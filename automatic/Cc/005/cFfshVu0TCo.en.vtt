00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.540 
one of apples most underrated products
but<00:02:11.280> hopefully<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:11.910> will<00:02:12.060> change

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
but hopefully this will change

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.950 
but hopefully this will change
thing<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.790> hopefully<00:02:12.940> people<00:02:13.180> which<00:02:13.690> really

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
thing and hopefully people which really

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.460 
thing and hopefully people which really
real<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.410> realize<00:02:14.890> how<00:02:14.920> awesome<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.580> appletv

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
real I realize how awesome the appletv

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.240 
real I realize how awesome the appletv
really<00:02:17.470> is<00:02:17.680> very<00:02:19.470> small<00:02:20.470> footprint<00:02:20.890> this<00:02:21.100> is

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
really is very small footprint this is

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.740 
really is very small footprint this is
insane<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:22.030> guess<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.930> just<00:02:22.960> comes<00:02:23.200> out<00:02:23.470> yeah

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:37.650 

come<00:02:28.750> on<00:02:29.670> therefore<00:02:30.670> there<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.210> is<00:02:36.510> look<00:02:37.510> at

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
come on therefore there it is look at

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.850 
come on therefore there it is look at
this<00:02:39.990> all<00:02:40.990> right<00:02:41.110> let's<00:02:41.290> let's<00:02:41.560> say<00:02:41.680> that's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
this all right let's let's say that's

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.850 
this all right let's let's say that's
best<00:02:42.340> for<00:02:42.400> last<00:02:42.930> finally<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:43.960> have<00:02:44.260> access<00:02:44.530> to
