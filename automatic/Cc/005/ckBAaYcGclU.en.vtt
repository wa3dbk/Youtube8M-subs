00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 a family of contention developed a 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.839
 series of maize-based products 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.360

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.700
 cultivated right there on the property 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.429
 the reporter, marcio barros, went to meet the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.190
 site of his clÃ¡udio and the dona cleusa and 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.560
 learned a delicious recipe from curau 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:29.189
 that you will now follow on the board 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:31.590
 pink kitchen say stay tang them 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.380
 they fill their hands raw material for a 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.899
 series of products made from corn 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.629
 the family keeps the plantation in about 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.930
 6 alqueires and the harvest happens 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.910
 December to May 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.730
 the cloud the family work with me there 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.129
 more than 20 years but it was in 2007 that they 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.780
 resolved to increase business and 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.690
 start selling in addition to corn in 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.449
 natura some products that themselves 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.609
 the business went well and there are three 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.920
 years they created the farm's director 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.439
 a company specializing in products 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.740
 derived from sweet corn and 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.390
 salty curau croquettes and even those 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.049
 dumplings that are delivered to the snack 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.840
 school 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.030
 the maize is sold in the trays corn and 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.400
 all the products made here in this 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.049
 property in disputes are distributed 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.909
 in curitiba and region markets 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.250
 metropolitan and now we're going to learn 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.740
 the recipe of the choir who will teach us 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.979
 cleuza is all right all right come on 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.979
 So 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.790
 write down the necessary ingredients 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.750
 for a healing recipe 4 ears of 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.040
 corn two cups milk and a cup 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.170
 of sugar 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.509
 after cutting the corn it should be 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.430
 the first blender in the blender. 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.310
 step which is the first step is to choose 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.830
 the ribbons that are perfect nefp 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.720
 explains uniforms agent peels his 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.070
 half washed and then people cut 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.979
 they are not 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.409
 removing from the spike the whole grain of 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.170
 simple way we can still 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.539
 do at home with a knife after 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.940
 cut the corn what is the next step 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.119
 We'll put it in the blender. 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.549
 We put all the corn that was 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.549
 important that it be well beaten in 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:18.069
 blender in which we place 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.989
 also a little milk in this 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:25.480
 it was not much of a blender 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:27.790
 Let's hit the perfect consistency is 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.940
 so we realize that the whole grain 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.880
 was well ground and so b extracted the link 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.650
 of the event, we will not stick this little 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:42.570
 with the help of a spoon 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.570
 We're moving until it looks lonely. 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.690
 now this liquid will produce 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.690
 So we put the pan 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.310
 Now we'll post the second ones. 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.310
 Cup of milk 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:10.230
 We also add sugar and we will 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.580
 to start the cooking 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.980
 always stirring 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.980
 because when he starts to pick up 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.740
 consistency have the ability to 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.180
 rural areas can not be 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:28.770
 The secret is to mess with her, she has to stay. 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:32.930
 stirring it and around 4 to 5 minutes it 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.490
 already begins to give consistency right and stay 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.560
 each time he will sign more then he has to 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.630
 always be on time always stirring here 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.150
 not though and always on low heat and 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.430
 israel almost a vital point looks just like 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.040
 gets the vehicle consistent looks 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.200
 half an hour later he's done ready 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.140
 ready and now we'll put in a 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.630
 to be carried 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.150
 refrigerator not necessarily ne 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.209
 the person that what you prefer can 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.480
 put cold senhores in the refrigerator there 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:10.350
 a normal climate even some people 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:13.700
 adds another seal is a matter of taste 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.400
 the coral he accepts you can add 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.010
 cinnamon can be put coconut can of 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.770
 suddenly a sour cream and milk 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.570
 condensate is what the person prefers the 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.570
 our best is to eat natural like this 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.810
 and is accompanied by coconut and cinnamon and no 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.020
 you have to resist this final look there 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.120
 I also like the natural and the 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.520
 details of Sunday coral preparation and 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.780
