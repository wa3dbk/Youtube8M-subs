00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
on Roger just for your essay we are

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.540 
on Roger just for your essay we are
locating<00:01:49.360> compound<00:01:49.870> seven<00:01:50.440> right<00:01:51.280> who<00:01:51.520> just

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
locating compound seven right who just

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.910 
locating compound seven right who just
made<00:01:51.940> an<00:01:52.060> effort<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.600> learn<00:01:53.290> as<00:01:53.530> much<00:01:53.650> as<00:01:53.830> I
