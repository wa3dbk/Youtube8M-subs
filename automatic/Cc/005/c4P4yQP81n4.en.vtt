not<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:02.070> world's<00:01:02.340> most<00:01:02.460> score<00:01:02.820> because<00:01:03.090> he

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
not the world's most score because he

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.469 
not the world's most score because he
only<00:01:03.780> picks<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.920> think<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.489> 32<00:01:06.000> 33

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
only picks up a I think it's a 32 33

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.230 
only picks up a I think it's a 32 33
gunstreak<00:01:07.220> that's<00:01:08.220> not<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> focal<00:01:08.970> point<00:01:09.000> of

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
gunstreak that's not the focal point of

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.320 
gunstreak that's not the focal point of
the<00:01:09.330> video<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.830> very<00:01:11.159> fast<00:01:11.580> nuclear<00:01:12.119> it's

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the video it is a very fast nuclear it's

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.359 
the video it is a very fast nuclear it's
about<00:01:12.540> two<00:01:12.780> minutes<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.260> three<00:01:13.500> seconds<00:01:13.950> even

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
about two minutes and three seconds even

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.460 
about two minutes and three seconds even
and<00:01:15.299> sharpshooter<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.930> think<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.350> that's

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
and sharpshooter I think that that's

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.740 
and sharpshooter I think that that's
that's<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.159> mean<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:18.000> very<00:01:18.240> little<00:01:18.509> downtime

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
that's I mean it's very little downtime

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.440 
that's I mean it's very little downtime
um<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:20.310> whole<00:01:20.460> video<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.820> about<00:01:20.970> five<00:01:21.270> minutes

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
um the whole video is about five minutes

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.320 
um the whole video is about five minutes
and<00:01:21.630> 35<00:01:22.020> seconds<00:01:22.950> kept<00:01:23.520> one<00:01:24.060> hundred<00:01:24.299> percent

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and 35 seconds kept one hundred percent

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.140 
and 35 seconds kept one hundred percent
real<00:01:24.840> time<00:01:25.310> nothing<00:01:26.310> funny<00:01:26.520> about<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.820> it's

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
