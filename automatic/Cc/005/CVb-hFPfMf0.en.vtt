00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 Hello to you Denis healthier mountain 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.220
 info section you and we are learning today 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.969
 pull up and walk flatline without a winch 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.630
 I call it online real slackline 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.020
 target footing and the long-range on which we 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.820
 fix the end protection really 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.859
 here is not very necessary because 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.099
 beetroot tension at minimum 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.689
 damage tree bark well 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.000
 impossible but we still hang 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.740
 note that the mounts 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.450
 Slackline I will spend enough 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.260
 high at shoulder level 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.700
 why because stretch is very weak 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.670
 sagging in the middle 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.250
 and that's why I need to hang high 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.820
 use a carbine so as not to thread all 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.059
 the length 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.600
 through the loop a little sleek secret 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.199
 if a 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.989
 string folded in half at the fixing 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.800
 then at the exit of the carbine or loop 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.829
 she will horizontally go to the target 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.290
 coast along the way we unwind from the path 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.470
 you now what we do we just 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.659
 we stretch it with our hands without any 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.610
 adaptations 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.040
 throwing behind a tree despite the fact that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.580
 here we have winches to use 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.439
 let's not just stretch our arms with all 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.439
 the forces that we have 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.140
 make such an apparatus 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.140
 and make it still sharp 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.370
 we are now crying 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.160
 the length of the stretch 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:16.070
 and on the knot we left a whole 30-meter 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.460
 send so know if you want 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.310
 hang up 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.450
 such a weakly stretched string 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:29.490
 20 meters like mine I need another 5-10 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.960
 meters on knots all tied a flag knot 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:37.290
 barking ready as you can see he is tall he 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.840
 quite dangerous but none the less x 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.000
 moron to walk 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.710
 such sleek line and of course you need 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.170
 first practice you gradually 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.410
 increase your difficulty at the beginning 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.500
 walk 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.680
 tight and short sweats all the more 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.190
 soft and all long and let's try 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.670
 like as such term wine to climb 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:06.030
 there are two options either you climb in 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.110
 center of what to balance 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.870
 more difficult 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.959
 she but her clan bends to the knee 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:19.920
 and in a smooth motion you can climb 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:23.100
 and resist the kind you climb again 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:29.370
 climb this maybe even were 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:33.590
 You can find fault with the tree so that 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.590
 at least the heads in the tree do not enter 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.270
 live 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.129
 In general, as for me this 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:53.459
 20 meter slalom stretched hands 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:55.560
 equivalent in complexity to 40 meters 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.220
 Ordinary us can and more 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.440
 very similar vibrations are very similar here 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.870
 but in my opinion he may even be 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.720
 safer though a couple of times of course i 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.430
 went muzzle on the ground 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:14.099
 can pay attention that my legs 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:17.489
 always slightly bent arms high we 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:21.840
 at least left arm at shoulder level and 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:28.229
 a higher look is almost always on 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:31.979
 distant support and breathing is very deep and 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:37.860
 even like logical breathing 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:47.580
 time and I actually about the shower 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:50.580
 observe each step while walking 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.949
 safety first choose lol 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.020
 level ground you try to 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.680
 it was without stones like mine here 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.539
 now 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.430
 so it was weed sand well or 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:05.010
 some kind of soft surface 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.810
 why because all the same with such a layer 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.960
 Qui on the probability of falling enough 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.590
 high while he dangles and 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.960
 Jumping off of it is not so easy. 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.479
 than rigidly stretched legs as if you 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.010
 stick to string and so can 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:24.900
 face up get ready 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.659
 grouped it do not relax 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:31.909
 until the very end until you 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.909
 don't come down with beets on the lands 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.160
 h 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.949
 let's go to
