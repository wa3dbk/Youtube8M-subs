00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
knit one so this is what's actually

going<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.330> create<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.630> yarn<00:01:27.840> over<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.590> by

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
going to create the yarn over here is by

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.280 
going to create the yarn over here is by
bringing<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.150> yarn<00:01:30.299> over<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.750> needle<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
bringing the yarn over the needle to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.130 
bringing the yarn over the needle to
knit<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:32.030> we've<00:01:33.030> created<00:01:33.360> our<00:01:33.659> yarn<00:01:33.900> over

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
knit one we've created our yarn over

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.890 
knit one we've created our yarn over
which<00:01:34.320> will<00:01:34.500> make<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> hole<00:01:35.689> then<00:01:36.689> we're<00:01:36.780> going

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
which will make a hole then we're going

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.870 
which will make a hole then we're going
to<00:01:36.990> pass<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.560> slip<00:01:37.829> stitch<00:01:38.040> over<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.729> that's

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
to pass the slip stitch over so that's

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.270 
to pass the slip stitch over so that's
this<00:01:39.119> stitch<00:01:39.360> right<00:01:39.509> here<00:01:39.890> we'll<00:01:40.890> pass<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
this stitch right here we'll pass it

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.469 
this stitch right here we'll pass it
over<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.640> reason<00:01:41.759> why<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.090> slip<00:01:42.360> that

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
over and the reason why we slip that

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.899 
over and the reason why we slip that
knitwise<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.680> because<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.310> twists<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
knitwise is because that twists the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.520 
knitwise is because that twists the
stitch<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> right<00:01:45.540> direction<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.409> we

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
stitch in the right direction so when we

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.120 
stitch in the right direction so when we
pass<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.040> over<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:48.090> going<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.540> face<00:01:49.439> forward

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
pass it over it's going to face forward

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.980 
pass it over it's going to face forward
alright<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.360> be<00:01:51.479> twisted

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
alright so it's not going to be twisted

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.959 
alright so it's not going to be twisted
stitch<00:01:53.299> alright<00:01:54.299> now<00:01:54.600> we<00:01:55.140> are<00:01:55.350> going<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.969> knit

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969
