00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.500 
this and think I want to look more into
flipping<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.520> different<00:00:32.820> types<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.120> things<00:00:33.360> I

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
flipping the different types of things I

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.959 
flipping the different types of things I
can<00:00:33.660> flip<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.380> highly<00:00:35.010> suggest<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
can flip and I highly suggest going and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.190 
can flip and I highly suggest going and
checking<00:00:36.000> out<00:00:36.390> his<00:00:36.570> channel<00:00:36.809> cuz<00:00:37.050> he's<00:00:37.140> got

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.930 
some great videos on there so this
entry-level<00:00:40.020> flipping<00:00:40.710> technique<00:00:41.160> basically

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
a card economics which sometimes I

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.140 
a card economics which sometimes I
forget<00:01:03.120> about<00:01:04.309> liquidity<00:01:05.309> simply<00:01:05.880> means<00:01:06.060> that

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
forget about liquidity simply means that

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.420 
forget about liquidity simply means that
the<00:01:06.360> market<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> very<00:01:07.320> thriving<00:01:07.979> there's<00:01:08.310> lots

the market is very thriving there's lots
being<00:01:08.670> bought<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:08.909> sold<00:01:09.240> at<00:01:09.479> anytime<00:01:09.930> and

being bought and sold at anytime and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.500 
being bought and sold at anytime and
anything<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.130> buy<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.670> then<00:01:11.790> try<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.090> resell

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
anything you buy and then try to resell

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.359 
anything you buy and then try to resell
will<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.960> sold<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.409> within<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.740> few<00:01:13.920> hours<00:01:13.979> so

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
will be sold in within a few hours so

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.120 
will be sold in within a few hours so
it's<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.549> highly<00:01:14.880> liquid<00:01:15.060> market<00:01:15.659> now<00:01:16.380> I'm<00:01:16.950> just

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it's a highly liquid market now I'm just

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.920 
it's a highly liquid market now I'm just
guessing<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.060> market<00:01:18.479> must<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.780> so

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
guessing that this market must be so

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.289 
guessing that this market must be so
liquid<00:01:19.290> because<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> lot<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.740> people<00:01:20.009> want<00:01:21.000> gold

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
liquid because a lot of people want gold

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.719 
liquid because a lot of people want gold
find<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.990> magic<00:01:22.290> find<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.830> their<00:01:23.009> followers

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
find and magic find for their followers

find and magic find for their followers
as<00:01:24.119> well<00:01:24.330> as<00:01:24.450> for<00:01:24.600> themselves<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.170> maybe<00:01:25.830> just

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
as well as for themselves and maybe just

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.980 
as well as for themselves and maybe just
because<00:01:26.400> there's<00:01:26.610> hundreds<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.450> thousands<00:01:27.930> of

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
because there's hundreds of thousands of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.510

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
sometimes you have to be quick so let's

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.670 
sometimes you have to be quick so let's
look<00:03:06.489> at<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:07.299> two<00:03:07.480> techniques<00:03:07.780> for<00:03:08.230> acquiring

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
look at the two techniques for acquiring

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.650 
look at the two techniques for acquiring
these<00:03:09.010> things<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.579> be<00:03:09.670> able<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.910> sell<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.329> then

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
these things to be able to sell and then

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.479 
these things to be able to sell and then
I'll<00:03:10.750> look<00:03:10.870> at<00:03:11.049> how<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.590> actually<00:03:12.010> sell<00:03:12.340> them

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
I'll look at how to actually sell them

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.059 
I'll look at how to actually sell them
so<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.480> first<00:03:13.660> technique<00:03:13.959> is<00:03:14.290> looking<00:03:14.950> at

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
so the first technique is looking at

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.490 
so the first technique is looking at
items<00:03:15.430> that<00:03:15.640> have<00:03:15.730> just<00:03:15.970> been<00:03:16.090> posted<00:03:16.720> a<00:03:17.079> lot

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
items that have just been posted a lot

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.410 
items that have just been posted a lot
of<00:03:17.590> times<00:03:17.859> people<00:03:18.220> don't<00:03:18.609> know<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.209> true

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
of times people don't know the true

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
here let's pretend this one posted for

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.529 
here let's pretend this one posted for
7,500<00:04:14.799> and<00:04:14.889> we<00:04:14.980> see<00:04:15.190> a<00:04:15.880> bit<00:04:16.180> of<00:04:16.299> strength

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
7,500 and we see a bit of strength

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.750 
7,500 and we see a bit of strength
vitality<00:04:16.840> attack<00:04:17.560> speed<00:04:17.829> is<00:04:18.160> actually<00:04:18.519> try

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
vitality attack speed is actually try

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.000 
vitality attack speed is actually try
factoring<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:19.570> let's<00:04:20.289> say<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.560> was<00:04:20.680> just<00:04:20.919> a

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
factoring so let's say it was just a

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.380 
factoring so let's say it was just a
another<00:04:21.190> traffic<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.880> ring<00:04:22.030> but<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.210> had

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
another traffic the ring but it had

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.950 
another traffic the ring but it had
crude<00:04:22.659> damage<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.050> crit<00:04:23.169> chance

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
crude damage and crit chance

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.600 
crude damage and crit chance
and<00:04:24.080> as<00:04:24.500> soon<00:04:24.680> as<00:04:24.830> you<00:04:24.949> see<00:04:25.130> those<00:04:25.310> three

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
and as soon as you see those three

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.219 
and as soon as you see those three
things<00:04:25.789> listed<00:04:26.150> there<00:04:26.360> even<00:04:26.630> if<00:04:26.720> you<00:04:26.810> don't

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
have enough time to look at the actual

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.490 
have enough time to look at the actual
stats<00:04:28.819> just<00:04:29.240> hit<00:04:29.389> that<00:04:29.539> by<00:04:29.750> up<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.139> get<00:04:30.470> that

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
put on a thousand one here that could be

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.200 
put on a thousand one here that could be
worth<00:04:35.720> something<00:04:36.080> ah<00:04:36.669> oh<00:04:37.669> I<00:04:37.729> don't<00:04:38.060> think

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
worth something ah oh I don't think

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.850 
worth something ah oh I don't think
that's<00:04:38.449> worth<00:04:38.630> too<00:04:38.870> much<00:04:38.900> over<00:04:39.229> 80,000<00:04:39.770> I'm

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
that's worth too much over 80,000 I'm

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.830 
that's worth too much over 80,000 I'm
not<00:04:40.009> willing<00:04:40.130> to<00:04:40.310> to<00:04:40.910> buy<00:04:41.030> that<00:04:41.240> one<00:04:41.389> for<00:04:41.780> now

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
that'll flip for at least 60 k so that's

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.839 
that'll flip for at least 60 k so that's

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:54.370 
like a just a fast one there to do so
there<00:04:52.970> you<00:04:53.030> go<00:04:53.090> so<00:04:53.449> they<00:04:53.599> don't<00:04:53.990> appear<00:04:54.199> pretty

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
there you go so they don't appear pretty

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.200 
there you go so they don't appear pretty
often<00:04:54.620> now<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.400> other<00:04:55.520> technique<00:04:55.880> is<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.090> one

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
often now the other technique is the one

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.430 
often now the other technique is the one
I<00:04:56.240> prefer<00:04:56.509> because<00:04:56.750> it's<00:04:56.870> been<00:04:56.960> more<00:04:57.080> passive

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
I prefer because it's been more passive

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.719 
I prefer because it's been more passive
it<00:04:57.560> doesn't<00:04:57.800> require<00:04:58.009> you<00:04:58.400> sitting<00:04:58.699> there

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
it doesn't require you sitting there

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.219 
it doesn't require you sitting there
watching<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.270> auction<00:04:59.570> houses<00:04:59.840> so<00:04:59.960> closely

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
watching the auction houses so closely

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.980 
watching the auction houses so closely
is<00:05:01.039> to<00:05:01.370> UM<00:05:01.550> sort<00:05:01.910> by<00:05:01.970> time<00:05:02.090> left<00:05:02.539> the<00:05:02.660> opposite

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
is to UM sort by time left the opposite

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.689 
is to UM sort by time left the opposite
direction<00:05:03.080> and<00:05:03.620> look<00:05:03.949> for<00:05:04.130> good<00:05:04.250> ones<00:05:04.430> to<00:05:04.580> bid

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
direction and look for good ones to bid

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.120 
direction and look for good ones to bid
on<00:05:04.729> so<00:05:05.030> this<00:05:05.270> one's<00:05:05.449> ending<00:05:05.690> soon<00:05:05.930> and<00:05:06.259> I've

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
on so this one's ending soon and I've

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.529 
on so this one's ending soon and I've
may<00:05:07.430> have<00:05:07.550> already<00:05:07.789> been<00:05:07.940> on<00:05:08.030> this<00:05:08.150> one<00:05:08.330> but

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
may have already been on this one but

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:10.240 
may have already been on this one but
i'll<00:05:08.690> just<00:05:08.900> start<00:05:09.110> do<00:05:09.289> it<00:05:09.380> anyway<00:05:09.620> this<00:05:10.039> one's

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
i'll just start do it anyway this one's

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.969 
i'll just start do it anyway this one's
got<00:05:10.400> main<00:05:10.759> stats<00:05:11.030> and<00:05:11.360> crit<00:05:11.960> chance<00:05:11.990> so<00:05:12.710> I'll

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
got main stats and crit chance so I'll

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.129 
got main stats and crit chance so I'll
just<00:05:13.039> place<00:05:13.430> a<00:05:13.460> bit<00:05:13.699> on<00:05:13.789> that<00:05:13.820> then<00:05:14.139> someone's

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
just place a bit on that then someone's

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:16.689 
just place a bit on that then someone's
already<00:05:15.259> been<00:05:15.349> on<00:05:15.530> its<00:05:15.650> I've<00:05:15.800> been<00:05:16.099> outbid<00:05:16.430> but

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
already been on its I've been outbid but

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.339 
already been on its I've been outbid but
a<00:05:16.880> lot<00:05:17.270> of<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.479> time<00:05:17.690> you<00:05:17.870> won't<00:05:17.990> be<00:05:18.139> outbid

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
a lot of the time you won't be outbid

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.409 
a lot of the time you won't be outbid
you'll<00:05:18.650> see<00:05:18.800> ones<00:05:18.979> like<00:05:19.190> this<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:19.699> you<00:05:20.300> can

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419

you'll see ones like this and you can
just<00:05:20.509> put<00:05:20.750> a<00:05:20.990> small<00:05:21.680> black<00:05:22.550> rice<00:05:22.880> just<00:05:23.030> put

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
your max by price you're not trying to

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.469 
your max by price you're not trying to
snap<00:05:24.860> you're<00:05:25.099> basically<00:05:25.430> just<00:05:25.610> trying<00:05:25.789> to<00:05:25.940> get

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
things that are slip through the cracks

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.680 
things that are slip through the cracks

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
maybe you can do this before heading to

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.700 
maybe you can do this before heading to
bed<00:05:38.750> one<00:05:38.960> night<00:05:38.990> after<00:05:39.289> you've<00:05:39.530> finished

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
bed one night after you've finished

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.649 
bed one night after you've finished
farming<00:05:40.250> or<00:05:40.400> before<00:05:40.789> doing<00:05:41.000> a<00:05:41.150> starting<00:05:41.599> a

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
farming or before doing a starting a

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:42.999 
farming or before doing a starting a
farming<00:05:42.020> session<00:05:42.380> because<00:05:42.469> that<00:05:42.650> can<00:05:42.770> be<00:05:42.860> fun

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 
farming session because that can be fun

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.909 
farming session because that can be fun
too<00:05:43.219> basically<00:05:44.030> you<00:05:44.210> want<00:05:44.330> to<00:05:44.449> have<00:05:44.570> this

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
too basically you want to have this

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.770 
too basically you want to have this
going<00:05:45.919> while<00:05:46.430> you're<00:05:46.729> doing<00:05:46.880> other<00:05:47.180> things<00:05:47.300> so

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
going while you're doing other things so

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.080 
going while you're doing other things so
it's<00:05:48.259> making<00:05:48.590> you<00:05:48.710> sort<00:05:49.039> of<00:05:49.099> a<00:05:49.219> bit<00:05:49.370> of<00:05:49.490> semi

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
it's making you sort of a bit of semi

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.600 
it's making you sort of a bit of semi
passive<00:05:50.630> income<00:05:50.840> on<00:05:51.229> the<00:05:51.259> side<00:05:51.349> there<00:05:51.770> so<00:05:52.310> you

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
passive income on the side there so you

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:53.980 
passive income on the side there so you
can<00:05:52.759> see<00:05:52.880> I've<00:05:53.000> sort<00:05:53.210> of<00:05:53.270> just<00:05:53.449> one<00:05:53.599> something

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
can see I've sort of just one something

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.689 
can see I've sort of just one something
there<00:05:54.199> I<00:05:54.409> want<00:05:54.919> to<00:05:54.979> ring<00:05:55.159> that's<00:05:55.610> actually

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
there I want to ring that's actually

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:57.430 
there I want to ring that's actually
pretty<00:05:55.969> good<00:05:56.150> because<00:05:56.330> now<00:05:56.360> I<00:05:56.509> cannot<00:05:56.810> take<00:05:57.409> a

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
pretty good because now I cannot take a

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.100 
pretty good because now I cannot take a
look<00:05:57.650> at<00:05:57.740> how<00:05:57.889> to<00:05:57.949> price<00:05:58.250> these<00:05:58.460> things

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
look at how to price these things

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.270 
look at how to price these things
pricing<00:06:00.110> is<00:06:00.139> pretty<00:06:00.349> simple<00:06:00.560> if<00:06:00.770> you<00:06:00.800> priced

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
pricing is pretty simple if you priced

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.129 
pricing is pretty simple if you priced
anything<00:06:01.729> else<00:06:01.909> on<00:06:02.180> the<00:06:02.750> auction<00:06:02.840> house

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
anything else on the auction house

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:04.120 
anything else on the auction house
before<00:06:03.500> then<00:06:03.650> you<00:06:03.770> shouldn't<00:06:04.009> have<00:06:04.039> any

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
before then you shouldn't have any

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.459 
before then you shouldn't have any
problems<00:06:04.550> with<00:06:04.669> it<00:06:04.699> so<00:06:05.419> let's<00:06:05.960> let's<00:06:06.229> start

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:06.469 
problems with it so let's let's start

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:09.310 
problems with it so let's let's start
off<00:06:06.530> with<00:06:06.680> this<00:06:06.770> one<00:06:06.949> here<00:06:07.219> we've<00:06:07.639> got<00:06:08.320> high

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
off with this one here we've got high

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.659 
off with this one here we've got high
end<00:06:09.650> so<00:06:09.979> I'm<00:06:10.039> going<00:06:10.070> to<00:06:10.219> get<00:06:10.430> rid<00:06:10.520> of<00:06:10.580> the

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
end so I'm going to get rid of the

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.659 
end so I'm going to get rid of the
dexterity<00:06:11.380> I'll<00:06:12.380> use<00:06:12.560> the<00:06:12.710> leave<00:06:13.039> vitality<00:06:13.550> in

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
dexterity I'll use the leave vitality in

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:15.909 
dexterity I'll use the leave vitality in
there<00:06:13.820> and<00:06:14.000> I<00:06:14.389> just<00:06:14.419> scale<00:06:15.199> things<00:06:15.500> back<00:06:15.590> by

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
there and I just scale things back by

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.490 
there and I just scale things back by
quite<00:06:16.190> a<00:06:16.219> bit<00:06:16.719> I'll<00:06:17.719> completely<00:06:18.259> remove

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
quite a bit I'll completely remove

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.930 
quite a bit I'll completely remove
average<00:06:18.800> damage<00:06:19.070> because<00:06:19.370> people<00:06:19.849> don't
