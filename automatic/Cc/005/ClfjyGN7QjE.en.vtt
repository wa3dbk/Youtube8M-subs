00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.119
 the republic 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:38.570
 then guys today let's do a little 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:40.850
 questions today on the board no 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.190
 just called me yesterday but 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:48.769
 always to me but wand is that others 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.720
 few stories an easy question if you 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:58.489
 I say to make the sheep what I am 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:01:01.790
 you answer in front of guys there's someone 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:08.450
 who knows I could do it if 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:13.490
 mister at least what the same process is 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.539
 I know how to make the sheep a gentle verse 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:24.400
 writes the poet 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:26.210
 well well it's down but sure of weapons 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.520
 all 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.090
 it was at least you who knows how many times it will have 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.900
 the fact of the stone 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.900
 no I don't think so 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.330
 one would say to put oneself to sheep 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.510
 practically when a runner is at 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.700
 everything even more when the act is not 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.420
 sees nothing but the runner's wheel 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.420
 that stands before him
