is-3 and most people they would usually

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.570 
is-3 and most people they would usually
just<00:00:26.090> pry<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:27.080> covering<00:00:27.590> I<00:00:27.800> wouldn't<00:00:28.460> do<00:00:28.550> that

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
just pry the covering I wouldn't do that

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
fact that this plastic piece right here

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.790 
fact that this plastic piece right here
it's<00:00:34.699> actually<00:00:35.180> connected<00:00:35.480> to<00:00:35.870> this<00:00:36.019> whole

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
it's actually connected to this whole

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.100

all<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.340> way<00:01:07.430> down<00:01:07.670> because<00:01:08.240> there's<00:01:08.690> a<00:01:08.899> notch

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
all the way down because there's a notch

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.480 
all the way down because there's a notch
here<00:01:10.069> you're<00:01:11.060> going<00:01:11.209> to<00:01:11.300> need<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.720> reach<00:01:12.490> like

here you're going to need to reach like

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.580 
here you're going to need to reach like
just<00:01:14.060> imagine<00:01:14.479> there's<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.720> line<00:01:14.990> right<00:01:15.259> here

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
just imagine there's a line right here

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.090 
just imagine there's a line right here
in<00:01:15.770> between<00:01:15.920> these<00:01:16.640> two<00:01:17.539> words

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
in between these two words

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.139 
in between these two words
push<00:01:19.100> in<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:19.729> then<00:01:20.179> pull<00:01:21.020> down<00:01:21.819> you<00:01:22.819> see<00:01:23.030> what

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
push in and then pull down you see what

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.809 
push in and then pull down you see what
that<00:01:23.270> notch<00:01:23.479> is<00:01:23.920> yes<00:01:24.920> there's<00:01:25.310> another<00:01:25.399> one

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
that notch is yes there's another one

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.010 
that notch is yes there's another one
over<00:01:25.940> here<00:01:26.319> on<00:01:27.369> this<00:01:28.369> one<00:01:28.640> I<00:01:28.849> looked<00:01:29.720> at<00:01:29.840> this

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
over here on this one I looked at this

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.199 
over here on this one I looked at this
second<00:01:30.890> square<00:01:31.190> you<00:01:31.340> see<00:01:31.369> how<00:01:31.610> these<00:01:31.789> there's

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:32.209 
second square you see how these there's

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:36.730 
second square you see how these there's
two<00:01:32.450> squares<00:01:34.030> line<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:35.209> up<00:01:35.330> just<00:01:35.569> right<00:01:36.380> at<00:01:36.619> the

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
two squares line it up just right at the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.520 
two squares line it up just right at the
edge<00:01:36.890> of<00:01:37.069> the<00:01:37.280> second<00:01:37.700> Square<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:38.410> do<00:01:39.410> the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
edge of the second Square and do the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.999 
edge of the second Square and do the
same<00:01:39.679> thing<00:01:39.979> push<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.670> pull<00:01:41.050> down<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.349> other

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
same thing push and pull down the other

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.300 
same thing push and pull down the other
side<00:01:43.929> well<00:01:44.929> you<00:01:45.259> don't<00:01:45.380> have<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.740> focus<00:01:45.920> so

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
side well you don't have to focus so

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.150 
side well you don't have to focus so
much<00:01:46.599> but<00:01:47.599> just<00:01:48.819> carefully<00:01:49.819> pry<00:01:50.300> it<00:01:50.360> loose

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
to turn because they have these little

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.969 
to turn because they have these little
notches<00:02:01.459> you<00:02:02.179> see<00:02:02.390> that<00:02:03.099> okay<00:02:04.099> so<00:02:05.950> there<00:02:06.950> you

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
notches you see that okay so there you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.460 
long life oh I guess we'll have to put
that<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.270> test<00:02:24.470> but<00:02:25.470> um<00:02:25.740> if<00:02:26.490> this<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.120> like

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
that to the test but um if this is like

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.830 
that to the test but um if this is like
your<00:02:28.470> cheapest<00:02:28.920> alternative<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:30.360> there<00:02:30.660> are

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
your cheapest alternative that there are

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.890 
your cheapest alternative that there are
LED<00:02:31.800> ones<00:02:32.070> but<00:02:32.910> those<00:02:33.060> are<00:02:33.240> quite<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.660> bit<00:02:33.750> more

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
LED ones but those are quite a bit more

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.290 
LED ones but those are quite a bit more
expensive<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.800> yes<00:02:35.370> they<00:02:35.700> do<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:36.000> lasts<00:02:36.180> a

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
expensive and yes they do it lasts a

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.240 
expensive and yes they do it lasts a
little<00:02:36.390> longer<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.410> if<00:02:37.710> you<00:02:37.800> want<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:37.980> go<00:02:38.100> that

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
little longer so if you want to go that

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.630 
little longer so if you want to go that
route<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:38.880> know<00:02:38.940> be<00:02:39.210> my<00:02:39.330> guest

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
route you know be my guest

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.980 
route you know be my guest
