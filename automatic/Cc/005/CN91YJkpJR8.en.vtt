can be very time-consuming to cut these

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.139 
can be very time-consuming to cut these
two<00:00:57.379> pieces<00:00:57.559> out<00:00:57.890> what<00:00:58.129> I<00:00:58.159> used<00:00:58.460> was<00:00:58.670> my<00:00:58.789> a<00:00:58.819> Q

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149

path die and that cuts out four of these

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.219 
path die and that cuts out four of these
at<00:01:04.489> one<00:01:04.670> time<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.120> it<00:01:05.210> saves<00:01:05.600> me<00:01:05.750> a<00:01:05.780> lot<00:01:05.840> of<00:01:05.990> time

into this side you can see it's a little

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.660 
into this side you can see it's a little
awkward<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:18.260> center<00:01:18.650> not<00:01:18.770> does<00:01:19.070> help<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.430> pin

it in place there and kind of work your
way<00:01:21.050> around<00:01:21.230> it<00:01:21.500> but<00:01:21.890> for<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.100> beginner<00:01:22.220> that

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
way around it but for a beginner that

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.490 
way around it but for a beginner that
can<00:01:22.880> be<00:01:23.000> both<00:01:23.270> time-consuming<00:01:23.900> and<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.290> little

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
can be both time-consuming and a little

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.800 
can be both time-consuming and a little
bit<00:01:24.620> difficult<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:25.130> figure<00:01:25.310> out<00:01:25.400> but<00:01:26.270> now<00:01:26.510> I

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
bit difficult to figure out but now I

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.990 
bit difficult to figure out but now I
recently<00:01:27.140> discovered<00:01:27.620> this<00:01:28.340> little<00:01:28.790> foot

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
recently discovered this little foot

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.820 
recently discovered this little foot
called<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.390> curve<00:01:29.660> master<00:01:30.110> presser<00:01:30.380> foot<00:01:30.680> and

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
called the curve master presser foot and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.230 
called the curve master presser foot and
it<00:01:31.130> makes<00:01:31.370> it<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:31.700> much<00:01:31.820> easier

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
it makes it so much easier

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.970 
it makes it so much easier
I<00:01:32.300> can<00:01:32.510> literally<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.050> all<00:01:33.290> these<00:01:33.740> curves

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
I can literally so all these curves

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.460 
I can literally so all these curves
together<00:01:34.220> without<00:01:34.820> using<00:01:35.180> a<00:01:35.300> single<00:01:35.330> pin<00:01:35.810> I'll

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
together without using a single pin I'll

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.640 
together without using a single pin I'll
show<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:36.920> here<00:01:37.810> what<00:01:38.810> you<00:01:38.930> can<00:01:39.140> do<00:01:39.290> with<00:01:39.560> the

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
show you here what you can do with the

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.890 
show you here what you can do with the
drunkards<00:01:40.040> path<00:01:40.190> block<00:01:40.550> this<00:01:41.270> is<00:01:41.450> four<00:01:41.810> of

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
drunkards path block this is four of

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.930 
drunkards path block this is four of
those<00:01:42.080> little<00:01:42.410> pi<00:01:42.590> sections<00:01:43.280> all<00:01:43.430> put

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
those little pi sections all put

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.210 
those little pi sections all put
together<00:01:44.120> with<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.260> zebra-print<00:01:45.650> facing

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
together with the the zebra-print facing

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.100 
together with the the zebra-print facing
in<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.400> center<00:01:46.760> and<00:01:46.910> then<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:47.480> can<00:01:47.720> see<00:01:47.900> what

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
in the center and then you can see what

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.110 
in the center and then you can see what
a<00:01:48.140> different<00:01:48.500> effect<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.920> get<00:01:49.100> when<00:01:49.880> you

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
a different effect you get when you

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.460 
a different effect you get when you
alternate<00:01:50.690> them<00:01:52.870> now<00:01:53.870> let<00:01:54.020> me<00:01:54.110> show<00:01:54.260> you<00:01:54.350> how

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
alternate them now let me show you how

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.650 
alternate them now let me show you how
it's<00:01:54.620> actually<00:01:54.770> sewn<00:01:55.160> together<00:01:55.510> first<00:01:56.510> thing

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
it's actually sewn together first thing

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.240 
it's actually sewn together first thing
we<00:01:56.750> have<00:01:56.900> to<00:01:56.930> do<00:01:57.140> is<00:01:57.260> actually<00:01:57.410> install<00:01:58.070> the

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
we have to do is actually install the

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.790 
we have to do is actually install the
curve<00:01:58.460> master<00:01:58.880> foot<00:01:59.120> itself<00:01:59.600> I<00:01:59.840> took<00:02:00.440> off<00:02:00.620> the

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
curve master foot itself I took off the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.370 
curve master foot itself I took off the
entire<00:02:01.160> foot<00:02:01.850> section<00:02:02.360> of<00:02:02.510> my<00:02:02.840> machine<00:02:03.170> you

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
entire foot section of my machine you

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.590 
entire foot section of my machine you
see<00:02:03.860> that<00:02:04.010> this<00:02:04.160> down<00:02:04.760> here<00:02:05.090> is<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.420> little

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
see that this down here is the little

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.859 
see that this down here is the little
foot<00:02:05.900> and<00:02:06.080> this<00:02:06.500> is<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.800> whole<00:02:06.980> ankle<00:02:07.310> portion

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
foot and this is the whole ankle portion

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.359 
foot and this is the whole ankle portion
because<00:02:08.869> my<00:02:09.170> machine<00:02:09.319> doesn't<00:02:09.950> allow<00:02:10.099> me<00:02:10.250> just

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
because my machine doesn't allow me just

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.880 
because my machine doesn't allow me just
to<00:02:10.489> slip<00:02:10.819> on<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.000> foot<00:02:11.269> itself<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:12.200> box<00:02:12.499> that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
to slip on the foot itself the box that

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:14.749 
when you order the term master foot it

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:15.789

parts confused now I'm going to turn
this<00:02:51.620> over<00:02:51.799> here<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:52.459> I<00:02:52.519> can<00:02:52.700> make<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:53.060> pretty

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
this over here so I can make the pretty

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.240 
this over here so I can make the pretty
sides<00:02:53.629> of<00:02:53.930> both<00:02:54.109> fabrics<00:02:54.410> touch<00:02:54.769> each<00:02:54.950> other

sides of both fabrics touch each other

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.759 
sides of both fabrics touch each other
and<00:02:55.540> I'm<00:02:56.540> going<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:56.780> match<00:02:56.930> up<00:02:57.140> this<00:02:57.319> topmost

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
and I'm going to match up this topmost

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.319 
and I'm going to match up this topmost
portion<00:02:58.040> here<00:02:58.459> this<00:02:58.910> is<00:02:59.030> where<00:02:59.150> we're<00:02:59.239> going

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
portion here this is where we're going

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.479 
portion here this is where we're going
to<00:02:59.390> sew<00:02:59.629> down<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.109> curve<00:03:00.410> but<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:00.950> still<00:03:01.280> like

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
to sew down this curve but I still like

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.369 
to sew down this curve but I still like
to<00:03:01.670> make<00:03:01.849> sure<00:03:01.879> that<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.239> align<00:03:02.659> that<00:03:02.840> top<00:03:03.140> raw

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
to make sure that I align that top raw

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.990 
to make sure that I align that top raw
edge<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:03.829> it<00:03:03.950> keeps<00:03:04.129> everything<00:03:04.400> nice<00:03:04.760> and

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
edge so it keeps everything nice and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.509 
edge so it keeps everything nice and
straight<00:03:05.950> now<00:03:06.950> I'm<00:03:07.040> going<00:03:07.159> to<00:03:07.220> place<00:03:07.489> that

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
straight now I'm going to place that

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.660 
straight now I'm going to place that
topmost<00:03:08.390> corner<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:09.049> my<00:03:09.980> little<00:03:10.280> patchwork

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
topmost corner of my little patchwork

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.420 
topmost corner of my little patchwork
here<00:03:11.269> under<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:12.170> presser<00:03:12.560> foot<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.950> if<00:03:13.340> you

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
here under the presser foot and if you

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.280 
here under the presser foot and if you
can<00:03:13.609> see<00:03:13.879> there<00:03:14.120> where<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.629> tip<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:15.109> the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
can see there where the tip of the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.949 
can see there where the tip of the
fabric<00:03:16.129> is<00:03:16.280> touching<00:03:16.760> that's<00:03:17.269> a<00:03:17.480> little<00:03:17.720> side

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
fabric is touching that's a little side

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.599 
fabric is touching that's a little side
edge<00:03:18.170> that<00:03:18.409> measures<00:03:18.769> from<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.010> where<00:03:19.489> the

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
edge that measures from the where the

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.849 
edge that measures from the where the
needle<00:03:19.879> comes<00:03:20.090> down<00:03:20.359> to<00:03:20.989> that<00:03:21.200> is<00:03:21.440> your

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
needle comes down to that is your

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.009 
needle comes down to that is your
quarter<00:03:22.280> inch<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.180> you<00:03:23.239> want<00:03:23.569> to<00:03:23.660> try<00:03:23.870> and
