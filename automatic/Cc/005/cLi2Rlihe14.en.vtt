00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
be best to have a game mode that was

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.260 
be best to have a game mode that was
specifically<00:01:29.280> taking<00:01:29.670> advantage<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.149> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
specifically taking advantage of the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.460 
specifically taking advantage of the
fact<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:30.899> so<00:01:31.140> many<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.350> these

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
fact that you have so many of these

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.160 
fact that you have so many of these
soldiers<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:32.970> squads<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.720> pick<00:01:33.899> up<00:01:34.020> to

potentially prestige in squads it would

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.360 
potentially prestige in squads it would
just<00:02:36.450> take<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.720> while<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.799> way<00:02:37.890> we<00:02:38.010> wanted<00:02:38.220> to

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
just take a while the way we wanted to

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.039 
just take a while the way we wanted to
balance<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.850> out<00:02:38.940> is<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.510> earn<00:02:39.690> more<00:02:39.989> and

balance it out is you earn more and

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.210 
balance it out is you earn more and
multiplayer<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.950> not<00:02:41.910> as<00:02:42.060> much<00:02:42.269> in<00:02:42.660> squads<00:02:43.220> we

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
multiplayer and not as much in squads we

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.640 
multiplayer and not as much in squads we
also<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.579> this<00:02:44.850> new<00:02:45.060> concept<00:02:45.299> where<00:02:45.810> if<00:02:46.140> you

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
also have this new concept where if you

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.150 
also have this new concept where if you
set<00:02:47.040> up<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.459> squad<00:02:48.109> when<00:02:49.109> you're<00:02:49.260> not<00:02:49.739> playing

to protect the map people online can

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.740 
to protect the map people online can
challenge<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.850> while<00:02:54.060> you're<00:02:54.209> at<00:02:54.239> home<00:02:54.540> were

out based on the map that you want them
to<00:03:16.359> protect<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:17.650> know<00:03:17.769> you<00:03:17.829> can't<00:03:18.099> just<00:03:18.310> have

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
to protect you know you can't just have

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.819 
to protect you know you can't just have
all<00:03:19.329> guys<00:03:19.659> running<00:03:20.079> around<00:03:20.139> knifing<00:03:20.680> because

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
all guys running around knifing because

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.330 
all guys running around knifing because
that<00:03:20.950> probably<00:03:21.280> won't<00:03:21.519> work<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.389> takes<00:03:22.870> a

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
that probably won't work so it takes a

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.709 
that probably won't work so it takes a
strategy<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.549> think<00:03:25.090> that's<00:03:25.239> one<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.599> new

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:25.719 
strategy I think that's one of the new

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:26.910 
strategy I think that's one of the new
elements<00:03:26.170> that<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.349> think<00:03:26.560> people<00:03:26.680> are<00:03:26.829> going

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
elements that I think people are going

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.280 
elements that I think people are going
to<00:03:27.010> be<00:03:27.099> really<00:03:27.340> attracted<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:27.939> so<00:03:28.599> in<00:03:28.930> college

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
to be really attracted to so in college

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.990 
to be really attracted to so in college
any<00:03:29.439> ghosts<00:03:29.799> you<00:03:29.920> have<00:03:30.159> up<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.579> ten<00:03:30.790> different

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
any ghosts you have up to ten different

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.879 
any ghosts you have up to ten different

how that happened so the United States
and<00:04:09.819> our<00:04:09.879> game<00:04:10.120> created<00:04:10.949> Odin<00:04:11.949> which<00:04:12.159> is<00:04:12.430> a

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060

nuclear fallout and in our story America
feels<00:04:24.669> very<00:04:24.970> safe<00:04:25.389> because<00:04:25.870> of<00:04:26.229> it<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.590> I<00:04:27.099> feel

in this new world and you can see how

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.250 
in this new world and you can see how
much<00:04:50.620> it's<00:04:51.280> changed<00:04:51.430> them<00:04:52.060> but<00:04:52.870> on<00:04:52.990> top<00:04:53.200> of

which is this awesome squad that we

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.720 
which is this awesome squad that we
created<00:04:59.410> where<00:04:59.710> they<00:04:59.860> hide<00:05:00.040> their<00:05:00.280> identity

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
created where they hide their identity

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.000

the Federation and various small numbers

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.560 
the Federation and various small numbers
versus<00:05:07.840> you<00:05:08.620> know<00:05:08.650> a<00:05:08.920> large<00:05:09.280> military<00:05:10.030> force

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
versus you know a large military force

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.160 
versus you know a large military force
and<00:05:10.870> so<00:05:11.550> in<00:05:12.550> our<00:05:12.820> story<00:05:13.240> people<00:05:13.900> don't<00:05:14.050> really

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
and so in our story people don't really

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.650 
and so in our story people don't really
believe<00:05:14.710> that<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:15.220> ghosts<00:05:15.610> are<00:05:15.730> real<00:05:15.760> they're

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
believe that the ghosts are real they're

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.690 
believe that the ghosts are real they're
sort<00:05:16.960> of<00:05:17.050> more<00:05:17.350> like<00:05:17.380> a<00:05:17.560> legend<00:05:18.070> because<00:05:18.220> no

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
sort of more like a legend because no

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.850 
sort of more like a legend because no
one<00:05:18.820> knows<00:05:19.000> what<00:05:19.600> they<00:05:19.720> look<00:05:19.960> like<00:05:19.990> or<00:05:20.530> what

one knows what they look like or what
they've<00:05:21.070> necessarily<00:05:21.760> done<00:05:21.970> because<00:05:22.419> they<00:05:22.600> do

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
they've necessarily done because they do

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.860 
they've necessarily done because they do
it<00:05:22.870> in<00:05:23.770> this<00:05:23.980> stuff<00:05:24.190> like<00:05:24.430> manner<00:05:24.730> but<00:05:25.720> when

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
it in this stuff like manner but when

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.890
