how we will do the whole procedure so
first<00:00:43.060> we're<00:00:43.180> gonna<00:00:43.270> put<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.570> eye<00:00:43.600> drop<00:00:44.050> on

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260

so<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.280> next<00:00:53.490> step<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.030> will<00:00:54.690> put<00:00:55.260> another

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
so the next step I will put another
