you an alternative that I found that is
cheaper<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.329> is<00:02:26.480> that's<00:02:26.870> pretty<00:02:27.079> much<00:02:27.319> the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
cheaper that is that's pretty much the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.449 
cheaper that is that's pretty much the
exact<00:02:27.829> same<00:02:27.860> thing<00:02:29.530> deep<00:02:30.530> cleans<00:02:30.890> pores<00:02:31.189> and

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
move makeup pretty effectively if I had

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.479 
move makeup pretty effectively if I had

any<00:02:48.680> residue<00:02:48.739> behind<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:51.849> hydrates<00:02:52.849> as<00:02:53.000> it

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
any residue behind it hydrates as it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.420 
any residue behind it hydrates as it
melts<00:02:53.390> away<00:02:53.450> makeup<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.200> my<00:02:54.859> skin<00:02:55.129> really

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
melts away makeup and my skin really

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.699 
melts away makeup and my skin really
didn't<00:02:55.849> feel<00:02:55.940> hydrated<00:02:56.269> at<00:02:56.930> times<00:02:57.319> it<00:02:57.560> did

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
didn't feel hydrated at times it did

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:58.899 
didn't feel hydrated at times it did
feel<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:57.950> little<00:02:58.040> bit<00:02:58.370> tight

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
feel a little bit tight

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.300 
feel a little bit tight
after<00:02:59.239> I<00:02:59.269> get<00:02:59.389> got<00:02:59.900> done<00:03:00.079> washing<00:03:00.319> with<00:03:01.099> this

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
after I get got done washing with this

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.789 
after I get got done washing with this
like<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.909> had<00:03:02.120> stripped<00:03:02.420> too<00:03:02.959> much<00:03:03.139> oil<00:03:03.349> kind

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
like it had stripped too much oil kind

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.080 
like it had stripped too much oil kind
of<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.220> know<00:03:04.340> when<00:03:04.489> you<00:03:04.519> get<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:04.879> feeling

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
of you know when you get that feeling

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.800 
of you know when you get that feeling
from<00:03:05.389> so<00:03:06.400> contains<00:03:07.400> deep<00:03:07.760> cleansing<00:03:08.329> agents

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
from so contains deep cleansing agents

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.539 
from so contains deep cleansing agents
as<00:03:08.989> far<00:03:09.590> as<00:03:09.739> my<00:03:09.980> pores<00:03:10.700> looking<00:03:12.159> cleaner<00:03:13.159> or

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
as far as my pores looking cleaner or

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.039 
as far as my pores looking cleaner or
having<00:03:13.879> less<00:03:14.030> blackheads

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
having less blackheads

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.319 
having less blackheads
I<00:03:15.109> really<00:03:16.099> didn't<00:03:16.310> see<00:03:16.340> any<00:03:16.730> difference<00:03:17.150> I

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
I really didn't see any difference I

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.729 
I really didn't see any difference I
still<00:03:17.510> had<00:03:17.629> the<00:03:17.720> same<00:03:17.870> blackheads<00:03:18.319> I<00:03:18.470> always

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
still had the same blackheads I always

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.129 
still had the same blackheads I always
had<00:03:18.950> in<00:03:19.129> the<00:03:19.190> same<00:03:19.340> kind<00:03:19.579> of<00:03:19.609> places<00:03:19.849> I<00:03:20.209> did

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
had in the same kind of places I did

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.979 
had in the same kind of places I did
have<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.859> decrease<00:03:22.519> in<00:03:22.760> overall<00:03:23.329> breakouts

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
have a decrease in overall breakouts

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.890 
have a decrease in overall breakouts
while<00:03:24.500> using<00:03:24.799> this<00:03:25.190> and<00:03:25.489> like<00:03:26.060> whiteheads<00:03:26.690> and

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
while using this and like whiteheads and

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.610 
while using this and like whiteheads and
things<00:03:27.049> like<00:03:27.199> that

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
things like that

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.589 
things like that
so<00:03:27.919> I<00:03:27.949> think<00:03:28.099> it<00:03:28.370> was<00:03:28.489> effective<00:03:28.940> in<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.150> part

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
so I think it was effective in that part

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.270 
so I think it was effective in that part
but<00:03:29.810> as<00:03:29.900> far<00:03:30.079> as<00:03:30.109> blackheads<00:03:30.650> there<00:03:30.949> is<00:03:31.069> really

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
but as far as blackheads there is really

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.470 
but as far as blackheads there is really
no<00:03:31.400> difference<00:03:33.220> natural<00:03:34.220> oil<00:03:34.430> extracts<00:03:35.120> help

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
no difference natural oil extracts help

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.289 
no difference natural oil extracts help
condition<00:03:35.810> skin<00:03:36.319> as<00:03:37.129> I<00:03:37.340> said<00:03:37.549> I<00:03:37.579> really<00:03:38.030> didn't

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
condition skin as I said I really didn't

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.830 
condition skin as I said I really didn't
see<00:03:38.419> any<00:03:38.569> moisturizing<00:03:39.230> effects<00:03:39.530> from<00:03:39.829> it

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
see any moisturizing effects from it

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.069 
see any moisturizing effects from it
so<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:41.870> used<00:03:42.319> a<00:03:42.530> separate<00:03:43.010> moisturizer

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
so I used a separate moisturizer

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.509 
so I used a separate moisturizer

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
bar mixed with a little bit of pan so

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.740 
bar mixed with a little bit of pan so
it's<00:04:09.349> kind<00:04:09.650> of<00:04:09.739> like<00:04:09.919> a<00:04:09.949> lemony<00:04:10.549> smell<00:04:11.209> and

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
which really didn't bother me because I

which really didn't bother me because I
kind<00:04:14.540> of<00:04:14.569> like<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.930> smell<00:04:15.109> of<00:04:15.139> ponds

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.300 
kind of like the smell of ponds
but<00:04:16.480> it's<00:04:16.750> really<00:04:16.930> not<00:04:17.200> completely<00:04:17.799> fragrance

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310

but it's really not completely fragrance
free<00:04:18.639> and<00:04:19.980> well<00:04:20.980> they<00:04:21.160> didn't<00:04:21.430> add<00:04:21.700> any

off<00:06:14.800> really<00:06:15.010> easily<00:06:15.280> it<00:06:15.669> rinses<00:06:16.000> really<00:06:16.240> well

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389 
off really easily it rinses really well

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:17.460 
off really easily it rinses really well
so<00:06:16.660> that's<00:06:16.840> true

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
so that's true

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.500 
so that's true
gentle<00:06:18.070> enough<00:06:18.130> for<00:06:18.430> everyday<00:06:18.639> use<00:06:19.000> this<00:06:19.300> is

gentle enough for everyday use this is

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.300 
gentle enough for everyday use this is
what<00:06:19.720> I<00:06:19.900> use<00:06:20.229> everyday<00:06:20.500> and<00:06:21.030> non<00:06:22.030> comedogenic

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
what I use everyday and non comedogenic

use this every day and every night I

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.050 
use this every day and every night I
have<00:06:29.710> definitely<00:06:29.950> noticed<00:06:30.370> the<00:06:30.670> difference

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
have definitely noticed the difference

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.300 
have definitely noticed the difference
in<00:06:31.270> the<00:06:31.390> overall<00:06:31.540> tone<00:06:32.200> and<00:06:32.560> texture<00:06:32.920> of<00:06:33.040> my

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
in the overall tone and texture of my

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.140 
in the overall tone and texture of my
skin<00:06:33.840> and<00:06:34.840> the<00:06:35.830> amount<00:06:36.100> of<00:06:36.190> breakouts<00:06:36.670> that<00:06:37.120> I

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
skin and the amount of breakouts that I

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.860 
skin and the amount of breakouts that I
have<00:06:37.570> I<00:06:37.870> think<00:06:38.020> that<00:06:38.860> this<00:06:39.100> works<00:06:39.430> a<00:06:39.870> lot

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
have I think that this works a lot

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.250 
have I think that this works a lot
better<00:06:41.140> than<00:06:41.590> the<00:06:41.770> purity<00:06:42.160> and<00:06:43.560> my<00:06:44.560> skin<00:06:44.860> feels

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260 
better than the purity and my skin feels

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.600 
better than the purity and my skin feels
clean<00:06:47.260> but<00:06:47.920> not<00:06:48.450> overly<00:06:49.450> dried<00:06:49.840> my<00:06:50.830> skin<00:06:51.190> looks

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
clean but not overly dried my skin looks

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.670 
clean but not overly dried my skin looks
better<00:06:51.730> as<00:06:52.180> far<00:06:52.360> as<00:06:52.420> the<00:06:52.540> tone<00:06:52.900> places<00:06:53.530> were

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
better as far as the tone places were

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.730 
better as far as the tone places were
that<00:06:53.860> I<00:06:53.890> had<00:06:53.980> a<00:06:54.190> lot<00:06:54.340> of<00:06:54.400> red<00:06:54.760> or<00:06:55.710> places<00:06:56.710> that

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
that I had a lot of red or places that

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.620 
that I had a lot of red or places that
kind<00:06:57.040> of<00:06:57.100> looked<00:06:57.280> discolored<00:06:57.640> like<00:06:58.240> different

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:58.630 
kind of looked discolored like different

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.710 
kind of looked discolored like different
color<00:06:58.840> patches<00:06:59.170> are<00:06:59.680> all<00:07:00.490> evening<00:07:00.850> out<00:07:01.270> and<00:07:01.600> it

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 
color patches are all evening out and it

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.310 
color patches are all evening out and it
looks<00:07:02.400> one<00:07:03.400> solid<00:07:03.880> tone<00:07:04.180> more<00:07:04.750> than<00:07:04.990> it<00:07:05.110> used

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320 
looks one solid tone more than it used

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.860 
looks one solid tone more than it used
to<00:07:05.500> and<00:07:05.680> I<00:07:06.340> think<00:07:06.700> this<00:07:06.940> has<00:07:07.270> a<00:07:07.300> lot<00:07:07.450> of

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
to and I think this has a lot of

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.560 
to and I think this has a lot of
benefits<00:07:08.350> and<00:07:08.620> I<00:07:09.550> think<00:07:09.790> this<00:07:09.970> was<00:07:10.120> only<00:07:10.270> five

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.570 
benefits and I think this was only five

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.320 
benefits and I think this was only five
dollars<00:07:10.870> in<00:07:11.260> something<00:07:11.650> at<00:07:12.040> Walmart<00:07:12.550> I<00:07:12.760> think

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 
dollars in something at Walmart I think

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.870 
dollars in something at Walmart I think
that<00:07:13.750> if<00:07:13.990> you<00:07:14.230> are<00:07:14.260> thinking<00:07:15.130> about<00:07:15.310> purity

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:15.880 
that if you are thinking about purity

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.220 
that if you are thinking about purity
because<00:07:16.330> you've<00:07:16.480> read<00:07:16.690> a<00:07:16.720> lot<00:07:16.900> about<00:07:16.960> it

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.230 
because you've read a lot about it

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.200 
because you've read a lot about it
you've<00:07:17.500> seen<00:07:17.530> water<00:07:17.950> reviews<00:07:18.430> but<00:07:18.910> I<00:07:18.970> would

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
you've seen water reviews but I would

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.120 
you've seen water reviews but I would
definitely<00:07:19.330> try<00:07:19.810> the<00:07:19.870> Cetaphil<00:07:20.470> first<00:07:20.740> but

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.130 
definitely try the Cetaphil first but

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.490 
definitely try the Cetaphil first but
get<00:07:21.250> a<00:07:21.280> lot<00:07:21.490> cheaper<00:07:21.790> a<00:07:22.150> better<00:07:22.500> product

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500 
get a lot cheaper a better product

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.100 
get a lot cheaper a better product
design<00:07:24.040> because<00:07:24.460> we've<00:07:24.610> got<00:07:24.790> your<00:07:24.940> pump<00:07:25.270> your

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110 
design because we've got your pump your

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.890 
design because we've got your pump your
provider<00:07:26.410> packaging<00:07:26.920> design<00:07:27.190> and<00:07:28.000> it's<00:07:28.630> so

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:28.900 
provider packaging design and it's so

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.680 
provider packaging design and it's so
much<00:07:29.080> cheaper<00:07:29.590> and<00:07:30.430> better<00:07:30.490> it<00:07:31.180> smells<00:07:31.540> better

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:31.690 
much cheaper and better it smells better

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.580 
much cheaper and better it smells better
so<00:07:32.260> for<00:07:32.860> a<00:07:33.490> lot<00:07:34.330> cheaper<00:07:34.570> you<00:07:35.020> can<00:07:35.170> go<00:07:35.290> get<00:07:35.440> you

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:35.590 
so for a lot cheaper you can go get you

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.560 
so for a lot cheaper you can go get you
something<00:07:35.800> else<00:07:36.100> and<00:07:36.310> this<00:07:36.580> so<00:07:36.880> if<00:07:37.360> you're

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:37.570 
something else and this so if you're

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.390 
something else and this so if you're
considering<00:07:37.960> purity<00:07:38.410> made<00:07:38.560> simple<00:07:39.010> I<00:07:39.130> really

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 
considering purity made simple I really

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.330 
considering purity made simple I really
