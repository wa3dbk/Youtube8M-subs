00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.810 
got two to two wheel drive one man
buggies<00:00:14.660> so<00:00:15.660> it's<00:00:15.809> pretty<00:00:15.960> cool<00:00:16.609> like<00:00:17.609> you've

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
them but they're basically just the 1/5

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:37.310 
them but they're basically just the 1/5
+<00:00:22.830> 1<00:00:22.980> +<00:00:23.279> 1<00:00:23.310> 8<00:00:23.970> 2<00:00:24.269> scales<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.869> each<00:00:24.990> other<00:00:36.320> powers

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
+ 1 + 1 8 2 scales of each other powers

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.500 
+ 1 + 1 8 2 scales of each other powers
old<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.489> same<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.030> anyway<00:00:39.329> they're

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
old is like the same so anyway they're

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.850

the<00:00:41.489> 1/5<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.120> gonna<00:00:42.270> stay<00:00:42.540> ahead<00:00:42.660> they're<00:00:43.110> just

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
the 1/5 is gonna stay ahead they're just

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.720 
the 1/5 is gonna stay ahead they're just
so<00:00:43.500> they<00:00:43.590> don't<00:00:43.770> crash<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.460> doesn't

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
so they don't crash and it doesn't

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.180 
so they don't crash and it doesn't
destroy<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.360> little<00:00:46.350> one<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> powder<00:00:46.800> so

spectrum<00:03:05.530> receiver<00:03:06.530> controller<00:03:07.100> which

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
spectrum receiver controller which

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.240 
spectrum receiver controller which
doesn't<00:03:07.850> blow<00:03:08.000> boys<00:03:08.830> want<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:09.920> crush<00:03:10.130> that<00:03:12.250> and

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
the servo I know he's got the the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.870 
the servo I know he's got the the
high-power<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.880> SS<00:03:17.420> 900<00:03:17.989> s<00:03:18.110> digital<00:03:18.730> from<00:03:19.730> the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
high-power the SS 900 s digital from the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.479 
high-power the SS 900 s digital from the
gas<00:03:20.600> powered<00:03:21.019> low<00:03:21.200> C<00:03:21.410> 5<00:03:21.620> T<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:24.320> little<00:03:24.800> Glamis

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
gas powered low C 5 T the little Glamis

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.240 
gas powered low C 5 T the little Glamis
so<00:03:25.910> probably<00:03:26.720> like<00:03:27.140> if<00:03:27.470> you've<00:03:27.739> seen<00:03:28.100> my

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
so probably like if you've seen my

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.100 
so probably like if you've seen my
channel<00:03:28.550> you<00:03:28.670> know<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.150> Glamis<00:03:29.600> I<00:03:29.840> put

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
channel you know this the Glamis I put

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.320 
channel you know this the Glamis I put
the<00:03:30.230> AVC<00:03:30.769> in<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:33.100> ya<00:03:34.100> stability<00:03:34.970> control

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
the AVC in it the ya stability control

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.280 
the AVC in it the ya stability control
system<00:03:35.780> I<00:03:36.019> put<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:37.130> light<00:03:37.310> system<00:03:37.790> in<00:03:37.910> it

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
system I put the light system in it

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.949 
system I put the light system in it
painted<00:03:39.290> her<00:03:39.350> up<00:03:39.500> green<00:03:40.420> you<00:03:41.420> know<00:03:41.540> anyways
