closure it starts a little bit straight
and<00:00:53.670> then<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.930> gets<00:00:55.230> curly<00:00:56.039> which<00:00:56.370> usually<00:00:56.850> is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
and then it gets curly which usually is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.410 
and then it gets curly which usually is
an<00:00:57.300> indication<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.850> steamed<00:00:59.850> process

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420

to get the curl

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.479 
to get the curl
I<00:01:02.370> don't<00:01:02.910> mind<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.439> to<00:01:04.439> be<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.650> long<00:01:04.769> as<00:01:05.040> curly

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
I don't mind it to be as long as curly

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.920 
I don't mind it to be as long as curly
and<00:01:05.700> they<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.090> work<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> that's<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:06.840> I

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
do like that better than having it

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.730 
do like that better than having it
really<00:01:20.729> full<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.360> looks<00:01:21.509> extra<00:01:21.930> Wiggy<00:01:22.290> what

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
paid like $2 or $3 for this front this

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.450 
paid like $2 or $3 for this front this
package<00:01:53.300> deal<00:01:53.600> then<00:01:53.920> probably<00:01:54.920> concerned
