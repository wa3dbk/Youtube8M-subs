countertop you might leave something

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.790 
countertop you might leave something
behind<00:01:39.940> because<00:01:40.390> you've<00:01:40.660> created<00:01:40.900> holes<00:01:41.320> and

we're just going to take that cloth and

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.400 
we're just going to take that cloth and
we<00:02:00.370> are<00:02:00.490> going<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.880> clean<00:02:01.300> our<00:02:01.780> countertop

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
we are going to clean our countertop

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.380 
we are going to clean our countertop
where<00:02:02.710> we<00:02:02.920> placed<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.670> chicken<00:02:04.120> juice

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
where we placed that chicken juice

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.840 
where we placed that chicken juice
before<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:05.350> then<00:02:06.220> I'm<00:02:06.310> going<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.580> flip<00:02:06.730> it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
before and then I'm going to flip it

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.270 
before and then I'm going to flip it
face<00:02:07.210> up<00:02:07.480> so<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.470> our<00:02:08.500> raw<00:02:08.739> chicken<00:02:09.129> is

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
face up so that our raw chicken is

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.059 
face up so that our raw chicken is
sitting<00:02:09.610> upward<00:02:10.030> right<00:02:10.269> now<00:02:10.739> we're<00:02:11.739> going<00:02:11.920> to

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
sitting upward right now we're going to

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.160 
sitting upward right now we're going to
take<00:02:12.280> our<00:02:12.550> pro<00:02:12.879> clean<00:02:13.120> testing<00:02:13.660> swab<00:02:13.900> and

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
take our pro clean testing swab and

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.600 
take our pro clean testing swab and
based<00:02:14.410> on<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.800> color<00:02:15.040> chart<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.489> you're

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
based on the color chart that you're

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.820 
based on the color chart that you're
seeing<00:02:15.849> along<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.269> side<00:02:16.480> here<00:02:16.720> green<00:02:17.530> is

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
seeing along the side here green is

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.460 
seeing along the side here green is
clean<00:02:18.190> or<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.550> negative<00:02:19.120> test<00:02:19.420> for<00:02:19.780> protein<00:02:20.260> and

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
clean or a negative test for protein and

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.190 
clean or a negative test for protein and
then<00:02:21.040> your<00:02:21.310> gray<00:02:21.640> or<00:02:21.969> purple<00:02:22.239> area<00:02:22.719> would<00:02:23.019> be<00:02:23.170> a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
then your gray or purple area would be a

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.559 
then your gray or purple area would be a
positive<00:02:23.499> test<00:02:24.099> for<00:02:24.219> protein<00:02:24.760> left<00:02:25.060> over<00:02:25.390> on

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
positive test for protein left over on

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.990 
positive test for protein left over on
that

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
that

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.700

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
surface so we're going to take the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.130 
surface so we're going to take the
testing<00:02:28.130> swab<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.730> we're<00:02:29.240> just<00:02:29.420> going<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.720> rub

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
testing swab and we're just going to rub

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.810 
testing swab and we're just going to rub
it<00:02:30.260> along<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.680> countertop<00:02:31.220> where<00:02:31.490> we<00:02:31.640> had

of shakes here and you can see already

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.500 
of shakes here and you can see already
that<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.800> test<00:02:52.070> is<00:02:52.310> green<00:02:52.760> it<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.240> showing

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
that it is negative for any protein left

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.720 
that it is negative for any protein left
over<00:02:56.420> on<00:02:56.570> that<00:02:56.810> surface

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
over on that surface

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.449 
over on that surface

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
countertop now and once we get that nice

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.750 
countertop now and once we get that nice
and<00:03:13.940> wiped<00:03:14.480> down<00:03:14.600> again<00:03:15.230> I'm<00:03:15.920> going<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.550> take

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
and wiped down again I'm going to take

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.970 
and wiped down again I'm going to take
the<00:03:17.000> same<00:03:17.270> protein<00:03:17.780> swab<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.440> I'm<00:03:18.800> going<00:03:18.950> to

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
the same protein swab and I'm going to

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.610 
the same protein swab and I'm going to
retest<00:03:19.489> our<00:03:19.700> area<00:03:20.060> reason<00:03:20.989> for<00:03:21.170> this<00:03:21.260> is<00:03:21.470> to

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
retest our area reason for this is to

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.050 
retest our area reason for this is to
show<00:03:21.800> you<00:03:21.830> that<00:03:21.980> you<00:03:22.160> don't<00:03:22.280> have<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.820> worry

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
show you that you don't have to worry

back<00:03:28.280> on<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:28.820> another<00:03:29.030> countertop<00:03:29.720> or<00:03:29.959> surface

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
back on to another countertop or surface

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.500 
back on to another countertop or surface
that<00:03:30.440> you<00:03:30.739> continue<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.220> clean<00:03:31.549> with<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.390> we're

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
that you continue to clean with so we're

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.530 
that you continue to clean with so we're
going<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.660> give<00:03:32.840> this<00:03:32.989> another<00:03:33.290> little<00:03:33.380> shake

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
going to give this another little shake

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.850 
going to give this another little shake
and<00:03:35.540> I'll<00:03:35.690> put<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:35.930> up<00:03:35.989> against<00:03:36.230> my<00:03:36.320> whiteboard

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
and I'll put it up against my whiteboard

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.199 
and I'll put it up against my whiteboard
and<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.070> can<00:03:37.220> see<00:03:37.459> that<00:03:37.610> we<00:03:37.730> still<00:03:37.760> have<00:03:38.180> a

and you can see that we still have a

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.300 
and you can see that we still have a
nice<00:03:38.600> green<00:03:39.080> test<00:03:39.440> showing<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.160> that

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
step further and we'll actually touch

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.560 
step further and we'll actually touch
the<00:03:49.970> top<00:03:50.209> of<00:03:50.239> our<00:03:50.510> cloth<00:03:50.810> here<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:52.120> swab<00:03:53.120> and

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
give us another little shake and show

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.280 
give us another little shake and show
you<00:04:02.600> whoops

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
you whoops

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
sensitive this test is I'm just going to

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.580 
sensitive this test is I'm just going to
touch<00:04:16.549> it<00:04:16.579> into<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.359> chicken<00:04:17.660> itself<00:04:18.140> in<00:04:18.440> our

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
touch it into the chicken itself in our

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.580 
touch it into the chicken itself in our
little<00:04:18.919> ziplock<00:04:19.280> bag<00:04:19.489> here<00:04:19.790> and<00:04:20.470> before<00:04:21.470> we

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
little ziplock bag here and before we

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.290 
little ziplock bag here and before we
even<00:04:21.620> put<00:04:21.950> it<00:04:22.070> into<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.460> solution<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.150> can

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
even put it into the solution you can

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.090 
even put it into the solution you can
already<00:04:23.479> see<00:04:23.810> what<00:04:23.990> color<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.500> test<00:04:24.800> stick

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
already see what color the test stick

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.510 
already see what color the test stick
itself<00:04:25.550> is<00:04:25.880> turning<00:04:26.360> so<00:04:27.320> once<00:04:27.590> we<00:04:27.770> pop<00:04:27.950> it<00:04:28.130> into

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
itself is turning so once we pop it into

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.640 
itself is turning so once we pop it into
the<00:04:28.700> rest<00:04:28.880> of<00:04:29.030> our<00:04:29.150> solution<00:04:29.780> give<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:30.560> a

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
the rest of our solution give it a

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.290 
the rest of our solution give it a
couple<00:04:30.860> of<00:04:31.040> shakes<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:31.669> we<00:04:31.880> can<00:04:32.060> show<00:04:32.270> you

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
couple of shakes and we can show you

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.779 
couple of shakes and we can show you
then<00:04:32.690> that<00:04:33.320> it<00:04:33.470> is<00:04:33.620> turning<00:04:34.010> purple<00:04:34.310> at<00:04:34.610> that

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
then that it is turning purple at that

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.870 
then that it is turning purple at that
point<00:04:35.090> because<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:35.479> did<00:04:35.780> detect<00:04:36.169> protein<00:04:36.880> when

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
point because it did detect protein when

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.250 
point because it did detect protein when
we<00:04:38.060> swapped<00:04:38.419> it<00:04:38.630> with<00:04:38.780> the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
we swapped it with the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.040 
we swapped it with the
with<00:04:39.410> the<00:04:39.560> testing<00:04:40.040> so<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:41.360> know<00:04:41.900> the

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
with the testing so you know the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.860
