00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello my name is diego min and that the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.379
 Thursday art game for the team lion 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:18.210
 gaming and I'm here to answer some 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:22.500
 questions of there are bilingual projects 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.240
 art because it's the last name and we 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.929
 I had a lot of creativity to start the game 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.719
 and that with this state together my broad 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:40.500
 favorites in the game are win 3 and 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:43.410
 enlist the champion that would block would 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.350
 illusion because it seems very strong for the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.870
 current goal 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.230
 is moved in front of the others to 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.230
 meats 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.760
 do not 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.129
 I do not know lately when would I 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.519
 insult in the game tried to kill him or 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.769
 not pay attention to him but sometimes a 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:09.460
 moment in which he could not stand anymore and 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:14.409
 I have to tell you something I have a life 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:17.159
 normal just study game and from time to time 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.159
 When I go out 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:26.770
 quiet space 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:39.340
 that this city 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:42.880
 it's simple good I went in as a 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.640
 substitute for a tournament in which one 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.800
 of the powerful could play and it was something 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.680
 so it was something unexpected for me to be 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.140
 adjusted he was about to leave by the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.600
 fitness center 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.760
 and they called me obviously all for 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.830
 internet they did to me if I could play and 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.010
 support us because one of them had a 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.790
 mishap and well I said yes and to 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.039
 final went very well and for the second 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.810
 the second time I also asked for support 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.380
 It was well and asked me can be 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.300
 as a substitute and in the end after about 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.860
 problems that the Mexican had like that 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:24.660
 could not travel and I already stayed with the 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:27.000
 main as very good sometimes 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.740
 they bother enough to be the only 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.300
 Peruvian team but so far 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.300
 I had a relationship with her 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.890
 oh well a strange animal that I have not 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.460
 talked to those on the plane that it seems that 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.290
 they do not eat and I think they are called 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.330
 pericotes for that very rich the coi that 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.190
 is what they eat in Peru not obviously 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.950
 you have to go to a special restaurant 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.200
 but 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.520
 for them it seems extremely strange 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.520
 they would never eat 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.879
 my best memory was when we donated the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:13.030
 chile along with lion that I entered as 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:16.030
 substitute and the truth I did not expect 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.180
 so much for nothing and in the end I stayed with 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.180
 the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.269
