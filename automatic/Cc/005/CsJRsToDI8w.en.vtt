how do you solve it by building a

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
smarter program it's called Orion how

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.490

does<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.150> actually<00:03:17.450> calculate<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.349> route

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
does it actually calculate the route

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.409 
does it actually calculate the route
well<00:03:19.130> it's<00:03:19.489> gonna<00:03:19.639> start<00:03:19.970> with<00:03:20.180> something

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
well it's gonna start with something

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.150 
well it's gonna start with something
that's<00:03:20.660> just<00:03:20.780> very<00:03:20.900> simplistic<00:03:21.859> it's<00:03:22.040> not

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
that's just very simplistic it's not

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.190 
that's just very simplistic it's not
gonna<00:03:22.310> think<00:03:22.579> like<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:22.940> thinking<00:03:23.389> ahead<00:03:23.480> it's

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
gonna think like you thinking ahead it's

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.960 
gonna think like you thinking ahead it's
gonna<00:03:24.410> say<00:03:24.680> who's<00:03:24.950> my<00:03:25.190> nearest<00:03:25.489> neighbor<00:03:25.730> so

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
gonna say who's my nearest neighbor so

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.280 
gonna say who's my nearest neighbor so
it's<00:03:26.090> gonna<00:03:26.239> start<00:03:26.540> at<00:03:26.599> the<00:03:26.660> beginning<00:03:26.780> what's

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
it's gonna start at the beginning what's

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.020 
it's gonna start at the beginning what's
closest<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:27.859> me<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.280> go<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.639> next<00:03:28.760> stop

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
closest to me and I go to the next stop

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.210 
closest to me and I go to the next stop
closest<00:03:29.480> so<00:03:29.780> when<00:03:29.930> it's<00:03:30.049> done<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:30.859> its<00:03:31.010> very

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
closest so when it's done in its very

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.100 
closest so when it's done in its very
first<00:03:31.280> iteration<00:03:31.669> its<00:03:32.209> created<00:03:32.659> a<00:03:32.720> route<00:03:32.870> that

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
first iteration its created a route that

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.650 
first iteration its created a route that
looks<00:03:33.290> like<00:03:33.409> a

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
looks like a

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.420 
looks like a
kindergartner<00:03:34.290> would<00:03:34.410> have<00:03:34.500> created<00:03:34.680> and

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
kindergartner would have created and

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.790 
kindergartner would have created and
then<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.670> says<00:03:35.850> now<00:03:35.970> what's<00:03:36.210> wrong<00:03:36.450> with<00:03:36.690> that

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
then it says now what's wrong with that

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.530 
then it says now what's wrong with that
in<00:03:37.800> this<00:03:38.070> case<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.550> does<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:39.090> by<00:03:39.270> breaking

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
in this case it does that by breaking

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.600 
in this case it does that by breaking
the<00:03:39.840> task<00:03:40.080> down<00:03:40.380> into<00:03:40.800> sets<00:03:41.070> of<00:03:41.190> smaller

with with human pride on the line I

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.310 
with with human pride on the line I
decided<00:04:44.700> to<00:04:44.880> pit<00:04:45.060> man<00:04:45.300> versus<00:04:45.750> machine<00:04:45.870> and

decided to pit man versus machine and

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.020 
decided to pit man versus machine and
see<00:04:46.770> if<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:47.070> could<00:04:47.280> come<00:04:47.400> up<00:04:47.520> with<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.730> quicker

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030

so<00:04:52.020> how<00:04:52.200> do<00:04:52.260> I<00:04:52.410> compare<00:04:52.919> with<00:04:53.100> Orion<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.940> only

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
so how do I compare with Orion the only

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.180 
so how do I compare with Orion the only
way<00:04:54.300> to<00:04:54.360> know<00:04:54.570> is<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.780> give<00:04:55.140> it<00:04:55.230> a<00:04:55.290> try<00:04:55.560> you're

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
way to know is to give it a try you're

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.409
