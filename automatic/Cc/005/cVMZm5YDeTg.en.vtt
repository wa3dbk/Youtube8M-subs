00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.540
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.189
 new episode of auxi farming for this 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.439
 last episode of hawx farming 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.650
 today we are not really going to do 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.880
 farming we will do a little bit of a 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.990
 a little tour of the farm for you 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.210
 show everything I did off 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.150
 camera everything that has changed for this 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.400
 last episode so first of all you 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.920
 can see that cells ally themselves 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.530
 with culture is at its height 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.879
 we finally finished I finished the culture of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.370
 citizen to the cameras one must know that 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.820
 I did several hours of their 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.530
 camera 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.410
 but when I say several hours 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.239
 it was really a huge thing I 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.440
 never seen so much off camera for 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.750
 by a video so here we finished the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.170
 cultures so of all that is strange 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.269
 berry saddlery including strawberries celery and 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.470
 onions so that's all this is in 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:09.000
 train quietly then push 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.720
 then next so you can see there 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.830
 down you have to say yeah you 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.599
 why a year ago of the jungle 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.349
 because I explored too because 

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:15.959
 I thought it might be 

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:17.490
 nice to have a jungle tree in 

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:20.399
 so shut up so I planted a 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.679
 jungle tree and that's it there was a 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.319
 little bit of changes so the column 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.729
 of watermelon is over there is when 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.069
 even to go determined and so here 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.920
 I took care of succeeding in finding 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.890
 of 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.400
 wheat of the true 1 and plant it so 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.979
 I spent a lot of time 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.610
 do not even imagine how I have too much 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.350
 galley imagine the work that was 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.060
 provided to make those fucking 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:52.060
 planting it was super long I 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.680
 never spent so much time doing 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.350
 cultures 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.200
 it was a sick thing it was a 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.430
 sick thing I had to garmin and for 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.390
 go get some diamond because 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.880
 I had farted mahou 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.679
 finally it was yeah this is the case madness 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.819
 everything I planted and knowing that 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.560
 you have to tell yourself why and how 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.670
 you made to fart you in diamonds 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.280
 just because I fixed this 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.080
 case more class of not m back of 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.790
 classes do not have mac do and so suddenly 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.860
 and beats every time I'll hand a 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.100
 slack to replant and 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.920
 sama took too much time 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.510
 it took me a lot of time there I 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.670

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:41.530
 I must have passed through 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.700
 practically 10 buzzer buzzer for 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.200
 do all this 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.640
 it was a sick thing I never 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.470
 does as much off camera as I can 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.470
 tell you 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.390

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.790

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.540
 not made a good vine culture it's 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.480

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.239
 little bit we did I did all the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.560
 turn I had finished the stage in 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.420
 change but I have not delighted 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.609
 by the way before me sang with 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.760
 you just for fun we will enchant 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.710
 a shovel level 30 fortune of a 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.530
 breaking dawn 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.790
 we saw we had some caca misfortune 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.100
 can be cool but on a shovel it's 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.860
 not very useful but not very useful I 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.780
 want him to agree so here listen to it 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.570
 did it all this season as if 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.460
 farming was really great I took 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.410
 a lot of fun on the tour 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.000
 share with you despite having 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.710
 lost a lot of people on the way but 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 I was not preparing for what is 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.590
 a lot of people watching a 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.160
 series where the principle is just to do 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.020
 a farm 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.510
 you are united early with followers of 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.070
 action and mob outrages dupes 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.270
 but that's it anyway it changes a little 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.530
 it's a series that I have a lot 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.670
 enjoyed tour I had done this 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.920
 season two presences because you 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.450
 were a lot at my request is 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.580
 theoretically there should not have been 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.950
 of season 2 so I did it there 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.780
 will have no season 3 on the other hand I you 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.210

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.070
 new series that must arrive 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.320

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.720
