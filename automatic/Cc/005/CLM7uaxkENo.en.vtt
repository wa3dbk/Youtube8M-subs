mother's some nights the light would
come<00:01:11.430> back<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> voice<00:01:12.450> would<00:01:12.720> stop<00:01:13.049> but

the voice seemed closer the song was
short<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.770> once<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.430> done<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.329> voice

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
short and once it was done the voice

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.780 
short and once it was done the voice
