00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
that way I have the ability of sitting

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.430 
that way I have the ability of sitting
it<00:03:15.120> up<00:03:15.209> there<00:03:15.420> gives<00:03:16.019> you<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.170> little<00:03:16.290> bit

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
it up there gives you a little bit

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.140 
it up there gives you a little bit
information<00:03:16.560> about<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.430> root<00:03:17.610> feature<00:03:17.820> is

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
information about the root feature is

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.300 
information about the root feature is
essentially<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.750> two<00:03:19.620> features<00:03:19.980> currently

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
essentially is two features currently

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.370 
essentially is two features currently
supporting<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.850> route<00:03:21.000> home<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.930> back<00:03:22.080> and

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
supporting the route home and back and

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.900 
supporting the route home and back and
if<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.530> choose<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.860> use<00:03:23.130> those<00:03:23.340> two<00:03:23.519> options

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
if you choose to use those two options

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.030 
if you choose to use those two options
you'll<00:03:24.360> need<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.660> have<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.870> root<00:03:24.959> check<00:03:25.860> for

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
you'll need to have the root check for

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.009 
you'll need to have the root check for
update<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.519> then<00:03:26.640> uninstall<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.510> in<00:03:27.780> the

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
update and then uninstall is in the

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.750 
update and then uninstall is in the
application<00:03:28.200> only<00:03:28.890> because<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.459> requires

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
application only because it requires

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.310 
application only because it requires
administrative<00:03:30.060> access<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.989> certain

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
administrative access to certain

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.500 
administrative access to certain
functions<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.830> your<00:03:31.920> applicator<00:03:32.280> system<00:03:32.820> to

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
functions of your applicator system to

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.170 
functions of your applicator system to
be<00:03:33.630> able<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:34.019> lock<00:03:34.170> if<00:03:34.440> your<00:03:34.920> device<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:36.060> do

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
be able to lock if your device and to do

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.210 
be able to lock if your device and to do
so<00:03:36.420> when<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:36.720> hit<00:03:36.840> lock<00:03:37.110> that's<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.950> only<00:03:38.130> way

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
so when you hit lock that's the only way

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.410 
so when you hit lock that's the only way
for<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.549> be<00:03:38.640> able<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.850> turn<00:03:39.030> on<00:03:39.180> your<00:03:39.329> device

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
for it to be able to turn on your device

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.259 
for it to be able to turn on your device
or<00:03:39.750> turn<00:03:40.110> off<00:03:40.170> your<00:03:40.350> device<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.670> just<00:03:42.150> keep

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
or turn off your device so just keep

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.690 
or turn off your device so just keep
that<00:03:42.299> in<00:03:42.480> mind<00:03:43.100> we'll<00:03:44.100> go<00:03:44.190> ahead<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.400> go<00:03:44.489> home

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
that in mind we'll go ahead and go home

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.190 
that in mind we'll go ahead and go home
and<00:03:44.910> try<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.090> launch<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.450> application<00:03:45.900> itself

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
and try to launch the application itself

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.590 
and try to launch the application itself
so<00:03:46.860> by<00:03:47.579> default<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.030> have<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.360> keep<00:03:48.480> in<00:03:48.570> mind

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
so by default you have to keep in mind

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.300 
so by default you have to keep in mind
it's<00:03:48.989> just<00:03:49.079> it's<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.470> floating<00:03:49.680> point<00:03:49.980> so

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
it's just it's a floating point so

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.560 
it's just it's a floating point so
you're<00:03:50.640> able<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:50.910> set<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.209> and<00:03:51.360> put<00:03:51.480> it

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
you're able to set it and put it

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.539 
you're able to set it and put it
wherever<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:51.930> want<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:53.040> beauty<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.370> it

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
wherever you want and the beauty of it

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.130 
wherever you want and the beauty of it
is<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.970> launches<00:03:54.390> an<00:03:54.540> interest<00:03:54.870> that's<00:03:54.959> in

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
is it launches an interest that's in

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.500 
is it launches an interest that's in
front<00:03:55.320> of<00:03:55.380> your<00:03:55.500> screen<00:03:55.910> again<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.269> have<00:03:57.390> the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
front of your screen again you have the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.759 
front of your screen again you have the
ability<00:03:57.570> setting<00:03:58.079> up<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.260> know<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.470> recent

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
ability setting up you know the recent

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.449 
ability setting up you know the recent
applications<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.459> just<00:03:59.700> had<00:03:59.850> those<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:01.459> you

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
applications I just had those and you

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.979 
applications I just had those and you
can<00:04:02.610> set<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.940> up<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.180> have<00:04:03.299> you<00:04:03.660> know<00:04:03.720> have<00:04:03.959> it

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
launching the browser go back in here go

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.750 
launching the browser go back in here go
to<00:04:06.959> my<00:04:07.049> extra<00:04:07.350> settings<00:04:07.680> or<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:08.250> can<00:04:08.459> go<00:04:08.579> back

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
to my extra settings or I can go back

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.150 
to my extra settings or I can go back
and<00:04:08.790> go<00:04:09.090> home<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:10.019> launches<00:04:10.260> very<00:04:10.560> quickly<00:04:10.829> and

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
and go home it launches very quickly and

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.949 
and go home it launches very quickly and
it<00:04:11.250> works<00:04:11.489> very<00:04:11.730> nicely<00:04:11.970> I<00:04:12.180> think<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.780> works

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
it works very nicely I think it works

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.960 
it works very nicely I think it works
more<00:04:13.319> functionally<00:04:13.950> if<00:04:14.160> it<00:04:14.310> sits<00:04:14.550> on<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.790> side

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
more functionally if it sits on the side

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.190 
more functionally if it sits on the side
of<00:04:15.000> your<00:04:15.180> screen<00:04:15.270> being

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
of your screen being

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.290 
of your screen being
if<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.470> want<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.740> launch<00:04:16.890> an<00:04:17.100> application<00:04:17.820> it

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.300 
if you want to launch an application it

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.910 
if you want to launch an application it
usually<00:04:18.450> takes<00:04:18.630> up<00:04:18.930> most<00:04:19.290> of<00:04:19.380> your<00:04:19.440> screen<00:04:19.740> so

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
usually takes up most of your screen so

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.000 
usually takes up most of your screen so
you<00:04:20.010> don't<00:04:20.040> have<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.340> worry<00:04:20.460> about<00:04:20.580> that<00:04:20.850> part

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
you don't have to worry about that part

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.290 
you don't have to worry about that part
and<00:04:23.010> if<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:23.520> want<00:04:23.670> to<00:04:23.730> ever<00:04:23.820> go<00:04:24.030> in<00:04:24.150> and

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
and if you want to ever go in and

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.700 
and if you want to ever go in and
customize<00:04:24.390> it<00:04:24.750> again<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.230> just<00:04:25.350> click<00:04:25.440> it

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
customize it again you just click it

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.070 
customize it again you just click it
again<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:26.550> takes<00:04:26.670> you<00:04:26.820> back<00:04:26.850> in<00:04:27.180> one<00:04:27.780> hidden

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
again it takes you back in one hidden

and I guess when they install it is you

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.960 
and I guess when they install it is you
have<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:31.830> ability<00:04:31.980> of<00:04:32.310> temporary<00:04:32.700> hiding
