00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.880 

the<00:00:34.720> way<00:00:34.870> you<00:00:35.080> should<00:00:35.110> teach<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.680> bell

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
the way you should teach the bell

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.040 
the way you should teach the bell
pattern<00:00:36.370> is<00:00:36.640> to<00:00:36.790> first<00:00:37.090> learn<00:00:37.360> to<00:00:37.420> be<00:00:37.810> able<00:00:37.960> to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
pattern is to first learn to be able to

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.460 
pattern is to first learn to be able to
play<00:00:38.140> three<00:00:38.620> against<00:00:38.950> two<00:00:39.280> so<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:41.440> that

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
play three against two so what that

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.640 
play three against two so what that
means<00:00:41.830> is<00:00:42.040> let's<00:00:42.520> I'll<00:00:43.420> tap<00:00:43.690> my<00:00:43.840> foot<00:00:44.110> in<00:00:44.320> four

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
means is let's I'll tap my foot in four

00:00:44.650 --> 00:01:04.590 
means is let's I'll tap my foot in four
one<00:00:45.520> two<00:00:46.410> three

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:20.960 

one<00:01:05.320> two<00:01:06.159> three

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.480 

now<00:01:21.630> I'll<00:01:21.780> count<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.140> foot<00:01:22.410> its<00:01:22.800> cap<00:01:23.310> again

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
now I'll count the foot its cap again

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:36.490 
now I'll count the foot its cap again
for

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.990 

I'll<00:01:37.220> go<00:01:37.460> back

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
I'll go back

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.300 
I'll go back
cowbell<00:01:38.660> pattern<00:01:39.050> in<00:01:39.170> six<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:40.010> foot<00:01:40.220> and

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
cowbell pattern in six and the foot and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:02:09.109 
cowbell pattern in six and the foot and
for<00:01:40.550> just<00:01:40.790> alternating<00:01:41.240> back<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:41.570> forth

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.210 

because<00:02:10.119> afro-cuban<00:02:10.780> music<00:02:10.989> is<00:02:11.500> polyrhythmic

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
because afro-cuban music is polyrhythmic

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.720 
because afro-cuban music is polyrhythmic
you<00:02:12.909> have<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.269> sense<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.140> both<00:02:14.730> time

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
you have the sense of both time

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.360 
you have the sense of both time
signatures<00:02:16.269> both<00:02:16.530> pulses<00:02:17.530> being<00:02:17.769> felt<00:02:18.129> at<00:02:18.280> the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
signatures both pulses being felt at the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.750 
signatures both pulses being felt at the
same<00:02:18.610> time<00:02:19.739> so<00:02:20.739> let's<00:02:20.890> try<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.099> again<00:02:21.400> and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
same time so let's try this again and

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.789 
same time so let's try this again and
now<00:02:21.849> i'm<00:02:21.940> going<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.180> show<00:02:22.299> you<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.799> bell

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
now i'm going to show you the bell

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.619 
now i'm going to show you the bell
pattern<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.459> what<00:02:24.819> we<00:02:24.909> call<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.180> six<00:02:25.420> bell

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
pattern the what we call the six bell

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:50.610 
pattern the what we call the six bell
468<00:02:47.190> okay<00:02:48.190> so<00:02:48.489> there's<00:02:48.640> many<00:02:48.760> ways<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.620> study

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
468 okay so there's many ways to study

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.509 
468 okay so there's many ways to study
that<00:02:50.920> rhythm<00:02:51.190> take<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.180> really<00:02:52.480> slowly

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
that rhythm take it really slowly

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.099 
that rhythm take it really slowly
sometimes<00:02:54.519> I<00:02:54.670> teach<00:02:54.879> it<00:02:55.060> using<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.599> phrase<00:02:56.079> like

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
sometimes I teach it using a phrase like

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:13.770 
sometimes I teach it using a phrase like
this<00:02:56.769> if<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.879> don't<00:02:58.180> want<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:59.019> tell<00:02:59.470> me<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.690> if

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
this if you don't want to tell me so if

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.420 
this if you don't want to tell me so if
you're<00:03:13.900> gonna<00:03:14.019> use<00:03:14.169> that<00:03:14.230> phrase<00:03:14.739> if<00:03:15.099> you

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
you're gonna use that phrase if you

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.879 
you're gonna use that phrase if you
don't<00:03:15.910> want<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.540> tell<00:03:16.930> me<00:03:17.230> make<00:03:17.560> sure<00:03:17.590> you

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
don't want to tell me make sure you

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.280 
don't want to tell me make sure you
understand<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.669> the<00:03:18.849> if<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.359> that<00:03:19.690> phrase<00:03:20.019> is

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
understand that the if of that phrase is

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.379 
understand that the if of that phrase is
actually<00:03:21.099> not<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.459> first<00:03:21.730> beat<00:03:22.000> it's<00:03:22.239> the

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
actually not the first beat it's the

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.300 
actually not the first beat it's the
pickup<00:03:22.780> note<00:03:23.019> just<00:03:23.290> before<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.829> first<00:03:24.069> beat

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
pickup note just before the first beat

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:57.870 
pickup note just before the first beat
so<00:03:24.579> you<00:03:24.690> would<00:03:25.690> become<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.109> one

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.740 

so<00:03:58.630> that<00:03:58.810> rhythm<00:03:59.050> is<00:03:59.230> play

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
so that rhythm is play

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:41.790 
so that rhythm is play
from<00:03:59.870> tempos<00:04:00.290> could<00:04:00.530> be<00:04:00.620> played<00:04:00.830> very<00:04:01.100> fast

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.050 

okay<00:04:42.800> so<00:04:42.860> there<00:04:43.190> you<00:04:43.280> have<00:04:43.340> it<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.640> six<00:04:43.850> Bell

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
okay so there you have it the six Bell

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.330 
okay so there you have it the six Bell
pattern<00:04:44.510> playing<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:45.380> six<00:04:45.620> against<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.010> four

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
pattern playing the six against the four

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.300 
pattern playing the six against the four
so<00:04:46.550> you<00:04:46.640> get<00:04:46.790> both<00:04:46.940> feels<00:04:48.010> experimental<00:04:49.010> have

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
so you get both feels experimental have

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.220 
so you get both feels experimental have
a<00:04:49.340> lot<00:04:49.460> of<00:04:49.490> fun<00:04:49.730> with<00:04:49.880> it<00:04:49.940> too<00:04:50.630> great<00:04:50.870> rhythm

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
a lot of fun with it too great rhythm

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.740 
a lot of fun with it too great rhythm
and<00:04:51.760> can<00:04:52.760> be<00:04:52.850> played<00:04:53.060> on<00:04:53.360> many<00:04:53.570> different
