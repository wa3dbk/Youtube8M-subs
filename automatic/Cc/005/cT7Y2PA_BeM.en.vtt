00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.210
 good youtube I am very good villeros and 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.150
 how are you and we bring you the second guide 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.420
 this jacks in this guide we will explain 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.630
 how in the dea or the skills the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.440
 combos and objects so to speak the 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.360
 objects that more than better would come 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.880
 well let's start with the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.850
 skills 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.060
 the passive is called the relentless jump 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.130
 this ability makes for every 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.120
 accumulation they make with attacks 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.610
 basic maximum 6 stacks wins 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.160
 attack speed to the next one is at 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.910
 principle is quite useful you see it there 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.910
 that is going up 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.350
 OK 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.140
 sorry to the q called hit in jump 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.110
 which is a hybrid skill that goes 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.049
 as much by attack as by power of 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.880
 skill in which jazz swoops 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.970
 against the enemy by hitting a jump 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.340
 although it is also valid for wii jumping 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.640
 about minions or champions of your own 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.640
 team 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:41.740
 fuck always then w is called 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.020
 empowerment stability goes with the with 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.470
 ability power and can be combined 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.860
 both with the q and with a basic attack 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.930
 normal 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.910
 Trome indagan de la wy gives me 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.570
 now we wait a bit for the 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.570
 cooling 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.790
 of the w jumps and still removes more is combined 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.910
 the damage 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.940
 lae is called counterattack in this 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.710
 skill when it's already active starts 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.160
 to do as the helicopter as a 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.980
 helicopter and dodge all attacks 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.460
 except the tower all attacks 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.460
 give him 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.340
 and that they are directed towards him and then 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.400
 when he finishes making the helicopter 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.950
 it stops for a moment and an average of a 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.350
 second or two as much 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.420
 this stuns 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.540
 water dam 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:44.090
 and it leaves cloudy I can not move 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.090
 and then the re s finish 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.460
 it's called the teacher's power with this 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.920
 ability 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.670
 as active 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.420
 activating it is already winning armor according to 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.330
 his attack and magic resistance according to his 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.300
 skill this is quite useful when 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.430
 there are two champions or three enemies and three 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.170
 you can with them will increase 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.290
 armor for that but as more 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.500
 important are your passive which is what 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.819
 there is a class to be so ope 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.660
 every third consecutive blow 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.970
 jacques vega 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.940
 so to speak, it hits a blow where 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.319
 they take away a lot more compared to their 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.650
 basic 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.079
 that second and the third after 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.469
 surrounded in yellow circle and takes away 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.469
 much more 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.210
 good following with the jacques guide 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.860
 we bring you the combos as the most used 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.140
 with jacques 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.140
 is the w 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.470
 at home what jumps on him to 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.140
 Remove more life and press lae to 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.120
 do a study already from there 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.900
 you start to take away much more life if you do not 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.900
 they have already killed 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:21.320
 the murky for almost killing me 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:24.350
 and then there is a variant of this combo 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.820
 what would be w 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.490
 and q live just finish 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.060
 helicopter jumps on the unfair to 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.190
 to fall the tur of which you do not leave him not 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.290
 you leave the option as in the in the 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.979
 combo before you can use 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:46.389
 flash can escape this yoyo by 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:51.430
 example in my case I can escape from 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.430
 nexus for back good let's see the combo 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.940
 nature of it, it kills me 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:09.889
 good following with the jacques guide 

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:13.219
 here are the 200 to start and give a 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:15.709
 little resistance for beginning and such 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:18.649
 we could take a golden shield 

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:23.239
 since it gives life to the mature and 

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:26.029
 life regeneration then as boots is 

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:29.439
 I'll be able to according to the peak situation vi 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:31.639
 girl or mercury boots according to 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:34.849
 according to the abilities of the enemies 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.659
 since the mercury boots reduce 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:40.519
 the studies the slowdowns and others 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:43.239
 then we can continue with a saber 

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:45.979
 gun where we would start with the 

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:48.619
 revolver headset and then in the part 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:52.219
 left and then the object more 

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:55.849
 important in the trinity we would begin 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:58.849
 by a bacteriophage and then the brightness and 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.069
 then the fervor and then to put together a 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:04.429
 Once we have the activity it's going to 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:09.040
 mark the game enough in favor 

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:12.370
 ours since its passive 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.220
 when using one skill the next of 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.640
 basic beat be a stronger verse 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:22.540
 adding in addition to the basic that you give the 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.460
 attack power that we then have a 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.590
 furious stew sheet as it gives us 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:32.880
 attack power and ability power 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:35.229
 and giving basic would not raise our 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.740
 our power of ability and our 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:41.710
 attack speed and then as fifth 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.970
 as a sixth leek deadly object of 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.980
 banksy 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:50.720
 then we would sell 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:54.770
 in the q of dora and according to which goes the 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:58.310
 departure march the side the case that you 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:00.910
 see with little attack then a warm or if 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:06.140
 you look good of everything to have more life 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:10.300
 I did not focus on rila and little more and good 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.300
 this has been all in the jazz guide
