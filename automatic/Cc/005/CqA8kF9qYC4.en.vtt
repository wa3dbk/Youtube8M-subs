00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
this chapter you know I like to think of

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.670 
this chapter you know I like to think of
it<00:01:23.610> as<00:01:23.700> focusing<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.509> three<00:01:24.900> particular<00:01:25.530> areas

it as focusing on three particular areas

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.490 
it as focusing on three particular areas
your<00:01:26.070> substantive<00:01:26.670> issue<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.780> thing

question forward a little bit so that

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.160 
question forward a little bit so that
that's<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.670> substantive<00:02:33.329> issue<00:02:33.510> that's<00:02:33.840> kind

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
that's the substantive issue that's kind

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.050 
that's the substantive issue that's kind
of<00:02:34.200> what<00:02:34.349> you're<00:02:34.500> doing<00:02:34.769> there<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.640> other<00:02:35.819> two

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060

things that you need to keep in mind is

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.069 
things that you need to keep in mind is
your<00:02:38.099> theoretical<00:02:38.540> foundation<00:02:39.540> there's

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
your theoretical foundation there's

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.490 
your theoretical foundation there's
going<00:02:40.379> to<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.620> some<00:02:41.040> sort<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.400> accepted

going to be some sort of accepted

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.050 
going to be some sort of accepted
explanations<00:02:43.500> for<00:02:43.829> your<00:02:43.890> substantive<00:02:44.610> issues

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
explanations for your substantive issues

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.660 
explanations for your substantive issues
in<00:02:45.690> your<00:02:45.930> literature<00:02:46.230> sometimes<00:02:46.829> what<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.489> do

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
in your literature sometimes what you do

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.509 
in your literature sometimes what you do
is<00:02:47.879> you<00:02:48.060> use<00:02:48.239> serious<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.049> main<00:02:49.340> focus<00:02:50.340> of

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
is you use serious the main focus of

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.039 
is you use serious the main focus of
your<00:02:50.640> research<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.269> you're<00:02:51.359> going<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.569> test<00:02:51.810> a

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
your research and you're going to test a

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.380 
your research and you're going to test a
certain<00:02:52.560> aspect<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.220> three<00:02:53.459> other<00:02:54.060> times

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
certain aspect of the three other times

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.759 
certain aspect of the three other times
you're<00:02:54.599> just<00:02:54.629> relating<00:02:55.319> how<00:02:55.500> this

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
you're just relating how this

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.960 
you're just relating how this
explanation<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:57.390> used<00:02:58.319> in<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.680> literature<00:02:59.159> so

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
explanation is used in the literature so

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.619 
explanation is used in the literature so
used<00:03:00.329> to<00:03:00.450> be<00:03:01.040> for<00:03:02.040> example<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:03.209> police

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
used to be for example that police

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.470 
used to be for example that police
misconduct<00:03:03.989> in<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:04.950> literature<00:03:05.280> was<00:03:06.150> talked

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
misconduct in the literature was talked

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.680 
misconduct in the literature was talked
about<00:03:06.810> but<00:03:07.049> it<00:03:07.140> wasn't<00:03:07.500> really<00:03:08.599> mentioned<00:03:09.599> in

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
about but it wasn't really mentioned in

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.839 
about but it wasn't really mentioned in
a<00:03:09.780> theoretical<00:03:10.470> way<00:03:10.620> then<00:03:11.340> we<00:03:11.519> started

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
a theoretical way then we started

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.000 
a theoretical way then we started
bringing<00:03:12.060> theory<00:03:12.599> into<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.470> then<00:03:13.620> we<00:03:13.799> can

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
bringing theory into it and then we can

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.619 
bringing theory into it and then we can
start<00:03:14.340> bringing<00:03:14.549> different<00:03:14.970> types<00:03:15.420> of

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
start bringing different types of

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.069 
start bringing different types of
misconduct<00:03:16.530> into<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.370> forefront<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.690> might

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
misconduct into the forefront so I might

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.159 
misconduct into the forefront so I might
lay<00:03:19.440> out<00:03:19.650> an<00:03:20.040> argument<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.790> test<00:03:21.209> something

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
lay out an argument to test something

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.680 
lay out an argument to test something
related<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.560> police<00:03:22.950> abusive<00:03:23.700> force<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.599> I

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
related to police abusive force and I

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.020 
related to police abusive force and I
might<00:03:24.930> want<00:03:25.139> to<00:03:25.260> use<00:03:25.859> social<00:03:26.130> learning<00:03:26.579> theory

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
might want to use social learning theory

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.940 
might want to use social learning theory
would<00:03:27.239> say<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.750> core<00:03:27.989> social<00:03:28.410> learning<00:03:28.590> theory

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
would say a core social learning theory

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.849 
would say a core social learning theory
to<00:03:29.609> apply<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.989> because<00:03:31.530> there<00:03:31.680> hasn't

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
to apply that and because there hasn't

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.650 
to apply that and because there hasn't
been<00:03:32.069> a<00:03:32.190> lot<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.639> tests<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.269> I<00:03:33.299> might

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
been a lot of tests of that I might

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.479 
been a lot of tests of that I might
actually<00:03:33.840> do<00:03:34.200> an<00:03:34.260> exact<00:03:34.590> test<00:03:34.889> of<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:35.220> theory

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
actually do an exact test of the theory

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.000 
actually do an exact test of the theory
that<00:03:36.450> might<00:03:36.660> be<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.989> research<00:03:37.349> question<00:03:37.919> that

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
that might be the research question that

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.349 
that might be the research question that
I'm<00:03:38.129> proposing<00:03:39.829> methodological

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
I'm proposing methodological

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.339 
I'm proposing methodological
considerations<00:03:42.359> is<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.780> last<00:03:42.989> major

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
considerations is the last major

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.930 
considerations is the last major
component<00:03:44.069> that<00:03:44.220> belongs<00:03:44.549> in<00:03:44.760> your

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
component that belongs in your

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.240 
component that belongs in your
literature<00:03:45.209> review<00:03:45.419> section<00:03:46.079> you<00:03:46.829> need<00:03:47.040> to

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
literature review section you need to

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.189 
literature review section you need to
show<00:03:47.489> how<00:03:47.669> your<00:03:47.879> body<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.329> science<00:03:48.750> looks<00:03:48.989> at

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
show how your body of science looks at

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.129 
show how your body of science looks at
things<00:03:49.379> methodological<00:03:50.329> so<00:03:51.329> for<00:03:51.599> example

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
things methodological so for example

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.409 
things methodological so for example
testing<00:03:52.769> police<00:03:53.310> issues<00:03:53.819> I<00:03:54.000> might<00:03:54.209> use

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
testing police issues I might use

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.479 
testing police issues I might use
questionnaires<00:03:55.199> I<00:03:55.319> might<00:03:55.769> have<00:03:55.949> a<00:03:55.980> research

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
questionnaires I might have a research

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.900 
questionnaires I might have a research
design<00:03:57.560> that<00:03:58.560> is<00:03:58.709> some<00:03:58.949> sort<00:03:59.129> of<00:03:59.250> survey<00:03:59.639> based

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.670 
design that is some sort of survey based
design<00:04:00.359> and<00:04:02.150> one<00:04:03.150> common<00:04:03.690> way<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.870> do<00:04:04.169> that<00:04:04.319> is

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
design and one common way to do that is

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.619 
design and one common way to do that is
to<00:04:04.949> look<00:04:05.160> at<00:04:05.430> these<00:04:05.639> correlates<00:04:06.389> as

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
to look at these correlates as

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.199 
to look at these correlates as
independent<00:04:07.319> variables<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:08.040> see<00:04:08.849> how<00:04:08.970> they

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
independent variables and see how they

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.970 
independent variables and see how they
work<00:04:09.449> together<00:04:09.660> as<00:04:10.019> a<00:04:10.049> predictor<00:04:10.680> of<00:04:10.709> the

dependent revell that would be a

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
multiple regression approach and I want

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.240 
multiple regression approach and I want
to<00:04:15.480> show<00:04:15.720> how<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.019> body<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.680> science<00:04:17.070> is

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
to show how the body of science is

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.640 
to show how the body of science is

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
I'm looking at now that doesn't mean I

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.750 
I'm looking at now that doesn't mean I

explain why I still have to explain what

explain why I still have to explain what
I'm<00:04:35.290> doing<00:04:35.620> in<00:04:35.770> great<00:04:36.010> detail<00:04:36.550> even<00:04:37.390> if<00:04:37.480> I<00:04:37.630> fit

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
I'm doing in great detail even if I fit

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.270 
I'm doing in great detail even if I fit
exactly<00:04:38.110> what<00:04:38.680> they're<00:04:38.890> doing<00:04:38.920> because

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
exactly what they're doing because

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.190 
exactly what they're doing because
there's<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.490> lot<00:04:39.640> of<00:04:39.820> issues<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.210> lot<00:04:40.480> of<00:04:40.630> nuances

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
there's a lot of issues a lot of nuances

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.680 
there's a lot of issues a lot of nuances
that<00:04:41.410> go<00:04:41.530> into<00:04:41.890> how<00:04:42.430> my<00:04:42.670> research<00:04:42.940> differs

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
that go into how my research differs

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.390 
that go into how my research differs
from<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.110> way<00:04:44.230> it's<00:04:44.380> previously<00:04:44.980> been<00:04:45.190> done

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
from the way it's previously been done

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.700 
from the way it's previously been done
but<00:04:46.150> if<00:04:46.270> I'm<00:04:46.420> going<00:04:46.690> to<00:04:46.960> do<00:04:47.110> something<00:04:47.380> really

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
but if I'm going to do something really

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.310 
but if I'm going to do something really
different<00:04:48.010> I'll<00:04:48.280> have<00:04:48.730> to<00:04:49.030> discuss<00:04:49.990> that<00:04:50.260> and

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
different I'll have to discuss that and

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.130 
different I'll have to discuss that and
explain<00:04:50.950> that<00:04:51.130> one<00:04:51.370> so<00:04:52.180> basically<00:04:52.630> I<00:04:52.750> like<00:04:52.990> to

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
explain that one so basically I like to

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.620 
explain that one so basically I like to
look<00:04:53.320> at<00:04:53.590> the<00:04:53.860> literature<00:04:54.040> review<00:04:54.610> as<00:04:55.300> the

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
look at the literature review as the

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.060 
look at the literature review as the
three<00:04:55.930> main<00:04:56.110> things<00:04:56.140> that<00:04:56.560> you<00:04:56.710> want<00:04:56.860> to<00:04:56.920> give

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
three main things that you want to give

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.660 
three main things that you want to give
attention<00:04:57.220> to<00:04:57.790> is<00:04:58.300> your<00:04:58.510> substantive<00:04:59.080> issue

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
attention to is your substantive issue

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.820 
attention to is your substantive issue
your<00:05:00.670> theoretical<00:05:01.300> foundation<00:05:02.200> or<00:05:02.290> overview

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
your theoretical foundation or overview

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.870 
your theoretical foundation or overview
and<00:05:03.040> your<00:05:03.730> methodological<00:05:04.120> approach
