phone this is the remote handset lifter

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.610 
phone this is the remote handset lifter
and<00:00:08.519> where<00:00:08.820> it's<00:00:09.000> supposed<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.510> go<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:10.349> arm

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
and where it's supposed to go this arm

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.709 
and where it's supposed to go this arm
here<00:00:10.980> which<00:00:11.190> actually<00:00:11.429> lifts<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.330> going<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.599> go

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
here which actually lifts is going to go

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.959 
here which actually lifts is going to go
in<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:12.990> curve<00:00:13.349> right<00:00:13.740> here<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.700> want

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
in this curve right here so you want

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.029 
in this curve right here so you want
this<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.420> be<00:00:15.540> as<00:00:15.660> high<00:00:16.020> as<00:00:16.049> it'll<00:00:16.410> comfortably

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
this to be as high as it'll comfortably

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.730 
this to be as high as it'll comfortably
go<00:00:17.279> without<00:00:17.670> knocking<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.359> off<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:19.410> when<00:00:19.619> it

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
go without knocking it off so when it

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.620 
go without knocking it off so when it
does<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.100> when<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.430> does<00:00:20.670> lift<00:00:20.970> up<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.420> don't

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
does so when this does lift up you don't

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.450 
does so when this does lift up you don't
want<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.020> slide<00:00:22.260> down<00:00:22.619> because<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.250> not

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
want it to slide down because it's not

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
all the way I'm up on the curve so right

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.359 
all the way I'm up on the curve so right
up<00:00:26.580> here<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.880> right<00:00:27.060> where<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.330> want<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.840> go

okay<00:00:54.730> now<00:00:55.059> you<00:00:55.120> can<00:00:55.390> let<00:00:55.570> go<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:56.230> other<00:00:56.350> end<00:00:56.710> or

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
okay now you can let go the other end or

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.180 
okay now you can let go the other end or
this<00:00:57.480> cord<00:00:58.480> it<00:00:58.839> actually<00:00:59.260> goes<00:00:59.469> into<00:00:59.769> the<00:00:59.980> base

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
this cord it actually goes into the base

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.139 
this cord it actually goes into the base
of<00:01:00.219> either<00:01:00.670> your<00:01:00.850> 9350<00:01:01.809> shown<00:01:02.050> here<00:01:02.620> or<00:01:03.149> 90-120

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.230 
of either your 9350 shown here or 90-120
or<00:01:04.269> wireless<00:01:04.780> headset<00:01:05.490> so<00:01:06.490> when<00:01:06.729> you<00:01:06.820> lift<00:01:07.030> up

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
or wireless headset so when you lift up

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.130 
or wireless headset so when you lift up
on<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.720> set<00:01:08.259> then<00:01:08.950> that'll<00:01:09.310> lift<00:01:09.490> up<00:01:09.670> on<00:01:09.880> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
on the set then that'll lift up on the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.620 
on the set then that'll lift up on the
lifter<00:01:14.340> now<00:01:15.340> with<00:01:15.490> some<00:01:15.729> phones<00:01:16.060> or<00:01:16.420> most

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
lifter now with some phones or most

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.870 
lifter now with some phones or most
phones<00:01:16.990> have<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.710> speakerphone<00:01:18.159> underneath

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
phones have the speakerphone underneath

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.609 
phones have the speakerphone underneath
here<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.420> means<00:01:19.960> that<00:01:20.170> when<00:01:20.289> the<00:01:20.409> phone

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
here that means that when the phone

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.980 
here that means that when the phone
rings<00:01:21.009> that<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:21.909> ringtone<00:01:22.360> sensor<00:01:22.840> will

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
rings that the ringtone sensor will

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.440 
rings that the ringtone sensor will
sense<00:01:23.259> it<00:01:23.470> right<00:01:23.710> here<00:01:24.100> that's<00:01:24.850> not<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.270> case

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
sense it right here that's not the case

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.240 
sense it right here that's not the case
with<00:01:25.690> this<00:01:25.810> Nortel<00:01:26.380> phone<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.830> speakerphone

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
with this Nortel phone the speakerphone

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.490 
with this Nortel phone the speakerphone
or<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:27.909> ringer<00:01:28.270> will<00:01:28.450> come<00:01:28.690> right<00:01:28.929> from<00:01:28.960> there

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
or the ringer will come right from there

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.100 
or the ringer will come right from there
so<00:01:30.039> this<00:01:30.250> ringtone<00:01:30.520> sensor<00:01:31.270> won't<00:01:31.569> be<00:01:31.720> able<00:01:31.990> to

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
so this ringtone sensor won't be able to

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.960 
so this ringtone sensor won't be able to
sense<00:01:32.409> when<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.890> phone<00:01:33.069> is<00:01:33.100> ringing<00:01:33.520> because

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
sense when the phone is ringing because

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.539 
sense when the phone is ringing because
of<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.330> location<00:01:34.869> of<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.049> speaker<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:36.369> good

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
of the location of the speaker the good

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.699 
of the location of the speaker the good
news<00:01:36.759> is<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:37.030> we<00:01:37.450> have<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.659> remote<00:01:38.080> ringtone

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
news is that we have a remote ringtone
