mandate to create a new brand which is
well<00:00:12.660> pretty<00:00:13.230> we're<00:00:13.500> pretty<00:00:13.679> lucky<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.219> have

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
well pretty we're pretty lucky to have

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.430 
well pretty we're pretty lucky to have
that<00:00:14.519> chance<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:14.969> then<00:00:15.570> what<00:00:15.809> influenced<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
that chance and then what influenced the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.130 
that chance and then what influenced the
team<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.949> build<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.550> how<00:00:17.720> technology<00:00:18.720> was

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
team to build this is how technology was

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.320 
team to build this is how technology was
affecting<00:00:19.590> our<00:00:19.770> own<00:00:19.980> lives<00:00:20.220> how<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:20.580> realize

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
affecting our own lives how we realize

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.849 
affecting our own lives how we realize
that<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.689> were<00:00:21.720> changing<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.380> way<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:22.560> were

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
that we were changing the way we were

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.830 
that we were changing the way we were
connecting<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.369> people<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:24.029> well<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.660> guess

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
connecting with people and well I guess

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.810 
connecting with people and well I guess
with<00:00:24.990> information<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.560> general<00:00:25.590> based<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
with information in general based on the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.160 
with information in general based on the
fact<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.240> had<00:00:27.359> smart<00:00:27.689> phones<00:00:27.930> and

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
fact that we had smart phones and

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.929 
fact that we had smart phones and
computer<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.920> internet<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.519> we<00:00:29.849> were

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
computer and the internet and we were

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.939 
computer and the internet and we were
exploring<00:00:30.300> how<00:00:30.630> there<00:00:30.929> was<00:00:31.050> flaws<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.679> all<00:00:31.769> of

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
exploring how there was flaws and all of

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.440 
exploring how there was flaws and all of
that<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.340> how<00:00:32.460> come<00:00:32.669> some<00:00:32.910> people<00:00:32.940> some

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that and how come some people some

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.360 
that and how come some people some
hackers<00:00:33.870> could<00:00:34.140> exploit<00:00:34.530> all<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.950> those<00:00:35.070> flaws

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
hackers could exploit all of those flaws

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.430 
hackers could exploit all of those flaws
so<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.940> our<00:00:36.059> core<00:00:36.420> inspiration<00:00:37.260> for

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
so that was our core inspiration for

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.619 
so that was our core inspiration for
watchdogs<00:00:37.790> why<00:00:38.790> did<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.090> decide<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> have

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
watchdogs why did you decide to have

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.440 
watchdogs why did you decide to have
Chicago<00:00:40.170> as<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> setting<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.829> watchdogs

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
Chicago as the setting and watchdogs

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.790 
Chicago as the setting and watchdogs
Chicago<00:00:42.450> was<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.600> great<00:00:42.870> choice<00:00:43.110> for<00:00:43.170> us<00:00:43.410> well

of our teams and with corruption really
well<00:01:15.450> explain<00:01:16.290> some<00:01:16.530> ways<00:01:16.740> your<00:01:17.009> action<00:01:17.400> can

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
well explain some ways your action can

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.600 
well explain some ways your action can
impact<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.119> city<00:01:18.500> well<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.040> there's<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> lot

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
impact the city well and there's a lot

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.310 
impact the city well and there's a lot
of<00:01:20.640> ways<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.210> impact<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.659> city<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.110> mean

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
of ways you can impact the city I mean

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.289 
of ways you can impact the city I mean
first<00:01:22.560> off<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.280> hack<00:01:23.490> into<00:01:23.700> any<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
first off you can hack into any of the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.749 
first off you can hack into any of the
systems<00:01:24.540> within<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.560> city<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.040> all<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.610> that

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
systems within the city and all of that

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.609 
systems within the city and all of that
is<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> cause<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> lot<00:01:28.590> of

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
is going to just going to cause a lot of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.950 
is going to just going to cause a lot of
situations<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.790> are<00:01:29.939> purely<00:01:30.210> based<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
situations that are purely based on the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.230 
situations that are purely based on the
players<00:01:31.229> plan<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:32.729> he<00:01:32.820> does<00:01:33.000> like

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
players plan and on what he does like

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.289 
players plan and on what he does like
for<00:01:33.450> example<00:01:33.540> you're<00:01:34.079> able<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.470> hack<00:01:34.650> into<00:01:34.860> any

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
for example you're able to hack into any

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.700 
for example you're able to hack into any
traffic<00:01:36.299> light<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.290> change<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
traffic light you can change the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.999 
traffic light you can change the
direction<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.329> an<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.450> way<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.439> open<00:01:40.920> up

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
disrupt game engine okay so we knew that

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.640 
disrupt game engine okay so we knew that
our<00:02:15.130> goal<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:16.060> create<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.360> very<00:02:16.660> dynamic<00:02:16.959> open

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.040 
our goal to create a very dynamic open
world<00:02:17.830> was<00:02:18.099> going<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.370> be<00:02:18.459> hard<00:02:18.750> we're<00:02:19.750> trying

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
world was going to be hard we're trying

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.259 
world was going to be hard we're trying
to<00:02:20.230> give<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.590> control<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.640> city<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:22.150> the

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
to give the control of the city to the

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.660 
to give the control of the city to the
player<00:02:22.569> so<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.560> required<00:02:24.040> us<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.250> build<00:02:24.550> a

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
player so that required us to build a

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.190 
player so that required us to build a
new<00:02:24.700> engine<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.390> we<00:02:25.540> knew<00:02:25.690> we<00:02:25.810> needed<00:02:25.930> to

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
new engine and we knew we needed to

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.270 
new engine and we knew we needed to
start<00:02:26.440> from<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.739> beginning<00:02:27.190> because

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
start from the beginning because

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.190 
start from the beginning because
creating<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.849> game<00:02:28.030> engine<00:02:28.269> is<00:02:28.569> takes<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:29.080> long

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
creating a game engine is takes a long

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.320 
creating a game engine is takes a long
while<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.980> we've<00:02:30.280> been<00:02:30.430> at<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:30.580> for<00:02:30.730> over<00:02:30.940> four

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
while so we've been at it for over four

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.630 
while so we've been at it for over four
years<00:02:31.540> now<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:32.620> we've<00:02:32.860> made<00:02:33.099> sure<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.580> we

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
years now and we've made sure that we

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.970 
years now and we've made sure that we
pushed<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.120> those<00:02:34.300> two<00:02:34.540> key<00:02:34.750> areas<00:02:34.980> dynamism

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
pushed on those two key areas dynamism

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.339 
pushed on those two key areas dynamism
which<00:02:36.340> means<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:37.060> fact<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.599> city<00:02:37.810> truly

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
which means the fact that the city truly

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.650 
which means the fact that the city truly
reacts<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.099> choices<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.640> made<00:02:39.880> it's<00:02:40.510> not

still<00:03:15.190> use<00:03:15.670> hacking<00:03:16.150> for<00:03:16.390> at<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.630> they<00:03:16.900> can

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
still use hacking for at that they can

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.900 
still use hacking for at that they can
still<00:03:17.260> always<00:03:17.650> mix<00:03:17.950> in<00:03:18.100> hacking<00:03:18.549> with<00:03:18.700> their

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
still always mix in hacking with their

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.550 
still always mix in hacking with their
physical<00:03:19.120> abilities<00:03:19.480> in<00:03:20.109> order<00:03:20.319> to<00:03:20.440> achieve

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
physical abilities in order to achieve

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.830 
physical abilities in order to achieve
that<00:03:20.859> and<00:03:21.069> we<00:03:21.850> also<00:03:22.000> wanted<00:03:22.359> to<00:03:22.420> support

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
that and we also wanted to support

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.840 
that and we also wanted to support
people<00:03:22.959> who<00:03:23.290> wanted<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.680> focus<00:03:23.889> on<00:03:24.220> hacking<00:03:24.489> so

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
people who wanted to focus on hacking so

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.819 
people who wanted to focus on hacking so
that's<00:03:25.030> going<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.239> be<00:03:25.329> a<00:03:25.420> huge<00:03:25.750> way<00:03:26.049> also<00:03:26.470> of

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
that's going to be a huge way also of

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.860 
that's going to be a huge way also of
solving<00:03:27.250> some<00:03:27.430> problems<00:03:27.910> for<00:03:28.090> example<00:03:28.750> we

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
solving some problems for example we

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.229 
solving some problems for example we
showed<00:03:29.079> you<00:03:29.260> how<00:03:29.440> Aiden<00:03:29.889> was<00:03:30.040> able<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.549> get

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
showed you how Aiden was able to get

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.270 
showed you how Aiden was able to get
into<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.540> control<00:03:32.019> center<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.739> hack<00:03:32.920> into<00:03:33.100> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
into a control center and hack into the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.309 
into a control center and hack into the
server<00:03:33.459> room<00:03:33.730> our<00:03:34.269> demo<00:03:34.569> is<00:03:34.780> did<00:03:34.959> it<00:03:35.079> there<00:03:35.230> in

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
server room our demo is did it there in

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.289 
server room our demo is did it there in
a<00:03:35.380> rather<00:03:35.590> violent<00:03:36.190> way<00:03:36.549> but<00:03:36.760> it's<00:03:36.910> possible

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
a rather violent way but it's possible

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.059 
a rather violent way but it's possible
to<00:03:37.480> do<00:03:37.600> it<00:03:37.750> without<00:03:37.870> killing<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.410> single<00:03:38.769> guard

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
to do it without killing a single guard

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.860 
to do it without killing a single guard
and<00:03:39.340> it's<00:03:39.670> actually<00:03:39.819> possible<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.510> do<00:03:40.720> it

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
and it's actually possible to do it

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.160 
and it's actually possible to do it
almost<00:03:41.200> solely<00:03:41.680> through<00:03:41.709> hacking
