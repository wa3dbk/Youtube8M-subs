00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:08.390
Ladies and gentlemen I give you Phantom Ray

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.700
Built in St. Louis, the Phantom Ray made it's
debut after only two years in development

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.650
the sleek fighter-sized unmanned airborne system
combines survivability with a powerful arsenal

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.500
Our customers will be able to test out new technologies
in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.000
new technologies in electronic attack and 
unmanned systems all enabled by this new test bed

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.539
36 feet long with a 50 foot wingspan
Phantom Ray was designed and developed

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:49.500
by Boeing using technology originally created for
the X-45C unmanned aircraft less than a decade ago

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.969
technology like rapid prototyping and manufacturing

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.250
Craig Brown, Phantom Ray program manager
says stay tuned...

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.120
We're really excited about
this quite honestly because

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.250
Phantom Works is back as a 
rapid prototyping house, operation

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.680
and organization.  This is the
first of what I expect to be many

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.420
exciting prototypes and they'll
all showcase exciting technologies

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.750
Phantom Ray team members say
it's been a long road to this roll-out

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.689
It's a sense of pride that we
were all able to work together

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.909
to get what we needed to get to
this point it's been a long time coming

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.000
Funding for Phantom Ray
highlights a commitment by Boeing and it's

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.130
Phantom Works division to become the leader
in the global unmanned systems market

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.899
In a day and age of aerospace risk management

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:42.290
Boeing is financing the Phantom Ray entirely on
its own with no risk to customers or taxpayers

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.670
For the first time in a long time
we're spending our own money and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.770
designing and building and
flying near operational prototypes

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.729
We're spending that money to leverage the
decades of experience we have in unmanned systems

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.619
systems that span the gamut from sea to space

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.289
The revolutionary aircraft is on target to
take its first taxi tests later this

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.090
summer and soar through its initial
flight profiles as early as December

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.560
A Phantom Ray-like aircraft that
one day could penetrate enemy forces

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.040
and provide a new specter of
security for our nation's war fighters
