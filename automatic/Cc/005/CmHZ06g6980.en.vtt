00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
know a win is more important than the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.799

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
grenade launching using cheap mechanics

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.599 
grenade launching using cheap mechanics
in<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.319> game<00:03:38.500> which<00:03:38.950> weren't<00:03:39.250> meant<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.519> be

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
in the game which weren't meant to be

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.520 
in the game which weren't meant to be
used<00:03:39.730> that<00:03:39.910> way<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.900> main<00:03:41.019> reason<00:03:41.290> I'm<00:03:41.350> saying

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
used that way the main reason I'm saying

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.110 
used that way the main reason I'm saying
this<00:03:41.650> is<00:03:41.829> because<00:03:41.859> usually<00:03:42.459> if<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:42.790> activate

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
this is because usually if you activate

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.690 
this is because usually if you activate
someone<00:03:43.600> you<00:03:43.930> know<00:03:43.989> rely<00:03:44.769> for<00:03:44.799> example<00:03:45.310> people

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
someone you know rely for example people

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.640 
someone you know rely for example people
up<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.030> punch<00:03:46.299> someone<00:03:46.600> in<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.810> face<00:03:46.900> they're

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
up and punch someone in the face they're

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.129 
up and punch someone in the face they're
gonna<00:03:47.799> punch<00:03:48.340> you<00:03:48.459> back<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.720> most<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:50.079> the

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
gonna punch you back and most of the

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.309 
gonna punch you back and most of the
time<00:03:50.319> they're<00:03:50.650> gonna<00:03:50.739> do<00:03:50.920> it<00:03:50.980> twice<00:03:51.160> as<00:03:51.370> hard

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
time they're gonna do it twice as hard

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.660 
time they're gonna do it twice as hard
so<00:03:53.319> for<00:03:53.500> example<00:03:53.560> if<00:03:54.010> you're<00:03:54.250> playing<00:03:54.370> modern

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
so for example if you're playing modern

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.309 
so for example if you're playing modern

grenade launcher and you kill someone

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.509 
grenade launcher and you kill someone
you're<00:03:59.260> thinking<00:03:59.590> you<00:03:59.680> move<00:03:59.859> us<00:04:00.099> won't<00:04:00.340> kill

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
you're thinking you move us won't kill

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
that but I find using far game mechanics

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.320 
that but I find using far game mechanics
and<00:05:03.240> getting<00:05:03.420> my<00:05:03.510> kills<00:05:03.750> you<00:05:04.320> know<00:05:04.470> uh<00:05:05.330> cancer

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
and getting my kills you know uh cancer

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.780 
and getting my kills you know uh cancer
it<00:05:06.540> kind<00:05:06.750> of<00:05:06.810> gives<00:05:06.930> him<00:05:07.110> more<00:05:07.460> see<00:05:08.460> if<00:05:08.550> I<00:05:08.610> ran

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
it kind of gives him more see if I ran

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.460

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
game am I like 100 kills warm death I

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.840 
game am I like 100 kills warm death I
won't<00:05:13.860> be<00:05:13.950> too<00:05:14.100> happy<00:05:14.220> with<00:05:14.400> that<00:05:14.580> you<00:05:14.760> know

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
cael's rather than using cheeping

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.400 
cael's rather than using cheeping
mechanics<00:05:22.530> you<00:05:23.370> know<00:05:23.460> not<00:05:24.090> there<00:05:24.990> is<00:05:25.110> so<00:05:25.260> they

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
mechanics you know not there is so they

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.930 
mechanics you know not there is so they
had<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.530> chopper<00:05:25.890> up<00:05:25.980> I<00:05:26.190> took<00:05:26.280> it<00:05:26.550> done<00:05:26.730> like<00:05:26.880> a
