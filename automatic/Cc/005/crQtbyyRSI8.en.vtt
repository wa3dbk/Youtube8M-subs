I<00:02:43.660> said<00:02:43.960> it<00:02:44.080> earlier<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.530> actually<00:02:44.770> put<00:02:45.160> the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
I said it earlier I actually put the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.080 
I said it earlier I actually put the
henna<00:02:46.090> away<00:02:46.510> but<00:02:47.500> again<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.310> like<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.820> way<00:02:48.940> it

henna away but again I like the way it
came<00:02:49.300> out<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:52.150> room<00:02:52.420> part<00:02:52.750> actually<00:02:53.020> isn't<00:02:53.350> as

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
came out the room part actually isn't as

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.400 
came out the room part actually isn't as
bright<00:02:53.860> orange-red<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.540> I'm<00:02:55.780> not<00:02:55.959> even<00:02:56.020> going

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
bright orange-red so I'm not even going

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.710 
bright orange-red so I'm not even going
to<00:02:56.890> add<00:02:57.190> in<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.580> go<00:02:57.730> like<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:58.060> usually<00:02:58.300> do

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
to add in to go like I usually do

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.160 
to add in to go like I usually do
because<00:02:59.380> i<00:02:59.590> usually<00:02:59.830> do<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.130> two-step<00:03:00.459> process

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
because i usually do a two-step process

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.470 
because i usually do a two-step process
