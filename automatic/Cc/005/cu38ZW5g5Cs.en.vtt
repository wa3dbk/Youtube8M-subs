00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.440
 nicole's high quality compact camera goes 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.080
 in the third round 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.519
 The resolution increases to 12 megapixels 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.549
 on a comparatively large scale 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.800
 Image sensor enlarges the zoom lens 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.470
 seven times the lush dimensions are 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.779
 the light intensity owed in the wide angle 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.710
 is the largest aperture at 2 in tele 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.390
 at 4 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.740
 this represents a significant advance 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.630
 compared to the predecessor p7100 da the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.059
 image quality improves slightly as 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.590
 Our measurements show very good falls 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.020
 the edge sharpness at the lowest 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.879
 Photosensitivity to image noise 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.520
 turns in the 100% view at 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.010
 screen iso 800 noticeable 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.289
 the detail faithful also convinces 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.059
 to this photosensitivity to the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.430
 Objectively goodness, there is only one 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.070
 Critical point is the visible distortion 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.960
 in the weitwinkel photo professionals pleased the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.059
 Storage option in raw file formats 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.840
 what better options in the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.120
 Post-processing offers the p7000 700 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.489
 has enough controls 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.780
 choose with the wheels on the top 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.369
 you the recording mode the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.070
 Exposure compensation and control 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.260
 different recording settings two 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.390
 more rendel wheels are used by the fleet 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.000
 adjustment the display offers a 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.430
 sharp resolution, however, waived 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.590
 nikon on the optical viewfinder over the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.350
 Internal lightning you can use external nikon 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.290
 system places control video succeeds and 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.270
 full hd resolution the battery life falls 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.790
 good but a bit weaker than 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.320
 at the precursor of autofocus 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.509
 sharpens in the wide angle sufficiently 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.509
 fast for snapshot fleet 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.340
 The p7000 700 also has picture series 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.340
 however, it is after six 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.310
 photos in a row first we finish 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.990
 my opinion the nikon p7000 700 is one 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.450
 practical and functional strong 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.520
 Compact camera especially for users 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.960
 she comes as a nikon dslr 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.540
 second camera in question 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.369
 The picture quality is good overall 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.560
 but does not reach the very good level 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.640
 the compact camera is still competing 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.640
 larger picture sensor
