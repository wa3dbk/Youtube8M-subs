for milk calculation and calculation

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.289 
for milk calculation and calculation
generally<00:02:05.200> speaking<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:06.460> occurs<00:02:07.030> when<00:02:07.180> you

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
generally speaking it occurs when you

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.199 
generally speaking it occurs when you
add<00:02:07.509> a<00:02:07.540> rennet<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.379> then<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.489> change<00:02:10.090> the

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
add a rennet and then you change the

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.240 
add a rennet and then you change the
structure<00:02:10.569> of<00:02:10.750> milk<00:02:11.170> instead<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:11.920> having

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
structure of milk instead of having

so<00:02:16.329> those<00:02:16.749> fungus<00:02:17.709> can<00:02:18.010> cause

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
so those fungus can cause

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.390 
so those fungus can cause
the<00:02:18.549> coagulation<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.599> you<00:02:20.530> can<00:02:20.680> buy<00:02:20.890> drown<00:02:21.220> it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
the coagulation and you can buy drown it

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.240 
the coagulation and you can buy drown it
in<00:02:21.519> a<00:02:21.640> liquid<00:02:21.819> form<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.510> also<00:02:23.019> in<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.799> powdered

in a liquid form and also in a powdered

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.589 
in a liquid form and also in a powdered
form<00:02:24.459> both<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.540> them<00:02:25.750> are<00:02:25.959> great<00:02:26.829> but<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.640> I

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
form both of them are great but I I

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.350 
form both of them are great but I I
prefer<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.769> liquid<00:02:30.129> because<00:02:30.280> it's<00:02:30.670> easier<00:02:31.329> to

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
prefer a liquid because it's easier to

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.929 
prefer a liquid because it's easier to
dissolve<00:02:31.870> in<00:02:32.049> milk<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:33.670> have<00:02:33.819> to

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
dissolve in milk and you have to

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.819 
dissolve in milk and you have to
dissolve<00:02:34.239> it<00:02:34.480> in<00:02:34.659> a<00:02:34.810> non<00:02:35.049> chlorinated<00:02:35.769> water

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
dissolve it in a non chlorinated water

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.280 
dissolve it in a non chlorinated water
it's<00:02:36.370> very<00:02:36.489> important<00:02:37.269> that<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.900> water<00:02:38.019> is

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
it's very important that the water is

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.050 
it's very important that the water is
non<00:02:38.530> fluorinated<00:02:39.129> because<00:02:39.579> you<00:02:39.670> don't<00:02:39.849> want

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
non fluorinated because you don't want

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.330 
non fluorinated because you don't want
to<00:02:40.739> kill<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:42.040> bacteria<00:02:42.370> in<00:02:43.000> milk<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:44.340> what's

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
to kill the bacteria in milk and what's

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.160 
to kill the bacteria in milk and what's
more<00:02:45.519> this<00:02:45.700> really<00:02:46.060> no<00:02:46.180> sign<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.540> an<00:02:46.689> available

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
more this really no sign of an available

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.530 
more this really no sign of an available
in<00:02:47.349> a<00:02:47.530> small<00:02:47.799> bottle<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:48.519> it's<00:02:48.700> really<00:02:48.909> nice

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
in a small bottle so it's really nice

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.640 
tablets and it's also quite easy to use
so<00:03:10.150> just<00:03:10.359> ask<00:03:11.109> your<00:03:11.439> cheese<00:03:12.629> supplier<00:03:13.629> and<00:03:14.019> ask

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
so just ask your cheese supplier and ask

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.470 
so just ask your cheese supplier and ask
for<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.040> strength<00:03:15.250> of<00:03:15.609> the<00:03:15.700> rennet<00:03:16.180> because

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
for the strength of the rennet because

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.800 
for the strength of the rennet because
in<00:03:16.629> my<00:03:16.780> very<00:03:17.250> but<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.760> might<00:03:19.030> be<00:03:19.150> different<00:03:19.389> and

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
in my very but it might be different and

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.660 
in my very but it might be different and
it's<00:03:20.379> really<00:03:20.650> important<00:03:21.159> to<00:03:21.250> know<00:03:21.430> how<00:03:21.639> much

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
it's really important to know how much

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.509 
it's really important to know how much
of<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.180> rennet<00:03:22.599> you<00:03:22.900> have<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.139> use<00:03:23.519> another

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
of this rennet you have to use another

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.879 
of this rennet you have to use another
kind<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:25.000> vegetarian<00:03:25.989> let's<00:03:26.500> call<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.769> the

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
kind of vegetarian let's call it the

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.650 
kind of vegetarian let's call it the
rennet<00:03:27.220> it's<00:03:27.510> there

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
rennet it's there

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.089 
rennet it's there
those<00:03:28.930> are<00:03:29.310> engine<00:03:30.310> enzymes<00:03:31.180> from<00:03:32.099> flowers

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
those are engine enzymes from flowers

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.930 
those are engine enzymes from flowers
and<00:03:33.310> plants<00:03:33.760> one<00:03:34.329> of<00:03:34.510> them<00:03:34.720> is<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:35.010> fake<00:03:36.010> our<00:03:36.549> fig

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
and plants one of them is a fake our fig

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.170 
and plants one of them is a fake our fig
leaves<00:03:37.359> and<00:03:37.629> are<00:03:38.079> quite<00:03:38.859> nice<00:03:39.250> for

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
leaves and are quite nice for

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.229 
leaves and are quite nice for
calculating<00:03:40.690> simple<00:03:41.349> cheese<00:03:41.909> artisans<00:03:42.909> but<00:03:43.090> I

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
calculating simple cheese artisans but I

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.420 
calculating simple cheese artisans but I
hope<00:03:43.389> I<00:03:43.629> wouldn't<00:03:44.290> use<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.650> for<00:03:44.949> more

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
hope I wouldn't use it for more

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.210 
hope I wouldn't use it for more

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.189 
with is one of the digestive enzymes
which<00:04:03.069> can<00:04:03.280> be<00:04:03.370> found<00:04:03.579> in<00:04:03.849> an<00:04:04.209> animal<00:04:04.659> in<00:04:04.930> young

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
which can be found in an animal in young

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:09.319 
which can be found in an animal in young
animal<00:04:05.620> stomach<00:04:06.180> but<00:04:07.180> scientists<00:04:07.780> managed<00:04:08.470> to

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
animal stomach but scientists managed to

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.189 
animal stomach but scientists managed to
use<00:04:10.329> gene<00:04:10.720> which<00:04:11.379> is<00:04:11.409> responsible<00:04:11.590> for<00:04:12.280> making

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
use gene which is responsible for making

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.409 
use gene which is responsible for making
him<00:04:14.199> assign<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:14.829> they<00:04:15.370> put<00:04:15.579> it<00:04:15.699> into<00:04:15.849> bacteria

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
him assign and they put it into bacteria

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.740 
him assign and they put it into bacteria
so<00:04:16.659> now<00:04:16.840> bacteria<00:04:17.260> are<00:04:17.729> creating<00:04:18.729> humans<00:04:19.599> I'm

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
so now bacteria are creating humans I'm

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.379 
so now bacteria are creating humans I'm
and<00:04:19.989> you<00:04:20.500> know<00:04:20.650> no<00:04:20.829> animal<00:04:21.280> is<00:04:21.459> harmed<00:04:22.180> and

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
and you know no animal is harmed and

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.149 
and you know no animal is harmed and
those<00:04:23.550> prepared<00:04:24.550> preparing<00:04:25.680> cold<00:04:26.680> something

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:27.159 
those prepared preparing cold something

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:31.409 
those prepared preparing cold something
like<00:04:28.830> him<00:04:29.830> assign<00:04:30.159> extra<00:04:30.639> or<00:04:30.909> something<00:04:31.300> like

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
like him assign extra or something like

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:31.750 
like him assign extra or something like
that

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
that

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.850 
that
I<00:04:31.790> will<00:04:31.940> write<00:04:32.150> it<00:04:32.360> for<00:04:32.480> you<00:04:33.110> in<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.440> post<00:04:33.650> and

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
I will write it for you in the post and

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.740 
I will write it for you in the post and
you<00:04:33.950> can<00:04:34.100> check<00:04:34.340> if<00:04:34.550> those<00:04:34.760> are<00:04:34.970> available<00:04:35.300> and

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
you can check if those are available and

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.210 
you can check if those are available and
there<00:04:35.960> those<00:04:36.320> are<00:04:36.470> really<00:04:36.620> great<00:04:36.890> because

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
there those are really great because

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.040 
there those are really great because
they're<00:04:37.580> they<00:04:38.330> emulate<00:04:39.370> animal<00:04:40.370> rennet<00:04:40.610> and

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
they're they emulate animal rennet and

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
is happily for about one year

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.680 
is happily for about one year
comparing<00:05:30.620> to<00:05:30.800> animal<00:05:31.430> rennet<00:05:31.670> which<00:05:32.000> lasts

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
comparing to animal rennet which lasts

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.600 
comparing to animal rennet which lasts
let's<00:05:33.020> say<00:05:33.380> two<00:05:33.710> or<00:05:33.830> three<00:05:34.130> months<00:05:34.400> in<00:05:34.520> my

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
let's say two or three months in my

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
let's say two or three months in my
fridge<00:05:34.910> I<00:05:35.150> don't<00:05:35.570> need<00:05:36.010> you<00:05:37.010> know<00:05:37.190> one<00:05:37.760> big

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
fridge I don't need you know one big

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.990 
fridge I don't need you know one big
bottle<00:05:39.170> of<00:05:39.410> animal<00:05:40.010> rennet<00:05:40.190> so<00:05:40.460> this<00:05:40.640> is<00:05:40.790> just

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
bottle of animal rennet so this is just

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.570 
bottle of animal rennet so this is just
fine<00:05:41.240> for<00:05:41.510> me<00:05:41.570> but<00:05:41.840> also<00:05:42.590> it<00:05:42.860> has<00:05:43.040> a<00:05:43.070> huge

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
fine for me but also it has a huge

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.930 
fine for me but also it has a huge
disadvantage<00:05:43.910> because<00:05:44.570> it<00:05:45.050> can<00:05:45.350> get<00:05:45.670> sore<00:05:46.670> and

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
disadvantage because it can get sore and

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.980 
disadvantage because it can get sore and
ink<00:05:47.630> can<00:05:47.990> spoil<00:05:48.410> your<00:05:48.650> cheese<00:05:48.950> when<00:05:49.700> the<00:05:49.990> when

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
ink can spoil your cheese when the when

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.900 
ink can spoil your cheese when the when
the<00:05:51.020> cheese<00:05:51.260> is<00:05:51.290> aging<00:05:51.800> for<00:05:51.980> a<00:05:52.040> long<00:05:52.220> time<00:05:52.550> and

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
the cheese is aging for a long time and

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.570 
the cheese is aging for a long time and
this<00:05:53.690> is<00:05:53.810> why<00:05:53.990> for<00:05:54.020> traditional<00:05:54.920> cheeses<00:05:55.370> are

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
this is why for traditional cheeses are

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.690 
this is why for traditional cheeses are
long<00:05:55.940> aged<00:05:56.150> cheese's<00:05:57.160> vegetarian<00:05:58.160> rennet<00:05:58.580> is

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
long aged cheese's vegetarian rennet is

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.370 
long aged cheese's vegetarian rennet is
not<00:06:00.340> it<00:06:01.340> is<00:06:01.910> not<00:06:02.240> use<00:06:02.450> it<00:06:02.660> it's<00:06:02.990> not

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
not it is not use it it's not

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.650 
not it is not use it it's not
recommended<00:06:04.010> to<00:06:04.040> use<00:06:04.160> I'm<00:06:04.850> not<00:06:05.120> sure<00:06:05.390> about

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
recommended to use I'm not sure about

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.530 
recommended to use I'm not sure about
the<00:06:06.020> chemo<00:06:06.650> sign<00:06:06.920> but<00:06:07.250> I<00:06:07.430> think<00:06:07.940> that<00:06:08.150> it<00:06:08.300> works

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
the chemo sign but I think that it works

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.900 
the chemo sign but I think that it works
quite<00:06:09.050> well<00:06:09.170> so<00:06:09.710> you<00:06:09.770> have<00:06:09.920> to<00:06:10.280> ask<00:06:10.520> your

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
quite well so you have to ask your

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.980 
quite well so you have to ask your
supplier<00:06:11.780> supplier<00:06:12.590> and<00:06:13.540> what's<00:06:14.540> more<00:06:14.720> it's

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
supplier supplier and what's more it's

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.130 
supplier supplier and what's more it's
quite<00:06:15.350> a<00:06:15.590> rennet<00:06:16.100> it's<00:06:16.340> quite<00:06:16.670> easy<00:06:16.910> to<00:06:17.360> add

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
quite a rennet it's quite easy to add

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.540 
quite a rennet it's quite easy to add
you<00:06:18.440> just<00:06:18.650> dissolve<00:06:19.040> it<00:06:19.160> in<00:06:19.280> a<00:06:19.370> non

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
you just dissolve it in a non

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.060 
you just dissolve it in a non
chlorinated<00:06:20.180> water<00:06:20.210> and<00:06:20.750> you<00:06:20.990> add<00:06:21.020> it<00:06:21.410> after

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
chlorinated water and you add it after

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.390 
chlorinated water and you add it after
all<00:06:22.280> the<00:06:22.610> additives<00:06:22.970> so<00:06:23.870> you<00:06:24.350> have<00:06:24.560> milk<00:06:25.010> you

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
all the additives so you have milk you

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.670 
add bacterias or milk if using then you

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.820 
add bacterias or milk if using then you
can<00:06:28.910> add<00:06:29.300> some<00:06:29.630> coloring<00:06:29.960> like<00:06:30.290> a<00:06:30.440> nut<00:06:30.650> or

something<00:06:31.130> like<00:06:31.190> that<00:06:31.370> and<00:06:31.550> then<00:06:31.910> you<00:06:32.390> add

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
something like that and then you add

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.620 
something like that and then you add
this<00:06:32.900> dissolved<00:06:33.650> rennet<00:06:34.250> then<00:06:34.880> you<00:06:35.030> put<00:06:35.240> a<00:06:35.270> lid

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
this dissolved rennet then you put a lid

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.000 
this dissolved rennet then you put a lid
on<00:06:35.870> your<00:06:36.400> on<00:06:37.400> your<00:06:37.460> pot<00:06:37.880> and<00:06:38.150> wait<00:06:38.600> it<00:06:39.350> depends

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.010 
on your on your pot and wait it depends

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.040 
on your on your pot and wait it depends
it<00:06:40.100> varies<00:06:40.460> of<00:06:40.610> the<00:06:40.820> recipe<00:06:41.210> but<00:06:41.390> you<00:06:41.780> have<00:06:41.930> to
