of course you have to bring all your

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.640 
of course you have to bring all your
tools<00:01:16.189> with<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:16.840> that's<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.170> red<00:01:18.409> bag

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
tools with you that's the red bag

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.560 
hanging below it weighs about 30 pounds
and<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.189> pull<00:01:22.430> it<00:01:22.580> up<00:01:22.700> behind<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:23.299> all<00:01:23.509> the

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
and you pull it up behind you all the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.940 
and you pull it up behind you all the
way<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.320> top<00:01:26.380> it's<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:27.500> lot<00:01:27.710> like<00:01:27.920> a

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
way to the top it's a lot like a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.490 
way to the top it's a lot like a
spacewalk<00:01:28.729> where<00:01:29.690> you<00:01:29.810> have<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.140> remember<00:01:30.320> to

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
spacewalk where you have to remember to

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.870 
spacewalk where you have to remember to
bring<00:01:30.710> everything<00:01:31.130> you're<00:01:31.460> going<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.759> need

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
bring everything you're going to need

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.859 
bring everything you're going to need
because<00:01:32.720> it's<00:01:32.899> a<00:01:32.990> long<00:01:33.259> way<00:01:33.560> down<00:01:37.689> once<00:01:38.689> you

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
because it's a long way down once you

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.920 
because it's a long way down once you
reach<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.110> top<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.799> tower<00:01:40.210> itself<00:01:41.210> it's

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
reach the top of the tower itself it's

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:54.010 
reach the top of the tower itself it's
time<00:01:42.289> to<00:01:42.500> go<00:01:42.619> outside

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.020 

the<00:06:05.570> top<00:06:05.840> is<00:06:06.110> in<00:06:06.260> sight<00:06:06.560> and<00:06:06.800> time<00:06:07.700> for<00:06:07.910> another

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
break before transitioning to the top at

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.240 
break before transitioning to the top at
this<00:06:16.100> height<00:06:16.160> you<00:06:17.030> can<00:06:17.240> see<00:06:17.450> 55<00:06:18.290> miles<00:06:18.680> to<00:06:19.130> the

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
this height you can see 55 miles to the

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:48.839 
this height you can see 55 miles to the
horizon

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:48.849 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:57.610 

this<00:06:49.539> is<00:06:49.749> the<00:06:49.899> tricky<00:06:50.259> part<00:06:50.289> getting<00:06:51.279> on<00:06:51.490> top

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.400 

that<00:06:58.280> object<00:06:58.760> with<00:06:58.880> the<00:06:59.000> black<00:06:59.210> top<00:06:59.510> is<00:07:00.139> the

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
that object with the black top is the

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:28.640 
that object with the black top is the
lighting<00:07:00.800> beacon

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.650 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.790 

and<00:07:28.820> that's<00:07:29.820> how<00:07:30.030> you<00:07:30.270> climb<00:07:30.660> to<00:07:30.870> the<00:07:30.900> top<00:07:31.020> of<00:07:31.530> a

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 
and that's how you climb to the top of a

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.460 
and that's how you climb to the top of a
transmission<00:07:32.430> tower
