00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
for this think it's completely dead so

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.920 
for this think it's completely dead so
from<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.550> business<00:02:17.850> standpoint<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.720> makes

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
from a business standpoint it makes

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.260 
from a business standpoint it makes
sense<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.350> me<00:02:19.470> as<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.860> put<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> battle<00:02:20.460> hang<00:02:20.580> up<00:02:21.000> in

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
sense to me as I put a battle hang up in

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.540 
sense to me as I put a battle hang up in
the<00:02:21.360> sky<00:02:21.680> shoot<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.860> guy<00:02:23.040> who<00:02:23.100> was<00:02:23.340> running

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
like maybe if they took the infinity war

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.780 
like maybe if they took the infinity war
you<00:02:45.390> know<00:02:45.480> it's<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:45.930> captain<00:02:46.440> price<00:02:46.680> put<00:02:47.610> that

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
you know it's so captain price put that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.670 
you know it's so captain price put that
together<00:02:48.000> they<00:02:48.480> could<00:02:48.810> make<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.990> decent<00:02:49.260> movie

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
together they could make a decent movie

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.540 
together they could make a decent movie
but<00:02:50.130> even<00:02:50.730> with<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:50.910> wouldn't<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.840> just<00:02:51.870> be

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
but even with that wouldn't that just be

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.460 
but even with that wouldn't that just be
the<00:02:53.550> same<00:02:53.820> thing<00:02:54.090> as<00:02:54.240> a<00:02:54.270> video<00:02:54.570> game<00:02:54.900> except

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
don't see the point of making a movie

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.260 
don't see the point of making a movie
you<00:03:27.660> know<00:03:27.690> unless<00:03:27.930> they<00:03:28.290> are<00:03:28.380> planning<00:03:28.739> on

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
you know unless they are planning on

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.520 
you know unless they are planning on
integrating<00:03:30.270> something<00:03:30.660> new<00:03:30.930> completely

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
integrating something new completely

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.660 
integrating something new completely
into<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.250> maybe<00:03:33.209> maybe<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:33.720> new<00:03:33.900> storyline<00:03:34.560> but

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
into it maybe maybe a new storyline but

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.800 
into it maybe maybe a new storyline but
wouldn't<00:03:35.670> be<00:03:35.730> better<00:03:35.910> off<00:03:36.090> just<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.480> call<00:03:36.690> it

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
wouldn't be better off just to call it

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.750 
wouldn't be better off just to call it
not<00:03:36.959> call<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.350> duty<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.650> something<00:03:38.190> else<00:03:38.310> and

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
not call of duty and something else and

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.790 
not call of duty and something else and
I<00:03:39.030> get<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.630> maybe<00:03:39.959> they're<00:03:40.140> calling<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.590> call

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
I get it maybe they're calling it call

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.229 
I get it maybe they're calling it call
of<00:03:40.920> duty<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:41.280> they<00:03:41.400> could<00:03:41.580> cash<00:03:41.820> in<00:03:42.060> on<00:03:42.150> the

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
of duty so they could cash in on the

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.170 
of duty so they could cash in on the
namesake<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:43.620> Jesus<00:03:43.950> Christ<00:03:44.250> there's<00:03:45.060> only

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
namesake but Jesus Christ there's only

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.850 
namesake but Jesus Christ there's only
