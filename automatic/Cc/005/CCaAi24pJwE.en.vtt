00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 And then it takes everything beauty, after all. 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.760
 making a video of this avoided since 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.360
 important for you and was hitting a 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.360
 chat with 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:40.960
 I went quality and pieces pulled the queue 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.960
 walk 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.219
 i 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 O 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.120
 ae 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:21.690
 then the house was okay with the guitar is 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:24.660
 It's really cool, I have Italy today. 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.210
 spectacular sound you feel the response of 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.660
 the wood you were in when you call 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.650
 Do not you feel the response of the 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:37.680
 Caldas wood finishes off a bit 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:45.300
 This is a nice aspect here to make a 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:47.729
 video you have already used I used in x5 there 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:54.830
 he has nothing else behind him than you 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:05:00.979
 Turn on the real if you pass, it's already over. 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.979
 direct from the power pulp cup 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.690
 and she 's a guitar that she does not need 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.490
 you take the day to regulate the maximum 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.900
 What are you going to do with a little passion? 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:19.120
 the ropes increase because everything I gave 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.620
 a glimpse that already comes dashed line 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:26.260
 well regulated had everything then you 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.970
 buy a guitar that already ready 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:34.660
 so it is but there you do not have this expense 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:38.110
 traffic included missed much notice 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.480
 that's when I do not know you either 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.050
 I look at the placement of the arm with the coconut 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.060
 the placement show itself not so few 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.130
 higher than the others, it is clear that 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.430
 You do not take I do not end up doing the 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:55.750
 line well but the best of breed 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:58.660
 It's still fine, it's better then I pulled. 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.390
 one of the things I do not like very much 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:06.040
 zaire was the arm that changes are thick 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:08.320
 and this is the deadline practically the 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:18.970
 Guitar Arm Stitch Your Use is 2 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:21.390
 of 2.52 euros and abroad to play a 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.390
 thing that I 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.589
 so I found it very cool 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:44.969
 Not only will this chat you have with a 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:47.579
 This is not for me, that's it. 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:50.549
 like the videos in nifty guitar to 

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:55.860
 who is still so long's there 

00:06:50.549 --> 00:06:57.869
 You can check the video of the farm. 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.569
 said that another screen box was 

00:06:57.869 --> 00:07:02.849
 dark but then I come another day and 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:04.439
 make the video because the people will do 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:07.860
 a small renovation that is good is only 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:10.289
 noise and stuff and also home 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:14.119
 by dawn was released in 2 for this 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:14.119
 the reason was
