second question from Melissa and how do
you<00:00:12.300> know<00:00:12.509> when<00:00:12.719> you've<00:00:12.840> mastered<00:00:13.549> working<00:00:14.549> on

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
you know when you've mastered working on

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.430 
you know when you've mastered working on
an<00:00:14.910> operating<00:00:15.389> system<00:00:15.599> question<00:00:16.170> mark<00:00:16.320> it

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
an operating system question mark it

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.660 
an operating system question mark it
seems<00:00:16.590> like<00:00:16.770> there's<00:00:16.980> always<00:00:17.220> something<00:00:17.640> new

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
seems like there's always something new

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.220 
seems like there's always something new
to<00:00:17.789> learn<00:00:17.910> when<00:00:18.210> exploring<00:00:18.480> Windows<00:00:18.869> Linux

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
to learn when exploring Windows Linux

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.599 
to learn when exploring Windows Linux
etc<00:00:20.900> yeah<00:00:21.900> there<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.100> don't<00:00:23.279> worry<00:00:23.460> about

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
etc yeah there is you don't worry about

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.830 
etc yeah there is you don't worry about
it<00:00:23.970> like<00:00:25.820> that's<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.970> kind<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.300> thing<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.630> noob

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
it like that's the kind of thing a noob

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.160 
it like that's the kind of thing a noob
worries<00:00:28.349> about<00:00:28.680> like<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.640> real<00:00:29.789> world<00:00:30.170> it

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
worries about like in the real world it

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.560 
worries about like in the real world it
doesn't<00:00:31.710> matter<00:00:32.120> basically<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> real

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
doesn't matter basically in the real

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.270 
doesn't matter basically in the real
world<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.020> question<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.040> solve

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
world the question is is can you solve

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.220 
world the question is is can you solve
the<00:00:35.460> problems<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.059> you've<00:00:36.390> run<00:00:36.570> into<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the problems that you've run into on a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.580 
the problems that you've run into on a
day<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.530> day<00:00:37.770> basis<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.899> if<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.110> run<00:00:40.290> into<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
day to day basis and if you run into a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.380 
day to day basis and if you run into a
weird<00:00:40.950> problem<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.670> think<00:00:42.120> you'll<00:00:42.270> be

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
weird problem do you think you'll be

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.970 
weird problem do you think you'll be
able<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.690> solve<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.200> that's<00:00:43.379> really<00:00:43.739> all

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
able to solve it that that's really all

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.049 
able to solve it that that's really all
there<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.309> it

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
there is to it

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.340 
there is to it
you<00:00:45.480> know<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.719> start<00:00:45.930> looking<00:00:46.079> at<00:00:46.260> these

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
you know if you start looking at these

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.510 
you know if you start looking at these
operating<00:00:46.739> systems<00:00:46.800> these<00:00:47.160> operating

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
operating systems these operating

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.130 
operating systems these operating
systems<00:00:47.579> were<00:00:47.910> very<00:00:48.030> very<00:00:48.510> very<00:00:48.780> complicated

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
systems were very very very complicated

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.040 
systems were very very very complicated
I<00:00:49.500> mean<00:00:49.739> even<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.329> simple<00:00:51.329> desktop

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
I mean even like a simple desktop

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.510 
I mean even like a simple desktop
operating<00:00:52.230> system<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.860> Windows<00:00:52.920> 7<00:00:53.190> or

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
operating system like Windows 7 or

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.060 
operating system like Windows 7 or
Windows<00:00:53.789> 8<00:00:53.910> or<00:00:54.059> XP<00:00:54.800> theoretically<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:55.949> you

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
Windows 8 or XP theoretically if you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.799 
Windows 8 or XP theoretically if you
went<00:00:56.219> through<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> actual<00:00:56.730> classes<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.719> it

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
went through the actual classes for it

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.990 
went through the actual classes for it
it's<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.020> 40<00:00:58.559> hours<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.280> training<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.940> for

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it's like 40 hours of training just for

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.250 
it's like 40 hours of training just for
that<00:01:00.180> client<00:01:00.420> operating<00:01:00.870> system<00:01:01.170> that

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that client operating system that

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.299 
that client operating system that
doesn't<00:01:01.559> teach<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.859> everything<00:01:02.160> that

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
doesn't teach you everything that

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.549 
doesn't teach you everything that
doesn't<00:01:02.670> teach<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.969> all<00:01:03.350> everything<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
doesn't teach you all everything in the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.620 
doesn't teach you all everything in the
registry<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.189> doesn't<00:01:05.580> teach<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.970> all<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
registry that doesn't teach you all the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.690 
registry that doesn't teach you all the
nitty-gritty<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.500> that's<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.310> like<00:01:08.520> to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
nitty-gritty of it that's just like to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.770 
nitty-gritty of it that's just like to
get<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> professional<00:01:09.750> level

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
get you to the professional level

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.270 
get you to the professional level
because<00:01:10.320> there's<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:10.590> 40<00:01:10.979> hours<00:01:11.010> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
because there's like 40 hours of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.289 
because there's like 40 hours of
training<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.270> become<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.750> master<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:14.299> who

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
training so to become like master of who

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.429 
training so to become like master of who
the<00:01:15.420> healthcare<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.869> only<00:01:16.080> people<00:01:16.229> though

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the healthcare is the only people though

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.990 
the healthcare is the only people though
probably<00:01:16.680> masters<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.610> any<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.880> these

probably masters of any of these

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.940 
probably masters of any of these

know this stuff inside and out because

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.520 
know this stuff inside and out because
realistically<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.759> most<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.360> us<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:31.409> just

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
realistically for most of us it it just

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.410 
realistically for most of us it it just
fundamentally<00:01:32.100> doesn't<00:01:32.400> matter<00:01:32.520> yes<00:01:33.210> you

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
fundamentally doesn't matter yes you

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.640 
fundamentally doesn't matter yes you
have<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> understand<00:01:33.990> how<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> registry

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
have to understand how the registry

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.649 
have to understand how the registry
works<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.520> do<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> understand<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.540> know

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
works you do have to understand you know

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.359 
works you do have to understand you know
some<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> components<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:37.920> all<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.189> kind

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
some of the components and all that kind

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.710 
some of the components and all that kind
of<00:01:38.400> stuff<00:01:38.490> how<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> go<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.060> there<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.299> edit<00:01:39.450> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
of stuff how to go in there and edit it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.929 
of stuff how to go in there and edit it
you<00:01:40.170> don't<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.100> every<00:01:41.729> little

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
you don't have to know every little

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.270 
you don't have to know every little
nitty<00:01:42.450> gritty<00:01:42.810> bit<00:01:43.079> that's<00:01:43.950> what<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
nitty gritty bit that's what we have the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.770 
nitty gritty bit that's what we have the
internet<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.759> frankly<00:01:45.149> that's<00:01:45.270> what<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.570> have

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
internet for frankly that's what we have

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.490 
internet for frankly that's what we have
Google<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:48.060> would<00:01:48.780> argue<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.470> don't

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
Google for so I would argue you don't

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.789 
Google for so I would argue you don't
really<00:01:50.040> worry<00:01:50.430> about<00:01:51.290> mastery<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
really worry about mastery of the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.530 
really worry about mastery of the
operating<00:01:53.280> system<00:01:53.729> because<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.149> other<00:01:54.270> thing

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
operating system because the other thing

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.300 
operating system because the other thing
to<00:01:54.720> know<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.960> by<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> time<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.500> met<00:01:55.649> by<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
to know is by the time you met by the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.340 
to know is by the time you met by the
time<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.850> master<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> operating<00:01:57.930> system

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
time you master the operating system

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.590 
time you master the operating system
Microsoft<00:01:58.920> or<00:01:59.670> whatever<00:01:59.969> company<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.450> gonna

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
Microsoft or whatever company is gonna

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.510 
Microsoft or whatever company is gonna
be<00:02:00.689> popping<00:02:01.140> out<00:02:01.229> another<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.310> it's

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
be popping out another one so it's it's

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.029 
be popping out another one so it's it's
not<00:02:02.729> really<00:02:02.790> gonna<00:02:03.180> matter<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:04.110> not<00:02:05.030> like

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
not really gonna matter so it's not like

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.410 
not really gonna matter so it's not like

enough<00:02:09.750> about<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.920> operating<00:02:11.459> system<00:02:11.879> that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
enough about the operating system that

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.610 
enough about the operating system that
when<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.660> were<00:02:12.780> given<00:02:13.110> a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
for that operating system that you can

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.180 
for that operating system that you can
do<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:15.870> if<00:02:15.959> somebody<00:02:16.230> comes<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.709> with<00:02:16.739> a

viola with a Windows 7 machine that is
acting<00:02:21.540> slow<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.530> need<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.830> know<00:02:22.980> enough<00:02:23.280> to

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
acting slow you need to know enough to

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.160 
acting slow you need to know enough to
be<00:02:23.580> able<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:24.000> tune<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.330> up<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.659> fix<00:02:24.900> what's
