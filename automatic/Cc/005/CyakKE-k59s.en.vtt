00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
marketplace and further to that all this

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.950 
marketplace and further to that all this
talk<00:00:50.370> about<00:00:50.399> rates<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.300> rise<00:00:51.480> it's

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
talk about rates going to rise it's

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.560 
talk about rates going to rise it's
bizarre<00:00:52.579> because<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.820> 10-year<00:00:54.390> government

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
bizarre because a 10-year government

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.439 
bizarre because a 10-year government
bond<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.140> making<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> new<00:00:56.100> low<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:57.329> it's

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
bond is making it a new low and it's

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.090 
bond is making it a new low and it's
lower<00:00:57.719> than<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.989> year<00:00:58.289> ago<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.859> lower

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
lower than a year ago and it's lower

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.400 
lower than a year ago and it's lower
than<00:00:59.129> two<00:00:59.489> years<00:00:59.670> ago<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> think<00:01:01.050> there's

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
than two years ago so I think there's

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.470 
than two years ago so I think there's
something<00:01:01.680> negative<00:01:02.100> around<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.910> world<00:01:03.180> in

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
something negative around the world in

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.660 
something negative around the world in
addition<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> what's<00:01:04.439> taking<00:01:04.769> place<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.250> China

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
addition to what's taking place in China

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.270 
addition to what's taking place in China
is<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.600> commodities<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.380> think<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.010> grease

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
is for commodities I think the grease

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.300 
is for commodities I think the grease
event<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.360> very<00:01:09.810> negative<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.860> our<00:01:10.890> funds

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
event is very negative so for our funds

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.120 
event is very negative so for our funds
we<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:11.970> more<00:01:12.240> than<00:01:12.450> ample<00:01:12.600> cash<00:01:13.140> looking<00:01:13.979> for

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
we have more than ample cash looking for

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.649 
we have more than ample cash looking for
opportunities<00:01:14.729> where<00:01:14.760> they<00:01:15.030> find<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.360> trough

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
opportunities where they find a trough

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.749 
opportunities where they find a trough
and<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.930> bottom<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:17.070> about<00:01:17.159> options

talking heads are talking about rates
rising<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:32.250> don't<00:03:32.730> see<00:03:32.970> anything<00:03:33.330> for<00:03:33.600> them<00:03:33.720> to

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
rising I don't see anything for them to

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.010 
rising I don't see anything for them to
go<00:03:34.560> higher<00:03:34.860> with<00:03:35.060> all<00:03:36.060> right<00:03:36.180> Frank<00:03:36.420> finally

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
go higher with all right Frank finally

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.979 
go higher with all right Frank finally
what's<00:03:37.260> their<00:03:37.410> touchdown<00:03:37.860> pass<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.989> will

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
what's their touchdown pass and it will

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.810 
what's their touchdown pass and it will
follow<00:03:40.290> what<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:41.160> government<00:03:41.550> has<00:03:41.640> to

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
follow what the the government has to

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.060 
follow what the the government has to
say<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.270> Fed<00:03:42.480> notes<00:03:42.750> coming<00:03:43.050> out<00:03:43.350> in<00:03:43.770> the<00:03:43.860> Fed

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
say the Fed notes coming out in the Fed

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.590 
say the Fed notes coming out in the Fed
meetings<00:03:44.520> and<00:03:44.730> we're<00:03:44.850> going<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.030> have<00:03:45.120> GDP

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
meetings and we're going to have GDP

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.410 
meetings and we're going to have GDP
numbers<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.230> think<00:03:46.620> it's<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:46.800> combination<00:03:47.360> as<00:03:48.360> a

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
numbers I think it's a combination as a

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.330 
numbers I think it's a combination as a
rational<00:03:48.900> reason<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.500> drop<00:03:49.709> interest<00:03:50.160> rates

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
rational reason to drop interest rates

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.940 
rational reason to drop interest rates
now<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:50.910> US<00:03:51.300> has<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.780> highest<00:03:52.320> real<00:03:52.560> rates<00:03:52.800> of

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
now the US has the highest real rates of

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.150 
now the US has the highest real rates of
return<00:03:53.220> rate<00:03:53.400> now<00:03:53.610> if<00:03:53.880> those<00:03:54.360> rates<00:03:54.840> drop<00:03:55.350> then

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
return rate now if those rates drop then

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.530 
return rate now if those rates drop then
