00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.530
 I went to Poland 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.320
 hit a polish is 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.549
 in it away from the organization with the 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.570
 defa like many years 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.510
 working together 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.289
 sabina makes for the svw in western Poland 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.599
 monitors work that means you 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.750
 observed in the order of thw the wolves 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.660
 in western coals too scientific 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.910
 Monitoring belongs to the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.010
 use of photo traps that are small 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.190
 well done 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.140
 cameras are hung on trees 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.480
 and with the help of an infrared technology 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.339
 trigger as soon as motion registers 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.280
 So, for example, a wolf is running 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.199
 Through the picture, this camera takes photos 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.850
 or videos on what then a very 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.030
 Good evidence is indeed in this area 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.339
 Life is another possibility 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.170
 Of course, that one looks for traces 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.920
 This is very, especially on sandy soil 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.710
 quite possible 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.570
 after Wolf's tracks the very welver one 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.450
 very typical street side and especially 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.030
 then in combination with the course of the 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.680
 track can give experts good judgment 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.100
 years must have been a wolf 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.020
 There are also possible solutions 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.939
 search and find happiness too 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.649
 That's a very good option 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.079
 if for example it is a very fresh one 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.780
 You can solve it with the help 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.030
 do a dna analysis with a sample and 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.299
 so in the laboratory of doubtless determine 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.229
 yes that was a wolf or because you 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.039
 Comparative possibilities also came 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.159
 origin or degree of relationship 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.180
 find out 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.189
 the bvb has been running for many many years 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.289
 Monitoring work by that is a whole 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.340
 important building block for an effective 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.829
 protection for the wolves 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.329
 because only if we have to know where to live 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.159
 the wolves how the wolves live like 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.479
 do we spread the we can 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.429
 public the population on it 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.469
 the shepherds can prepare for it 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.689
 keep your herd safe 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.340
 must and this works but this 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.490
 we need knowledge for one 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.490
 reliable and trustworthy 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.490
 public relation
