 Hi to everyone in this video, I 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.200
 I'll tell you how you can make super bright 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.680
 summer manicure or pedicure at home 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.680
 conditions 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.100
 I will make such beautiful nails on 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.140
 legs can be done on the hands of someone like 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.850

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.489
 cheers up 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.010
 to begin with, nails need to be covered in white or 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.449
 light varnish i take varnish which 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.449
 designed for french manicure 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.530
 And while I wither, I take a napkin with small 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.530
 patterned 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.719
 and separate the thinnest layer 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.059
 neatly cut a piece of about 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.059
 the shape of the nail 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.030
 then I drop a drop of pva on the nail 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.030
 rubbing 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.950
 after the glue dries need 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.040
 cover your nails with a clear varnish for 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.040
 nails 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.660
 this is nothing complicated for me 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.180
 It turned out the first time and our procedure 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.040

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.510
 such nails as well as ordinary varnish for 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.310
 nails 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.060
 and you can wipe them off with ordinary liquid 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.209
 song 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.209
