this<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.200> Pinarello<00:00:10.470> f8<00:00:11.130> Chris<00:00:11.790> Froome<00:00:12.030> of

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
this is the Pinarello f8 Chris Froome of

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.690 
this is the Pinarello f8 Chris Froome of
Team<00:00:12.450> Sky<00:00:12.810> now<00:00:13.320> it's<00:00:13.560> a<00:00:13.620> brand<00:00:13.920> new<00:00:14.010> frame<00:00:14.430> he's

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
Team Sky now it's a brand new frame he's

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.250 
Team Sky now it's a brand new frame he's
use<00:00:14.850> it<00:00:14.970> a<00:00:15.060> definite<00:00:15.480> but<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.750> don't<00:00:15.990> think<00:00:16.199> this

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
use it a definite but I don't think this

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.390 
use it a definite but I don't think this
is<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.500> same<00:00:16.710> frame<00:00:16.950> because<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:17.280> not

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
is the same frame because it's not

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.830 
is the same frame because it's not
covered<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.760> scratches<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.390> as<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:18.720> know

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
covered in scratches and as we know

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.359 
covered in scratches and as we know
Chris<00:00:19.110> did<00:00:19.320> go<00:00:19.560> down<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> road<00:00:19.980> at<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.220> one

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
Chris did go down the road at that one

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.760 
Chris did go down the road at that one
now<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.360> pretty<00:00:21.539> novel<00:00:21.960> frame<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.619> been

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
now it's a pretty novel frame it's been

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.350 
now it's a pretty novel frame it's been
designed<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.220> collaboration<00:00:23.730> with<00:00:23.760> Jaguar

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
designed in collaboration with Jaguar

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.150 
designed in collaboration with Jaguar
the<00:00:24.390> car<00:00:24.690> manufacturer<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:26.010> both

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
the car manufacturer and it's both

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.250 
the car manufacturer and it's both
aerodynamic<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.880> light<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.840> only

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
aerodynamic and light so it's the only

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.810 
aerodynamic and light so it's the only
frame<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.710> Chris<00:00:28.949> Froome<00:00:29.190> will<00:00:29.340> be<00:00:29.430> using<00:00:29.730> in

jag<00:00:33.810> you<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.020> done<00:00:34.140> some<00:00:34.320> neat<00:00:34.500> touches

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
jag you have done some neat touches

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.040 
jag you have done some neat touches
despite<00:00:35.730> being<00:00:35.850> designed<00:00:35.970> for<00:00:36.329> aerodynamics

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
despite being designed for aerodynamics

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.600 
despite being designed for aerodynamics
they've<00:00:37.380> actually<00:00:37.530> put<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.040> rear<00:00:38.370> brake

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
they've actually put the rear brake

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.520 
they've actually put the rear brake
caliper<00:00:39.059> back<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.600> normal<00:00:39.989> conventional

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
caliper back in the normal conventional

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.990 
caliper back in the normal conventional
position<00:00:40.710> which<00:00:41.160> kind<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.610> bucks<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.970> trend

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
position which kind of bucks the trend

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.940 
position which kind of bucks the trend
of<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.420> lot<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.780> Aero<00:00:42.930> bikes<00:00:43.290> which<00:00:43.680> would<00:00:43.800> match

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
of a lot of Aero bikes which would match

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.560 
of a lot of Aero bikes which would match
-<00:00:44.100> tuck<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.340> underneath<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.030> change<00:00:45.300> date

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
- tuck it underneath the change date

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.180 
- tuck it underneath the change date
they've<00:00:46.110> said<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.590> their<00:00:46.860> aerodynamic

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
they've said that in their aerodynamic

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.729 
they've said that in their aerodynamic
models<00:00:47.820> there's<00:00:48.329> no<00:00:48.540> difference<00:00:48.930> at<00:00:49.079> all<00:00:49.290> so

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
models there's no difference at all so

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.410 
models there's no difference at all so
it's<00:00:50.130> only<00:00:50.280> easier<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> mechanics<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.300> that

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it's only easier the mechanics in that

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.860 
it's only easier the mechanics in that
position

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
position

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.139 
position
now<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.469> other<00:00:52.649> touch<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.340> front<00:00:53.700> forks

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
now the other touch is a front forks

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.270 
now the other touch is a front forks
they're<00:00:54.360> actually<00:00:54.600> really<00:00:54.899> wide<00:00:55.320> stance<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
they're actually really wide stance a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.190 
they're actually really wide stance a
lot<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.879> old<00:00:57.120> aerodynamic<00:00:57.660> bike<00:00:57.809> she's<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
lot of old aerodynamic bike she's have a

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.260 
lot of old aerodynamic bike she's have a
really<00:00:58.559> narrow<00:00:58.829> gap<00:00:59.219> between<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.940> tire<00:01:00.239> and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
really narrow gap between the tire and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.170 
really narrow gap between the tire and
the<00:01:00.719> forks<00:01:01.200> but<00:01:01.379> here<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.309> incredibly<00:01:02.879> wide

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the forks but here it's incredibly wide

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.329 
the forks but here it's incredibly wide
an<00:01:03.510> extra<00:01:03.930> bowed<00:01:04.229> out<00:01:04.469> looks<00:01:04.860> pretty<00:01:05.100> cool

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
an extra bowed out looks pretty cool

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.030 
an extra bowed out looks pretty cool
otherwise<00:01:05.940> it's<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.780> fairly<00:01:06.990> stock<00:01:07.440> bike<00:01:07.710> dare

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
otherwise it's a fairly stock bike dare

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.359 
otherwise it's a fairly stock bike dare
I<00:01:08.070> say<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.820> full<00:01:09.180> Shimano<00:01:09.570> di2<00:01:10.080> Gerace<00:01:10.979> which

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
I say it's full Shimano di2 Gerace which

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.030 
I say it's full Shimano di2 Gerace which
is<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:12.000> know<00:01:12.049> incredibly<00:01:13.049> good<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.619> fairly

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
is as we know incredibly good but fairly

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.070 
is as we know incredibly good but fairly
standard<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.760> only<00:01:14.940> other<00:01:15.090> minor<00:01:15.360> change<00:01:15.750> is

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
standard the only other minor change is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.690 
standard the only other minor change is

satellite shifters on the handlebars but

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.670 
satellite shifters on the handlebars but
they've<00:01:24.750> actually<00:01:24.869> stripped<00:01:25.380> them<00:01:25.500> out

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
they've actually stripped them out

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.679 
they've actually stripped them out
removed<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> housing<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.210> they're<00:01:27.330> about<00:01:27.510> as

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
removed the housing so they're about as

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.899 
removed the housing so they're about as
lean<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.590> pared<00:01:28.860> down<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.310> possibly<00:01:29.670> can

the<00:01:30.420> other<00:01:30.540> interesting<00:01:30.720> thing<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.140> note<00:01:31.350> here

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the other interesting thing to note here

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.800 
the other interesting thing to note here
actually<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.250> tires<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:33.119> Team<00:01:33.390> Sky<00:01:33.540> are

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
actually is the tires of Team Sky are

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.120 
actually is the tires of Team Sky are
running<00:01:34.020> twenty<00:01:34.409> three<00:01:34.650> point<00:01:34.890> five

millimeter<00:01:35.430> tires<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.210> as<00:01:36.270> we've<00:01:36.390> seen<00:01:36.509> in

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
millimeter tires and as we've seen in

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.690 
millimeter tires and as we've seen in

absolutely zero difference from the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.140 
absolutely zero difference from the
performance<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> team<00:01:50.520> would<00:01:50.790> probably

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
performance of the team would probably

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.149 
performance of the team would probably
have<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.479> agree<00:01:51.810> finally<00:01:52.439> Team<00:01:52.770> Sky<00:01:52.920> are<00:01:52.979> also

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
running the stages power meter as you

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.630 
running the stages power meter as you
can<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.560> down<00:01:55.799> there<00:01:55.979> on<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> crank

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
can see just down there on the crank

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.370 
can see just down there on the crank
they've<00:01:57.270> been<00:01:57.390> using<00:01:57.540> s<00:01:57.689> variants<00:01:57.960> for<00:01:58.049> years
