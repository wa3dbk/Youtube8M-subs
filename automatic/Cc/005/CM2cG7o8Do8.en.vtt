that<00:01:49.350> stands<00:01:49.649> out<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.579> me<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.000> thought

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
that stands out to me and I thought

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.600 
that stands out to me and I thought
about<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.659> was<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.710> had<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.159> little<00:01:53.340> fake

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
about it was I had this little fake

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.389 
about it was I had this little fake
flower<00:01:54.299> pot<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.560> white<00:01:55.950> pot

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
flower pot and it's like a white pot

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.420 
flower pot and it's like a white pot
with<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.149> flowers<00:01:57.659> pink<00:01:58.079> flowers<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.680> green

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
with the flowers pink flowers and green

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.679 
with the flowers pink flowers and green
leaves<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.030> thought<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.540> would

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
leaves and I thought that that would

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.600 
leaves and I thought that that would
just<00:02:00.899> go<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> green<00:02:01.799> leaves<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.549> do

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
just go with the green leaves and I do

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.859 
just go with the green leaves and I do
think<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:02.939> looks<00:02:03.210> really<00:02:03.329> nice<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.750> then

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
think that looks really nice and then

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:04.220 
think that looks really nice and then
I'm<00:02:04.020> glad

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
I'm glad

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.780

these two
I<00:06:35.940> just<00:06:36.510> thought<00:06:36.660> these<00:06:36.840> were<00:06:37.020> really<00:06:37.290> really

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
I just thought these were really really

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.570 
I just thought these were really really
beautiful<00:06:37.890> and<00:06:38.010> they<00:06:38.130> were<00:06:38.220> even<00:06:38.550> more

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
beautiful and they were even more

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.670 
beautiful and they were even more
beautiful<00:06:39.180> when<00:06:39.750> you<00:06:39.840> put<00:06:39.870> them<00:06:40.110> together<00:06:40.230> and

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
beautiful when you put them together and

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.000 
beautiful when you put them together and
they<00:06:41.280> were<00:06:41.370> cheap<00:06:41.610> so<00:06:42.090> I<00:06:42.360> bought<00:06:42.810> them<00:06:43.080> and<00:06:43.320> at

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.010 
they were cheap so I bought them and at

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.580 
they were cheap so I bought them and at
the<00:06:44.130> minute<00:06:44.370> they<00:06:44.580> just<00:06:44.820> sit<00:06:45.090> on<00:06:45.410> the<00:06:46.410> top<00:06:46.560> of

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
the minute they just sit on the top of

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.360 
the minute they just sit on the top of
my<00:06:46.830> mantelpiece<00:06:47.160> over<00:06:47.550> there<00:06:47.700> that<00:06:48.270> is

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
my mantelpiece over there that is

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.160 
my mantelpiece over there that is
everything<00:06:50.370> that's<00:06:51.150> not<00:06:51.360> a<00:06:51.420> lot<00:06:51.630> of<00:06:51.720> stuff<00:06:51.930> I

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.170 
everything that's not a lot of stuff I

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.140 
everything that's not a lot of stuff I
know<00:06:52.290> and<00:06:52.800> it<00:06:52.920> wasn't<00:06:53.160> particularly<00:06:53.520> exciting

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
know and it wasn't particularly exciting

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.900 
know and it wasn't particularly exciting
like<00:06:54.450> expensive<00:06:54.930> things<00:06:55.170> but<00:06:55.650> I<00:06:56.370> just<00:06:56.640> thought

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
like expensive things but I just thought

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.040 
like expensive things but I just thought
I<00:06:57.060> would<00:06:57.120> share<00:06:57.360> them<00:06:57.420> with<00:06:57.570> you<00:06:57.750> anyway

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
I would share them with you anyway

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.690 
I would share them with you anyway
because<00:06:58.350> I<00:06:58.530> really<00:06:58.800> like<00:06:58.980> everything<00:06:59.580> that<00:06:59.610> I

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 
because I really like everything that I

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.610 
because I really like everything that I
got<00:06:59.940> and<00:07:00.150> I<00:07:00.240> would<00:07:00.390> like<00:07:00.510> to<00:07:00.660> go<00:07:00.750> back<00:07:00.780> to<00:07:01.200> Ikea

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
got and I would like to go back to Ikea

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.350 
got and I would like to go back to Ikea
when<00:07:01.860> I've<00:07:01.980> got<00:07:02.130> more<00:07:02.310> money<00:07:02.490> I<00:07:02.760> thought<00:07:03.180> that

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
when I've got more money I thought that

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.170 
when I've got more money I thought that
like<00:07:03.480> how<00:07:04.140> IKEA<00:07:04.650> worked<00:07:04.950> and<00:07:05.280> IKEA<00:07:05.610> in<00:07:05.790> general

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
like how IKEA worked and IKEA in general

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.150 
like how IKEA worked and IKEA in general
was<00:07:06.750> quite<00:07:07.020> cool<00:07:07.290> it<00:07:07.560> was<00:07:07.620> a<00:07:07.680> shame<00:07:07.950> that<00:07:07.980> it

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 
was quite cool it was a shame that it

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.070 
was quite cool it was a shame that it
was<00:07:08.280> busy<00:07:08.610> and<00:07:08.880> I<00:07:08.970> imagine<00:07:09.390> that<00:07:09.570> it's<00:07:09.750> busy

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
was busy and I imagine that it's busy

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.540 
was busy and I imagine that it's busy
quite<00:07:10.350> often<00:07:10.530> that<00:07:11.010> was<00:07:11.220> the<00:07:11.370> biggest

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
quite often that was the biggest

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.000 
quite often that was the biggest
downside<00:07:12.150> was<00:07:12.390> that<00:07:12.450> there<00:07:13.080> was<00:07:13.200> just<00:07:13.440> like<00:07:13.770> so

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.010 
downside was that there was just like so

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.470 
downside was that there was just like so
many<00:07:14.220> people<00:07:14.490> everywhere<00:07:14.700> I<00:07:14.850> think<00:07:15.000> it<00:07:15.330> was<00:07:15.450> a

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.480 
many people everywhere I think it was a

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.900 
many people everywhere I think it was a
Saturday<00:07:15.780> that<00:07:16.290> we<00:07:16.410> went<00:07:16.680> like<00:07:17.250> midday<00:07:17.490> and
