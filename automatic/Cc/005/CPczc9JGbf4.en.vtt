00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:11.690
 easier brag it's me almost two years 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:14.809
 ago did not give a damn about 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.809
 extruded polystyrene foam 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:22.410
 what is the feature of the hundreds is that here 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.300
 planochka where shoulders falls if such 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:41.840
 second building 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:41.840
 lid lower back strap for senado 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:55.980
 In short, if we touched the entire body by touch 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:59.030
 or what is other than loops and here 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.350
 made the usual 300 frame 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:08.780
 if you need to put the nucleus 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:14.280
 in half it turned out all this 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.850
 the turning mechanism is just here 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.850
 coat hanger 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:34.579
 This macro is worth 8 frames of 8 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.579
 frames 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.380
 50 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:02:07.390
 cut everything out 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:02:09.580
 the second frame frame cut all the knife 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:37.440
 now you will of course be much easier 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:37.440
 more iron running
