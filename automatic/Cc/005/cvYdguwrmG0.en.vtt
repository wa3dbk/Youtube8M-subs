00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.040 
oh just my camera doesn't want to focus
at<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.360> moment<00:02:10.739> there<00:02:11.739> we<00:02:11.830> go<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.870> looks

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
at the moment there we go and it looks

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.089 
at the moment there we go and it looks
like<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.260> did<00:02:14.610> go<00:02:15.610> off<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.970> 3g<00:02:16.800> let's<00:02:17.800> let<00:02:17.950> go

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
like it did go off of 3g let's let go

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.240 
like it did go off of 3g let's let go
and<00:02:18.280> see<00:02:18.400> what<00:02:18.489> happens<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.830> has<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.040> little

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
and see what happens it has a little

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.979 
and see what happens it has a little
circle<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.120> I'm<00:02:25.209> not<00:02:25.360> sure<00:02:25.540> what<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:25.720> means

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
circle and I'm not sure what that means

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.140 
circle and I'm not sure what that means
but<00:02:26.730> now<00:02:27.730> did<00:02:28.120> not<00:02:28.150> lose<00:02:28.420> any<00:02:28.690> bars<00:02:29.970> which<00:02:30.970> is

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
but now did not lose any bars which is

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.410 
but now did not lose any bars which is
good<00:02:31.950> they<00:02:32.950> did<00:02:33.190> fix<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.580> antenna<00:02:33.730> from<00:02:34.030> now

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
good they did fix the antenna from now

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.449 
good they did fix the antenna from now
let's<00:02:35.200> go<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.470> speed<00:02:35.830> test<00:02:41.010> there<00:02:42.010> we<00:02:42.130> have<00:02:42.160> 3

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
let's go to speed test there we have 3

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.840 
let's go to speed test there we have 3
g's<00:02:42.640> back<00:02:42.850> on<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.630> now<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:44.489> did<00:02:45.489> this<00:02:45.640> yesterday

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
g's back on and now I did this yesterday

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.780 
g's back on and now I did this yesterday
and<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.540> speeds<00:02:46.840> were<00:02:47.430> nothing<00:02:48.430> site<00:02:48.670> of

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
and the speeds were nothing site of

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.410 
and the speeds were nothing site of
impressive<00:02:49.380> as<00:02:50.380> in<00:02:50.860> bad<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.610> probably<00:02:52.120> worded

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
impressive as in bad I probably worded

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.150 
impressive as in bad I probably worded
that<00:02:52.480> wrong<00:02:52.540> let's<00:02:53.380> see<00:02:53.530> what<00:02:53.739> we<00:02:53.830> can<00:02:53.860> get

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
that wrong let's see what we can get

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.600 
that wrong let's see what we can get
from<00:02:54.910> my<00:02:55.569> house<00:02:56.069> just<00:02:57.069> north<00:02:57.340> of<00:02:57.400> Philadelphia

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
from my house just north of Philadelphia

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:05.940 
from my house just north of Philadelphia
in<00:02:58.239> a<00:02:58.540> suburb<00:02:59.340> let's<00:03:00.340> go<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.750> ping<00:03:05.049> took<00:03:05.440> 98

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
in a suburb let's go so the ping took 98

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.490 
in a suburb let's go so the ping took 98
milliseconds<00:03:06.610> ah<00:03:08.730> look<00:03:09.730> at<00:03:09.819> that<00:03:10.019> we're<00:03:11.019> just

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
milliseconds ah look at that we're just

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.740 
milliseconds ah look at that we're just
about<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.799> break<00:03:12.400> one<00:03:12.790> megabit<00:03:18.570> but<00:03:19.570> we're

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
about to break one megabit but we're

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.000 
about to break one megabit but we're
getting<00:03:19.870> about<00:03:20.049> like<00:03:20.320> one<00:03:21.780> point<00:03:22.780> 98<00:03:23.200> down<00:03:23.620> and

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
getting about like one point 98 down and

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.890 
getting about like one point 98 down and
let's<00:03:24.430> see<00:03:24.549> what<00:03:24.700> we<00:03:24.790> get<00:03:24.880> for<00:03:25.060> up<00:03:30.000> 98<00:03:31.000> down<00:03:31.209> 21

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
let's see what we get for up 98 down 21

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.569 
let's see what we get for up 98 down 21
up<00:03:32.049> in<00:03:32.260> ninety<00:03:32.620> eight<00:03:32.709> milliseconds<00:03:32.950> and

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
up in ninety eight milliseconds and

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.440 
up in ninety eight milliseconds and
that's<00:03:34.180> on<00:03:34.390> my<00:03:34.510> verizon<00:03:35.130> 3g<00:03:36.130> network<00:03:36.850> from<00:03:37.389> my

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
that's on my verizon 3g network from my

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.259 
that's on my verizon 3g network from my
room<00:03:37.840> in<00:03:38.170> just<00:03:39.160> north<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.459> Philadelphia<00:03:39.639> in

metropolitan area I'm in a suburb and
it's<00:03:47.079> it's<00:03:47.500> like<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.889> speeds<00:03:48.160> are<00:03:48.280> okay<00:03:48.639> in

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
it's it's like the speeds are okay in

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.170 
it's it's like the speeds are okay in
here<00:03:50.230> for<00:03:50.680> verizon<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.340> mean<00:03:51.790> it's<00:03:51.910> not<00:03:51.970> like<00:03:52.030> I

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
here for verizon I mean it's not like I

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.370 
here for verizon I mean it's not like I
do<00:03:52.239> any<00:03:52.450> ate<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.840> very<00:03:53.500> intensive<00:03:54.720> work<00:03:55.720> wall<00:03:56.200> on

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
do any ate a very intensive work wall on

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.449 
do any ate a very intensive work wall on
my<00:03:56.410> phone<00:03:56.799> like<00:03:56.829> needing<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.910> use<00:03:58.090> 3g<00:03:58.569> but<00:03:59.500> the

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
my phone like needing to use 3g but the
