that I found on Reeb writable this is
called<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.750> 6x6<00:00:11.090> off-road<00:00:12.090> modular<00:00:12.780> truck<00:00:13.080> and

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
called a 6x6 off-road modular truck and

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.680 
called a 6x6 off-road modular truck and
it<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.040> designed<00:00:14.519> by<00:00:14.759> d3k

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
it is designed by d3k

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.300 
it is designed by d3k
and<00:00:16.320> what<00:00:16.560> we're<00:00:16.710> looking<00:00:16.830> at<00:00:17.039> here<00:00:17.100> is

and what we're looking at here is

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.189 
and what we're looking at here is
actually<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.940> completion<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.510> two<00:00:18.750> builds

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
actually the completion of two builds

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.380 
actually the completion of two builds
the<00:00:19.650> first<00:00:19.859> build<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.369> just<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.029> truck

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
the first build is that just the truck

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.200 
the first build is that just the truck
chassis<00:00:21.750> which<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.070> basically<00:00:23.850> what<00:00:24.090> you

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
chassis which is the basically what you

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.179 
chassis which is the basically what you
see<00:00:24.240> -<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.990> bed<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:26.220> model<00:00:26.820> itself<00:00:27.480> has

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
see - the bed and that model itself has

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.240 
see - the bed and that model itself has
1900<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.310> about<00:00:30.269> 25<00:00:30.840> pieces<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.650> then<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
1900 and about 25 pieces and then the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.370 
1900 and about 25 pieces and then the
bed<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.969> whole<00:00:33.420> separate<00:00:33.840> build<00:00:34.079> which<00:00:34.350> is

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
bed is a whole separate build which is

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.459 
bed is a whole separate build which is
about<00:00:34.739> 385<00:00:35.520> pieces<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.899> truck<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.170> about

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
about 385 pieces so the truck is about

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.790 
about 385 pieces so the truck is about
1900<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.610> bed<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.969> about<00:00:39.239> 400<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.200> this

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
1900 and the bed is about 400 and this

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.250 
1900 and the bed is about 400 and this
is<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> fully<00:00:41.399> remote-controlled<00:00:42.239> truck<00:00:42.480> with

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
is a fully remote-controlled truck with

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.860 
is a fully remote-controlled truck with
power<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.950> both<00:00:44.160> rear<00:00:44.460> axles<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.210> it's

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
power to both rear axles and it's

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.130 
power to both rear axles and it's
accomplished<00:00:46.440> via<00:00:46.770> two<00:00:47.100> XL<00:00:47.610> motors<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
accomplished via two XL motors and the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.229 
accomplished via two XL motors and the
steering<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.710> accomplished<00:00:50.280> via<00:00:50.370> an<00:00:50.700> M<00:00:50.969> motor

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
steering is accomplished via an M motor

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.660 
steering is accomplished via an M motor
now<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.410> built<00:00:52.680> my<00:00:52.829> model<00:00:53.219> without<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
now I have built my model without the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.330 
now I have built my model without the
power<00:00:53.850> functions<00:00:54.649> but<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.710> think<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.100> still<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
power functions but I think it's still a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.450 
power functions but I think it's still a
fantastic<00:00:56.640> model<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.870> still<00:00:58.079> show<00:00:58.320> you

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
fantastic model and I can still show you

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.819

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.680 
its features and some of the neat things
about<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.789> basically<00:01:03.030> just<00:01:03.539> say

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
about it and I can basically just say

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.600 
about it and I can basically just say
it's<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.049> fantastic<00:01:04.769> design<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.430> highly

and it's got a switch here that you can
actually<00:01:56.260> engage<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.220> disengage<00:01:57.480> all<00:01:58.480> wheel

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
actually engage and disengage all wheel

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.930 
actually engage and disengage all wheel
drive<00:01:58.780> so<00:01:59.380> when<00:01:59.530> it's<00:01:59.650> back<00:01:59.890> like<00:02:00.370> this<00:02:00.610> you've

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
drive so when it's back like this you've

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.960 
drive so when it's back like this you've
got<00:02:01.120> power<00:02:01.420> here<00:02:02.230> here<00:02:02.620> and<00:02:02.800> here<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.400> then

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
got power here here and here and then

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.850 
got power here here and here and then
when<00:02:04.120> you<00:02:04.210> shift<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.600> forward<00:02:04.990> you've<00:02:05.140> got<00:02:05.380> cop

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
when you shift it forward you've got cop

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.410 
when you shift it forward you've got cop
you've<00:02:06.040> only<00:02:06.190> got<00:02:06.310> power<00:02:06.640> here<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:07.120> here<00:02:07.300> it

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
you've only got power here and here it

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.510 
you've only got power here and here it
disengages<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:08.350> power<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:09.130> front<00:02:09.280> wheels

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.130 

so<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.700> does<00:02:15.880> have<00:02:16.060> suspension<00:02:16.720> on<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.930> rear

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
so it does have suspension on the rear

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:25.890 
so it does have suspension on the rear
axle<00:02:18.540> like<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.660> said<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.170> live<00:02:20.380> axles<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.720> the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
axle like I said to live axles and the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.750 
axle like I said to live axles and the
gate<00:02:26.110> when<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.440> lift<00:02:26.680> up<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.980> bed<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.430> the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
gate when you lift up the bed the the

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.949 
gate when you lift up the bed the the
dump<00:02:28.200> gate<00:02:29.200> there<00:02:29.500> opens<00:02:30.040> automatically<00:02:33.959> so

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
dump gate there opens automatically so

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.290 
dump gate there opens automatically so
overall<00:02:35.470> just<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.980> fantastic<00:02:36.930> fantastic<00:02:37.930> model

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
overall just a fantastic fantastic model

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.570 
overall just a fantastic fantastic model

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
then the cab does tip forward now the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.980 
then the cab does tip forward now the
reason<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.610> see<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:45.970> battery<00:02:46.240> box<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.720> said<00:02:46.959> I

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
reason you see the battery box I said I

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.370 
reason you see the battery box I said I
did<00:02:47.260> not<00:02:47.440> use<00:02:47.800> power<00:02:48.459> functions<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:50.020> reason

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
did not use power functions the reason

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.470 
did not use power functions the reason
why<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.620> see<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.010> battery<00:02:51.370> box<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:52.030> was<00:02:52.240> kind

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
why you see a battery box is it was kind

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.920 
why you see a battery box is it was kind
of<00:02:52.600> an<00:02:52.750> integrated<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.790> way<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.209> exhaust

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
of an integrated the way the exhaust

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.660 
of an integrated the way the exhaust
pipes<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.440> stuff<00:02:56.620> are<00:02:56.800> mounted<00:02:57.130> it's<00:02:57.610> a

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
pipes and stuff are mounted it's a

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.690 
pipes and stuff are mounted it's a
little<00:02:58.060> bit<00:02:58.180> integrated<00:02:59.190> so<00:03:00.190> that's<00:03:00.370> why<00:03:00.519> but

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
little bit integrated so that's why but
