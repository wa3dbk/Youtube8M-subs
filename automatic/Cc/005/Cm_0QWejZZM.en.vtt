make<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:07.080> paper<00:00:07.200> airplane<00:00:07.880> this<00:00:08.880> isn't<00:00:09.240> any

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
make a paper airplane this isn't any

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.950 
make a paper airplane this isn't any
ordinary<00:00:09.510> paper<00:00:10.139> very<00:00:10.950> paper<00:00:11.309> airplane<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:12.000> is

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
ordinary paper very paper airplane it is

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.890 
ordinary paper very paper airplane it is
tricky<00:00:13.920> but<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.549> flies<00:00:14.880> very<00:00:16.520> well<00:00:17.570> now<00:00:18.570> there

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
tricky but it flies very well now there

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.140 
tricky but it flies very well now there
are<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> few<00:00:19.289> steps<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:19.830> here<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.430> might

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
are a few steps in here that might

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.400 
are a few steps in here that might
confuse<00:00:21.539> some<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.380> try<00:00:22.710> my<00:00:22.920> bet<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
confuse some of you so try my bet is to

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:38.299 
confuse some of you so try my bet is to
make<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:32.600> take<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.780> right<00:00:33.930> side<00:00:37.040> fold<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.250> over

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
make it take the right side fold it over

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.110 
make it take the right side fold it over
like<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:41.030> like<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.059> crease<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:44.550> try<00:00:44.820> them

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
like this like this crease and try them

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.690 
like this like this crease and try them
both<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.260> same<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> other<00:00:46.890> side<00:00:46.980> and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
both on the same for the other side and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:01:00.760 
both on the same for the other side and
try<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.930> get<00:00:49.260> both<00:00:50.149> pieces<00:00:51.680> to<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:52.800> very<00:00:53.010> sharp

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.750 

like<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:02.989> Apple<00:01:03.989> take<00:01:04.650> these<00:01:04.860> two<00:01:05.070> sides<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
like this Apple take these two sides and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:18.940 
like this Apple take these two sides and
fold<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:07.140> down<00:01:12.320> like<00:01:13.320> that

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.050 

take<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.100> corner<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.500> fold<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:23.060> all

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
take this corner here and fold it up all

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.960 
take this corner here and fold it up all
the<00:01:24.119> way<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.350> nose<00:01:28.040> take<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.250> under<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the way to the nose take this under the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.450 
the way to the nose take this under the
same<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> other<00:01:30.630> side<00:01:36.619> now<00:01:37.619> take<00:01:38.220> these

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
same for the other side now take these

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.420 
same for the other side now take these
two<00:01:38.729> cars<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.299> you've<00:01:39.450> formed<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:41.100> fold

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
two cars that you've formed and fold

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:54.010 
two cars that you've formed and fold
them<00:01:41.610> back<00:01:48.890> I'll<00:01:49.890> take<00:01:50.509> this<00:01:51.509> side<00:01:52.280> flap<00:01:53.280> here

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
them back I'll take this side flap here

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:09.580 
them back I'll take this side flap here
and<00:01:55.789> fold<00:01:56.789> it<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:58.429> like<00:01:59.429> this<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.039> have

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
and fold it in like this so you have

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.020 
and fold it in like this so you have
this<00:02:10.590> shape

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.199 

now<00:02:15.030> do<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.390> same<00:02:15.690> for<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:17.459> other<00:02:17.580> side<00:02:17.700> and

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
now do the same for the other side and

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.390 
now do the same for the other side and
here's<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.720> tricky<00:02:19.290> bit<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.709> have<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:20.010> get<00:02:20.159> both

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
here's a tricky bit you have to get both

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:31.240 
here's a tricky bit you have to get both
sides<00:02:24.049> as<00:02:25.580> close<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:27.000> symmetrical<00:02:27.360> as<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.290> can

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.729 

because<00:02:32.250> if<00:02:32.819> they're<00:02:33.480> not<00:02:33.599> symmetrical<00:02:34.379> the

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
because if they're not symmetrical the

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.369 
because if they're not symmetrical the
plane<00:02:35.010> will<00:02:35.190> look<00:02:35.370> for<00:02:35.700> me<00:02:35.879> and<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.720> may<00:02:36.930> fly

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
plane will look for me and it may fly

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:51.740 
plane will look for me and it may fly
off<00:02:37.920> strangely

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.199 

so<00:02:52.750> like<00:02:52.989> this<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:54.400> take<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.909> nose<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.790> fold

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
so like this and take the nose and fold

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.619 
so like this and take the nose and fold
it<00:02:58.390> back<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:59.860> so<00:03:00.250> these<00:03:00.549> two<00:03:00.909> flaps<00:03:01.299> are

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
it back is so these two flaps are

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:09.270 
it back is so these two flaps are
extending<00:03:02.260> out<00:03:02.730> now<00:03:08.129> there<00:03:09.129> are<00:03:09.159> some

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
extending out now there are some

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:23.000 
extending out now there are some
scissors<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:12.510> cut<00:03:13.510> part<00:03:14.409> of<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:15.340> paper<00:03:16.290> off

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.599 

now<00:03:24.209> don't<00:03:25.209> throw<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.319> away<00:03:26.379> we<00:03:27.250> will<00:03:27.430> need

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
now don't throw this away we will need

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.690 
now don't throw this away we will need
this<00:03:27.849> later<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:29.680> let's<00:03:29.920> just<00:03:30.099> put<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.670> the

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
this later so let's just put it to the

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:40.170 
this later so let's just put it to the
side<00:03:33.120> now<00:03:34.470> take<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.739> plane<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:38.940> fold<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.060> in

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
side now take the plane and fold it in

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.119 
side now take the plane and fold it in
half<00:03:41.819> some<00:03:42.819> two<00:03:43.060> flaps<00:03:43.420> they've<00:03:45.750> creator

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
half some two flaps they've creator

00:03:47.129 --> 00:04:03.760 
half some two flaps they've creator
right<00:03:48.129> here<00:03:48.370> are<00:03:48.849> sticking<00:03:49.299> out

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.410 

okay<00:04:04.770> so<00:04:04.830> I<00:04:05.010> on<00:04:05.190> your<00:04:05.370> plane<00:04:05.610> should<00:04:05.880> look<00:04:06.090> like

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
okay so I on your plane should look like

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.070 
okay so I on your plane should look like
this<00:04:07.290> now<00:04:08.150> fruit<00:04:09.150> fly<00:04:09.650> as<00:04:10.650> close<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:12.690> perfect

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
this now fruit fly as close to perfect

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.289 
this now fruit fly as close to perfect
that<00:04:13.320> you<00:04:13.470> can<00:04:14.300> need<00:04:15.300> to<00:04:15.480> take<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:16.590> wings<00:04:16.799> and

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
that you can need to take the wings and

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.490 
that you can need to take the wings and
fold<00:04:18.890> just<00:04:19.890> a<00:04:20.130> little<00:04:20.519> flap<00:04:20.940> down<00:04:21.290> and<00:04:22.290> user

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
fold just a little flap down and user

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.020 
fold just a little flap down and user
these<00:04:23.100> are<00:04:23.490> what<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.240> call<00:04:25.010> stabilizers

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
these are what I call stabilizers

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.510 
these are what I call stabilizers
because<00:04:27.030> they<00:04:27.300> help<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:28.410> stabilize<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:29.250> plane

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
because they help to stabilize the plane

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:42.399 
because they help to stabilize the plane
in<00:04:29.760> flight

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:42.409 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:44.779 

No

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
No

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.739 
No
you<00:04:45.789> have<00:04:46.059> the<00:04:46.659> body<00:04:47.529> of<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:48.099> plane<00:04:48.270> now<00:04:49.270> set

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:49.749 
you have the body of the plane now set

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:57.769 
you have the body of the plane now set
this<00:04:50.110> aside<00:04:50.499> for<00:04:51.249> now<00:04:51.279> and<00:04:54.990> take<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.460> sheet

00:04:57.769 --> 00:04:57.779 
this aside for now and take the sheet

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:18.879 
this aside for now and take the sheet
that<00:04:58.779> you<00:04:58.960> cut<00:04:59.199> earlier<00:04:59.619> and<00:05:00.509> fold<00:05:01.509> it<00:05:01.719> in<00:05:01.899> half

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:25.809 

and<00:05:19.580> now<00:05:20.300> you<00:05:20.960> need<00:05:21.499> to<00:05:22.300> cut<00:05:23.949> this<00:05:24.949> just<00:05:25.580> a

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
and now you need to cut this just a

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:34.360 
and now you need to cut this just a
little<00:05:26.270> bit<00:05:26.449> but<00:05:26.749> not<00:05:26.930> too<00:05:27.110> much<00:05:27.259> so<00:05:32.020> then<00:05:33.370> this

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
little bit but not too much so then this

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:46.629 
little bit but not too much so then this
will<00:05:34.819> form<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:36.610> tail<00:05:43.120> brake<00:05:44.120> so<00:05:44.419> and<00:05:45.639> again

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
will form the tail brake so and again

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.640 
will form the tail brake so and again
try<00:05:47.300> and<00:05:47.330> get<00:05:47.569> both<00:05:47.779> sides<00:05:48.199> of<00:05:48.349> the<00:05:48.469> tail

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
try and get both sides of the tail

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.269 
try and get both sides of the tail
symmetrical<00:05:50.379> so<00:05:51.379> it<00:05:51.529> will<00:05:51.650> now<00:05:51.830> look<00:05:52.069> like

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:52.279 
symmetrical so it will now look like

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:58.899 
symmetrical so it will now look like
this<00:05:53.229> now<00:05:55.060> this<00:05:56.060> flat<00:05:56.539> and<00:05:57.379> you<00:05:57.650> have<00:05:57.889> phone<00:05:58.189> to

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909 
this now this flat and you have phone to

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:02.740 
this now this flat and you have phone to
by<00:05:59.060> folding<00:05:59.599> the<00:05:59.659> nose<00:05:59.930> down<00:06:01.300> this<00:06:02.300> is<00:06:02.509> where

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
by folding the nose down this is where

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.279 
by folding the nose down this is where
you<00:06:03.110> stick<00:06:03.849> the<00:06:04.849> tailin<00:06:05.270> until<00:06:05.960> the<00:06:06.050> plane

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 
you stick the tailin until the plane

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.429 
you stick the tailin until the plane
should<00:06:06.529> now<00:06:06.740> look<00:06:06.979> like<00:06:07.039> this<00:06:07.219> and<00:06:08.379> now<00:06:09.379> you

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:09.439 
should now look like this and now you

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:13.029 
should now look like this and now you
are<00:06:10.159> ready<00:06:10.610> to<00:06:10.789> fly
