00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.109
 Laminated floors a great day if you want alternative to improve a 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.219
 room 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.230
 its installation requires some time and planning 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.009
 avilÃ©s its houses of laminated in columns of 3 by 4 incorporating 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.309
 plasticity so that climate patterns censor present 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.120
 to prepare the room quinteros carpet philosopher 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.060
 Measure the length and width of the room to determine the 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.410
 Laminate layout 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.000
 this will tend to expand slightly on warm days so I'll leave you a 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.210
 additional margin of half an inch 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.340
 per the perimeter of the room 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.990
 the laminate predispose perpendicular the windows to hide the joints 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.670
 the tickets 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.070
 alticor of the first and last row in the same way to achieve a 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.920
 balanced appearance 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.259
 Most of the laminated products comes with a lower layer installing the 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.420
 factory 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.950
 that your product does not contain such a layer, consult when including improvements for the 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.950
 home 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.590
 the surveys will not be necessary in the network 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.860
 of the fig tree as they will be against the wall 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.740
 use a square to expand 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.010
 the planks through the sierra in order to protect their marks 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.280
 I polite the tabs on the ends and eyes of his first row of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.670
 laminate 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.710
 Place the first two or three rows of laminate away from the wall with the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.860
 slot facing into the room 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.409
 once again check home improvement books 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.080
 June 2 and 3 said 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.430
 for more tips and give the manufacturer's instructions 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.780
 you should generally insert the tongue of the second row of laminate inside 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.710
 of the slot of the first of the year 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.130
 Press the new plank down in order to join loop 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:15.949
 Place spacers against the wall to absorb expansion space 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.019
 provided 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.959
 mosso that these spaces will fulfill them 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.090
 once the first two or three rows are placed 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.979
 you say the floor to arrange the wall in parallel 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:31.139
 a gray and a hammer and a block a piece of contaminated waste to 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.109
 level the 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.779
 when you measure the last piece of your church 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:39.790
 remember that the reinforced end must always be against the wall 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.159
 to avoid remembering the wrong end 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.409
 back to the table and mark the length of the cut you'll need to 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.629
 Isabel 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.419
 It is difficult to know much about cutting, there is someone who can cut the planks 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:55.729
 measure 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:03:00.190
 You can save the part you do not need from a fig tree to start the next one 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.560
 in case your ec length will be at 12 inches 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.749
 once you go forward you climbed one of the ends 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:12.209
 behaving like a howitzer parts of cala fig tree different measures 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:21.109
 otherwise your floor might look like a dash line is unwanted 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:24.659
 sometime 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.220
 and it is that you need pierre measures to cut certain parts of laminate around 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.219
 Hands of doors or vents 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.309
 the cobo that some debris cut from the floor next to the bed mimics the portion 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:40.289
 that it is necessary to eliminate 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:44.329
 Use a saw so that both to remove the unwanted surface 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.329
 extracting it with a chisel or screwdrivers 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:57.759
 Repeat the procedure of laying and fixing laminate on the floor 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.750
 when I got to the opposite end of the room 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.079
 life and I cut the last row so that they play together against the wall 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.189
 do not forget to contemplate the space for the expansion margin 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.449
 He referred to the spacers on the wall and insert the tongue of his last 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.449
 row in existing lamination slots 

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:29.400
 if the space left between the wall and its last row of laminates 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:34.269
 Use a hammer and a drawbar to adjust the last 

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:37.300
 plank in the corresponding slot 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.699
 once placed your laminate floor 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.219
 you can reinstall the sockets and terminate this task 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:45.639
 So save more 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.069
 that is the power 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.059
 the little dot 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:52.299
 Here you can find a reminder list of the tools and 

00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:54.679
 materials that you will need to carry out this project
