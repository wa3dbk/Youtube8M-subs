00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.690
 tutorial today we are on a 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.389
 new software called 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.130
 professional flash macromedia 8 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.800
 today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.270
 how to create a scic animations so 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.680
 here you have seen a small 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.300
 demonstration of what can be achieved 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.300
 with this software 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.430
 so here's a simple animations scic 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.910
 so here landed on those who 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.160
 interface 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.970
 so I make sense to myself and it's in 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.660
 English here again complicate on 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.660
 flash document 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:52.470
 so let's start by setting the layers 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.070
 so here in giving background 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:00.990
 so this is the back bench when we take 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:05.190
 the title and celia in good standing the solid 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.830
 So here taillon to recover 9 coster 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.120
 we will even 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.110
 zug no 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.110
 we click ok 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.390
 we will create the only 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.820
 I'm not going too much by and you just have to 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.870
 I am for 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.930
 here is now we take ten 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.420
 filling we know lucien the color 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.750
 slater 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.750
 the colour 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.080
 it can work with 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:42.280
 the grimoire in the black background 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.860
 and that's it for the cautious gall 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.510
 so here in click on celtic the icons 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.010
 there to create a new call 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.310
 property injury 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:58.020
 there we will call the stick so here we go 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.020
 animate our so what 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.530
 I'm going to do an animation a 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.650
 character falling from the sky 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.790
 since he will run until the end of 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.370
 images here it's simple you after 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.520
 you have to give some creativity to 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.490
 did not want your emotion 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.350
 so basically the pin tool here on 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.530
 select the size of our brooch 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.450
 so I take this size there and I 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.450
 start to create my character 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.800
 I let you listen to the music of the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.160

 so here after abortionists have done 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.160

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:17.110
 purpose a file 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:20.200
