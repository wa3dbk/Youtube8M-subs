confirmed<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.259> dice<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.770> working<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
confirmed that dice is working on it

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.249 
confirmed that dice is working on it
which<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.850> kind<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.240> strange<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.659> me<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.079> EA

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
which is kind of strange to me like EA

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.649 
which is kind of strange to me like EA
seems<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:47.009> gung-ho<00:01:47.250> about<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.090> have

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
seems really gung-ho about this I have

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.490 
seems really gung-ho about this I have
seen<00:01:48.930> some<00:01:49.170> internal<00:01:50.420> discussions<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.869> dice

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
seen some internal discussions in dice

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
seen some internal discussions in dice
and<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.340> seems<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> lot<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.240> people<00:01:54.360> are

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and it seems like a lot of people are

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.289 
and it seems like a lot of people are
unhappy<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:55.409> EA<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.189> forcing<00:01:56.670> dice<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.210> do

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
unhappy that EA is forcing dice to do

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.330 
unhappy that EA is forcing dice to do
this<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.719> dice<00:01:57.899> employees<00:01:58.439> do<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:58.829> want

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
this like the dice employees do not want

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.910 
this like the dice employees do not want
to<00:01:59.549> try<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.820> make<00:02:00.119> another<00:02:00.780> that'll<00:02:01.469> field<00:02:01.680> for

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
to try to make another that'll field for

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.880 
to try to make another that'll field for
battlefield<00:02:02.759> title<00:02:03.149> within<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:04.110> two-year<00:02:04.409> span

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
battlefield title within a two-year span

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.180 
battlefield title within a two-year span
which<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> be<00:02:06.210> fair<00:02:07.190> between

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
which you know to be fair between

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.979 
which you know to be fair between
battlefield<00:02:08.670> 3<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.030> battlefield<00:02:09.539> 4<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:09.869> they

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
battlefield 3 in battlefield 4 if they

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.370 
battlefield 3 in battlefield 4 if they
release<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.470> early<00:02:10.560> 2014<00:02:12.260> that

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
release it early 2014 that

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.870 
release it early 2014 that
that's<00:02:13.710> a<00:02:13.800> lot<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:13.980> time<00:02:14.250> between<00:02:14.460> games

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
that's a lot of time between games

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.570 
that's a lot of time between games
that's<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.270> rushing<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.050> ton<00:02:16.350> but<00:02:17.130> for<00:02:17.460> as

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
that's not rushing it a ton but for as

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.820 
that's not rushing it a ton but for as
long<00:02:17.790> as<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.150> took<00:02:18.390> them<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:19.080> make<00:02:19.290> battlefield

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
long as it took them to make battlefield

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.830 
long as it took them to make battlefield
4<00:02:20.070> you'd<00:02:20.700> think<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.120> they'd<00:02:21.270> want<00:02:21.510> more<00:02:21.660> time

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
4 you'd think that they'd want more time

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.220 
4 you'd think that they'd want more time
to<00:02:22.080> be<00:02:22.230> fair<00:02:22.470> though<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:24.720> Frostbite<00:02:25.200> engine

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
to be fair though the Frostbite engine

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.810 
to be fair though the Frostbite engine
is<00:02:25.560> there<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:26.160> not<00:02:26.310> like<00:02:26.580> they<00:02:26.610> have<00:02:26.790> to

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
is there so it's not like they have to

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.280 
is there so it's not like they have to
sit<00:02:27.090> down<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.450> design<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.870> main<00:02:28.020> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
sit down and design the main the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.900 
sit down and design the main the
framework<00:02:28.800> for<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.190> know<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.430> mainframe

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
framework for you know the mainframe

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.610 
framework for you know the mainframe
they<00:02:30.090> have<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.540> there<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.110> there<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.380> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
they have that there so there is the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.100 
they have that there so there is the
core<00:02:31.890> game<00:02:32.130> there<00:02:32.430> they<00:02:33.330> can<00:02:33.480> build<00:02:33.720> upon<00:02:33.870> that

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
core game there they can build upon that

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.200 
core game there they can build upon that
I<00:02:34.410> mean<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.860> might<00:02:35.190> get<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.790> point<00:02:35.970> where

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
I mean it might get to the point where

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.100 
I mean it might get to the point where
we're<00:02:36.360> feeling<00:02:36.660> like<00:02:36.810> we're<00:02:36.990> playing

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110

makes money for EA you know I don't

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.120 
makes money for EA you know I don't
think<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> lot<00:03:34.050> of<00:03:34.080> people<00:03:34.170> realize<00:03:34.710> the<00:03:34.860> last

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
think a lot of people realize the last

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.220 
think a lot of people realize the last
five<00:03:35.550> six<00:03:35.910> quarters<00:03:36.210> for<00:03:36.360> EA<00:03:36.510> they<00:03:36.840> have<00:03:37.020> gone

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
five six quarters for EA they have gone

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.350 
five six quarters for EA they have gone
negative<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:38.070> profit<00:03:38.550> margin<00:03:38.910> they<00:03:39.030> have<00:03:39.150> done

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
negative in profit margin they have done

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.240 
negative in profit margin they have done
very<00:03:39.630> poorly<00:03:39.990> I<00:03:40.200> think<00:03:40.440> last<00:03:40.740> quarter<00:03:41.100> they

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
very poorly I think last quarter they

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.960 
very poorly I think last quarter they
were<00:03:41.310> down<00:03:41.930> 139<00:03:42.930> million<00:03:43.260> which<00:03:44.190> their<00:03:44.520> stock

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
were down 139 million which their stock

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.210 
were down 139 million which their stock
has<00:03:45.270> plummeted<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.200> they<00:03:46.410> really<00:03:46.980> need

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
has plummeted so they really need

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.730 
has plummeted so they really need
something<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:48.090> kind<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.870> revive<00:03:49.410> their

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
something to kind of revive their

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.860 
something to kind of revive their
company<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.390> that'll<00:03:51.390> feel<00:03:51.540> being<00:03:51.720> a

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
company and that'll feel being a

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.660 
company and that'll feel being a
constant<00:03:52.110> revenue<00:03:52.890> stream<00:03:53.190> for<00:03:53.340> them<00:03:53.490> is

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
constant revenue stream for them is

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.490 
constant revenue stream for them is
something<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.180> they<00:03:54.360> can<00:03:54.540> depend<00:03:54.900> on<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.290> I

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
something that they can depend on and I

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.190 
something that they can depend on and I
don't<00:03:56.340> really<00:03:56.459> blame<00:03:56.670> them<00:03:56.959> but<00:03:57.959> like<00:03:58.080> i<00:03:58.170> said

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
don't really blame them but like i said

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.050 
don't really blame them but like i said
it<00:03:58.650> seems<00:03:58.980> like<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.310> may<00:03:59.490> be<00:03:59.520> a<00:03:59.700> little<00:03:59.850> bit

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
it seems like it may be a little bit

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.550 
it seems like it may be a little bit
rushed<00:04:00.390> i'm<00:04:00.630> hoping<00:04:00.990> that<00:04:01.110> it<00:04:01.200> comes<00:04:01.410> out

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
rushed i'm hoping that it comes out

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.900 
rushed i'm hoping that it comes out
sometime<00:04:02.130> early<00:04:02.520> 2014<00:04:02.970> not<00:04:03.390> necessarily<00:04:03.900> 2013

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
sometime early 2014 not necessarily 2013

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.150 
sometime early 2014 not necessarily 2013
that<00:04:05.910> would<00:04:06.060> give<00:04:06.209> us<00:04:06.330> about<00:04:06.450> a<00:04:06.630> year<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:07.680> a

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
that would give us about a year and a

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.670 
that would give us about a year and a
few<00:04:08.459> two<00:04:08.940> years<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:09.510> like<00:04:09.840> what<00:04:10.230> is<00:04:10.320> that<00:04:10.410> for

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
few two years and like what is that for

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.880 
few two years and like what is that for
months<00:04:10.980> between<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.610> game<00:04:11.820> so<00:04:12.120> I<00:04:12.990> I<00:04:13.260> could<00:04:13.770> see

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
months between the game so I I could see

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.470 
months between the game so I I could see
that<00:04:14.010> as<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.190> fair<00:04:14.520> window<00:04:14.850> it's<00:04:15.060> definitely

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
that as a fair window it's definitely

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.599 
that as a fair window it's definitely
not<00:04:15.630> every<00:04:15.959> year<00:04:16.200> like<00:04:16.380> Call<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.650> Duty<00:04:16.980> I<00:04:17.130> think

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
not every year like Call of Duty I think

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.560 
not every year like Call of Duty I think
what<00:04:17.730> they're<00:04:17.850> going<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.000> try<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.209> do<00:04:18.420> is

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
what they're going to try to do is

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.090 
what they're going to try to do is
rotate<00:04:18.810> Medal<00:04:19.290> of<00:04:19.350> Honor<00:04:19.590> which<00:04:19.920> I<00:04:20.040> don't

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
rotate Medal of Honor which I don't

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.360 
rotate Medal of Honor which I don't
think<00:04:20.459> will<00:04:20.609> really<00:04:20.640> do<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.630> well<00:04:22.370> rotate

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
think will really do that well rotate

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.890 
think will really do that well rotate
medal<00:04:23.820> of<00:04:23.850> honor<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.240> battlefield<00:04:24.660> so<00:04:24.810> I'm
