00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
exciting but let me just say that I

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.760 
exciting but let me just say that I
spent<00:00:45.130> many<00:00:45.550> hours<00:00:46.270> each<00:00:46.510> and<00:00:46.900> every<00:00:47.200> day<00:00:47.410> just

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.410 
spent many hours each and every day just
working<00:00:48.220> on<00:00:48.430> improving<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:48.970> strength<00:00:49.270> in<00:00:49.390> my

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
working on improving the strength in my

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.840 
working on improving the strength in my
feet<00:00:49.780> and<00:00:49.960> doing<00:00:50.500> thera-band<00:00:50.740> exercises<00:00:51.670> and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
feet and doing thera-band exercises and

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.370 
feet and doing thera-band exercises and
stretching<00:00:52.240> out<00:00:52.360> my<00:00:52.390> feet<00:00:52.720> because<00:00:52.900> my<00:00:53.110> feet

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
stretching out my feet because my feet

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.010 
stretching out my feet because my feet
are<00:00:53.500> naturally<00:00:54.490> very<00:00:54.910> stiff<00:00:55.360> and<00:00:55.540> inflexible

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
are naturally very stiff and inflexible

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.200 
are naturally very stiff and inflexible
and<00:00:56.530> very<00:00:56.830> weak<00:00:57.130> as<00:00:57.340> well<00:00:57.610> so<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.910> reason<00:00:58.180> that

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
and very weak as well so the reason that

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.910 
and very weak as well so the reason that
I<00:00:58.330> was<00:00:58.480> able<00:00:58.600> to<00:00:58.720> go<00:00:58.870> on<00:00:58.960> point<00:00:59.230> so<00:00:59.440> quickly<00:00:59.829> is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
I was able to go on point so quickly is

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.069 
I was able to go on point so quickly is
because<00:00:59.950> I<00:01:00.310> put<00:01:00.340> a<00:01:00.550> lot<00:01:00.940> and<00:01:01.240> a<00:01:01.300> lot<00:01:01.570> of<00:01:01.780> hard

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
because I put a lot and a lot of hard

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.020 
because I put a lot and a lot of hard
work<00:01:02.230> into<00:01:02.800> it<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:02.920> I<00:01:03.130> practice<00:01:03.610> every<00:01:04.000> single

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
work into it and I practice every single

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.030 
work into it and I practice every single
day<00:01:04.329> outside<00:01:04.930> of<00:01:05.019> class<00:01:05.229> and<00:01:05.500> I<00:01:05.560> also<00:01:05.740> worked

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
day outside of class and I also worked

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.220 
day outside of class and I also worked
as<00:01:06.190> hard<00:01:06.430> as<00:01:06.580> I<00:01:07.060> possibly<00:01:07.540> could<00:01:07.780> in<00:01:07.990> every

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
as hard as I possibly could in every

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.960 
as hard as I possibly could in every
single<00:01:08.530> class<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:08.950> also<00:01:09.190> I<00:01:09.220> was<00:01:09.400> much<00:01:09.610> older

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
single class and also I was much older

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.640 
single class and also I was much older
so<00:01:10.120> my<00:01:10.240> bones<00:01:10.450> were<00:01:10.690> pretty<00:01:10.960> much<00:01:11.080> completely

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
so my bones were pretty much completely

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.380 
so my bones were pretty much completely
formed<00:01:12.130> and<00:01:12.370> hardened<00:01:12.790> so<00:01:12.940> they<00:01:13.060> were<00:01:13.120> ready

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
formed and hardened so they were ready

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.820 
formed and hardened so they were ready
to<00:01:13.510> go<00:01:13.720> on<00:01:13.840> point<00:01:14.110> so<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.380> was<00:01:14.470> just<00:01:14.650> a<00:01:14.710> matter

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
to go on point so it was just a matter

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.230 
to go on point so it was just a matter
of<00:01:14.950> building<00:01:15.310> up<00:01:15.400> strength<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:15.940> getting<00:01:16.120> my

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
of building up strength and getting my

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.790 
of building up strength and getting my
feet<00:01:16.510> and<00:01:16.659> my<00:01:16.750> ankles<00:01:17.140> strong<00:01:17.470> enough<00:01:17.650> if

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
feet and my ankles strong enough if

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.350 
feet and my ankles strong enough if
you're<00:01:17.950> interested<00:01:18.430> in<00:01:18.520> seeing<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:18.909> specific

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
and build up the strength as quickly as

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.200 
and build up the strength as quickly as
I<00:01:23.320> possibly<00:01:23.770> could<00:01:24.010> you<00:01:24.370> can<00:01:24.550> watch<00:01:24.729> all<00:01:24.940> these

point faster and let me just say that

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.290 
point faster and let me just say that
definitely<00:02:00.100> patience<00:02:00.909> is

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
definitely patience is

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.790 
definitely patience is
key<00:02:01.420> when<00:02:01.690> it<00:02:01.720> comes<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:02.200> getting<00:02:02.380> your<00:02:02.500> pointe

actually<00:02:53.140> they<00:02:53.290> were<00:02:53.350> not<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.650> good<00:02:54.070> fit<00:02:54.280> for<00:02:54.340> my

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
actually they were not a good fit for my

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.610 
actually they were not a good fit for my
feet<00:02:54.820> at<00:02:55.000> all<00:02:55.210> because<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.720> had<00:02:55.870> flat<00:02:56.110> feet<00:02:56.140> and

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
feet at all because I had flat feet and

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.200 
feet at all because I had flat feet and
they're<00:02:56.740> not<00:02:56.860> very<00:02:56.920> flexible<00:02:57.520> at<00:02:57.610> all<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:58.060> the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
they're not very flexible at all so the

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.630 
they're not very flexible at all so the
longer<00:02:58.660> box<00:02:58.900> made<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.320> very<00:02:59.560> very<00:03:00.100> hard<00:03:00.430> for<00:03:00.490> me

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
longer box made it very very hard for me

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.670 
longer box made it very very hard for me
