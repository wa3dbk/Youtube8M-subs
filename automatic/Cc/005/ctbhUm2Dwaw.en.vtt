00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.590
 with them a lot and bad 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.840
 if you analyze we have our shopping carts we would see that we filled with 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.350
 foods rich in carbohydrates proteins and lipids that our 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.439
 organism does not spend 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.159
 It is a great energy contribution for our body and sedentary life 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.169
 that we carry the most makes us not all that energy 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.299
 for the first time in history in the western world there are more people with 

00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:28.299
 overweight problems that people in your case 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.750
 port prince united states is already a 60 percent obesity classic 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.230
 is overweight and in 31 are things 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.510
 eat a lot of mantilla tim little exercise 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.290
 that is the american way of the five and globalization has made it spread 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.290
 all over the planet 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.530
 in Spain, obesity is a problem 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.900
 According to public authorities, 15% of Spaniards are obese 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.740
 if we also add the people who are overweight it turns out that more than half 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.740
 of the Spaniards eat others 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.040
 and the worst of all is that we are incubating obese 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.640
 Spain is the European country with the most obese children with 16% 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.300
 in your diet and too many fats few vegetables and fruits and especially eat 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.320
 a lot between meals 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.869
 bed bugs and jewelry are their downfall 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.869
 and instead of drinking water they drink sugary refreshing drinks 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.270
 An example 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.190
 let's review the diet of a 10-year-old child 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.350
 needs about 2,200 kilocalories a day 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.080
 let's imagine that taking 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.430
 a can of soda that are 130 kilos calories 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.380
 contrast with a contribution of 300 kilocalories 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.680
 a small appetizer judge with 200 kilocalories and a handful of sweets 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.870
 with 120 kilos Canary 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.869
 In total it will have taken 750 kilos calories 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.389
 a third of what you need a day and you still have to add the remains 

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:56.530
 of food 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.299
 if every day he takes this for sure he will have plenty of kilocalories 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.240
 surely we do not get to burn because today children are 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.710
 increasingly quiet 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.920
 they pass over the front of the TV and the computer without moving 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.129
 and you can say that the TV fattening 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:18.249
 We are also exporting this lifestyle to countries in the process of 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.409
 developing 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.739
 but as they struggle to end hunger at the same time they face 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.739
 obesity opposite problem 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.099
 more and more people live in cities because in the countryside they can not earn 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.269
 lifetime 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.489
 Komen the same fatty food as the accident and give him the same drinks 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.559
 sweetened because it is also fashionable 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.559
 they have also become as sedentary as we are 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.489
 It is estimated that the least developed countries could have no more 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.489
 less than about 115 million pesos 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.009
 and the worst is that obesity is another model of malnutrition 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:02.709
 although some poor people are overweight that does not mean that 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.319
 are better fed obesity often covers consumption deficiencies 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.319
 of vitamins and minerals 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.549
 taking stock the statistics say that in the world there are so many people that 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.889
 they go hungry like overweight people 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.120
 a billion people go hungry 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.650
 another billion are overweight and 300 million are obese 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:26.839
 they are figures to reflect
