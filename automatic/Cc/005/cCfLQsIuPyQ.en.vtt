it<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.479> like<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.839> have<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> chip<00:00:46.320> chart<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.040> chip

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it I like to have a chip chart the chip

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.369 
it I like to have a chip chart the chip
chart<00:00:47.489> basically<00:00:47.729> has<00:00:48.210> three<00:00:48.239> values<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.230> this

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
chart basically has three values on this

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.729 
chart basically has three values on this
one<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:49.920> got<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> 100%<00:00:51.090> white<00:00:51.269> a<00:00:51.570> 50%<00:00:52.500> gray<00:00:52.710> and

we're going to light this we've got a

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.099 
we're going to light this we've got a
softbox<00:00:58.440> set<00:00:58.739> up<00:00:58.859> here<00:00:59.100> very<00:00:59.760> frontal<00:01:00.420> flat

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
softbox set up here very frontal flat

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.470 
softbox set up here very frontal flat
lighting<00:01:01.440> try<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.219> get<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:02.429> many<00:01:02.670> values<00:01:02.879> as

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
lighting try and get as many values as

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.150 
lighting try and get as many values as
possible<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> straight<00:01:04.440> bouncing<00:01:05.039> off

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
possible to straight bouncing off

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.310 
possible to straight bouncing off
directly<00:01:05.729> into<00:01:05.970> our<00:01:06.060> camera<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:07.050> we've<00:01:07.200> got

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
directly into our camera here we've got

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.770 
directly into our camera here we've got
a<00:01:07.380> hv<00:01:07.890> X<00:01:08.039> 200<00:01:08.550> which<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.240> case<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.659> going

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
a hv X 200 which in this case is going

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.180 
a hv X 200 which in this case is going
to<00:01:09.840> make<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.140> process<00:01:10.440> a<00:01:10.710> little<00:01:10.920> bit<00:01:11.070> more

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
to make this process a little bit more

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.460 
to make this process a little bit more
easier<00:01:11.820> we've<00:01:12.270> got<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.509> brevis<00:01:12.929> on<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> front

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
easier we've got a brevis on the front

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.230 
easier we've got a brevis on the front
and<00:01:13.740> we've<00:01:14.429> got<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:15.119> Zeiss<00:01:16.050> one-point<00:01:16.880> 385<00:01:17.880> lens

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
and we've got a Zeiss one-point 385 lens

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.410 
and we've got a Zeiss one-point 385 lens
on<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.569> front<00:01:18.600> via<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.619> PL<00:01:19.950> mount<00:01:20.220> adapter<00:01:20.429> so

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
on the front via the PL mount adapter so

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.850 
on the front via the PL mount adapter so
what<00:01:21.600> we're<00:01:21.750> going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.960> do<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.500> we're<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.410 
what we're going to do is we're going to
start<00:01:23.220> by<00:01:23.369> determining<00:01:23.579> the<00:01:24.149> correct

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
start by determining the correct

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.050 
start by determining the correct
exposure<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.350> our<00:01:25.409> camera<00:01:26.009> using<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.579> 50%

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
exposure for our camera using the 50%

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.990 
exposure for our camera using the 50%
gray<00:01:27.689> chip<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> center<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.799> our<00:01:28.890> chart<00:01:29.340> now

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
gray chip in the center of our chart now

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.490 
gray chip in the center of our chart now
there's<00:01:30.210> two<00:01:30.479> different<00:01:30.509> ways<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.320> this

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
there's two different ways to do this

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.560 
there's two different ways to do this
and<00:01:31.649> I'm<00:01:31.740> going<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.920> show<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.040> both<00:01:32.340> methods

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
and I'm going to show you both methods

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.660 
and I'm going to show you both methods
the<00:01:33.570> first<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> hv<00:01:34.710> X<00:01:34.829> 200<00:01:35.399> we<00:01:35.520> can

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the first is on the hv X 200 we can

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.459 
the first is on the hv X 200 we can
actually<00:01:36.030> use<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.390> built-in<00:01:36.780> spot<00:01:37.229> meter

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
actually use the built-in spot meter

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.709 
actually use the built-in spot meter
function<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.549> read<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> value<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> great

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
function to read the value of the great

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.959 
function to read the value of the great
chip<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.710> I've<00:01:40.799> already<00:01:41.100> got<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.280> set<00:01:41.579> up<00:01:41.640> and

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
chip so I've already got it set up and

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.370 
chip so I've already got it set up and
if<00:01:42.030> you'll<00:01:42.149> look<00:01:42.210> right<00:01:42.570> here<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:43.140> see

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
if you'll look right here you can see

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.010 
if you'll look right here you can see
that<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.860> center<00:01:44.549> marker<00:01:45.149> right<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:45.390> that's

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that the center marker right here that's

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.240 
that the center marker right here that's
where<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.469> to<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:46.619> reading<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> light

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
where it's going to be reading the light

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.920 
where it's going to be reading the light
from<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.969> you<00:01:48.060> looked<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.420> bottom<00:01:48.750> left

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
from if you looked in the bottom left

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.620 
from if you looked in the bottom left
you<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.110> see<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.350> value<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.860> 14%<00:01:50.549> that's<00:01:51.270> 50%

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
you can see the value is 14% that's 50%

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.289 
you can see the value is 14% that's 50%
gray<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:52.950> want<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.250> raise<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.700> value<00:01:54.090> to

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
gray so we want to raise this value to

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.999 
gray so we want to raise this value to
match<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.810> value<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.350> center<00:01:55.710> chip

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
match the value of that center chip

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.560 
match the value of that center chip
we're<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:56.789> to<00:01:56.850> open<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.299> aperture

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
we're just going to open the aperture

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.240 
we're just going to open the aperture
until<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.200> reads<00:01:58.409> 50%<00:01:59.280> or<00:01:59.430> 49<00:02:01.130> sometimes<00:02:02.130> on

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
until that reads 50% or 49 sometimes on

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.800 
until that reads 50% or 49 sometimes on
these<00:02:02.340> cameras<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:02.880> hard<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.210> get<00:02:03.359> it<00:02:03.450> 100%

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
these cameras it's hard to get it 100%

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.599 
these cameras it's hard to get it 100%
exact<00:02:04.350> but<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.859> it<00:02:04.950> within<00:02:05.070> one<00:02:05.189> point

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
exact but if you get it within one point

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.550 
exact but if you get it within one point
Ayari<00:02:06.119> that's<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.020> be<00:02:07.109> pretty<00:02:07.350> close

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
Ayari that's going to be pretty close

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.609 
Ayari that's going to be pretty close
alright<00:02:08.519> so<00:02:09.000> we've<00:02:09.119> got<00:02:09.269> a<00:02:09.299> 50%<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:10.380> reading

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
alright so we've got a 50% here reading

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.890 
alright so we've got a 50% here reading
that<00:02:10.859> center<00:02:11.250> chip<00:02:11.609> and<00:02:11.850> it<00:02:12.510> shows<00:02:12.750> our

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
that center chip and it shows our

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.670 
that center chip and it shows our
exposure<00:02:13.320> as<00:02:13.739> being<00:02:14.250> f/4<00:02:15.140> problem<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.290> what<00:02:16.590> if

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
exposure as being f/4 problem is what if

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.080 
exposure as being f/4 problem is what if
you've<00:02:16.799> got<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> camera<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.549> doesn't<00:02:17.880> have<00:02:18.060> a

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
you've got a camera that doesn't have a

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.000 
you've got a camera that doesn't have a
spot<00:02:18.420> meter<00:02:18.660> built-in<00:02:19.230> are<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.560> out<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.709> luck

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
to do that first of all I'm gonna roll

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.170 
to do that first of all I'm gonna roll
the<00:02:35.750> aperture<00:02:36.170> back<00:02:36.380> down<00:02:38.110> over<00:02:39.110> here<00:02:39.440> on<00:02:39.500> our

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
the aperture back down over here on our

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.240 
the aperture back down over here on our
laptop<00:02:41.180> we've<00:02:42.020> got<00:02:42.170> our<00:02:42.260> scopes<00:02:42.620> open<00:02:43.040> and

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
laptop we've got our scopes open and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.290 
laptop we've got our scopes open and
we're<00:02:43.370> reading<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.760> signal<00:02:44.090> through<00:02:44.270> the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
we're reading the signal through the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.390 
we're reading the signal through the
firewire<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.050> you<00:02:45.440> can<00:02:45.620> see<00:02:45.830> here<00:02:46.069> we've<00:02:46.220> got

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
firewire and you can see here we've got

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.890 
firewire and you can see here we've got
through<00:02:46.700> our<00:02:46.819> three<00:02:47.090> different<00:02:47.209> chips<00:02:47.690> this

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
through our three different chips this

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.570 
through our three different chips this
would<00:02:48.080> be<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.410> lowest<00:02:48.590> one<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.220> charts

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
would be the lowest one and the charts

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.699 
would be the lowest one and the charts
going<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.819> be<00:02:49.910> your<00:02:50.060> black<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:51.260> middle<00:02:51.560> ones

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
going to be your black the middle ones

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.410 
going to be your black the middle ones
going<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:51.980> be<00:02:52.069> your<00:02:52.190> gray<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.790> you're<00:02:53.239> going

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
going to be your gray and you're going

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.670 
going to be your gray and you're going
to<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.660> furthest<00:02:54.019> right<00:02:54.200> is<00:02:54.349> going<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.590> be

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
to the furthest right is going to be

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.550 
to the furthest right is going to be
your<00:02:54.860> white<00:02:55.330> so<00:02:56.330> using<00:02:56.690> our<00:02:56.780> scopes<00:02:57.260> we're

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
your white so using our scopes we're

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.170 
your white so using our scopes we're
going<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:57.980> read<00:02:58.190> our<00:02:58.340> measurement<00:02:58.880> until<00:02:59.090> we

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
going to read our measurement until we

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.120 
going to read our measurement until we
get<00:02:59.300> 50%<00:02:59.690> on<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.290> gray<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.680> I'm<00:03:00.800> just<00:03:00.980> gonna

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
get 50% on the gray and I'm just gonna

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.670 
get 50% on the gray and I'm just gonna
once<00:03:01.880> again<00:03:02.180> open<00:03:02.660> this<00:03:02.780> aperture<00:03:03.080> back<00:03:03.410> up

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
once again open this aperture back up

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.490 
once again open this aperture back up
real<00:03:04.430> slowly<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.209> as<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:05.780> do<00:03:05.989> it<00:03:06.290> you're<00:03:06.410> gonna

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
real slowly and as I do it you're gonna

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.610 
real slowly and as I do it you're gonna
see<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:07.010> center<00:03:07.430> gray<00:03:07.730> chip<00:03:08.060> rise<00:03:08.810> up<00:03:09.140> this<00:03:09.470> is

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
see the center gray chip rise up this is

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.979 
see the center gray chip rise up this is
the<00:03:09.739> 50%<00:03:10.220> mark<00:03:10.549> right<00:03:10.970> across<00:03:11.209> here<00:03:11.600> we're

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
the 50% mark right across here we're

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.360 
the 50% mark right across here we're
looking<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.410> center<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:12.890> or<00:03:13.100> put<00:03:13.250> it

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
looking to center that or put it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.520 
looking to center that or put it
slightly<00:03:13.489> above<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.090> line<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:15.200> I'm<00:03:15.349> just

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
slightly above that line so I'm just

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.160 
slightly above that line so I'm just
gonna<00:03:15.680> roll<00:03:15.860> it<00:03:16.069> until<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.819> Center<00:03:17.120> chip<00:03:17.420> is

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
gonna roll it until that Center chip is

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.460 
gonna roll it until that Center chip is
just<00:03:18.709> above<00:03:19.930> probably<00:03:20.930> somewhere<00:03:21.230> along

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
just above probably somewhere along

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.210 
just above probably somewhere along
there<00:03:22.480> so<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:23.660> would<00:03:23.780> confirm<00:03:24.230> for<00:03:24.470> me<00:03:24.500> that

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
there so that would confirm for me that

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.250 
there so that would confirm for me that
I've<00:03:25.310> accurately<00:03:26.120> placed<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.599> exposure<00:03:27.049> of

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
I've accurately placed the exposure of

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.820 
I've accurately placed the exposure of
that<00:03:27.410> chip<00:03:27.769> on<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.549> 50%<00:03:29.090> mark<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:30.319> next<00:03:30.530> step

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
that chip on the 50% mark the next step

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.820 
that chip on the 50% mark the next step
is<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.130> just<00:03:31.340> check<00:03:31.580> on<00:03:31.790> my<00:03:31.880> camera<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:33.110> I<00:03:33.799> can

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
is to just check on my camera and I can

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.699 
is to just check on my camera and I can
see<00:03:34.250> that<00:03:34.430> it's<00:03:34.609> at<00:03:34.730> f/4<00:03:35.269> which<00:03:36.049> is<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.350> exact

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
see that it's at f/4 which is the exact

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.650 
see that it's at f/4 which is the exact
same<00:03:36.920> exposure<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:37.579> we<00:03:37.640> got<00:03:37.850> using<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.329> spot

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
same exposure that we got using the spot

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.680 
same exposure that we got using the spot
meter<00:03:38.930> on<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.340> HVX<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:41.120> now<00:03:41.299> we've<00:03:41.480> got<00:03:41.660> our

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
meter on the HVX so now we've got our

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.349 
meter on the HVX so now we've got our
camera's<00:03:42.170> exposure<00:03:42.290> set<00:03:43.040> correctly<00:03:43.820> for<00:03:44.269> the

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
camera's exposure set correctly for the

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.660 
camera's exposure set correctly for the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
center gray chip the next step is to set

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.210 
center gray chip the next step is to set
the<00:03:46.700> light<00:03:46.970> meter<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:48.500> do<00:03:48.650> this<00:03:48.769> exercise

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
the light meter to do this exercise

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.069 
the light meter to do this exercise
correctly<00:03:49.459> you're<00:03:50.180> going<00:03:50.299> to<00:03:50.359> need<00:03:50.569> a<00:03:50.840> light

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
correctly you're going to need a light

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.660 
correctly you're going to need a light

that's<00:04:12.769> incorrect<00:04:13.370> we've<00:04:13.880> got<00:04:14.090> our<00:04:14.180> HDX<00:04:14.569> 200

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
that's incorrect we've got our HDX 200

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.440 
that's incorrect we've got our HDX 200
to<00:04:15.079> suit<00:04:15.290> 24p<00:04:15.950> so<00:04:16.579> we're<00:04:16.789> going<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.030> adjust<00:04:17.299> a

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
to suit 24p so we're going to adjust a

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.440 
to suit 24p so we're going to adjust a
frame<00:04:17.690> rate<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:18.109> 24<00:04:19.070> frames<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.489> second<00:04:19.940> once

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
next piece of information you need is

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.690 
next piece of information you need is
the<00:04:23.630> shutter<00:04:23.900> speed<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.440> sekonic<00:04:25.130> 608

defaults to 180 degree shutter angle
what's<00:04:28.430> incidentally<00:04:29.120> we<00:04:29.270> have<00:04:29.419> set<00:04:29.750> up<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:29.900> be

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
what's incidentally we have set up to be

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.500 
what's incidentally we have set up to be
the<00:04:30.260> exact<00:04:30.650> same<00:04:30.919> as<00:04:31.190> our<00:04:31.400> 180<00:04:31.970> degree<00:04:32.240> shutter

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
the exact same as our 180 degree shutter

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.740 
the exact same as our 180 degree shutter
on<00:04:32.720> our<00:04:33.200> HVX<00:04:33.740> 200<00:04:34.340> there<00:04:34.970> are<00:04:35.060> different<00:04:35.510> frame

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
on our HVX 200 there are different frame

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.270 
on our HVX 200 there are different frame
rates<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:36.229> shutter<00:04:36.560> angles<00:04:36.979> that<00:04:37.100> you<00:04:37.160> can

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
rates and shutter angles that you can

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.399 
rates and shutter angles that you can
use<00:04:37.669> and<00:04:37.910> you<00:04:37.940> may<00:04:38.389> have<00:04:38.599> to<00:04:38.750> consult<00:04:39.169> your

use and you may have to consult your

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.260 
use and you may have to consult your
light<00:04:39.710> meters<00:04:40.039> manual<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.909> set<00:04:41.120> them<00:04:41.240> up

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
light meters manual to set them up

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.000 
light meters manual to set them up
correctly<00:04:41.630> with<00:04:41.810> your<00:04:41.960> particular<00:04:42.289> camera

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
correctly with your particular camera

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.800 
correctly with your particular camera
the<00:04:43.669> next<00:04:43.909> step<00:04:44.090> is<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.390> take

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
the next step is to take

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.720 
the next step is to take
a<00:04:44.870> spot<00:04:45.350> meter<00:04:45.620> reading<00:04:46.040> using<00:04:46.220> this<00:04:46.460> light

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
a spot meter reading using this light

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.790 
a spot meter reading using this light
meter<00:04:46.970> off<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.480> 50%<00:04:47.900> gray<00:04:48.290> so<00:04:48.650> we're<00:04:48.770> just

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
meter off the 50% gray so we're just

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.990 
meter off the 50% gray so we're just
going<00:04:49.010> to<00:04:49.100> change<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.460> from<00:04:49.490> an<00:04:49.700> incident

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
going to change it from an incident

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.570 
going to change it from an incident
meter<00:04:50.330> to<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.139> reflected<00:04:51.740> spot<00:04:52.040> meter<00:04:52.340> and

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
meter to a reflected spot meter and

00:04:52.580 --> 00:05:01.300 
meter to a reflected spot meter and
we're<00:04:52.669> going<00:04:52.820> to<00:04:52.880> take<00:04:53.060> our<00:04:53.210> reading<00:04:58.270> okay<00:05:00.310> at

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
we're going to take our reading okay at

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.100 
we're going to take our reading okay at
24<00:05:01.820> frames<00:05:02.030> a<00:05:02.270> second<00:05:02.660> we're<00:05:02.780> getting<00:05:03.050> a

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
24 frames a second we're getting a

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.879 
24 frames a second we're getting a
reading<00:05:03.320> of<00:05:03.560> f28<00:05:04.370> which<00:05:05.150> is<00:05:05.330> much<00:05:05.780> lower<00:05:06.530> than

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
reading of f28 which is much lower than

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.830 
reading of f28 which is much lower than
the<00:05:07.250> f4<00:05:07.700> that<00:05:07.880> we're<00:05:08.000> getting<00:05:08.240> on<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.360> camera

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
the f4 that we're getting on the camera

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.050 
the f4 that we're getting on the camera
so<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:09.710> calibrate<00:05:10.100> them<00:05:10.280> correctly<00:05:10.669> all<00:05:10.910> we're

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
so to calibrate them correctly all we're

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.400 
so to calibrate them correctly all we're
going<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:11.240> do<00:05:11.419> is<00:05:11.540> we're<00:05:11.660> going<00:05:11.750> to<00:05:11.810> dial<00:05:12.169> in

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
going to do is we're going to dial in

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.940 
going to do is we're going to dial in
the<00:05:12.530> ISO<00:05:13.130> speeds<00:05:13.520> to<00:05:14.090> get<00:05:14.240> a<00:05:14.270> corresponding

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
the ISO speeds to get a corresponding

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.490 
the ISO speeds to get a corresponding
f-stop<00:05:15.950> go<00:05:16.550> press<00:05:16.790> iso<00:05:17.330> one<00:05:17.570> we're<00:05:18.229> just<00:05:18.380> going

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
f-stop go press iso one we're just going

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.800 
f-stop go press iso one we're just going
to<00:05:18.530> dial<00:05:18.800> it<00:05:18.979> up<00:05:19.070> oh<00:05:19.310> and<00:05:19.610> actually<00:05:20.389> it's<00:05:20.720> just

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
to dial it up oh and actually it's just

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.159 
to dial it up oh and actually it's just
one<00:05:21.050> little<00:05:21.350> change<00:05:21.800> from<00:05:22.280> 80<00:05:22.610> to<00:05:23.120> 100<00:05:23.630> gives

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
one little change from 80 to 100 gives

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.920 
one little change from 80 to 100 gives
us<00:05:24.290> a<00:05:24.380> reading<00:05:24.680> of<00:05:24.770> f/4<00:05:25.389> once<00:05:26.389> that's<00:05:26.630> set<00:05:26.900> up

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
us a reading of f/4 once that's set up

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.270 
us a reading of f/4 once that's set up
I'm<00:05:27.229> just<00:05:27.260> going<00:05:27.500> to<00:05:27.590> double<00:05:27.860> check<00:05:27.889> it<00:05:28.160> one

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
I'm just going to double check it one

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.190 
I'm just going to double check it one
more<00:05:28.430> time<00:05:28.610> to<00:05:28.820> make<00:05:28.880> 100%<00:05:29.300> that<00:05:29.720> is<00:05:29.840> correct

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
more time to make 100% that is correct

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.469 
more time to make 100% that is correct
by<00:05:30.410> metering<00:05:31.070> that<00:05:31.250> Center<00:05:31.610> medium<00:05:32.000> gray<00:05:32.240> one

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
by metering that Center medium gray one

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:40.990 
by metering that Center medium gray one
more<00:05:32.660> time<00:05:36.790> and<00:05:37.790> I<00:05:37.850> get<00:05:38.000> f/4<00:05:38.360> again<00:05:40.000> checking

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
more time and I get f/4 again checking

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.030 
more time and I get f/4 again checking
my<00:05:41.270> black<00:05:41.800> and<00:05:42.800> white<00:05:43.360> values<00:05:44.830> confirm<00:05:45.830> that

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
my black and white values confirm that

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.770 
my black and white values confirm that
it<00:05:46.160> falls<00:05:46.370> where<00:05:46.639> it<00:05:46.760> should<00:05:47.000> be<00:05:47.030> we've

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
it falls where it should be we've

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.600 
it falls where it should be we've
confirmed<00:05:48.229> that<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:48.620> center<00:05:48.890> gray<00:05:49.100> fell<00:05:49.370> back

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
confirmed that the center gray fell back

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.060 
confirmed that the center gray fell back
at<00:05:49.820> f/4<00:05:50.270> and<00:05:50.600> the<00:05:50.750> white<00:05:50.990> and<00:05:51.229> black<00:05:51.440> tips<00:05:51.800> fell

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
at f/4 and the white and black tips fell

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.130 
at f/4 and the white and black tips fell
where<00:05:52.250> they<00:05:52.370> should<00:05:52.640> as<00:05:52.850> well<00:05:53.120> now<00:05:53.870> that<00:05:54.050> we've

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
where they should as well now that we've

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.350 
where they should as well now that we've
set<00:05:54.350> this<00:05:54.500> meter<00:05:54.770> up<00:05:54.950> correctly<00:05:55.460> to<00:05:55.550> our<00:05:55.910> HDX
