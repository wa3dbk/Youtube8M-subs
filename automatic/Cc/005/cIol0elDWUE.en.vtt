00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.880
 Now I'm getting ready to live that you 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.930
 voluntary doctoral examination in physics 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.930
 skoda wants to take off 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.730
 hello hello for her 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.380
 i am cosmologist i study the 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.640
 marriage of space and time 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.640
 the perfect couple 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.220
 You never know where the next big one is 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.550
 Ultimately, leap forward or come 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.550
 from whom 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.120
 and if i just have the time 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.590
 turn back to start to see 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.489
 what was the beginning of time itself 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.520
 she falls back to make time back 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.640
 she continues I do not know against yet 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.640
 Not 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.530
 continue to turn where 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.399
 It is called motor neurone disease 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.800
 the life expectancy is two 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.489
 years I want us to be together 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.489
 as long as possible 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.659
 they do not know what to expect 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.659
 It will be a very bitter defeat 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.860
 but I love him and he loves me 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.520
 We will share this disease together 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.520
 fight 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.040
 title 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.310
 how are you? 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.110
 and that black hole in the beginning of the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.900
 Time 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.110
 that is brilliantly brilliant stephen gould 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.310
 made doctor 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.840
 he has a pneumonia 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.350
 he will only survive if one 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.920
 make air tube section 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.409
 the stage can speak he was my name 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.799
 is still working now is americans 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.290
 is that a problem 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.610
 It is a great pleasure to watch 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:01.680
 how this man blows up all expectations 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.680
 scientifically and personally 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.740
 The human aspiration should not be 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.750
 know borders 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.750
 however bad life may seem 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.750
 I hope so long as I live 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.190
 Excuse me, you have something right now 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.190
 told 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.500
 I should 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.500
 Thank you
