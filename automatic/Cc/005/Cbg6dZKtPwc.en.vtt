hi guys welcome to my quick and review
of<00:00:06.759> the<00:00:07.419> Omar<00:00:08.340> stingray<00:00:09.340> fins<00:00:09.940> freediving

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:10.629 
of the Omar stingray fins freediving

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.849 
of the Omar stingray fins freediving
thinnest<00:00:11.219> so<00:00:12.660> my<00:00:13.660> background<00:00:14.170> is<00:00:14.320> I've<00:00:14.619> been

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:14.859 
thinnest so my background is I've been

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:17.070 
thinnest so my background is I've been
free<00:00:15.430> diving<00:00:15.670> spearfishing<00:00:16.150> out<00:00:16.690> for<00:00:16.960> about

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
free diving spearfishing out for about

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.159 
free diving spearfishing out for about
not<00:00:17.589> too<00:00:17.740> long<00:00:17.890> for<00:00:18.009> about<00:00:18.189> 18<00:00:18.750> 18<00:00:19.750> to<00:00:19.900> 20

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:20.169 
not too long for about 18 18 to 20

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:21.689 
not too long for about 18 18 to 20
months<00:00:20.259> so<00:00:20.589> a<00:00:20.619> little<00:00:20.800> bit<00:00:21.009> over<00:00:21.189> a<00:00:21.339> year<00:00:21.400> and<00:00:21.669> a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:21.699 
months so a little bit over a year and a

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.659 
months so a little bit over a year and a
half<00:00:21.880> and<00:00:22.810> for<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.140> last<00:00:23.289> eight<00:00:23.619> to<00:00:24.310> nine

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
half and for the last eight to nine

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.040 
half and for the last eight to nine
months<00:00:24.910> I've<00:00:25.240> actually<00:00:25.630> used<00:00:25.839> these<00:00:26.769> fins<00:00:27.159> so

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
months I've actually used these fins so

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.630 
months I've actually used these fins so
they've<00:00:29.050> had<00:00:29.230> quite<00:00:29.529> a<00:00:29.560> fair<00:00:29.829> bit<00:00:29.980> abuse<00:00:30.249> I've

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
they've had quite a fair bit abuse I've

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.600 
they've had quite a fair bit abuse I've
used<00:00:31.089> them<00:00:31.329> both<00:00:31.989> in<00:00:32.259> the<00:00:32.470> pool<00:00:32.710> for<00:00:33.280> my<00:00:33.400> free

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
used them both in the pool for my free

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.520 
used them both in the pool for my free
dive<00:00:33.790> training<00:00:34.240> and<00:00:34.450> obviously<00:00:35.170> I've<00:00:35.290> used

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
dive training and obviously I've used

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.040 
dive training and obviously I've used
them<00:00:35.740> out<00:00:36.370> in<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:36.700> open<00:00:36.970> water<00:00:37.210> for<00:00:37.690> some<00:00:37.840> free

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
them out in the open water for some free

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.970 
them out in the open water for some free
diving<00:00:38.290> but<00:00:39.160> mainly<00:00:39.520> for<00:00:39.880> spearfishing<00:00:40.980> so

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
diving but mainly for spearfishing so

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.150 
diving but mainly for spearfishing so
let's<00:00:42.820> get<00:00:42.970> started<00:00:43.420> with<00:00:43.570> the<00:00:43.750> specs<00:00:44.620> of<00:00:44.830> the

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
let's get started with the specs of the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.950 
let's get started with the specs of the
Omar<00:00:45.490> fins<00:00:45.990> they<00:00:46.990> these<00:00:47.740> particular<00:00:48.960> size

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
Omar fins they these particular size

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.440 
Omar fins they these particular size
which<00:00:50.500> is<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:51.040> 43<00:00:51.580> to<00:00:51.700> 44<00:00:52.650> Omar<00:00:53.650> fin<00:00:53.950> is<00:00:54.760> about

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
which is the 43 to 44 Omar fin is about

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.770 
which is the 43 to 44 Omar fin is about
19<00:00:56.260> three-and-a-half<00:00:57.040> 294<00:00:57.820> centimeters<00:00:58.570> from

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
19 three-and-a-half 294 centimeters from

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.150 
19 three-and-a-half 294 centimeters from
the<00:00:58.870> very<00:00:59.530> tip<00:01:00.430> for<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.240> tip<00:01:01.480> they're<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
the very tip for the tip they're the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.880 
the very tip for the tip they're the
product<00:01:03.520> weight<00:01:03.730> so<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.330> comes<00:01:04.570> in<00:01:04.750> at<00:01:04.869> about<00:01:04.989> 2

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
product weight so it comes in at about 2

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.929 
product weight so it comes in at about 2
kilos<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.200> foot<00:01:08.499> pocket<00:01:08.859> itself<00:01:09.189> is<00:01:09.640> made

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
kilos it's a foot pocket itself is made

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.639 
kilos it's a foot pocket itself is made
out<00:01:10.060> of<00:01:10.090> two<00:01:10.240> different<00:01:10.719> types<00:01:11.020> of<00:01:11.229> rubber<00:01:11.409> so

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
out of two different types of rubber so

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.830 
out of two different types of rubber so
you<00:01:11.740> have<00:01:11.920> a<00:01:11.950> much<00:01:12.130> softer<00:01:12.460> rubber<00:01:12.840> around

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
you have a much softer rubber around

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.870 
you have a much softer rubber around
your<00:01:14.289> ankle<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:14.890> then<00:01:15.340> you<00:01:15.460> also<00:01:15.579> have<00:01:15.850> a

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
your ankle and then you also have a

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.719 
your ankle and then you also have a
harder<00:01:16.390> rubber<00:01:16.630> which<00:01:16.990> leads<00:01:17.319> into<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.520> fin

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
harder rubber which leads into the fin

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.700 
harder rubber which leads into the fin
itself<00:01:19.149> so<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.719> provides<00:01:20.079> a<00:01:20.200> fair<00:01:20.409> bit<00:01:20.619> of

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
itself so it provides a fair bit of

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.309 
itself so it provides a fair bit of
comfort<00:01:20.920> but<00:01:21.219> also<00:01:21.369> gives<00:01:21.819> a<00:01:22.090> good<00:01:22.749> power

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
comfort but also gives a good power

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:25.319 
comfort but also gives a good power
transfer<00:01:24.069> with<00:01:24.249> the<00:01:24.280> stiffer<00:01:24.789> rubber<00:01:25.119> into

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
transfer with the stiffer rubber into

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.309 
transfer with the stiffer rubber into
the<00:01:25.539> actual<00:01:25.929> blade<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:28.509> blade<00:01:28.719> itself<00:01:29.109> is

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
the actual blade the blade itself is

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.489 
the actual blade the blade itself is
fully<00:01:30.130> removable<00:01:30.609> so<00:01:31.359> I've<00:01:31.719> got<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.170> the

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:32.499 
fully removable so I've got the the

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:34.830 
fully removable so I've got the the
plastic<00:01:32.950> blade<00:01:33.189> but<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:33.759> can<00:01:33.999> put<00:01:34.299> on<00:01:34.420> the

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
plastic blade but you can put on the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.809 
plastic blade but you can put on the
fancier<00:01:35.409> carbon<00:01:35.829> blade<00:01:36.009> I<00:01:36.280> didn't<00:01:36.520> go<00:01:36.609> for

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
fancier carbon blade I didn't go for

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.109 
fancier carbon blade I didn't go for
that<00:01:36.939> option<00:01:37.649> simply<00:01:38.649> because<00:01:39.069> it's<00:01:39.850> a<00:01:39.969> lot

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
that option simply because it's a lot

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.419 
that option simply because it's a lot
more<00:01:40.149> expensive<00:01:40.749> and<00:01:41.289> I<00:01:41.950> usually<00:01:42.130> go<00:01:42.399> off

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
more expensive and I usually go off

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.279 
more expensive and I usually go off
rocks<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.090> things<00:01:43.299> like<00:01:43.569> that<00:01:43.840> or<00:01:44.020> there's

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
rocks and things like that or there's

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.169 
rocks and things like that or there's
rocky<00:01:44.679> bottoms<00:01:45.130> so<00:01:45.639> even<00:01:45.939> though<00:01:46.030> I<00:01:46.060> don't

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
rocky bottoms so even though I don't

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.379 
rocky bottoms so even though I don't
intentionally<00:01:47.520> scrape<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.700> fins<00:01:48.939> along<00:01:49.240> the

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:49.389 
intentionally scrape the fins along the

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:51.690 
intentionally scrape the fins along the
bottom<00:01:49.569> or<00:01:49.990> I<00:01:50.020> don't<00:01:50.259> walk<00:01:50.530> in<00:01:50.740> them<00:01:50.889> sometimes

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
bottom or I don't walk in them sometimes

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.989 
bottom or I don't walk in them sometimes
I<00:01:51.819> do<00:01:51.880> get<00:01:52.209> scratched<00:01:52.689> and<00:01:53.310> things<00:01:54.310> like<00:01:54.520> that

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
I do get scratched and things like that

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:56.550 
I do get scratched and things like that
even<00:01:55.359> though<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.569> carbon<00:01:55.959> fins<00:01:56.200> are<00:01:56.350> a<00:01:56.380> lot

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
even though the carbon fins are a lot

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.249 
even though the carbon fins are a lot
stiffer<00:01:57.069> they're<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.369> lot<00:01:57.520> more<00:01:58.259> susceptible

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
stiffer they're a lot more susceptible

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.859 
stiffer they're a lot more susceptible
to<00:01:59.619> breaking<00:02:00.189> and<00:02:00.249> snapping<00:02:00.789> I<00:02:00.939> don't<00:02:01.719> know<00:02:01.810> if

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
to breaking and snapping I don't know if

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.149 
to breaking and snapping I don't know if
the<00:02:01.990> camera<00:02:02.289> pick<00:02:02.499> it<00:02:02.619> up<00:02:02.709> but<00:02:02.829> you<00:02:02.889> can<00:02:03.039> their

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
the camera pick it up but you can their

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.620 
the camera pick it up but you can their
faces<00:02:03.549> and<00:02:03.700> see<00:02:03.939> some<00:02:04.119> scratches<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:06.579> fin<00:02:06.939> or

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
faces and see some scratches the fin or

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.109 
faces and see some scratches the fin or
the<00:02:07.749> blade<00:02:07.990> angle<00:02:08.259> is<00:02:08.500> actually<00:02:08.849> twenty<00:02:09.849> meant

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
the blade angle is actually twenty meant

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.460 
the blade angle is actually twenty meant
to<00:02:10.209> be<00:02:10.269> 22<00:02:10.840> degrees

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
to be 22 degrees

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.660 
to be 22 degrees
they<00:02:11.650> were<00:02:11.709> 22

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
they were 22

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.600 
they were 22
when<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.360> first<00:02:13.569> got<00:02:13.750> on<00:02:13.930> but<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.800> keep<00:02:15.280> them<00:02:15.430> on

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
when I first got on but I keep them on

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.340 
when I first got on but I keep them on
the<00:02:15.700> balcony<00:02:15.880> sometimes<00:02:16.600> actually<00:02:16.840> laying

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
the balcony sometimes actually laying

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.949 
the balcony sometimes actually laying
flat<00:02:17.650> like<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.130> on<00:02:18.280> my<00:02:18.400> my<00:02:18.700> girlfriend<00:02:19.300> moves

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
flat like that on my my girlfriend moves

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.630 
flat like that on my my girlfriend moves
things<00:02:20.170> around<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.560> balcony<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.100> puts<00:02:21.520> him

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
things around the balcony and puts him

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.130 
things around the balcony and puts him
down<00:02:21.670> flat<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.270> don't<00:02:22.480> try<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.720> keep<00:02:22.930> that

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
down flat I don't try and keep that

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.250 
down flat I don't try and keep that
angle<00:02:23.500> but<00:02:24.459> I<00:02:24.520> do<00:02:24.670> find<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.330> with<00:02:25.720> these<00:02:25.870> fins

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
angle but I do find that with these fins

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.190 
angle but I do find that with these fins
the<00:02:26.920> power<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.850> get<00:02:28.090> from<00:02:28.390> each<00:02:28.630> stroke<00:02:29.050> is

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
the power you get from each stroke is

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.630 
the power you get from each stroke is
phenomenal<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.870> first<00:02:32.200> couple<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.220> months<00:02:33.520> I

dollars you can get them under $200 it's

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.320 
dollars you can get them under $200 it's
a<00:02:52.870> pretty<00:02:53.080> good<00:02:53.320> deal<00:02:53.820> but<00:02:54.820> if<00:02:55.090> you're

worth it
you<00:03:11.620> can<00:03:11.890> get<00:03:12.100> away<00:03:12.220> with<00:03:12.519> regular<00:03:12.940> fins<00:03:13.209> but

you can get away with regular fins but

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.360 
you can get away with regular fins but
this<00:03:13.959> is<00:03:14.110> just<00:03:14.260> one<00:03:14.440> of<00:03:14.470> those<00:03:14.620> products<00:03:15.070> which

and<00:03:29.019> also<00:03:29.829> under<00:03:30.370> underwater<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.390> can<00:03:31.570> dive<00:03:31.870> a

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
and also under underwater you can dive a

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.280 
and also under underwater you can dive a
little<00:03:32.110> bit<00:03:32.260> deeper<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:33.670> you're<00:03:34.660> saving<00:03:35.230> a

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
little bit deeper you you're saving a

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.930 
little bit deeper you you're saving a
lot<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.500> energy<00:03:36.070> which<00:03:36.220> means<00:03:36.459> you're<00:03:36.579> saving

lot of energy which means you're saving

a lot of oxygen which means you're

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.120 
a lot of oxygen which means you're
staying<00:03:38.620> underwater<00:03:39.010> for<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.459> lot<00:03:39.610> longer<00:03:39.760> so
