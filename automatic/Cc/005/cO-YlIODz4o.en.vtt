00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
again then you have to wait for somebody

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.420 
again then you have to wait for somebody
and<00:03:36.150> then<00:03:36.390> tuck<00:03:36.659> it<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:37.200> send<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.709> this<00:03:38.159> mech

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
and then tuck it to send you this mech

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.710 
and then tuck it to send you this mech
suit<00:03:38.700> through<00:03:38.909> the<00:03:39.000> air<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.299> have<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.569> laying

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
suit through the air and have it laying

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.089 
suit through the air and have it laying
on<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.930> ground<00:03:40.110> so<00:03:40.409> this<00:03:40.620> whole<00:03:40.769> process

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
on the ground so this whole process

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.100 
on the ground so this whole process
probably<00:03:41.610> takes<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.120> around<00:03:42.209> 20<00:03:42.659> seconds<00:03:43.019> or

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
probably takes you around 20 seconds or

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.800 
probably takes you around 20 seconds or
so<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.950> get<00:03:44.370> they<00:03:44.519> get<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:45.000> mech<00:03:45.180> which<00:03:45.510> leaves

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
so to get they get the mech which leaves

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.600 
so to get they get the mech which leaves
you<00:03:46.019> completely<00:03:46.650> open<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:46.980> somebody<00:03:47.310> killing

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
you completely open to somebody killing

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.220 
you completely open to somebody killing
you<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:47.909> taking<00:03:48.299> your<00:03:48.390> mech<00:03:48.569> from<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:49.019> and

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
you and taking your mech from you and

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.520 
you and taking your mech from you and
then<00:03:49.650> when<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:49.920> hop<00:03:50.129> in<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.400> mech<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:51.870> takes

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
then when you hop in the mech it takes

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.130 
then when you hop in the mech it takes
your<00:03:52.739> sensitivity<00:03:53.370> down<00:03:53.549> to<00:03:53.879> about<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.330> fifth<00:03:54.870> I

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
your sensitivity down to about a fifth I

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.990 
your sensitivity down to about a fifth I
would<00:03:55.590> say<00:03:55.799> that's<00:03:56.069> what<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.340> felt<00:03:56.519> like<00:03:56.790> of

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
would say that's what it felt like of

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.420 
would say that's what it felt like of
what<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.080> is<00:03:58.110> when<00:03:58.409> you're<00:03:58.530> outside<00:03:58.709> of<00:03:59.129> it<00:03:59.250> and

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
what it is when you're outside of it and

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.539 
what it is when you're outside of it and
it's<00:04:00.330> probably<00:04:00.689> like<00:04:01.319> 10<00:04:01.620> times<00:04:01.920> slower<00:04:02.370> than

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
it's probably like 10 times slower than

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.630 
it's probably like 10 times slower than
walking<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.930> have<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.170> boost<00:04:04.560> feature<00:04:04.890> but

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
walking you have a boost feature but

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.059 
walking you have a boost feature but
you're<00:04:05.939> not<00:04:05.970> allowed<00:04:06.330> to<00:04:06.620> turn<00:04:07.620> while<00:04:07.920> you're

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
you're not allowed to turn while you're

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.220 
you're not allowed to turn while you're
boosting<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.790> have<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.480> like<00:04:09.780> make<00:04:10.019> sure

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
boosting so you have to like make sure

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.479 
boosting so you have to like make sure
that<00:04:10.409> you're<00:04:10.560> on<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.709> path<00:04:10.799> where<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.340> won't

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
that you're on a path where you won't

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.670 
that you're on a path where you won't
like<00:04:11.700> hit<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.060> rock<00:04:12.450> on<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.750> ground<00:04:13.110> because<00:04:13.530> a

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
like hit a rock on the ground because a

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.479 
like hit a rock on the ground because a
pebble<00:04:14.099> will<00:04:14.220> stop<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.970> really<00:04:15.330> will

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
pebble will stop you it really will

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.659 
pebble will stop you it really will
and<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:18.630> gun<00:04:18.919> it's<00:04:19.919> kind<00:04:20.099> of<00:04:20.190> like<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.340> chain

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
and the gun it's kind of like a chain

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.120 
and the gun it's kind of like a chain
gun<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:21.299> takes<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:21.959> second<00:04:22.349> to<00:04:22.440> start<00:04:22.710> you

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
gun so it takes it a second to start you

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.370 
gun so it takes it a second to start you
know<00:04:23.250> revving<00:04:23.610> up<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:23.880> shooting<00:04:24.139> at<00:04:25.139> your

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
know revving up and shooting at your

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.379 
know revving up and shooting at your
enemies<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:26.160> have<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.460> reload<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:27.090> little

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
enemies and you have to reload a little

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.330 
enemies and you have to reload a little
bit<00:04:27.509> often<00:04:27.930> so<00:04:28.139> it's<00:04:28.319> it's<00:04:28.620> completely

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
bit often so it's it's completely

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.850 
bit often so it's it's completely
balanced<00:04:29.849> in<00:04:29.940> those<00:04:30.090> fat<00:04:30.389> in<00:04:30.780> those<00:04:30.990> facets<00:04:31.740> of

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
balanced in those fat in those facets of

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.390 
balanced in those fat in those facets of
it<00:04:32.039> and<00:04:32.669> honestly<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:34.560> both<00:04:34.770> times<00:04:35.099> that<00:04:35.280> I

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
it and honestly the both times that I

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.879 
it and honestly the both times that I
got<00:04:35.669> in<00:04:35.849> it<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.120> got<00:04:36.419> out<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.470> first<00:04:37.650> time<00:04:37.830> I

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
got in it I got out and the first time I

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.800 
got in it I got out and the first time I
got<00:04:38.130> in<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:38.370> though<00:04:38.550> I<00:04:38.759> was<00:04:39.150> lucky<00:04:39.479> enough<00:04:39.509> to

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
got in it though I was lucky enough to

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.330 
got in it though I was lucky enough to
run<00:04:39.960> into<00:04:40.199> a<00:04:40.229> group<00:04:40.590> of<00:04:40.620> people<00:04:40.800> who<00:04:41.009> had<00:04:41.130> just

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
run into a group of people who had just

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.249 
run into a group of people who had just
spawned<00:04:41.669> all<00:04:41.970> three<00:04:42.509> of<00:04:42.539> them<00:04:42.720> at<00:04:42.810> just<00:04:43.110> fun

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
spawned all three of them at just fun

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:44.210 
spawned all three of them at just fun
and<00:04:43.289> they<00:04:43.440> were<00:04:43.530> walking<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.889> the<00:04:44.009> same

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
and they were walking to the same

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.770 
and they were walking to the same
doorway<00:04:44.460> so<00:04:44.639> I<00:04:44.759> killed<00:04:45.060> all<00:04:45.210> of<00:04:45.270> them<00:04:45.389> but

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
doorway so I killed all of them but

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.230 
doorway so I killed all of them but
after<00:04:46.620> that<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:47.069> just<00:04:47.099> you<00:04:47.520> know<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:47.819> couldn't

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
after that I just you know it couldn't

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.790 
after that I just you know it couldn't
find<00:04:48.479> them<00:04:48.660> anymore<00:04:48.840> so<00:04:49.139> I<00:04:49.169> just<00:04:49.410> got<00:04:49.560> out<00:04:49.770> of

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
find them anymore so I just got out of

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.309 
find them anymore so I just got out of
it<00:04:50.039> is<00:04:50.940> probably<00:04:51.479> due<00:04:51.659> to<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.840> fact<00:04:51.990> that<00:04:52.139> it

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
it is probably due to the fact that it

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.860 
it is probably due to the fact that it
was<00:04:52.380> only<00:04:52.530> three<00:04:52.830> on<00:04:52.949> three<00:04:53.240> and<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:54.389> map<00:04:54.630> was

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
was only three on three and the map was

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.350 
was only three on three and the map was
a<00:04:55.080> little<00:04:55.409> bit<00:04:55.530> large<00:04:55.800> for<00:04:55.860> that<00:04:56.190> so<00:04:56.610> I'm<00:04:57.060> sure

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
a little bit large for that so I'm sure

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.540 
a little bit large for that so I'm sure
I'm<00:04:57.990> not<00:04:58.020> sure<00:04:58.199> exactly<00:04:58.830> what<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.250> numbers

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
I'm not sure exactly what the numbers

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.279 
I'm not sure exactly what the numbers
are<00:04:59.699> for<00:04:59.940> multiplayer<00:05:00.419> I<00:05:00.479> would<00:05:00.780> assume<00:05:01.080> that

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
are for multiplayer I would assume that

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:02.839 
are for multiplayer I would assume that
they're<00:05:01.440> gonna<00:05:01.650> at<00:05:01.860> least<00:05:01.889> be<00:05:02.220> eight<00:05:02.460> on<00:05:02.610> eight

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
they're gonna at least be eight on eight

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:06.499 
they're gonna at least be eight on eight
maybe<00:05:03.710> they'll<00:05:04.710> go<00:05:04.830> up<00:05:04.860> to<00:05:05.069> 16<00:05:05.520> on<00:05:05.639> 16<00:05:06.090> on<00:05:06.240> some

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
maybe they'll go up to 16 on 16 on some

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.270 
maybe they'll go up to 16 on 16 on some
maps<00:05:06.720> I'm<00:05:06.960> not<00:05:07.080> sure<00:05:07.289> exactly<00:05:07.740> what<00:05:07.949> it<00:05:08.039> is<00:05:08.159> or

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
maps I'm not sure exactly what it is or
