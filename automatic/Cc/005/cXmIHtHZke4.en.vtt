00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
Ireland over the years that perhaps you

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.100 
Ireland over the years that perhaps you
might<00:01:54.490> have<00:01:54.640> been<00:01:54.880> better<00:01:55.270> treated<00:01:55.630> towards

might have been better treated towards
the<00:01:56.200> end<00:01:57.540> maybe<00:01:58.540> so<00:01:59.340> it's<00:02:00.340> not<00:02:00.490> as<00:02:00.610> something

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
the end maybe so it's not as something
