00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
an hour and then when we got there there

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.030 
an hour and then when we got there there
was<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:11.660> little<00:04:12.020> bit<00:04:12.200> of<00:04:12.290> an<00:04:12.380> argument<00:04:12.530> about

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
was a little bit of an argument about

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.490 
was a little bit of an argument about
who<00:04:13.430> was<00:04:13.580> going<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.760> go<00:04:13.910> first<00:04:14.240> and<00:04:14.630> then<00:04:15.290> there

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
who was going to go first and then there

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.620 
who was going to go first and then there
were<00:04:15.590> children<00:04:15.980> crying<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.820> whole<00:04:16.850> time<00:04:17.330> that

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
were children crying the whole time that

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.110 
were children crying the whole time that
the<00:04:17.870> photographer<00:04:18.680> was<00:04:19.160> very<00:04:19.520> very<00:04:19.670> stressed

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
the photographer was very very stressed

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.229 
the photographer was very very stressed
out

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
out

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.420 
out
I<00:04:21.419> felt<00:04:22.139> like<00:04:22.229> it<00:04:22.380> was<00:04:22.470> very<00:04:22.710> very<00:04:22.860> very<00:04:22.979> rushed

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
I felt like it was very very very rushed

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.170 
I felt like it was very very very rushed
not<00:04:24.419> really<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.780> best<00:04:24.900> place<00:04:25.139> for<00:04:25.530> my<00:04:26.190> treat

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
not really the best place for my treat

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.809 
not really the best place for my treat
me<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.569> kind<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:27.900> come<00:04:28.139> out<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.729> was

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819 
me to kind of come out and it was

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.890 
me to kind of come out and it was
reposed<00:04:30.560> so<00:04:31.560> we<00:04:31.740> took<00:04:31.979> nine<00:04:32.370> photos<00:04:32.970> totally

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
reposed so we took nine photos totally

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.070 
reposed so we took nine photos totally
the<00:04:34.710> other<00:04:34.819> experience<00:04:35.819> of<00:04:36.030> me<00:04:36.419> going<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.870> my

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
the other experience of me going to my

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.420 
the other experience of me going to my
other<00:04:37.199> photographer<00:04:37.770> George

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.529 
other photographer George
he<00:04:38.669> took<00:04:38.819> maybe<00:04:39.419> 200<00:04:40.080> photos<00:04:40.819> so<00:04:41.819> the<00:04:42.330> room

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
he took maybe 200 photos so the room

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.480 
he took maybe 200 photos so the room
wasn't<00:04:42.900> really<00:04:43.110> anything<00:04:43.289> to<00:04:43.590> choose<00:04:43.889> from<00:04:44.220> I

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
wasn't really anything to choose from I

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.830 
wasn't really anything to choose from I
don't<00:04:45.150> really<00:04:45.449> feel<00:04:46.229> that<00:04:46.289> it<00:04:46.620> represents<00:04:47.280> me

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
don't really feel that it represents me

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.830 
don't really feel that it represents me
when<00:04:48.840> they<00:04:48.930> came<00:04:49.169> out<00:04:49.380> okay

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
when they came out okay

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.260 
when they came out okay
we'll<00:04:50.990> be<00:04:51.169> okay<00:04:51.830> photos<00:04:52.580> but<00:04:53.000> they're<00:04:53.120> not

online<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.680> think<00:04:57.740> they<00:04:58.040> give<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.370> a<00:04:58.880> much<00:04:59.360> more

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
online I think they give a a much more

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.320 
online I think they give a a much more
uptight<00:05:01.990> unrelaxed<00:05:02.990> kind<00:05:03.650> of<00:05:03.940> picture<00:05:04.940> of<00:05:05.090> me

were<00:05:41.529> completely<00:05:42.309> posed<00:05:42.879> and<00:05:43.449> they<00:05:44.049> were<00:05:44.109> much

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:44.439 
were completely posed and they were much

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:46.469 
were completely posed and they were much
much<00:05:44.709> more<00:05:44.919> expensive<00:05:45.069> than<00:05:45.639> if<00:05:45.759> I've<00:05:45.939> gone<00:05:46.209> to

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479
