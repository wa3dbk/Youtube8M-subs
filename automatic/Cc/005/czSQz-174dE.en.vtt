00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
the seed for this world for a while so I

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.950 
the seed for this world for a while so I
thought<00:00:21.669> I<00:00:21.880> would<00:00:21.939> give<00:00:22.240> you<00:00:22.270> the<00:00:22.480> seed<00:00:22.779> and

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
thought I would give you the seed and

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
thought I would give you the seed and
fancy<00:00:23.650> fashion<00:00:24.239> so<00:00:25.239> this<00:00:25.660> world<00:00:25.960> is<00:00:26.169> actually

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
fancy fashion so this world is actually

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.080 
fancy fashion so this world is actually
like<00:00:27.700> pretty<00:00:28.450> it<00:00:29.439> has<00:00:29.590> a<00:00:29.890> lot<00:00:30.579> of<00:00:30.610> stuff<00:00:30.910> like

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
like pretty it has a lot of stuff like

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.270 
like pretty it has a lot of stuff like
when<00:00:31.239> I<00:00:31.270> generated<00:00:31.899> it<00:00:32.020> I<00:00:32.230> just<00:00:32.710> generated<00:00:33.219> a

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
when I generated it I just generated a

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.100 
when I generated it I just generated a
random<00:00:33.640> seed<00:00:33.940> because<00:00:34.210> I<00:00:34.329> made<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.690> world<00:00:34.899> I

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
random seed because I made the world I

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.250 
random seed because I made the world I
run<00:00:35.590> the<00:00:35.739> server<00:00:35.980> like<00:00:36.539> we<00:00:37.539> all<00:00:37.690> pay<00:00:37.840> for<00:00:37.870> it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
run the server like we all pay for it

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.140 
run the server like we all pay for it
I'm<00:00:38.410> just<00:00:38.710> kind<00:00:39.010> of<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.160> manager<00:00:39.579> sort<00:00:40.000> of<00:00:40.059> I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
I'm just kind of the manager sort of I

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.360 
I'm just kind of the manager sort of I
guess<00:00:40.180> you<00:00:40.420> would<00:00:40.540> say<00:00:40.570> um<00:00:40.960> so<00:00:41.829> anyways<00:00:42.190> when<00:00:42.340> I

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
guess you would say um so anyways when I

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.500 
guess you would say um so anyways when I
generated<00:00:42.880> the<00:00:42.970> world<00:00:43.240> I<00:00:43.540> was<00:00:43.720> like<00:00:43.960> whoa<00:00:45.510> so

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
generated the world I was like whoa so

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.450 
generated the world I was like whoa so
starting<00:00:46.840> off<00:00:46.989> here<00:00:47.050> at<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:47.500> spawn<00:00:47.829> there's

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
starting off here at the spawn there's

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.220 
starting off here at the spawn there's
actually<00:00:48.820> a<00:00:48.850> spawner<00:00:49.270> what<00:00:49.510> you<00:00:49.630> guys<00:00:49.780> noticed

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
actually a spawner what you guys noticed

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.510 
actually a spawner what you guys noticed
if<00:00:50.320> you<00:00:50.410> keep<00:00:50.560> going<00:00:50.710> down<00:00:50.860> there's<00:00:51.190> actually

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
another spawner there's two spotters

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.500 
another spawner there's two spotters
down<00:00:53.170> there<00:00:53.440> one's<00:00:54.130> a<00:00:54.280> zombie<00:00:54.670> spawner<00:00:54.820> one<00:00:55.329> is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
down there one's a zombie spawner one is

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.370 
down there one's a zombie spawner one is
another<00:00:55.870> spawner<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:58.210> starting<00:00:58.989> off<00:00:59.110> just

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
another spawner so starting off just

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.049 
another spawner so starting off just
right<00:00:59.440> off<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.710> value<00:00:59.890> have<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.220> spawner<00:01:00.640> so

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
right off the value have a spawner so

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.900 
right off the value have a spawner so
we'll<00:01:01.870> go<00:01:02.020> ahead<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.620> we<00:01:03.220> will<00:01:03.430> go<00:01:03.610> through<00:01:03.640> a

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
we'll go ahead and we will go through a

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.660 
we'll go ahead and we will go through a
portal<00:01:05.009> so<00:01:06.009> we'll<00:01:06.130> go<00:01:06.250> through<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.490> nether

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
portal so we'll go through the nether

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.700 
portal so we'll go through the nether
hub<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.600> I'll<00:01:07.990> show<00:01:08.200> you<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.469> coordinates

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
hub and I'll show you the coordinates

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.679 
hub and I'll show you the coordinates
for<00:01:08.950> each<00:01:09.070> of<00:01:09.310> these<00:01:09.430> places<00:01:09.969> so<00:01:10.299> first<00:01:10.509> we're

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
for each of these places so first we're

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.500 
for each of these places so first we're
going<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:10.869> go<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:10.990> my<00:01:11.170> area<00:01:11.740> my<00:01:12.549> area<00:01:13.210> right<00:01:13.479> off

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
going to go to my area my area right off

we didn't look at any of this when we

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.180 
we didn't look at any of this when we
generated<00:01:23.049> the<00:01:23.140> world<00:01:23.350> we<00:01:23.530> just<00:01:23.560> build<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.100> and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
generated the world we just build it and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
village coordinates turneth one back on

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.929 
village coordinates turneth one back on
were<00:01:33.820> 64<00:01:34.630> 1085<00:01:35.560> not<00:01:36.040> to<00:01:36.220> mention<00:01:36.430> there's<00:01:36.880> a

exactly remember which way are you think
it's<00:04:38.180> this<00:04:38.300> way<00:04:39.039> outside<00:04:40.039> of<00:04:40.160> Sam's<00:04:40.400> portal

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
there's actually a pyramid but we have

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.790 
there's actually a pyramid but we have
to<00:04:42.800> wait<00:04:42.949> for<00:04:42.979> the<00:04:43.160> world<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:43.639> load<00:04:43.910> to<00:04:44.090> find<00:04:44.300> it

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
to wait for the world to load to find it

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.060 
to wait for the world to load to find it
where<00:04:45.800> is<00:04:45.979> it<00:04:46.990> maybe<00:04:47.990> it's<00:04:48.110> this<00:04:48.259> way<00:04:48.500> that

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
where is it maybe it's this way that

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.129 
where is it maybe it's this way that
thinks<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.520> feels<00:04:50.389> like<00:04:50.509> right<00:04:50.780> on<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:51.020> edge

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
thinks it feels like right on the edge

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.189 
thinks it feels like right on the edge
there<00:04:51.380> we<00:04:51.500> go<00:04:51.669> so<00:04:52.669> there's<00:04:53.030> a<00:04:53.120> portal<00:04:53.660> here<00:04:53.720> or
