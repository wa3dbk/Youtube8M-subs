ask your maintenance they don't have to
be<00:00:44.670> adjusted<00:00:45.270> but<00:00:45.510> they<00:00:45.600> should<00:00:45.809> be<00:00:45.930> checked

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
be adjusted but they should be checked

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
year in order to check them you remove

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.670 
year in order to check them you remove
them<00:00:51.059> from<00:00:51.239> your<00:00:51.420> engine<00:00:51.809> hold<00:00:52.289> them<00:00:52.440> up<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
them from your engine hold them up to

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.619 
them from your engine hold them up to
light<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.370> check<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.610> cracks<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.270> between

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
light and check for cracks in between

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the Reed valve and the cage like so now

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.080 
the Reed valve and the cage like so now
if<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.620> any<00:00:58.770> feathering<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> edges

if you see any feathering on the edges

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.340 
if you see any feathering on the edges
that<00:01:00.300> also<00:01:00.510> means<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.050> they<00:01:01.170> needed

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
that also means that they needed

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.709 
that also means that they needed
replaced<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.190> they<00:01:02.640> lost<00:01:02.820> anywhere<00:01:03.480> from

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
replaced and they lost anywhere from

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
replaced and they lost anywhere from
about<00:01:04.080> three<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.650> five<00:01:04.860> years<00:01:05.159> depending<00:01:05.369> on

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
about three to five years depending on

ride<00:02:03.560> with<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:03.920> read<00:02:04.100> valve<00:02:04.340> is<00:02:04.909> actually<00:02:05.659> one

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
ride with the read valve is actually one

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.810 
ride with the read valve is actually one
of<00:02:05.869> my<00:02:06.020> more<00:02:06.530> enjoyable<00:02:07.070> parts<00:02:07.399> that<00:02:07.549> we<00:02:07.640> put

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
of my more enjoyable parts that we put

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.690 
of my more enjoyable parts that we put
on<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:07.970> it's<00:02:08.500> only<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.800> lot<00:02:10.009> of<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.160> vibration

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
on it it's only a lot of the vibration

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.809 
on it it's only a lot of the vibration
bogging<00:02:11.120> at<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.300> lower<00:02:11.450> end<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.980> just<00:02:13.220> felt<00:02:13.640> a

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
bogging at the lower end it just felt a

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.880 
bogging at the lower end it just felt a
lot<00:02:13.940> crisper<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.290> definitely<00:02:15.440> had

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
lot crisper in it and it definitely had

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.370 
lot crisper in it and it definitely had
a<00:02:15.920> lot<00:02:16.130> more<00:02:16.540> popping<00:02:17.540> up<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.900> go<00:02:18.050> once<00:02:18.290> we
