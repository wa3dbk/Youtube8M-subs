00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.310
 hello hearts have already told you that it is 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.879
 genetic engineering and what 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.430
 good skin applications I'm going to 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.410
 tell you what methods and techniques are 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.709
 they use in this discipline to see what 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.709
 to be 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.110
 as we have said before the main thing 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.540
 of genetic engineering is to pass a 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.910
 anyone to another body to be able 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.090
 express them 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.790
 let's say that from this DNA chain I 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.670
 wants to transfer the genre as I can 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.510
 do it with the so-called technology 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.900
 of recombinant DNA we will see in what 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.140
 consists 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.570
 ok there's our number gene no 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.460
 However, we can not separate it from the rest 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.190
 of the chain with chemical processes 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.190
 normal the link that binds 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.280
 nucleotides link foxx body esther es 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.329
 very strong however there are some 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.809
 enzymes called strict as 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.900
 that act like plane scissors like 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.550
 that 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.460
 well breaking that link 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.070
 phosphodiesterase on top of that 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.830
 property 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:19.000
 so with the help of the restricted sa 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.250
 we cut what we wanted and now and 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.350
 now we have isolated 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.180
 and now that we have it clear how 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.680
 we do to put our gel number 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.620
 one in the DNA of other organisms 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.400
 Well with more than three cups this time 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.730
 we take the DNA chain of the living being in 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.000
 which we want to express light 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.860
 making known using the transcriptase 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.470
 we cut everything with the help of a 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.260
 different enzyme that are called adn and 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.990
 ghassan we paste so to speak our 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:58.090
 one in the gap we have made and 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:01.780
 is unlimited the DNA has now the gene 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.330
 what we were looking for but in the end it is a 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.530
 single gene or one does not serve us any good does 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.340
 is missing several chains since April 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.890
 how do we get it 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.769
 it is introduced in our gene number 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.400
 1 in the genome of a bacterium following 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.860
 the method that we explained before 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.590
 then our friend the bacterium 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.380
 reproduce and ' to the offspring and 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.960
 has gene 1 in its genome 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.020
 so, well, we already have heaps 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.200
 of genes number one to use 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.240
 couple that was the final step as 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.210
 we introduce the new DNA that we have 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.530
 obtained back in the cell that 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:47.320
 had therefore for it two are employed 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.990
 get the viral vectors things 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.210
 medical readers vectors 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.730
 medical manipulated viruses 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.850
 genetically so that in the first place 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.770
 are not pathogenic and secondly have 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.500
 inside the gene 1 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.150
 actually the DNA chain in which 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.299
 we have introduced the 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.299
 so that the pin is released to the 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.360
 get in contact with the cells 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:16.010
 they introduce their genetic material into it 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.710
 leaving gene 1 in the genome of the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.140
 cell 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.140
 in this way when the cell phone 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.210
 varies reproducing will be expressing the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.750
 character that we have chosen with the 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.540
 example 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.790
 and well I think I do not forget anything 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:37.600
 so I only have to thank 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.600
 your attention and nothing see you soon
