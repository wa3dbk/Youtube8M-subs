00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
that's pretty much it

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.759 
that's pretty much it
obviously<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.780> did<00:03:18.900> not<00:03:18.989> matter<00:03:19.200> even<00:03:19.440> though

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
obviously it did not matter even though

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.289 
obviously it did not matter even though
it's<00:03:19.980> on<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.160> Sun<00:03:20.519> it's<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:20.970> zubur

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
it's on the Sun it's in the zubur

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.569 
it's on the Sun it's in the zubur
it<00:03:21.480> has<00:03:21.630> so<00:03:21.900> much<00:03:22.019> power<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.620> Dean's<00:03:23.370> just

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
it has so much power and Dean's just

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:24.710 
it has so much power and Dean's just
gonna<00:03:23.730> decide<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.060> go<00:03:24.150> for<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.359> volts<00:03:24.540> which

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
gonna decide to go for the volts which

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.349 
gonna decide to go for the volts which
could<00:03:24.930> either<00:03:25.019> volts<00:03:25.380> which<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:26.359> Charizard

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
could either volts which the Charizard

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.210 
could either volts which the Charizard
or<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.900> Zoomer<00:03:28.650> really<00:03:28.950> didn't<00:03:29.160> matter

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
or the Zoomer really didn't matter

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.069 
or the Zoomer really didn't matter
because<00:03:29.820> he's<00:03:30.239> gonna<00:03:30.359> bring<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.690> hit<00:03:30.810> Miley

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
because he's gonna bring it hit Miley

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.460 
because he's gonna bring it hit Miley
which<00:03:31.260> can<00:03:31.470> do<00:03:31.590> anything<00:03:31.920> into<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:34.260> either

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
which can do anything into a to either

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.590 
which can do anything into a to either
one<00:03:36.200> but<00:03:37.880> figuring<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.180> know<00:03:39.329> just

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
one but figuring that you know just

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.880 
one but figuring that you know just
going<00:03:39.840> for<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.049> waltz<00:03:40.260> would<00:03:40.410> surely<00:03:40.650> be<00:03:40.799> the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
going for the waltz would surely be the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.770 
going for the waltz would surely be the
best<00:03:41.070> play<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.340> that

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
best play in that

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.360 
best play in that
I<00:03:42.780> feel<00:03:43.290> like<00:03:43.440> max<00:03:43.680> should<00:03:43.920> have<00:03:44.010> predicted

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
I feel like max should have predicted

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.620 
I feel like max should have predicted
that<00:03:44.489> switch<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:44.970> he<00:03:45.090> should<00:03:45.269> have<00:03:45.299> gone<00:03:45.450> for

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
that switch and he should have gone for

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.810 
that switch and he should have gone for
the<00:03:45.720> Fire<00:03:46.320> Blast<00:03:46.709> or<00:03:47.130> something<00:03:47.459> right<00:03:47.609> there

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
the Fire Blast or something right there

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.150 
the Fire Blast or something right there
that<00:03:48.359> would<00:03:48.480> have<00:03:48.540> made<00:03:48.780> things<00:03:49.079> a<00:03:50.010> little

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
that would have made things a little

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.699 
that would have made things a little
better<00:03:50.370> just<00:03:50.940> go<00:03:51.170> because<00:03:52.170> why<00:03:52.380> would<00:03:52.530> he<00:03:52.620> go

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
better just go because why would he go

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.140 
better just go because why would he go
for<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:52.950> water<00:03:53.250> move<00:03:53.459> when<00:03:53.640> it's<00:03:53.760> not<00:03:53.940> gonna<00:03:54.060> do

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
for a water move when it's not gonna do

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.170 
for a water move when it's not gonna do
anything<00:03:54.299> ever<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:55.470> Sun<00:03:55.709> so<00:03:56.040> um<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:56.850> just<00:03:56.880> wanna

Mokpo<00:05:00.370> that<00:05:00.760> would<00:05:00.850> have<00:05:00.940> done<00:05:01.060> enough<00:05:01.270> to

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
Mokpo that would have done enough to

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.270 
Mokpo that would have done enough to
where<00:05:01.570> my<00:05:02.080> Dragon<00:05:02.620> Claw<00:05:02.770> would<00:05:02.979> have<00:05:03.070> killed

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
where my Dragon Claw would have killed

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.300 
where my Dragon Claw would have killed
him<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:03.669> oh<00:05:04.120> well<00:05:04.450> but<00:05:05.139> anyways<00:05:05.770> he<00:05:05.889> has<00:05:05.979> Rotom

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
him and oh well but anyways he has Rotom

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.610 
him and oh well but anyways he has Rotom
this<00:05:06.880> Rotom<00:05:07.180> is<00:05:07.389> scarfed<00:05:07.780> actually<00:05:08.290> so<00:05:08.410> I<00:05:08.470> can

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
this Rotom is scarfed actually so I can

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.590 
this Rotom is scarfed actually so I can
kind<00:05:08.800> of<00:05:08.830> see<00:05:08.979> his<00:05:09.520> reasoning<00:05:09.970> here<00:05:10.210> as<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:10.450> why

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
kind of see his reasoning here as to why

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.150 
kind of see his reasoning here as to why
he<00:05:10.750> didn't<00:05:10.960> really<00:05:11.080> necessarily<00:05:11.290> need<00:05:11.919> to<00:05:11.950> do

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
he didn't really necessarily need to do

he didn't really necessarily need to do
that<00:05:12.190> don't<00:05:12.940> know<00:05:13.000> why<00:05:13.210> he<00:05:13.450> went<00:05:13.720> for<00:05:13.900> the
