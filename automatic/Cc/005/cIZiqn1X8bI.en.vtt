renders and I didn't know what else we

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.590 
renders and I didn't know what else we
could<00:01:02.620> do<00:01:02.800> until<00:01:03.550> I<00:01:03.879> saw<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.150> new<00:01:04.360> interface

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600

I give that decline probably bigger than
any<00:02:02.550> of<00:02:02.730> those<00:02:02.820> things<00:02:03.150> though<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
any of those things though is the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.860 
any of those things though is the
addition<00:02:04.230> of<00:02:04.320> 2<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.590> T<00:02:04.890> splines<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:06.180> how<00:02:06.540> easy

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
addition of 2 of T splines and how easy

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.410 
addition of 2 of T splines and how easy
it's<00:02:07.260> going<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.500> be<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.130> organic<00:02:08.610> modeling

some of those into your designs we

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.570 
some of those into your designs we
decided<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.050> would<00:02:40.140> be<00:02:40.200> best<00:02:40.350> if<00:02:41.010> we

decided that it would be best if we

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.970 
decided that it would be best if we

find<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.489> really<00:02:47.880> helps<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.480> learn<00:02:48.720> the

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
find it really helps you to learn the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:49.930 
find it really helps you to learn the
technology<00:02:49.380> when

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
technology when

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.790 
technology when

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
has a pre-existing model that you can

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
push and pull and tug on so having to

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.680 
push and pull and tug on so having to
create<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.710> lot<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.070> that<00:02:55.250> from<00:02:55.400> scratch<00:02:55.690> they

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
create a lot of that from scratch they

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.900 
create a lot of that from scratch they
can<00:02:56.870> make<00:02:56.960> three<00:02:57.200> ways<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:57.710> you<00:02:57.980> do<00:02:58.460> parts<00:02:58.760> min

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
can make three ways and you do parts min

can make three ways and you do parts min
T<00:02:59.090> splines<00:02:59.270> parts<00:02:59.810> mid<00:02:59.960> nerves<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.980> it's<00:03:01.160> just

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
T splines parts mid nerves and it's just

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.190 
T splines parts mid nerves and it's just
adding<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:02.060> whole<00:03:02.270> other<00:03:02.450> element<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:03.050> it

cheese<00:03:03.620> blinds<00:03:03.860> is<00:03:04.040> really<00:03:04.280> an<00:03:04.610> entirely<00:03:04.970> new

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
cheese blinds is really an entirely new

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.960 
cheese blinds is really an entirely new
way<00:03:05.270> of<00:03:05.450> thinking<00:03:05.570> about<00:03:06.020> modeling<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.820> mean<00:03:07.820> my

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
way of thinking about modeling I mean my

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.910 
way of thinking about modeling I mean my
original<00:03:08.420> role<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.690> did<00:03:09.020> a<00:03:09.050> lot<00:03:09.260> of<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.710> user

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
original role I did a lot of the user

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.240 
original role I did a lot of the user
interface<00:03:10.330> setup<00:03:11.330> not<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.410> design<00:03:12.710> but<00:03:13.040> just

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
interface setup not the design but just

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.720 
interface setup not the design but just
the<00:03:13.340> implementation<00:03:14.320> for<00:03:15.320> matrix<00:03:15.710> seven<00:03:16.070> my

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
the implementation for matrix seven my

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.640 
the implementation for matrix seven my
focus<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.240> really<00:03:17.450> shifted<00:03:17.990> towards<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.470> back

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
focus is really shifted towards the back

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.890 
focus is really shifted towards the back
end<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.100> so<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.310> do<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.550> lot<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:19.850> writing<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.660> the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
end and so I do a lot of writing of the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.900 
end and so I do a lot of writing of the
builders<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.650> curious<00:03:22.070> commands<00:03:22.430> that<00:03:22.670> are

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
builders the curious commands that are

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.470 
builders the curious commands that are
in<00:03:23.180> matrix<00:03:24.280> my<00:03:25.280> major<00:03:25.490> focus<00:03:25.760> for<00:03:25.970> working

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
in matrix my major focus for working

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.970 
in matrix my major focus for working
with<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.690> gem<00:03:26.900> vision<00:03:27.140> development<00:03:27.560> team<00:03:27.770> is

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
with the gem vision development team is

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.820 
with the gem vision development team is
for<00:03:28.700> all<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:28.910> user<00:03:29.480> interface<00:03:30.020> design<00:03:30.470> and

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
for all the user interface design and

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.370 
for all the user interface design and
the<00:03:30.890> workflow<00:03:31.460> i'm<00:03:32.090> known<00:03:32.600> as<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.900> button

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
the workflow i'm known as the button

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.890 
the workflow i'm known as the button
girl<00:03:33.560> around<00:03:34.070> here<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.580> I<00:03:34.700> design<00:03:35.540> anything

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
girl around here and I design anything

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.100 
girl around here and I design anything
from<00:03:36.440> what<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.040> click<00:03:37.280> on<00:03:37.930> working<00:03:38.930> through

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
from what you click on working through

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.140 
from what you click on working through
matrix<00:03:39.620> working<00:03:40.100> on<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.280> tools<00:03:40.490> the<00:03:40.820> builders

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
matrix working on the tools the builders

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150 
matrix working on the tools the builders
so<00:03:41.510> any<00:03:41.660> time<00:03:41.870> there's<00:03:42.050> a<00:03:42.110> new<00:03:42.140> idea<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.770> passes

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
so any time there's a new idea it passes

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.820 
so any time there's a new idea it passes
through<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.670> I<00:03:43.730> par<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.060> team<00:03:44.650> as<00:03:45.650> the

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
through and I par the team as the

developers<00:03:46.310> develop<00:03:47.000> matrix<00:03:47.480> seven<00:03:48.320> we<00:03:49.220> look

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
developers develop matrix seven we look

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.550 
developers develop matrix seven we look
at<00:03:49.520> the<00:03:49.610> new<00:03:49.730> tool<00:03:50.000> sets<00:03:50.300> we<00:03:51.020> figure<00:03:51.290> out<00:03:51.350> how

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
at the new tool sets we figure out how

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.930 
at the new tool sets we figure out how
they<00:03:51.740> work<00:03:51.980> in<00:03:52.220> conjunction<00:03:52.430> with<00:03:52.820> one

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
they work in conjunction with one

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.930 
they work in conjunction with one
another<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:53.660> then<00:03:54.350> how<00:03:54.590> that<00:03:54.620> applies<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.580> a

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
another and then how that applies to a

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.420 
another and then how that applies to a
specific<00:03:56.350> jewelry<00:03:57.350> concept<00:03:57.920> so<00:03:58.640> we<00:03:58.790> take<00:03:59.150> that

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
specific jewelry concept so we take that

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.590 
specific jewelry concept so we take that
concept<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.730> we<00:04:01.790> break<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:02.180> down<00:04:02.300> into

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
concept and we break it down into

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.590 
concept and we break it down into
step-by-step<00:04:03.410> processes<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.970> write

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
step-by-step processes and write

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.320 
step-by-step processes and write
tutorials<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.500> create<00:04:06.770> tutorial<00:04:07.489> videos<00:04:07.880> for

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
tutorials and create tutorial videos for

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.660 
tutorials and create tutorial videos for
our<00:04:08.360> end<00:04:08.780> users<00:04:08.989> so<00:04:09.860> that<00:04:09.890> they<00:04:10.190> have<00:04:10.550> an

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
our end users so that they have an

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.240 
our end users so that they have an
easier<00:04:11.000> time<00:04:11.030> learning<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.720> program<00:04:12.220> so<00:04:13.220> I

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
easier time learning the program so I

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.270 
easier time learning the program so I
was<00:04:13.550> lead<00:04:13.850> developer<00:04:14.330> for<00:04:14.630> matric<00:04:15.350> seven<00:04:15.770> I've

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
lot of new functionality compared to

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.260 
lot of new functionality compared to
matrix<00:04:27.230> six<00:04:27.500> I<00:04:27.830> think<00:04:28.669> one<00:04:28.850> of<00:04:28.880> the<00:04:29.060> biggest

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
matrix six I think one of the biggest

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.330 
matrix six I think one of the biggest
challenges<00:04:29.990> in<00:04:30.200> the<00:04:30.320> support<00:04:30.740> department

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
challenges in the support department

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.170 
challenges in the support department
regarding<00:04:32.120> T<00:04:32.540> splines<00:04:32.810> is<00:04:33.820> knowing<00:04:34.820> when<00:04:35.150> to

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
regarding T splines is knowing when to

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.290 
regarding T splines is knowing when to
use<00:04:36.110> T<00:04:36.380> splines<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:37.190> offer<00:04:37.580> that<00:04:37.910> for<00:04:38.180> as<00:04:38.270> a

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
use T splines and offer that for as a

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.840 
use T splines and offer that for as a
solution<00:04:38.720> for<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.200> model<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:39.830> when<00:04:40.310> to<00:04:40.460> just<00:04:40.700> do

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
solution for a model and when to just do

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.630 
solution for a model and when to just do
it<00:04:40.940> at<00:04:41.090> nerves<00:04:41.390> because<00:04:42.110> a<00:04:42.440> lot<00:04:42.980> of<00:04:43.010> times<00:04:43.340> with

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
it at nerves because a lot of times with

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.460 
it at nerves because a lot of times with
a<00:04:43.669> new

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
a new

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.360 
a new
tool<00:04:45.780> Travis<00:04:46.780> as<00:04:46.930> is<00:04:47.110> saying<00:04:47.350> get<00:04:48.130> a<00:04:48.160> new

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
tool Travis as is saying get a new

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.890 
tool Travis as is saying get a new
hammer<00:04:48.670> and<00:04:48.940> everything<00:04:49.330> looks<00:04:49.540> like<00:04:49.690> a<00:04:49.750> nail

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
hammer and everything looks like a nail

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.800 
hammer and everything looks like a nail
and<00:04:50.440> so<00:04:50.950> people<00:04:51.100> tend<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.610> get<00:04:51.760> a<00:04:51.820> new<00:04:52.090> tool<00:04:52.420> and

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
and so people tend to get a new tool and

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.350 
and so people tend to get a new tool and
they<00:04:52.930> tend<00:04:53.200> to<00:04:53.290> use<00:04:53.530> that<00:04:53.860> for<00:04:54.610> everything<00:04:55.180> and

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
they tend to use that for everything and

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.330 
they tend to use that for everything and
then<00:04:55.960> so<00:04:56.140> I<00:04:56.170> think<00:04:56.500> we<00:04:56.620> need<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:56.860> really<00:04:57.040> look

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
then so I think we need to really look

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.310 
then so I think we need to really look
at<00:04:57.490> models<00:04:57.970> and<00:04:58.180> say<00:04:58.330> well<00:04:58.570> this<00:04:58.780> is<00:04:58.930> a<00:04:58.960> NURBS

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
at models and say well this is a NURBS

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.740 
at models and say well this is a NURBS
model<00:04:59.830> this<00:04:59.950> is<00:05:00.130> a<00:05:00.160> t-splines<00:05:00.640> model<00:05:01.240> and<00:05:01.390> then

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
model this is a t-splines model and then

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.000 
model this is a t-splines model and then
of<00:05:01.870> course<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:02.200> have<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:02.530> challenge<00:05:02.740> of

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
of course you have the challenge of

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.920 
of course you have the challenge of
learning<00:05:03.160> T<00:05:03.550> splines<00:05:03.790> but<00:05:04.210> I<00:05:04.240> it'll<00:05:04.840> be

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
learning T splines but I it'll be

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.540 
learning T splines but I it'll be
interesting<00:05:05.140> to<00:05:05.350> see<00:05:05.470> what<00:05:05.710> models<00:05:06.310> lend

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
interesting to see what models lend

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.970 
interesting to see what models lend
themselves<00:05:06.760> to<00:05:07.180> that<00:05:07.480> technology<00:05:07.980> would

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
themselves to that technology would

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.770 
themselves to that technology would

we've<00:06:03.370> changed<00:06:03.670> this<00:06:03.970> now<00:06:04.240> people<00:06:04.540> are<00:06:04.600> very

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
we've changed this now people are very

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.810 
we've changed this now people are very
used<00:06:05.110> to<00:06:05.230> this<00:06:05.320> but<00:06:05.650> I<00:06:05.740> think<00:06:06.010> that<00:06:06.400> if<00:06:06.490> we<00:06:06.640> did

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
used to this but I think that if we did

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.320 
used to this but I think that if we did
this<00:06:06.970> in<00:06:07.150> logical<00:06:07.690> rose<00:06:08.340> it'll<00:06:09.340> be<00:06:09.430> fine<00:06:09.700> to<00:06:10.060> go

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
this in logical rose it'll be fine to go

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.150 
this in logical rose it'll be fine to go
ahead<00:06:10.390> and<00:06:10.690> keep<00:06:11.050> it<00:06:11.230> the<00:06:11.320> way<00:06:11.350> it<00:06:11.470> is<00:06:11.650> there's

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
ahead and keep it the way it is there's

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:22.420 
ahead and keep it the way it is there's
a<00:06:12.250> new<00:06:12.520> princess
