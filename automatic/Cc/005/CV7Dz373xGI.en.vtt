00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello very good everyone I love 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.859
 skis and in the video today I bring you a 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.600
 pixel art in minecraft xbox 360 made 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.030
 for me I can not be 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.620
 and before showing you what I wanted 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.410
 tell you not to be too cruel that I 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.900
 I had never done and I want to start with 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.590
 Something simple, well, I'm going to 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.250
 teach the green shell 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.910
 the mushroom 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.330
 this mushroom has more videos than I kissed 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.330
 the mysterious box 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.809
 a little flower from the fire of the vile 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.140
 bullet and the siwi and missed no more than as 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.239
 you can see there is a carnivorous plant 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.070
 throwing a ball of fire I will move away 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.320
 first a tad so you can see it 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.970
 all right 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.980
 do not turn your back on me because there is another 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.070
 pixelar and I do not want you to see it is 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.040
 for another video and it has nothing to do with me 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.860
 with mario's so 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.110
 well, as you can see until 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.690
 the plant makes the gesture of as if 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.600
 I was throwing the ball 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.900
 and good not 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.520
 it's not very complicated it costs a little 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.360
 because what's in the mouth you have to have 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.840
 patience but it's very easy as you can 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.450
 see the ball also neither does 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.340
 It has a lot of complication and the pipe 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.270
 It is made in 3-d because it is made in 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.700
 3-d 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.090
 I do not know, but from a distance 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.420
 pretty cool and as we see up close 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.340
 it sticks out a little here and the plant 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.190
 it's like inside, so to speak 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.289
 to do grace and here there is no 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.210
 much more because like this you do not see 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.640
 we do not have it like in the head 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:54.119
 but other than if you see if you see we have 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.119
 put here as light and shadow 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.950
 and well let's do a little goes 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.560
 so you can see well 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.100
 and nothing I hope you liked and 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.100
 until next time
