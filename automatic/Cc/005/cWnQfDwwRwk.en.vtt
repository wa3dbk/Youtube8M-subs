kind of diagnosing from the hip and he

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.810 
kind of diagnosing from the hip and he
thinks<00:00:39.410> it<00:00:39.560> could<00:00:39.800> be<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.220> pressure<00:00:40.579> plate

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
thinks it could be the pressure plate

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.720 
thinks it could be the pressure plate
and<00:00:41.810> if<00:00:41.989> its<00:00:42.140> clutch<00:00:42.410> disc<00:00:42.890> you<00:00:43.460> know<00:00:43.550> I<00:00:43.579> had

I<00:00:46.130> haven't<00:00:46.370> been<00:00:46.520> out<00:00:46.700> slipping<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:47.239> clutch

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
I haven't been out slipping the clutch

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.130 
I haven't been out slipping the clutch

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
any but oh yeah I think single bad but I

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.050 
any but oh yeah I think single bad but I
have<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.380> couple<00:00:51.620> of<00:00:51.770> new<00:00:51.920> clutches<00:00:52.399> new<00:00:52.880> old

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
have a couple of new clutches new old

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.450 
have a couple of new clutches new old
stock<00:00:53.270> in<00:00:53.720> throwout<00:00:53.930> bearings<00:00:54.410> but<00:00:55.220> if<00:00:55.309> it's

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
stock in throwout bearings but if it's

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.280 
stock in throwout bearings but if it's
the<00:00:55.640> pressure<00:00:55.910> plate<00:00:56.180> I'm<00:00:56.930> in<00:00:57.079> trouble

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
the pressure plate I'm in trouble

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.510 
the pressure plate I'm in trouble
because<00:00:58.120> that<00:00:59.120> only<00:00:59.149> works<00:00:59.540> from<00:00:59.920> 1929<00:01:00.920> up<00:01:01.309> to

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
because that only works from 1929 up to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.970 
because that only works from 1929 up to
nineteen<00:01:01.910> thirty-six<00:01:02.420> through<00:01:02.930> 1936<00:01:03.770> and

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
nineteen thirty-six through 1936 and

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.830 
nineteen thirty-six through 1936 and
then<00:01:04.070> after<00:01:04.339> that<00:01:04.460> on<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.759> 2<00:01:04.939> 16's<00:01:05.479> are<00:01:05.689> all

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
then after that on the 2 16's are all

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.230 
then after that on the 2 16's are all
different<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:06.640> they're<00:01:07.640> little<00:01:07.850> harder<00:01:08.150> to

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
different so they're little harder to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.789 
different so they're little harder to
find<00:01:08.450> but<00:01:08.720> we're<00:01:09.020> going<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:09.200> get<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:09.409> in<00:01:09.500> here
