00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
kind of curious about is this lipstick

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.730 
kind of curious about is this lipstick
trio<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.540> comes<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.259> little<00:02:07.320> box

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
trio and it comes in this little box

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.930 
trio and it comes in this little box
like<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.539> slides<00:02:09.780> open<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.280> the

New<00:02:12.420> York<00:02:12.840> jazz<00:02:13.440> trio<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.580> think<00:02:14.790> there's

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
New York jazz trio and I think there's

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.520 
New York jazz trio and I think there's
another<00:02:15.270> set<00:02:15.660> in<00:02:15.900> fact<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.170> know<00:02:16.230> there's

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.890 
another set and that one I think was
called<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.650> Paris<00:02:20.100> trio<00:02:20.460> and<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.720> what
