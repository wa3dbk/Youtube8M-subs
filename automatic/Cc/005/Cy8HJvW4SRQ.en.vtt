passenger side door jams are all in good

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.140 
passenger side door jams are all in good
shape<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:52.590> eight<00:04:52.770> killers<00:04:53.220> when<00:04:54.030> these

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
shape the the eight killers when these

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.180 
shape the the eight killers when these
t-tops<00:04:54.630> at<00:04:54.810> they<00:04:54.930> leak<00:04:55.170> the<00:04:55.530> water<00:04:55.740> runs<00:04:56.010> on

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
t-tops at they leak the water runs on

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.410 
t-tops at they leak the water runs on
these<00:04:56.340> eight<00:04:56.460> pillars<00:04:56.670> and<00:04:56.910> rots<00:04:57.060> these<00:04:57.270> eight

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
these eight pillars and rots these eight

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.390 
these eight pillars and rots these eight
pillars<00:04:57.660> out<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.170> both<00:04:58.650> sides<00:04:58.920> are<00:04:59.130> in<00:04:59.220> very

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
pillars out and both sides are in very

very good shape

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.230 
very good shape
so<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.860> dash<00:05:02.040> doesn't<00:05:02.430> have<00:05:02.550> any<00:05:02.700> cracks<00:05:02.880> in

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
so the dash doesn't have any cracks in

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.370 
so the dash doesn't have any cracks in
it<00:05:03.710> seats<00:05:04.710> aren't<00:05:04.919> worn<00:05:05.520> they're<00:05:05.760> just<00:05:05.910> faded

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
it seats aren't worn they're just faded

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.170 
it seats aren't worn they're just faded
let<00:05:07.380> me<00:05:07.500> open<00:05:07.800> up<00:05:08.010> the<00:05:08.190> passenger<00:05:08.880> side<00:05:09.330> here

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
let me open up the passenger side here

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.560 
let me open up the passenger side here
you<00:05:12.180> see<00:05:12.330> this<00:05:12.480> side<00:05:12.740> is<00:05:13.740> just<00:05:13.800> as<00:05:14.250> clean<00:05:14.570> as

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
you see this side is just as clean as

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.159 
you see this side is just as clean as
the<00:05:15.720> driver<00:05:15.990> side<00:05:16.820> bugs<00:05:17.840> just<00:05:18.840> sitting<00:05:19.140> there

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
the driver side bugs just sitting there

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:26.960 
the driver side bugs just sitting there
so<00:05:22.040> there<00:05:23.040> you<00:05:23.160> go<00:05:23.750> both<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:25.460> bolt<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.550> t-tops

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
so there you go both the bolt the t-tops

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.640 
so there you go both the bolt the t-tops
are<00:05:27.180> in<00:05:27.270> very<00:05:27.450> nice<00:05:27.600> shape<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.050> car<00:05:28.290> can<00:05:28.500> be<00:05:28.620> a

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
very very cool car once it is done so

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.820 
very very cool car once it is done so
just<00:05:32.250> like<00:05:32.910> my<00:05:33.090> other<00:05:33.240> projects<00:05:33.780> here<00:05:34.020> I<00:05:34.169> will

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
just like my other projects here I will

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.050 
just like my other projects here I will
fix<00:05:35.070> the<00:05:35.220> little<00:05:35.370> things<00:05:35.669> that<00:05:35.760> are<00:05:35.850> wrong

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
with it I'll put the the other wheels on

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.550 
with it I'll put the the other wheels on
the<00:05:38.700> other<00:05:38.820> side<00:05:39.060> that<00:05:39.090> are<00:05:39.419> get<00:05:40.290> rid<00:05:40.410> of<00:05:40.440> those

the other side that are get rid of those
flat<00:05:40.830> tires<00:05:41.100> put<00:05:41.460> the<00:05:41.580> other<00:05:41.790> rally<00:05:42.030> wheels<00:05:42.300> on

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
flat tires put the other rally wheels on

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.460 
flat tires put the other rally wheels on
it<00:05:42.570> and<00:05:43.340> just<00:05:44.340> tune<00:05:44.729> it<00:05:44.880> up<00:05:45.110> get<00:05:46.110> it<00:05:46.200> running

it and just tune it up get it running

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.900 
it and just tune it up get it running
good<00:05:46.590> it<00:05:46.740> does<00:05:46.890> have<00:05:47.100> a<00:05:47.130> leak<00:05:47.370> in<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.640> intake

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
good it does have a leak in the intake

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.370 
good it does have a leak in the intake
manifold<00:05:48.390> so<00:05:48.540> I'll<00:05:48.630> put<00:05:48.750> a<00:05:48.780> new<00:05:48.870> gasket<00:05:49.080> on

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
manifold so I'll put a new gasket on

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.090 
manifold so I'll put a new gasket on
that<00:05:49.590> as<00:05:50.130> well<00:05:50.400> but<00:05:51.140> put<00:05:52.140> all<00:05:52.169> the<00:05:52.380> broken
