00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.170
Hey Folks it's John from HelloArtsy.com, today
I'm going to show you how I transfer my pencil

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.500
drawing onto my canvas so that they can then
be painting.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.280
[intro music]

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:23.190
So I have this drawing of the hammer here
and I want to transfer it over to this toned

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.859
canvas.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.160
So I'm going to be using some transfer paper;
Saral makes this one.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.110
It comes on a roll and you can cut it to different
sizes and it's very reusable.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.290
So, you don't use it just once; you can use
it many times over.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:49.590
The first thing I want to do is line my drawing
up on the canvas, get it exactly where I want

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.360
it to be.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:01:00.900
You'll notice I put lines on the canvas and
on the paper and I've cut these little triangles

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.900
out.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.930
This helps me line it up and so I know that
this is going to be right in the middle, exactly

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.010
where I want it to be.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.510
I use these drafter's dots but you can just
use some tape.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.630
That's all this really is, it's convienient
little pieces of tape.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.160
I love these things.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.930
So now when I lift the drawing up it's [paper]
going to go back to the same place.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.500
I highly recommend taping your drawing down
otherwise you're going to get frustrated shifting

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.720
around once the transfer paper is in between.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.420
This transfer paper is one sided.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.220
This is the graphite-gray variety.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.290
If you're working on something really dark
like a black canvas you might want to go with

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.850
the white or one of the colors they offer.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:07.280
I'm going to put this in position and save
all the scraps because it's all reusable;

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.170
there's no need to custom cut.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:20.780
I'll just get this into place and put this
[paper] down.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:29.470
Just got to affix this down here.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.120
You don't want the paper buckling or moving
around.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.700
You just want to concentrate on replicating
your drawing very accurately.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.760
I like to use a red pen when I trace over
this for two reasons.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.790
The red pen allows me to see where I've already
traced.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.170
And, the metal ball that's in the pen ends
up pushing through and makes the transfer

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.180
pretty efficient.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.830
Because if you don't press hard enough you
don't get a good transfer.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.830
There.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.121
Now before I remove the paper completely I
always like to take a sneak peak just to make

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:13.080
sure everything turned out okay and I didn't
miss anything.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.130
Now this is going to be hard to see on the
video because it's a gray canvas and it's

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.120
a graphite gray transfer, but it's there.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.860
I'll bring it a little closer so you can see.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.060
I don't know how well this is going to show
up, but you you can see that it indeed did

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.060
do the transfer.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.709
That gives me really good information from
which to start a painting.

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.430
Transferring drawings to canvas has made my
painting workflow so much better!

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.819
Don't forget to head over to helloartsy.com
where I reveal, not only the tools I use in

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.910
the tutorials here, but the art supplies I
use in my everyday work as well.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.800
Thanks for watching.
