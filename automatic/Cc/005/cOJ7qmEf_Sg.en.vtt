00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:16.500
 good afternoon dear viewers still new 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.420
 video we shoot care great kicked 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.730
 We will talk about what moments 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.960
 we didnâ€™t tell the last video by 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.100
 try to cover as much as possible with 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.850
 what it all began 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:35.199
 there was a pantry life was small 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:38.079
 Such a door from such software for papal 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:43.269
 drywall old nails fastens it 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.739
 on the eternal frame on wooden hlipenko 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.460
 all of course we were all 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:51.429
 dismantled and the client needed 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.979
 set in this place fundamentally 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.440
 coupe door that you went to the wall 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:59.170
 there were other installers at this facility 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.210
 they told us we first collect 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.470
 drywall designs then we 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.510
 move the door then hang further currents 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.049
 the one who collects the drywall to the 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.460
 side further behind the tire and here's the advantage 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.680
 in what we do as 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.549
 universal drywall bear in 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.860
 that we can collect by ourselves 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.530
 design for yourself to do everything 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.590
 hang the door and sew up on both sides 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.960
 drywall and everything will be ideally yes and 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.930
 no one will give and then one 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.820
 he says badly drywall gasgas 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.550
 the case is consultants 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:42.160
 God made 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.310
 frame wall was created anew and 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.540
 so we had the opportunity 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.710
 get to the symmetry of that which 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.240
 which we could not achieve on that 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.560
 videos that you've seen a change 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.720
 here was just going to re- concrete 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.210
 the wall here is the concrete floor here 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.590
 here they are brick bricks but here 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:10.860
 the concrete here is fixed guides in two 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:14.280
 layer turned out that how to show 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.170
 it turned out that the wall turned out here 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.440
 guides then clearance under self 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.840
 canvas that minutes he went there and 2 2 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.310
 son as it almost got and you almost 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.310
 there is no door between them 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.610
 Profile fastened to the rail after 30 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.840
 30 centimeters 60 and here with the head itself 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:41.130
 which can have turned out but turned out on 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.130
 77 or seventy eight centimeters 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.739
 inside they put it like we usually 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.420
 do the timber beam dry timber did not believe 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.769
 when the load is dry, remember the bead 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.660
 will lead if it is dry 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.049
 nothing will happen to him he is my sukhum 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.500
 premises and no dynamism 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:03.340
 it will not manifest itself this frame 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.650
 he is reliable he is quite reliable it 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.019
 practically this wall turned out 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.320
 plaster wall plaster and remove this 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:19.060
 drywall well not really I will tell you but 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:20.739
 inferior in hardness and here with this 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.410
 hand which moment was very important 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:28.660
 the wall here is plaster ago 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.660
 it is thick but especially for 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.829
 to make the door stop by 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.510
 directly into the wall we need 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.989
 was 18 cm 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.420
 it's a bee and in order to issue 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.400
 this transition and to lay down the platband with us 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.680
 there must be a plane to 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.569
 windows personally for this to be all 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.569
 beautifully combined and looked had 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.810
 send here this box box 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:56.530
 then for make wallpaper for glues your 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.780
 connect glues wallpaper hill she visually 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.700
 will not be evident well we 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.359
 We win due to this the casing 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.299
 this one he remains whole no 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.879
 you don't write it down beautifully with a sword 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.609
 own prepared exactly 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.430
 for him the plane door calls in 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:17.109
 our case now we were limited 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.530
 in width i.e. here the price is already 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:24.039
 confidently calls in to this extent 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.070
 this is why it happened because there in 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:31.419
 fittings have their own under it 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:35.350
 there should already be something 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.660
 have their own conditions knocking as well as there itself 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.090
 fittings here is the back back fittings are not 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.070
 allowed us this is the maximum 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.150
 door burial did not allow us 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.460
 deeper further already the wall but it was not 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.289
 basically here is to align here 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.550
 grant was needed as much as possible 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.830
 wide opening 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.010
 so it was decided to do like this 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.349
 pens are also not half and if have 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:10.260
 you can make to come 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:10.260
 flush with dobora do here 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:19.330
 one moment is very important to simplify 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:25.270
 the whole construction here can be more 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:26.500
 played and played budget object budget 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.690
 what we did here 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.370
 the budget was limited and this one 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.949
 simplifying the design in order not to 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.910
 thought it all worked out was done 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.830
 that's exactly the connection 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.870
 set strap again 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.240
 dobore and here on the extra two sides 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:45.700
 the best course was to make 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:48.290
 groove on how better that how but 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.420
 deepening it for what was there 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.460
 200 ruined by a centimeter with this 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.400
 side and from this side so she like 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.100
 I would have made it a centimeter families 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.180
 requires absolutely zero 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:11.270
 it all went perfectly 28 meters 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:13.550
 bar 45 45 section then it took 20 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.620
 guides we collected here again 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.780
 is our favorite favorite in metal frames 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.230
 dual heading backrest 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:25.090
 urgent and invested in sad 20 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:28.040
 guides of 28 meters running bar 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:31.250
 three sheets of plasterboard well residues 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.880
 of course there is but this is not going anywhere 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.170
 getting around 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:38.020
 that is for this up to this design 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:41.129
 it took three sheets of drywall 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:48.270
 Well, the door itself and the moldings 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:52.679
 everything basically works well still 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:55.339
 such a moment that you have everything beautiful 

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:55.339
 combined 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:00.599
 doborah and all so in fact as if to the door 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:02.610
 maybe you like a small bias 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:04.979
 will appear so that's when you door you 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.479
 move here you see a picture here 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:10.949
 manifested to this drawing he 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:12.989
 appeared evenly everywhere then 

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:14.429
 everything will not be visible any there even if 

00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:16.349
 you won't do a little crookedly 

00:07:14.429 --> 00:07:18.769
 you can see Nikita rubble and here too 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:18.769
 it adjoins 

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:26.550
 the gap is the same but at the top you can 

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:29.069
 make a minimum clearance at all 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:31.080
 downstairs there is an elevator dropped from upstairs in 

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:34.429
 backlash on the rails almost no see 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:37.050
 here are practically no buckets 

00:07:34.429 --> 00:07:38.519
 below there are people at the bottom so for 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:42.989
 nonsense let's do more group he 

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:46.469
 practically minimal also now 

00:07:42.989 --> 00:07:50.069
 we were not well here you can still glue 

00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:54.240
 soft stickers for furniture 

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:55.499
 usually glued to furniture they are in order for 

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.249
 In order to not scratch the parquet 

00:07:55.499 --> 00:08:01.550
 I hope our video has helped you something 

00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:01.550
 for myself
