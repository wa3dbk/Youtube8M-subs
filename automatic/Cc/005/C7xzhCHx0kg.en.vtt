00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
to I kind of like maokai but my team

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.510 
to I kind of like maokai but my team
thinks<00:00:16.260> he's<00:00:16.470> really<00:00:16.650> bad<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.100> I'll<00:00:17.369> never

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
thinks he's really bad so I'll never

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.550 
thinks he's really bad so I'll never
play<00:00:17.670> him<00:00:17.850> why<00:00:18.840> don't<00:00:19.109> they<00:00:19.199> trust<00:00:19.380> your

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
play him why don't they trust your

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.070 
play him why don't they trust your
judgment<00:00:19.949> ok<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.430> don't<00:00:21.300> know<00:00:21.390> he<00:00:21.750> has<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> lot<00:00:22.050> of

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
judgment ok I don't know he has a lot of

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.480 
judgment ok I don't know he has a lot of
weaknesses<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.859> think<00:00:23.130> it's<00:00:23.220> also<00:00:23.279> really

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
weaknesses but I think it's also really

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.670 
weaknesses but I think it's also really
good<00:00:23.730> but<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.510> guess<00:00:24.750> he<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:25.140> doesn't<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
good but I guess he just doesn't have a

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.960 
good but I guess he just doesn't have a
place<00:00:25.859> right<00:00:25.980> now<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> current<00:00:26.820> meta

and harassed me and I thought maplewood

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.859 
and harassed me and I thought maplewood
be<00:01:31.439> there<00:01:31.590> too<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.670> sucks<00:01:33.150> when<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.540> try

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
be there too and it sucks when you try

be there too and it sucks when you try
to<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.079> greedy<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.439> not<00:01:34.530> smite<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.009> then

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
to be greedy and not smite it and then

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.890 
to be greedy and not smite it and then
it<00:01:35.189> gets<00:01:35.250> stolen<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> wasn't<00:01:36.600> able<00:01:36.720> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
it gets stolen so I wasn't able to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.719 
it gets stolen so I wasn't able to
invade<00:01:37.110> his<00:01:37.350> blue<00:01:37.530> after<00:01:37.799> mine<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.430> had<00:01:38.700> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
invade his blue after mine so I had to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.490 
invade his blue after mine so I had to
do<00:01:38.880> read<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.869> he<00:01:40.020> was<00:01:40.140> able<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.380> get

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
do read and then so he was able to get

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.859 
do read and then so he was able to get
his<00:01:40.560> red<00:01:40.860> blue<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.369> then<00:01:41.850> defend<00:01:42.180> top<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.659> if

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
his red blue and then defend top and if

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.050 
his red blue and then defend top and if
we<00:01:42.899> tried<00:01:43.170> diving<00:01:43.500> 3v2<00:01:43.890> against<00:01:44.670> her<00:01:44.759> neck<00:01:44.909> on

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
we tried diving 3v2 against her neck on

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.450 
we tried diving 3v2 against her neck on
drivin<00:01:45.420> will<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.750> die<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.950> my<00:01:47.250> only<00:01:47.399> option

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
drivin will just die so my only option

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.580 
drivin will just die so my only option
is<00:01:47.790> really<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.149> defend<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.540> rumble<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.020> we

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
is really to defend with rumble and we

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.289 
is really to defend with rumble and we
knew<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.829> wasn't<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.100> best<00:01:50.340> matchups<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.149> us

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
knew it wasn't the best matchups for us

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.210 
knew it wasn't the best matchups for us
but<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:51.990> thought<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:52.619> could<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.829> do<00:01:53.040> some

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
but we thought if we could just do some

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.590 
but we thought if we could just do some
damage<00:01:53.369> control<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.000> not<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.299> too<00:01:54.420> far

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
damage control and not get too far

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.940 
damage control and not get too far
behind<00:01:54.659> then<00:01:55.110> we'd<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.409> all<00:01:55.500> right<00:01:55.649> yeah<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
behind then we'd be all right yeah the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.319 
behind then we'd be all right yeah the
lesser<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.280> two<00:01:56.369> evils<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.909> game<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
lesser of two evils in that game and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.850 
lesser of two evils in that game and
then<00:01:57.659> when<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.020> were<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.290> little<00:01:58.439> bit<00:01:58.740> behind

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
then when you were a little bit behind

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.310 
then when you were a little bit behind
getting<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.579> dragon<00:01:59.939> fight<00:02:00.149> how<00:02:01.020> did<00:02:01.229> you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
getting that dragon fight how did you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.319 
getting that dragon fight how did you
get<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.680> fight<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.280> conveniently<00:02:02.820> right<00:02:02.909> at

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
get that fight so conveniently right at

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.700 
get that fight so conveniently right at
the<00:02:03.420> dragon<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.930> completely<00:02:04.320> clean<00:02:04.439> them<00:02:04.619> up

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
the dragon to completely clean them up

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.950 
the dragon to completely clean them up
uh<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.909> didn't<00:02:06.149> have<00:02:06.270> vision<00:02:06.630> when<00:02:06.750> they<00:02:06.810> did

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
uh we didn't have vision when they did

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.300 
uh we didn't have vision when they did
the<00:02:07.020> first<00:02:07.079> dragon<00:02:07.619> but<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:07.860> saw<00:02:07.979> them<00:02:08.129> leaving

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the first dragon but we saw them leaving

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.770 
the first dragon but we saw them leaving
it<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:08.640> we<00:02:08.729> knew<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.970> spawned<00:02:09.179> around<00:02:09.390> 14

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
it so we knew it spawned around 14

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.780 
it so we knew it spawned around 14
minutes<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:11.099> just<00:02:11.190> had<00:02:11.310> everyone<00:02:11.610> come

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
minutes and so we just had everyone come

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.350 
minutes and so we just had everyone come
down<00:02:11.970> for<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.390> and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
down for it and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.000 
down for it and
grouped<00:02:13.600> up<00:02:13.750> perfectly<00:02:14.170> they<00:02:14.380> had<00:02:14.470> about<00:02:14.680> four

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010

people including their carry standing
together<00:02:16.570> and<00:02:16.900> we<00:02:16.960> just<00:02:17.080> got<00:02:17.200> an<00:02:17.290> ashy<00:02:17.440> arrow

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
together and we just got an ashy arrow

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.350 
together and we just got an ashy arrow
and<00:02:17.890> then<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.010> sack<00:02:18.280> jump<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.790> then<00:02:18.880> Rumble<00:02:19.240> all

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
yeah and then after that it was just

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.510 
yeah and then after that it was just
kind<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.560> history<00:02:23.830> another<00:02:24.070> victory<00:02:24.460> for

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
kind of history another victory for

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.210 
kind of history another victory for
cloud<00:02:24.850> nine<00:02:25.060> which<00:02:25.270> is<00:02:25.300> now<00:02:25.870> 16<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.770> two<00:02:26.980> on

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
cloud nine which is now 16 and two on

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.330 
cloud nine which is now 16 and two on
the<00:02:27.250> year<00:02:27.850> how<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:29.020> cloud<00:02:29.230> nine<00:02:29.440> still<00:02:29.890> working

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
the year how is cloud nine still working

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.450 
the year how is cloud nine still working
so<00:02:30.580> well<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:31.030> late<00:02:31.240> into<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.480> season<00:02:31.710> um<00:02:32.710> I

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
so well this late into the season um I

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.590 
so well this late into the season um I
guess<00:02:33.610> we<00:02:33.730> don't<00:02:33.790> really<00:02:33.880> let<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.240> winds<00:02:34.450> get

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
guess we don't really let the winds get

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.750 
guess we don't really let the winds get
to<00:02:34.690> our<00:02:34.720> head<00:02:34.990> we<00:02:35.140> still<00:02:35.410> take<00:02:36.160> each<00:02:36.340> game<00:02:36.370> very

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
to our head we still take each game very

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.340 
to our head we still take each game very
seriously<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:37.390> know<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.690> lot<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.870> people<00:02:37.960> see

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
seriously I know a lot of people see

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.020 
seriously I know a lot of people see
velocity<00:02:38.530> as<00:02:38.770> underdogs<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:39.459> last<00:02:39.730> night<00:02:39.940> we

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.310 
what we wanted to do during the game so
we<00:02:45.430> take<00:02:45.610> every<00:02:45.760> game<00:02:46.030> very<00:02:46.270> seriously<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:47.020> we

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
we take every game very seriously and we

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.540 
we take every game very seriously and we
try<00:02:47.440> not<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.590> get<00:02:47.709> complacent<00:02:48.040> or<00:02:48.250> anything

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
try not to get complacent or anything

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.280 
try not to get complacent or anything
and<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:49.330> think<00:02:49.390> that's<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.900> lot<00:02:49.990> of<00:02:50.050> teams

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
and I think that's a lot of teams

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.380 
and I think that's a lot of teams
downfalls<00:02:50.770> just<00:02:51.130> assuming<00:02:52.090> they'll<00:02:52.239> win

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
downfalls just assuming they'll win

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.360 
downfalls just assuming they'll win
every<00:02:52.600> game<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:53.020> then<00:02:53.260> going<00:02:53.410> into<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.920> and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
every game and then going into it and

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.680 
every game and then going into it and
getting<00:02:54.550> blindsided<00:02:54.910> by<00:02:55.150> thinks<00:02:55.390> they<00:02:55.480> didn't

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
getting blindsided by thinks they didn't

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.090 
getting blindsided by thinks they didn't
expect<00:02:56.050> so<00:02:56.200> we<00:02:56.320> try<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.470> take<00:02:56.650> everything<00:02:56.890> into

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
expect so we try to take everything into

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.010 
expect so we try to take everything into
account<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.610> we<00:02:58.209> just<00:02:58.450> try<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.570> play<00:02:58.720> as<00:02:58.750> smart

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
account and we just try to play as smart

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.660 
account and we just try to play as smart
as<00:02:59.080> we<00:02:59.200> can<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.530> without<00:02:59.920> making<00:03:00.220> go<00:03:00.340> into<00:03:00.520> too

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
as we can and without making go into too

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.070 
as we can and without making go into too
much<00:03:00.700> detail<00:03:00.820> what<00:03:01.480> kind<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.720> things<00:03:01.930> do<00:03:02.050> you

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
much detail what kind of things do you

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.240 
much detail what kind of things do you
talk<00:03:02.320> about<00:03:02.350> in<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.709> two<00:03:02.860> hours<00:03:03.130> we're

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
talk about in the two hours we're

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.650 
talk about in the two hours we're
preparing<00:03:03.640> for<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:03.940> velocity<00:03:04.060> game<00:03:04.450> for

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
preparing for the velocity game for

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.020 
preparing for the velocity game for
instance<00:03:04.959> well<00:03:05.830> generally<00:03:06.250> we<00:03:06.400> just<00:03:06.610> pull<00:03:06.880> all

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
instance well generally we just pull all

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.699 
instance well generally we just pull all
the<00:03:07.150> champions<00:03:07.540> we<00:03:07.750> want<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.410> other<00:03:08.530> team

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
the champions we want and the other team

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.130 
the champions we want and the other team
ones<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.130> then<00:03:09.580> we<00:03:09.670> banned<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.060> ones<00:03:10.239> that<00:03:10.540> we

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
ones and then we banned the ones that we

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.810 
ones and then we banned the ones that we
don't<00:03:11.380> like<00:03:11.530> dealing<00:03:11.770> with<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:12.310> then<00:03:12.430> we<00:03:12.640> try

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
don't like dealing with and then we try

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.340 
don't like dealing with and then we try
to<00:03:12.880> guess<00:03:13.060> what<00:03:13.150> they'll<00:03:13.390> ban<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:13.870> then<00:03:14.260> we

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
to guess what they'll ban and then we

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.060 
to guess what they'll ban and then we
just<00:03:14.500> sort<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.680> go<00:03:14.770> through<00:03:14.830> different

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
just sort of go through different

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.800 
just sort of go through different
scenarios<00:03:15.550> like<00:03:15.730> if<00:03:16.000> all<00:03:16.270> these<00:03:16.390> champions

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
scenarios like if all these champions

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.970 
scenarios like if all these champions
are<00:03:16.930> banned<00:03:17.080> in<00:03:17.140> all<00:03:17.290> these<00:03:17.410> champions<00:03:17.860> are

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
are banned in all these champions are

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.620 
are banned in all these champions are
banned<00:03:18.160> then<00:03:18.730> they'll<00:03:19.000> probably<00:03:19.180> first<00:03:19.420> pick

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
banned then they'll probably first pick

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.820 
banned then they'll probably first pick
this<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.019> then<00:03:20.110> we<00:03:20.200> can<00:03:20.350> get<00:03:20.470> this<00:03:20.590> and

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
this and then we can get this and

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.750 
this and then we can get this and
they'll<00:03:20.980> get<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.370> we<00:03:21.430> just<00:03:21.459> go<00:03:21.610> through

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
they'll get that and we just go through

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.820 
they'll get that and we just go through
a<00:03:21.820> lot<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.060> different<00:03:22.090> scenarios<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:22.900> we<00:03:23.590> just

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
a lot of different scenarios and we just

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.190 
a lot of different scenarios and we just
try<00:03:24.580> to<00:03:24.610> get<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.090> best<00:03:25.209> draft<00:03:25.510> for<00:03:25.750> us<00:03:25.870> it

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
try to get the best draft for us it

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.720 
try to get the best draft for us it
sounds<00:03:26.440> like<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.590> very<00:03:26.680> collaborative<00:03:27.070> process

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
sounds like a very collaborative process

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.310 
sounds like a very collaborative process
is<00:03:27.910> there<00:03:28.060> someone<00:03:28.299> who<00:03:28.450> leads<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:28.930> process

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
is there someone who leads that process

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.539 
is there someone who leads that process
amongst<00:03:29.620> your<00:03:29.709> chamber<00:03:29.980> is<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.160> really<00:03:30.340> just<00:03:30.459> a

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
amongst your chamber is it really just a

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.130 
amongst your chamber is it really just a
group<00:03:30.700> effort<00:03:30.820> generally<00:03:31.390> lemon<00:03:31.720> leads<00:03:31.930> the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
group effort generally lemon leads the

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.800 
group effort generally lemon leads the
draft<00:03:32.580> lemon<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:33.760> then<00:03:33.940> Alex<00:03:34.239> pendu<00:03:34.570> the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
draft lemon and then Alex pendu the

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.600 
draft lemon and then Alex pendu the
majority<00:03:35.200> of<00:03:35.230> it<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:35.440> helped<00:03:35.769> a<00:03:35.860> lot<00:03:35.980> then

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
majority of it I helped a lot then

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.740 
majority of it I helped a lot then
everyone<00:03:36.880> else<00:03:36.940> sort<00:03:37.239> of<00:03:37.299> gives<00:03:37.480> her<00:03:37.600> two

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
everyone else sort of gives her two

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.330 
everyone else sort of gives her two
cents<00:03:37.989> just<00:03:38.320> like<00:03:38.500> oh<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.709> hate<00:03:38.980> that<00:03:39.010> matchup

velocity we have a big gap between our
now<00:03:53.380> in<00:03:53.620> our<00:03:53.769> Coast<00:03:54.400> game<00:03:54.610> so<00:03:54.880> we'll<00:03:55.299> do<00:03:55.450> the
