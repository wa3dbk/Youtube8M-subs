really is a nice feature because you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.130 
really is a nice feature because you
know<00:01:59.159> as<00:01:59.340> your<00:01:59.520> skis<00:01:59.880> or<00:02:00.270> your<00:02:00.390> boots<00:02:00.659> sort<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
know as your skis or your boots sort of

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.500 
know as your skis or your boots sort of
wear<00:02:01.409> out<00:02:01.440> over<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.010> years<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.729> heel<00:02:03.090> really

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
wear out over the years the heel really

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.990 
wear out over the years the heel really
takes<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.869> beating<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.260> having<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.070> plastic

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
takes a beating so having that plastic

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.270 
takes a beating so having that plastic
heel<00:02:06.270> counter<00:02:06.540> keeps<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.409> boot<00:02:07.590> from<00:02:08.039> wearing

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
heel counter keeps the boot from wearing

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.160 
heel counter keeps the boot from wearing
out<00:02:08.489> faster<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> boot<00:02:09.959> that'll

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
out faster so this is a boot that'll

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.479 
out faster so this is a boot that'll
last<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.439> little<00:02:10.530> bit<00:02:10.619> longer<00:02:10.709> over<00:02:11.159> the<00:02:11.250> years

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
last a little bit longer over the years

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.520

the T 4 Rockefeller T for binding
mounted<00:04:12.389> on<00:04:12.540> this<00:04:12.720> Evo<00:04:13.199> to<00:04:13.379> our<00:04:13.440> ski<00:04:13.680> this<00:04:14.099> is

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
mounted on this Evo to our ski this is

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.150 
mounted on this Evo to our ski this is
the<00:04:14.519> N<00:04:14.669> is<00:04:15.079> version<00:04:16.079> meaning<00:04:16.709> that<00:04:17.010> it

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
the N is version meaning that it

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.279 
the N is version meaning that it
integrates<00:04:17.849> into<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:18.269> black<00:04:18.630> plate<00:04:19.019> that's

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
integrates into this black plate that's
