00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 currently the systems 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.339
 biometric fingerprints have 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.750
 contributed a lot in the process improvement 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.820
 and security control how they work 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.670
 a client arrives at the point of contact and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.859
 this one must be enrolled that is to say it is created 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.020
 a file with your personal data and your 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.970
 fingerprint with which it feeds 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.250
 a data base 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.260
 then in future opportunities it 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.840
 contrast the live fingerprint with the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.480
 database created and verified well 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.700
 his identity however the systems 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
 traditional when enlisting administer a 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.719
 database by multiple users and 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.960
 use standard bass equipment 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.390
 they usually generate important data failures 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.789
 erroneous spoofing scams 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.640
 filtration identity of the bases of 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.980
 data and so on what is translated 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.420
 finally in scams for manipulation 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.829
 of an imperfect system 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.829
 now comes toc 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.970
 It is the first biometric system in 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.220
 identity verification and signature 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.260
 electronic that uses the footprint 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.850
 fingerprint comparing it with information 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.840
 contained in the identity card 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.140
 national issued by the civil registry 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.630
 It is 100% safe since it does not require 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.360
 Enrollment does not use or build bases 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.460
 of data uses the best hardware 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.470
 world in recognition of footprints 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.060
 fingerprints and reading of identification cards 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.039
 Identity is fast robust and reliable 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.440
 with more than 4 years of service in the 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.720
 market and more than 20 million 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.880
 secure transactions what is the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.340
 safest system in the country and the only 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.210
 that operates with both identity cards 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.210
 current how the system works 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.619
 verify the identity of the people 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.170
 comparing the information contained in 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.030
 the identity card issued by the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.720
 civil registry with fingerprint 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.450
 live presence of each person and everything 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.509
 in a simple process in a few seconds and 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.500
 100% sure that applications allow 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.290
 I touched 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.840
 verify identity control access 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.710
 to assistance in offices wineries 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.470
 stadiums public buildings notaries and 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.410
 others perform operations with certainty 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.870
 user's presence access online 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.060
 to commercial information sign 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.180
 electronically various types of 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.090
 documents such as employment contracts 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.150
 credit insurance services requests 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.640
 etcetera you can also make use of 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.650
 all technology touch through 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.860
 mobile devices like notebooks 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.989
 tablets and smartphones carrying all the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.840
 possibilities and tools to touch 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.690
 Anywhere and in real time 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.940
 in short toc is the new system 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.450
 biometric fingerprint of the future 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.310
 Robust fast safe and reliable that 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.630
 to authorize access to your 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.430
 information 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.800
 optimize processes and sign 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.800
 electronically everything you need
