 especially so it's the end of the world 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.530
 be careful on Fridays it's the end of 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.580

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.509
 I personally tell you 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.260
 characters and geek is like a big to 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.780
 you understood a big goal I the 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.550
 would put I think about the comments and 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.700
 so I will surely be just a 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.300
 gallery that like a probant and you 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.430
 what are you going to do 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.000
 I would like that sells so the witnesses in 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.750
 your comments 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.400
 what you think of doing and if you 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.740
 go home not go out and your colleagues 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.750
 the cinema I had call of duty do not know 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.240
 nothing to eat with granny grandpa it's not 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.820
 a game just know actually know a 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.850
 as if they were at a small step 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.400
 a debate but good 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.479
 how to know a little about what 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.770
 people so if not talk so about the 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.840
 end of the world it's quite complex because 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.880
 that there are still many subjects 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.380
 addressed first thing I 'm a 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.729
 first talked about seriousness so 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.690
 personally my job so these 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.060
 firefighters and so that's just actually on 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.770
 will say preventive information for 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.319
 the region that are quite weak 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.670
 of mind that is to say that is to say I 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.980
 I'm not sure why not already 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.959
 not stupid but people there these facts 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.000
 of mind that are made to his influences and 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.459
 quickly so that's it I give you this 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.440
 advice avoided it so if you go out 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.630
 your pals or even all alone on the street 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.640
 that night I personally 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.989
 say life will have riots it will not be 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.380
 the end of the world I do not really believe 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.850
 his life an interest to see in there but 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.810
 personally I believe a lot in 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.190
 made to the riots 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.040
 so this is a tip that I give a 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.410
 beautiful job she sells more often I 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.110
 work so I think so let's go 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.569
 ask a child if I will not go is 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.870
 good so it's just I'm just telling you 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.549
 actually avoid riots because if 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.959
 you put in there you risk to 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.360
 get you into anything 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.829
 so I do not think it's your 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.560
 inside there 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.579
 after also avoid breaks and everything 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.560
 which is then because you are going 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.030
 we really make really people 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.920
 suggestible it goes very very fast 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.570
 he follows when you go to make 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.040
 breakages anything's going to happen I 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.500
 really wanted it really 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.470
 happen everyone will do anything 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.440
 what's it going to be really apocalypse 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.299
 but the apocalypse in a sense it does not 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.250
 chaotic where you 're going to die but it's going 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.799
 to be a little anything after 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.850
 second thing here so suicides 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.820
 collective 1 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.549
 sorry for this little sexual moment 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.130
 but actually it's a guy who's been 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.840
 during village stop to kill in 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.769
 the organized egg the tiebreak good brief 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.329
 passing off about there so I was saying the 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.400
 collective suicides pay attention to that 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.180
 also people because there is really 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.640
 fools everywhere 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.690
 no i strongly advise you to do 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.329
 watch out for those people 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.260
 but collective suicides happen 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.060
 very quickly so 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.390
 I strongly advise you to do 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.439
 watch out for that to avoid people not 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.379
 very how to say not very well what 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:05.569
 if not then let's go back to the rhombus gameplay 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.430
 so there currently at 54.6 that you 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.269
 can see so that's a pretty part 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:14.409
 Arabic or outright have done a lot 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:17.570
 a lot of beautiful scores in fact French 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:20.060
 I am Catalan it's normal and as we 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.610
 can see I play with great ledroit 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.550
 descrambling orbital station attention 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.090
 airlocks and bonuses of the mali aide 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.470
 strict really existed to death as you 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.090
 see it I'm not stopping xp leak 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.800
 so my colleagues actually they did 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.210
 exactly the same thing and the whole 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.130
 part we had micro station 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.100
 orbital non stop as it was boost 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.840
 in fact it's not nice to see but it's 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.789
 like boost actually because all the 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.310
 time it's exactly summers and that's 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:49.639
 really very very easy to dll and kill 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.770
 not so if not now back the 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.050
 main topic the end of the world 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.250
 so here I talked about the serious side 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.789
 I do not hurry because that 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.210
 70 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.440
 so what are you pressing seriously 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.539
 the emissions going on right now 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.320
 so this is on m6 or any 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.599
 chain 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.610
 he explains in pl bugarach me I live 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.410
 to perpignan and then to each side of 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.760
 at home because I know that there 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.900
 it's blocking everything is blocked so if 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.400
 never paper people who go into 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.539
 the video that follows garage that marks in 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.070
 the comments how is it going at 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.990
 level of the ba if it's hot enough 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.820
 because they live everything is blocked 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.229
 stop anything there are people 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.440
 who cover german who will see some 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:26.979
 UFOs that will bring in a vortex is 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.419
 the guy who believe themselves on halo 4 types 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.490
 after a lot of people doing stuff 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.440

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.169
