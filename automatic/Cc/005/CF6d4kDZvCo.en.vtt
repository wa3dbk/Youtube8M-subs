you<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:33.450> bridge<00:01:33.689> collapsing<00:01:35.329> but<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:37.200> want

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
to get over it a little bit quickly

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.410 
to get over it a little bit quickly
because<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.200> does<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.920> does<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.420> collapse

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420

because it does it does do that collapse
that<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:44.659> keep<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.780> mind

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.760 

all<00:01:48.530> right<00:01:52.479> if<00:01:53.479> I<00:01:53.689> accidentally<00:01:54.229> stay<00:01:54.500> on<00:01:54.619> the

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
all right if I accidentally stay on the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.960 
all right if I accidentally stay on the
bridge<00:01:54.890> when<00:01:55.100> it<00:01:55.130> collapses<00:01:55.700> you'll

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
bridge when it collapses you'll

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.240 
bridge when it collapses you'll
definitely<00:01:56.390> see<00:01:56.570> it<00:01:56.720> clapping<00:01:57.229> so<00:02:00.250> usually

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
definitely see it clapping so usually

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.590 
definitely see it clapping so usually
you<00:02:01.610> can<00:02:01.729> get<00:02:01.850> over<00:02:01.970> it<00:02:02.119> pretty<00:02:02.210> quickly

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
you can get over it pretty quickly

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.490 
you can get over it pretty quickly
though<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:05.600> thing<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:05.840> about<00:02:06.170> getting

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
though so the thing is about getting

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.929 
though so the thing is about getting
over<00:02:06.799> it<00:02:06.860> quickly<00:02:07.100> is<00:02:07.340> that<00:02:07.520> there's<00:02:07.670> just<00:02:07.789> a

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
over it quickly is that there's just a

oh there's more artillery up here this

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:56.560 
oh there's more artillery up here this
anyway<00:04:46.520> moving<00:04:47.270> on<00:04:48.580> I'm<00:04:49.580> pretty<00:04:49.820> screwed

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.570 

we<00:04:57.140> do<00:04:57.260> have<00:04:57.410> a

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
we do have a

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.200 
we do have a
you<00:04:59.120> have<00:04:59.240> tanks<00:04:59.689> up<00:04:59.840> here<00:05:00.080> and<00:05:00.259> we<00:05:00.349> have<00:05:00.500> a

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
you have tanks up here and we have a

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.420 
you have tanks up here and we have a
scare<00:05:02.210> phase<00:05:03.250> bits

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
scare phase bits

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.779 
scare phase bits
I<00:05:04.639> believe<00:05:05.830> good<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:06.919> few<00:05:07.099> things<00:05:07.310> to<00:05:07.430> take<00:05:07.610> out

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
I believe good a few things to take out

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.630 
I believe good a few things to take out
yet<00:05:07.969> up<00:05:08.090> here

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.740 

not<00:05:11.640> all<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.030> missions<00:05:12.300> in<00:05:12.450> this<00:05:12.540> game<00:05:12.720> are

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
not all the missions in this game are

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.060 
not all the missions in this game are
this<00:05:13.620> short<00:05:14.040> by<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:14.670> way<00:05:15.620> they<00:05:16.620> just<00:05:16.830> kind<00:05:17.040> of

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
this short by the way they just kind of

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.950 
this short by the way they just kind of
start<00:05:17.340> out<00:05:17.460> short<00:05:18.800> real<00:05:19.800> short<00:05:20.570> you<00:05:21.570> can<00:05:21.720> you

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
start out short real short you can you

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.310 
start out short real short you can you
could<00:05:22.110> tackle<00:05:22.350> this<00:05:22.620> one<00:05:22.860> easy<00:05:23.130> and<00:05:25.670> probably

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
could tackle this one easy and probably

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.400 
could tackle this one easy and probably
a<00:05:28.410> good<00:05:28.890> 30<00:05:29.160> seconds<00:05:29.640> not<00:05:30.540> a<00:05:30.600> good<00:05:30.840> well<00:05:31.020> good

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
a good 30 seconds not a good well good

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.930 
a good 30 seconds not a good well good
minute<00:05:31.800> probably<00:05:32.100> you<00:05:32.400> could<00:05:32.580> finish<00:05:32.730> this

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
minute probably you could finish this

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.280 
minute probably you could finish this
one<00:05:33.150> off<00:05:33.180> then<00:05:33.450> if<00:05:33.570> you<00:05:33.690> wanted<00:05:33.930> to<00:05:34.020> go<00:05:34.110> real

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
one off then if you wanted to go real

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.590 
one off then if you wanted to go real
fast<00:05:34.530> and<00:05:34.980> that's<00:05:35.610> kind<00:05:36.150> of<00:05:36.210> water<00:05:36.330> we

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
fast and that's kind of water we

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.330 
fast and that's kind of water we
recommend<00:05:37.050> for<00:05:37.170> noobs<00:05:37.500> is<00:05:40.130> going<00:05:41.130> hella

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
recommend for noobs is going hella

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.520 
recommend for noobs is going hella
faster<00:05:41.880> here

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.070 

all<00:05:46.040> right<00:05:46.220> so<00:05:46.610> behind<00:05:47.240> that<00:05:47.390> building<00:05:47.570> here's

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
all right so behind that building here's

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:59.240 
all right so behind that building here's
here's<00:05:48.530> the<00:05:48.560> scare<00:05:48.980> face

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.590 

there's<00:06:00.250> a<00:06:00.310> behemoth<00:06:00.670> somewhere<00:06:01.180> around<00:06:01.270> here

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
there's a behemoth somewhere around here

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.180 
there's a behemoth somewhere around here
so<00:06:01.660> you<00:06:01.930> need<00:06:02.230> to<00:06:02.320> be<00:06:02.410> a<00:06:02.440> little<00:06:02.590> bit<00:06:02.740> careful

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.730 

I<00:06:07.220> think<00:06:07.550> I<00:06:07.670> got<00:06:07.910> hit<00:06:08.150> by<00:06:08.360> that<00:06:08.600> sniper<00:06:09.320> Ethel

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
I think I got hit by that sniper Ethel

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.990 
I think I got hit by that sniper Ethel
rounds<00:06:10.040> coming<00:06:10.220> from<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:10.520> secure<00:06:10.790> face

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
rounds coming from the secure face

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.900 
rounds coming from the secure face
sniper<00:06:11.810> rifle<00:06:12.170> rounds<00:06:12.530> and<00:06:12.650> this<00:06:12.770> game<00:06:12.950> aren't

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
sniper rifle rounds and this game aren't

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.909 
sniper rifle rounds and this game aren't
that<00:06:14.060> deadly<00:06:14.510> that<00:06:15.440> was<00:06:15.650> a

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
that deadly that was a

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.529 
that deadly that was a
probably<00:06:17.919> as<00:06:18.009> a<00:06:18.479> 77<00:06:19.479> recoilless<00:06:19.779> coming<00:06:20.289> from

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
probably as a 77 recoilless coming from

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:28.629 
probably as a 77 recoilless coming from
that<00:06:22.539> it's<00:06:22.840> up<00:06:23.050> there

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.279 

I<00:06:28.729> believe<00:06:29.270> there<00:06:29.449> is<00:06:29.569> a<00:06:29.599> behemoth<00:06:29.930> around

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
I believe there is a behemoth around

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.780 
I believe there is a behemoth around
here<00:06:30.439> somewhere

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:31.790 
here somewhere

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.960 
here somewhere
so

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
so

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.360 
so
listen<00:06:34.750> that<00:06:35.350> might<00:06:35.530> just<00:06:35.710> be<00:06:35.740> in<00:06:35.890> the<00:06:36.010> second

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
listen that might just be in the second

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.420 
listen that might just be in the second
variation<00:06:36.610> of<00:06:36.850> this<00:06:37.000> mission<00:06:37.150> I<00:06:37.390> sure<00:06:38.430> just

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
variation of this mission I sure just

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.510 
variation of this mission I sure just
keep<00:06:40.330> in<00:06:40.510> mind<00:06:40.540> be<00:06:41.020> careful<00:06:41.470> it'd<00:06:42.010> be<00:06:42.190> someone

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
keep in mind be careful it'd be someone

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.210 
keep in mind be careful it'd be someone
off<00:06:42.670> to<00:06:42.760> the<00:06:42.970> right<00:06:43.150> over<00:06:43.270> here<00:06:43.540> but<00:06:44.100> we're<00:06:45.100> not

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
off to the right over here but we're not

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.030

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
going to tackle in this particular one

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.610 
going to tackle in this particular one
later<00:06:48.700> on<00:06:48.910> we'll<00:06:49.120> tackle<00:06:49.360> him<00:06:50.010> for<00:06:51.010> sure
