00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.149
 means 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.840
 blueberry bush 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.410
 size i'm masha 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:39.230
 ten diameter and depth 50 centimeters 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:39.230
 now correctly level 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:54.239
 dub sour peat after which 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:01:01.250
 we fall asleep about two buckets 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.250
 and beer sawdust must be coniferous 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.710
 also leveled 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.240
 then 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:27.619
 add two buckets of sand river 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:46.770
 preferably without content after 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.729
 two buckets we take falls asleep here in general 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.729
 a bunch 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.230
 well and if you have 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.920
 shredded bark can be a little bit 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:07.920
 add a correspondent here and so on add 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 a couple 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.980
 about and something else means less 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.830
 then 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.910
 speedy start stirring 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:45.410
 shuffle it so that it 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.410
 mix it evenly 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.410
 can't mountain 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:04.630
 will retake 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:11.730
 like sharks and over time let's write 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.730
 property from empty 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:30.599
 the amount of substrate is calculated on 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:40.050
 enough to fill the pit 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:47.060
 50 by 50 when we hooked 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:04:00.260
 almost complete the race take the pipe and and 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:04:03.590
 TV series measure after which pour out 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.590
 last bucket 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:20.709
 Muscovite in the middle 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.709
 you can do a little bit 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.710
 to make the plant comfortable 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.710
 Yes 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:51.020
 run new roots now get 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:55.750
 from the cup and see now you need 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.750
 necessarily root system 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:08.300
 I will tear that is into 4 parts and so the garden 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.060
 landing should be done this way 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.890
 way to 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.970
 the stem was covered somewhere for a couple 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.970
 centimeters later 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:43.730
 measuring cup basically some 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:47.320
 say you can and 150 grams per 10 liters 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:06:06.910
 cola bye 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:06:06.910
 only 100 and so on 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.380
 so 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:43.309
 fell asleep shredder branches 

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:46.270
 Basically, I 'll suffice to show how 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:46.270
 happens 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:32.030
 and here is this good mulch will not 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:37.009
 open system evolving 

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:03.870
 that's about the result
