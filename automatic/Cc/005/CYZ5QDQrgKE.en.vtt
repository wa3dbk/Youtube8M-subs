of view it was about a couple of years

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.260 
of view it was about a couple of years
into<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.930> UNIX<00:01:55.259> work<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.340> was<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:57.060> made

thing<00:03:29.709> about<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.280> suit<00:03:30.640> is<00:03:30.910> actually<00:03:31.420> open<00:03:31.930> up

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
thing about the suit is actually open up

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.020 
thing about the suit is actually open up
a<00:03:32.290> level<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.739> confidence<00:03:33.220> towards<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:33.700> sharks

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
a level of confidence towards the sharks

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.670 
a level of confidence towards the sharks
which<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.420> feeder<00:03:34.690> allow<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.140> sharks<00:03:35.590> to

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
which the feeder allow the sharks to

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.440 
which the feeder allow the sharks to
come<00:03:35.890> closer<00:03:36.190> because<00:03:36.730> now<00:03:36.940> you<00:03:37.000> can<00:03:37.239> reach

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
come closer because now you can reach

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.820 
come closer because now you can reach
out<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.900> touch<00:03:38.050> you<00:03:38.200> don't<00:03:38.380> have<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.650> worry

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
out and touch you don't have to worry

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.500 
out and touch you don't have to worry
about<00:03:38.860> your<00:03:39.250> forearm<00:03:39.790> or<00:03:40.000> your<00:03:40.120> hands<00:03:40.390> or

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
about your forearm or your hands or

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.370 
about your forearm or your hands or
anything<00:03:40.690> like<00:03:40.959> that

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
anything like that

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.770 
anything like that
and<00:03:41.500> so<00:03:41.739> this<00:03:42.190> confidence<00:03:42.940> relaxed<00:03:43.510> the

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
and so this confidence relaxed the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.180 
and so this confidence relaxed the
feeders<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.350> all<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.560> sudden<00:03:44.739> they<00:03:44.950> realize

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
feeders and all the sudden they realize

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.310 
feeders and all the sudden they realize
the<00:03:45.340> basic<00:03:45.610> reached<00:03:45.910> out<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.269> touched<00:03:46.570> the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
the basic reached out and touched the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.020 
the basic reached out and touched the
shark<00:03:47.650> will<00:03:47.800> collide<00:03:48.010> momentarily<00:03:48.670> stop

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
shark will collide momentarily stop

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.300 
shark will collide momentarily stop
swimming<00:03:49.330> and<00:03:49.660> by<00:03:49.959> nature<00:03:50.200> slowly<00:03:50.739> sinking

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
swimming and by nature slowly sinking

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.430 
swimming and by nature slowly sinking
down<00:03:51.519> to<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.880> bottom<00:03:52.239> so<00:03:52.900> first<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.320> was<00:03:53.410> a

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
down to the bottom so first it was a

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.410 
down to the bottom so first it was a
kind<00:03:54.070> of<00:03:54.100> like<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.250> tentative<00:03:54.730> touch<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.360> a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
kind of like a tentative touch and a

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.759 
kind of like a tentative touch and a
little<00:03:55.660> bit<00:03:55.780> of<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.930> padding<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:56.470> that's<00:03:56.620> what

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
little bit of a padding and that's what

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.620 
little bit of a padding and that's what
then<00:03:56.950> will<00:03:57.160> do<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.519> all<00:03:57.640> that<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.269> then<00:03:58.450> from

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
then will do and all that and then from

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.470 
then will do and all that and then from
there<00:03:58.780> we<00:03:58.930> went<00:03:59.080> from<00:03:59.940> removing<00:04:00.940> hooks

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
there we went from removing hooks

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.690 
there we went from removing hooks
may<00:04:01.720> I<00:04:01.750> have<00:04:02.050> scientists<00:04:02.739> doing<00:04:02.890> DNA<00:04:03.340> research

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
may I have scientists doing DNA research

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.100 
may I have scientists doing DNA research
as<00:04:03.940> a<00:04:03.970> short<00:04:04.300> sleep<00:04:04.540> some<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:04.810> lacked<00:04:04.989> in

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
as a short sleep some I lacked in

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.509 
as a short sleep some I lacked in
certain<00:04:05.560> needles<00:04:05.860> and<00:04:05.980> then<00:04:06.100> we<00:04:06.250> started

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
certain needles and then we started

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:07.839 
certain needles and then we started
lifting<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.420> shower

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
lifting the shower

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.940 
lifting the shower
and<00:04:08.180> now<00:04:08.329> we're<00:04:08.689> long<00:04:09.049> to<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.379> point<00:04:09.620> where<00:04:09.769> we

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
and now we're long to the point where we

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.009 
and now we're long to the point where we
bring<00:04:10.129> the<00:04:10.280> shark<00:04:10.519> up<00:04:10.760> move<00:04:10.999> past<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.629> tail<00:04:11.810> in

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
bring the shark up move past the tail in

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.589 
bring the shark up move past the tail in

the sharks swim by we have one sleeping
in<00:04:16.639> our<00:04:16.759> lap<00:04:17.060> and<00:04:17.299> we<00:04:17.690> put<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:17.989> tail<00:04:18.199> in<00:04:18.410> the

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
in our lap and we put the tail in the

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.469 
in our lap and we put the tail in the
guests<00:04:18.829> ends<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:19.370> people<00:04:19.759> can<00:04:19.940> touch<00:04:20.150> their

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
is considered either a defense mechanism

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.890 
is considered either a defense mechanism
and<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:33.860> consider<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.400> sexual<00:04:35.090> behavior<00:04:35.570> where

and to consider a sexual behavior where

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.050 
and to consider a sexual behavior where
the<00:04:35.990> female<00:04:36.380> when<00:04:36.710> is<00:04:37.009> an<00:04:37.250> final<00:04:37.789> state<00:04:38.030> of

the female when is an final state of

the female when is an final state of
accepted<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.470> male<00:04:39.740> as<00:04:40.099> a<00:04:40.210> partnership<00:04:41.210> will

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
accepted the male as a partnership will

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.529 
accepted the male as a partnership will
go<00:04:41.840> into<00:04:42.020> tonic<00:04:42.500> immobility<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:43.539> facilitate

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
go into tonic immobility to facilitate

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.820 
go into tonic immobility to facilitate
the<00:04:44.750> basically<00:04:45.430> event<00:04:46.430> but<00:04:47.270> throughout<00:04:48.199> for

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
the basically event but throughout for

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.159 
the basically event but throughout for
our<00:04:49.009> shirts<00:04:49.340> we<00:04:49.550> think<00:04:49.820> it's<00:04:50.090> more<00:04:50.419> all<00:04:50.840> the

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
our shirts we think it's more all the

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.330 
our shirts we think it's more all the
sensory<00:04:51.919> overload

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
sensory overload

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.480 
sensory overload
so<00:04:53.030> we<00:04:53.419> touched<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:54.080> part<00:04:54.320> of<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.919> cell<00:04:55.250> which

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
so we touched the part of the cell which

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.950 
so we touched the part of the cell which
is<00:04:55.520> full<00:04:55.820> of<00:04:55.940> what<00:04:56.060> are<00:04:56.150> called<00:04:56.180> ampullae<00:04:56.690> of

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
is full of what are called ampullae of

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.879 
is full of what are called ampullae of
Lorenzini<00:04:57.680> which<00:04:57.830> is<00:04:58.009> a<00:04:58.270> sensors<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.479> feel

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
Lorenzini which is a sensors to feel

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.659 
Lorenzini which is a sensors to feel
electromagnetic<00:05:00.889> fields<00:05:01.250> and<00:05:01.340> now<00:05:01.430> we're

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
electromagnetic fields and now we're

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.249 
electromagnetic fields and now we're
there<00:05:01.910> with<00:05:02.150> our<00:05:02.270> hands<00:05:02.690> and<00:05:02.810> we'll<00:05:02.960> kinda

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
there with our hands and we'll kinda

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.439 
there with our hands and we'll kinda
overload<00:05:04.039> the<00:05:04.220> shirts<00:05:04.490> and<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.699> shirts<00:05:04.940> as<00:05:05.240> a

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
overload the shirts and the shirts as a

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.180 
overload the shirts and the shirts as a
natural<00:05:05.870> defense<00:05:06.080> I<00:05:06.259> think<00:05:06.320> just<00:05:06.650> goes<00:05:06.800> into

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
natural defense I think just goes into

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.219 
natural defense I think just goes into
into<00:05:07.729> trance<00:05:08.030> and<00:05:08.270> so<00:05:08.419> light<00:05:08.660> tonic

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
into trance and so light tonic

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.279
