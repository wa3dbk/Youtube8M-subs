00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
the biggest challenge probably for me is

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.020 
the biggest challenge probably for me is
staffing<00:03:44.320> one<00:03:45.160> of<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.370> key<00:03:45.550> things<00:03:45.580> with

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
staffing one of the key things with

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.680 
staffing one of the key things with
Dubai<00:03:46.330> is<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.690> labor<00:03:46.900> laws<00:03:47.200> tend<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.800> be<00:03:47.980> very

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
Dubai is the labor laws tend to be very

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.390 
Dubai is the labor laws tend to be very
iffy<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:49.900> so<00:03:50.410> what<00:03:50.590> happens<00:03:50.980> is<00:03:51.100> you<00:03:51.220> get<00:03:51.340> a

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
iffy and so what happens is you get a

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.950 
iffy and so what happens is you get a
lot<00:03:51.640> of<00:03:51.670> people<00:03:51.880> who<00:03:52.120> come<00:03:52.390> over<00:03:52.660> here<00:03:52.840> and

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
think I'm going to come over to divide

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.520 
think I'm going to come over to divide
as<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:54.940> holiday<00:03:55.150> let<00:03:55.690> me<00:03:55.810> have<00:03:55.960> a<00:03:55.990> short<00:03:56.320> as

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.690 
short stint and so there's not still
this<00:03:59.020> idea<00:03:59.530> that<00:03:59.620> people<00:03:59.890> will<00:04:00.250> think<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.610> this

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
this idea that people will think of this

and so what we're really facing now as

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.030 
and so what we're really facing now as
we<00:04:09.610> grow<00:04:09.850> is<00:04:10.090> trying<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.660> say<00:04:10.870> who's<00:04:11.440> important

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040

in<00:04:12.130> our<00:04:12.250> team<00:04:12.550> how<00:04:13.090> can<00:04:13.270> we<00:04:13.390> motivate<00:04:13.570> them<00:04:14.020> to

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
in our team how can we motivate them to

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.350 
in our team how can we motivate them to
think<00:04:14.320> of<00:04:14.500> Dubai<00:04:14.830> as<00:04:15.040> a<00:04:15.070> home<00:04:15.400> as<00:04:15.610> a<00:04:15.640> place<00:04:15.970> not

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
think of Dubai as a home as a place not

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.690 
think of Dubai as a home as a place not
just<00:04:16.420> for<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:17.110> one-year<00:04:17.680> stint<00:04:17.920> after<00:04:18.310> college

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
just for a one-year stint after college

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.850 
just for a one-year stint after college
or<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.120> know<00:04:19.239> short<00:04:19.540> break<00:04:19.780> but<00:04:20.380> really<00:04:20.709> to

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:20.860 
or you know short break but really to

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.920 
or you know short break but really to
think<00:04:21.070> of<00:04:21.160> it<00:04:21.250> as<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.610> positive<00:04:22.180> career<00:04:22.690> move

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
think of it as a positive career move

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.630 
think of it as a positive career move
and<00:04:23.170> I<00:04:23.260> think<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.590> is<00:04:23.800> something<00:04:24.130> that<00:04:24.400> we're

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
and I think that is something that we're

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.610 
and I think that is something that we're
working<00:04:24.940> on<00:04:25.270> different<00:04:25.450> ideas<00:04:25.960> but<00:04:26.260> that<00:04:26.440> is

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
working on different ideas but that is

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.550 
working on different ideas but that is
definitely<00:04:26.890> my<00:04:27.370> biggest<00:04:27.580> challenge<00:04:28.380> some<00:04:29.380> to

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
definitely my biggest challenge some to

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.560 
definitely my biggest challenge some to
buy<00:04:29.680> small<00:04:30.100> business<00:04:30.520> owners<00:04:30.820> speaking<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.420> me

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
buy small business owners speaking to me

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.020
