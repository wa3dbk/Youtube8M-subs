about speed building if you're working
on<00:00:54.970> getting<00:00:55.120> faster<00:00:55.870> this<00:00:56.379> is<00:00:56.530> something<00:00:56.860> to

just pick any lick like this one for
example<00:01:06.120> and<00:01:07.409> set<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.530> tempo<00:01:09.010> where<00:01:09.580> you<00:01:09.729> can

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
example and set the tempo where you can

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.109 
example and set the tempo where you can
barely<00:01:10.120> play<00:01:10.479> sixteenth<00:01:11.290> notes<00:01:11.560> or<00:01:12.460> sixteen

barely play sixteenth notes or sixteen

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.270 
barely play sixteenth notes or sixteen
note<00:01:13.299> triplets<00:01:13.780> you<00:01:14.409> should<00:01:14.590> be<00:01:14.740> able<00:01:14.799> to<00:01:15.040> kind

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
note triplets you should be able to kind

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.100 
note triplets you should be able to kind
of<00:01:15.430> play<00:01:15.640> it<00:01:15.700> but<00:01:16.180> you<00:01:16.270> can't<00:01:16.510> really<00:01:16.570> keep<00:01:16.960> it

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
of play it but you can't really keep it

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.500 
of play it but you can't really keep it
going<00:01:17.560> for<00:01:18.070> very<00:01:18.190> long<00:01:18.460> at<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:18.700> tempo<00:01:19.270> and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
going for very long at that tempo and

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.149 
going for very long at that tempo and
then<00:01:19.720> you<00:01:19.810> start<00:01:20.200> by<00:01:20.350> playing<00:01:20.650> at<00:01:20.860> half<00:01:21.130> the

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
then you start by playing at half the

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.050 
then you start by playing at half the
speed<00:01:21.760> and<00:01:22.119> you<00:01:22.479> do<00:01:22.659> bursts<00:01:23.350> at<00:01:23.560> full<00:01:23.979> tempo<00:01:24.460> so

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
speed and you do bursts at full tempo so

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:43.220 
speed and you do bursts at full tempo so
it<00:01:25.360> sounds<00:01:25.630> something<00:01:25.780> like<00:01:25.869> this

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.080 

all<00:01:44.230> right<00:01:44.380> today's<00:01:44.830> lesson<00:01:45.370> three<00:01:45.760> string

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
all right today's lesson three string

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.090 
all right today's lesson three string
sweeps<00:01:46.570> there<00:01:47.260> are<00:01:47.350> many<00:01:47.530> ways<00:01:47.710> of<00:01:47.950> doing

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
sweeps there are many ways of doing

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.250 
sweeps there are many ways of doing
these<00:01:48.400> but<00:01:48.940> I'll<00:01:49.180> show<00:01:49.450> you<00:01:49.510> what<00:01:49.780> has<00:01:49.990> worked

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
these but I'll show you what has worked

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.650 
these but I'll show you what has worked
best<00:01:50.530> for<00:01:50.680> me<00:01:51.010> and<00:01:51.250> hopefully<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.420> works

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
best for me and hopefully that works

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.510 
best for me and hopefully that works
quite<00:01:52.870> well<00:01:52.960> for<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:53.410> too<00:01:53.650> I<00:01:53.860> think<00:01:54.340> these<00:01:54.460> are

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
quite well for you too I think these are

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.420 
quite well for you too I think these are
by<00:01:54.820> far<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.210> most<00:01:55.510> useful<00:01:55.900> sweeps<00:01:56.500> in<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:57.220> road

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
by far the most useful sweeps in a road

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.160 
by far the most useful sweeps in a road
little<00:01:57.730> example<00:01:58.390> that<00:01:58.660> goes<00:01:58.840> something<00:01:59.050> like

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
little example that goes something like

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:20.060 
little example that goes something like
this

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.070 

what<00:02:21.070> I<00:02:21.100> play<00:02:21.430> there<00:02:21.700> were<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.270> arpeggios<00:02:22.870> of

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
what I play there were the arpeggios of

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.580 
what I play there were the arpeggios of
D<00:02:23.380> minor<00:02:24.390> C<00:02:25.390> major<00:02:25.630> D<00:02:26.580> flat<00:02:27.580> major<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.410> then<00:02:29.410> a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
D minor C major D flat major and then a

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.940 
D minor C major D flat major and then a
sus<00:02:30.010> four<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:31.300> then<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:34.260> it's<00:02:35.260> really<00:02:35.410> good<00:02:35.800> if

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
sus four and then a it's really good if

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.950 
sus four and then a it's really good if
you<00:02:36.040> already<00:02:36.400> know<00:02:36.640> your<00:02:36.820> basic<00:02:37.150> minor<00:02:37.600> major

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
you already know your basic minor major

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.110 
you already know your basic minor major
triads<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.920> will<00:02:39.370> make<00:02:39.520> things<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.940> lot<00:02:40.090> easier

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
triads I will make things a lot easier

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.780 
triads I will make things a lot easier
and<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:41.110> only<00:02:41.410> really<00:02:41.740> have<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.070> focus<00:02:42.280> on<00:02:42.640> the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
and you only really have to focus on the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.180 
and you only really have to focus on the
right<00:02:43.030> hand<00:02:43.060> technique<00:02:43.480> but<00:02:44.260> basically<00:02:44.830> when

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
right hand technique but basically when

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.160 
right hand technique but basically when
you<00:02:45.310> play<00:02:45.520> three<00:02:45.880> strings<00:02:46.180> sweep<00:02:46.480> arpeggios

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
you play three strings sweep arpeggios

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.380 
you play three strings sweep arpeggios
you<00:02:47.740> can<00:02:47.950> use<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.190> top<00:02:48.460> notes<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:49.090> your

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
you can use the top notes of your

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.240 
you can use the top notes of your

note<00:03:13.480> is<00:03:13.510> on<00:03:14.020> the<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:14.980> shape<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.640> root<00:03:15.820> note<00:03:16.000> is

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
note is on the a shape the root note is

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.560 
note is on the a shape the root note is
here<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:17.230> g<00:03:17.470> string<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:18.010> on<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.970> d<00:03:19.300> shape

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
here the g string and on the d shape

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.480 
here the g string and on the d shape
it's<00:03:19.810> here<00:03:19.990> on<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:20.140> b<00:03:20.380> string<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:21.280> on<00:03:21.370> the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
it's here on the b string and on the

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.780 
it's here on the b string and on the
ishe<00:03:21.910> p--<00:03:21.940> it's<00:03:22.570> here<00:03:22.810> on<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.050> E<00:03:23.380> string<00:03:23.790> now

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
ishe p-- it's here on the E string now

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.490 
ishe p-- it's here on the E string now
you<00:03:24.850> can<00:03:25.120> just<00:03:25.270> move<00:03:25.480> these<00:03:25.630> up<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:26.020> neck<00:03:26.200> and

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
you can just move these up the neck and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.440 
you can just move these up the neck and
just<00:03:27.010> keep<00:03:27.220> track<00:03:27.460> of<00:03:27.670> where<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.940> root<00:03:28.240> note

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
just keep track of where the root note

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.110 
just keep track of where the root note
is<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.930> that's<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.040> name<00:03:30.220> of<00:03:30.250> your<00:03:30.400> arpeggios

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
is and that's the name of your arpeggios

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.350 
is and that's the name of your arpeggios
and<00:03:31.830> remember<00:03:32.830> if<00:03:33.130> it's<00:03:33.310> minor<00:03:33.670> or<00:03:33.820> major<00:03:33.880> I

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
and remember if it's minor or major I

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.780 
and remember if it's minor or major I
tend<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:34.900> use<00:03:35.020> the<00:03:35.200> D<00:03:35.410> chord<00:03:35.650> shapes<00:03:36.040> mostly

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
tend to use the D chord shapes mostly

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.820 
tend to use the D chord shapes mostly
because<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.510> fingering<00:03:37.990> just<00:03:38.200> feels<00:03:38.410> kind<00:03:38.710> of

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
because the fingering just feels kind of

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:46.980 
because the fingering just feels kind of
natural<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:44.820> once<00:03:45.820> you<00:03:45.940> know<00:03:46.120> your<00:03:46.300> arpeggios

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
natural and once you know your arpeggios

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.420 
natural and once you know your arpeggios
you<00:03:47.170> just<00:03:47.410> need<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.709> learn<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:48.070> picking

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
you just need to learn the picking

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.699 
you just need to learn the picking
technique<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.390> can<00:03:49.570> play<00:03:49.750> sweeps<00:03:50.140> over<00:03:50.470> any

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
technique you can play sweeps over any

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.160 
technique you can play sweeps over any
progression<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:51.940> let's<00:03:52.420> take<00:03:52.630> a<00:03:52.660> real<00:03:52.930> close

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
progression so let's take a real close

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.080 
progression so let's take a real close
look<00:03:53.320> at<00:03:53.680> what<00:03:53.950> my<00:03:54.100> picking<00:03:54.550> hand<00:03:54.700> is<00:03:54.940> doing

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
look at what my picking hand is doing

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.360 
look at what my picking hand is doing
now<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.780> like<00:03:56.050> to<00:03:56.080> start<00:03:56.230> with<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.830> top<00:03:57.070> note

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
now I like to start with the top note

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.730 
now I like to start with the top note
when<00:03:57.610> I<00:03:57.640> sweep<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.420> we're<00:03:59.170> actually<00:03:59.320> going<00:03:59.650> to

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
when I sweep and we're actually going to

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.010 
when I sweep and we're actually going to
use<00:03:59.890> an<00:04:00.040> upstroke<00:04:00.640> here<00:04:00.970> for<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.510> first<00:04:01.750> note

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
use an upstroke here for the first note

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.810 
use an upstroke here for the first note
you'll<00:04:02.620> notice<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.190> when<00:04:03.400> we<00:04:03.430> come<00:04:03.670> back

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
you'll notice that when we come back

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.850 
you'll notice that when we come back
around<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.450> will<00:04:04.660> be<00:04:04.690> really<00:04:05.320> hard<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.709> have<00:04:05.800> a

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
around it will be really hard to have a

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.750 
around it will be really hard to have a
down<00:04:06.100> stroke<00:04:06.400> here<00:04:06.690> so<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.870> first<00:04:08.280> one<00:04:09.280> is<00:04:09.520> an

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
down stroke here so the first one is an

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.390 
down stroke here so the first one is an
upstroke<00:04:10.209> and<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:11.230> second<00:04:11.650> note<00:04:11.800> is<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.070> pull

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
upstroke and the second note is a pull

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.080 
upstroke and the second note is a pull
off<00:04:12.550> so<00:04:12.790> we<00:04:12.880> don't<00:04:12.910> pick<00:04:13.209> anything<00:04:13.510> and<00:04:15.090> then

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
off so we don't pick anything and then

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.640 
off so we don't pick anything and then
another<00:04:16.480> upstroke<00:04:17.170> on<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.470> b<00:04:17.620> string

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
another upstroke on the b string

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.120 
another upstroke on the b string
followed<00:04:18.580> by<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:19.030> actual<00:04:19.299> sweep<00:04:19.930> three<00:04:20.890> down

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
followed by the actual sweep three down

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.720 
followed by the actual sweep three down
strokes<00:04:21.580> on<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:22.060> G<00:04:22.270> B<00:04:22.420> and<00:04:22.510> E<00:04:22.630> strings

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.760 

and<00:04:24.820> then<00:04:25.630> we're<00:04:26.080> back<00:04:26.110> to<00:04:26.320> where<00:04:26.620> we<00:04:26.680> started

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
and then we're back to where we started

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:35.370 
and then we're back to where we started
so<00:04:27.340> all<00:04:28.060> there<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.570> it<00:04:28.750> is<00:04:28.900> this<00:04:33.450> and<00:04:34.450> the

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
so all there is to it is this and the

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.560 
so all there is to it is this and the
rhythm<00:04:35.650> is<00:04:35.740> ba<00:04:35.980> ba<00:04:36.250> da<00:04:36.400> ba<00:04:36.550> da<00:04:36.700> ba<00:04:36.850> ba<00:04:37.150> da<00:04:37.300> ba<00:04:37.420> da

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
rhythm is ba ba da ba da ba ba da ba da

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.790 
rhythm is ba ba da ba da ba ba da ba da
ba<00:04:37.750> ba<00:04:38.020> da<00:04:38.200> ba<00:04:38.260> da<00:04:38.440> ba

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
ba ba da ba da ba

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.040 
ba ba da ba da ba
so<00:04:39.040> just<00:04:39.400> practice<00:04:39.610> that<00:04:40.000> with<00:04:40.240> muted<00:04:40.780> strings

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
so just practice that with muted strings

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:54.380 
so just practice that with muted strings
until<00:04:41.560> you<00:04:41.680> have<00:04:41.800> it<00:04:41.920> under<00:04:42.010> control<00:04:52.560> and

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
until you have it under control and

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.640 
until you have it under control and
that's<00:04:55.390> all<00:04:55.660> that's<00:04:55.840> going<00:04:56.110> on<00:04:56.320> with<00:04:56.560> the

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
that's all that's going on with the

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.440 
that's all that's going on with the
right<00:04:56.800> hand<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:57.490> picking<00:04:57.850> is<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.000> same

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
right hand the picking is the same

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.840 
right hand the picking is the same
throughout<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.990> exercise<00:04:59.560> your<00:05:00.340> fretting

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
throughout the exercise your fretting

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.480 
throughout the exercise your fretting
hand<00:05:00.880> is<00:05:01.360> going<00:05:01.600> to<00:05:01.660> do<00:05:01.840> this<00:05:02.110> D<00:05:02.830> minor

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
hand is going to do this D minor

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.840 
hand is going to do this D minor
17th<00:05:04.180> fret<00:05:04.450> E<00:05:04.660> string<00:05:04.690> pull<00:05:05.320> off<00:05:05.440> to<00:05:05.620> 13<00:05:06.190> and

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
17th fret E string pull off to 13 and

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.470 
17th fret E string pull off to 13 and
then<00:05:07.540> B<00:05:07.750> string<00:05:08.080> 15th<00:05:08.650> fret<00:05:08.950> g<00:05:09.580> string<00:05:09.610> 14th

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
then B string 15th fret g string 14th

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.310 
then B string 15th fret g string 14th
fret<00:05:10.870> and<00:05:11.140> then<00:05:11.260> back<00:05:11.410> up<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:13.870> second

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
fret and then back up and the second

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.170 
fret and then back up and the second
time<00:05:14.470> around<00:05:14.770> I<00:05:15.010> like<00:05:15.130> to<00:05:15.280> replace<00:05:15.640> the<00:05:15.880> first

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
time around I like to replace the first

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.240 
time around I like to replace the first
node<00:05:16.480> with<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.110> next<00:05:17.470> note<00:05:17.650> in<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:18.040> deme

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
node with the next note in the deme

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.980 
node with the next note in the deme
natural<00:05:18.730> minor<00:05:19.000> scale<00:05:19.120> just<00:05:19.600> to<00:05:19.720> get<00:05:19.840> some

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
natural minor scale just to get some

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.290 
natural minor scale just to get some
variation<00:05:20.560> so<00:05:21.430> that<00:05:21.850> would<00:05:21.970> be<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.870> 18th<00:05:23.770> fret

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.119 
the 14th which is the major third
c-sharp<00:06:37.180> so<00:06:37.539> that<00:06:37.720> makes<00:06:37.900> it<00:06:38.110> a<00:06:38.229> regular<00:06:38.740> a

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:39.129

chord then we're back on D so that's it

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:49.800 
chord then we're back on D so that's it
here<00:06:47.530> it<00:06:47.620> is<00:06:47.680> one<00:06:47.949> time<00:06:48.220> at<00:06:48.490> a<00:06:48.550> slow<00:06:48.970> tempo<00:06:49.000> and
