00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.590
 very good we'll all see a trick 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.690
 to get level with a lot 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.750
 easily get money with a lot 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.730
 ease weapons armor in the testing 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.910
 sometimes he is asking if there was any 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.990
 trick and was investigating and for 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.510
 chance I came across a video that 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.220
 I do not like 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.460
 record a strategy that someone has 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.050
 done but when it's an extremely 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.670
 useful and especially if someone has 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.240
 asked how can you do 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.530
 I can make try to explain it well 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.960
 where we are 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.520
 we have to have the phase I think it's the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.040
 first phase of the moon the darkness 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.900
 outside available to be able to be 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.340
 we are at a level 15 it worked better 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.379
 situations of the principle above all 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.840
 for what is familiar experience as 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.550
 such can be done directly in 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.910
 when it arrives because it is a trick in what 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.190
 it is based on exploiting 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.590
 the response of enemies with him 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.950
 responded own game of our 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.950
 character 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.860
 it's very simple in that and easily you 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.710
 will give if you do it in a short time I 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.210
 gets up in 20 minutes what 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.650
 I was doing 25 meters and climbed 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.730
 two last levels that I was missing 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.210
 and considered that to get things like that 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.020
 accessible quickly goes great and 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.640
 possibly if it was not a match already 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.980
 to get over more weapons 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.750
 legendary legendary armors this 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.000
 be holy hand 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.390
 we have that this phase as I already 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.210
 I have already made it I have started it 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.920
 out of it 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.270
 to start directly where it's done 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.440
 the trick but of normal would have if 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.640
 you'll start at the beginning of the whole of the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.380
 phase that you have to do a couple of 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.140
 5 out of 10 minutes as much and 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.420
 you get here 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.990
 once we are here we are on the occasion 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.210
 what to look for the guardian 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.600
 and this is our destination the area of the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.899
 door as soon as we interact with the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.270
 guardian will skip an intro and then to 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.560
 intro this door will open will activate 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.509
 an area of 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.210
 limited reappearance occurrence what 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.289
 means that if you kill the phase by 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.119
 so to say it starts from the 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.010
 principle this area does not keep you 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.630
 enemies martÃ­n nothing and this comes great 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.280
 since you for example as soon as they open 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.300
 Suppose the door is interacting 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.489
 open the door they start to come out a 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.650
 bunch of enemies and I focus on 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.810
 kill the beast all I can 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.750
 around here with care of one thing that I 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.940
 I'll train you kill many then 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.150
 matter that they surround me they kill me at 15 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.530
 seconds I kill 230 enemies and what happens 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.450
 restart three seconds later 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.709
 reappeared here the phase you start from the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.170
 beginning with the door opening and 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.200
 all the swarm of enemies there 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.520
 there they come out again and it's so simple 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.100
 as 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.690
 kill kill and kill he answered is almost 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.370
 instant many times you want to change 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.810
 of gun you kill you want to change weapon 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.540
 do something and it does not give you time because the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.740
 enemies know is instant are three 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.900
 seconds the time you have since 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.880
 you kill good four or five saints 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.010
 since you have killed until 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.720
 you're back here and the enemies 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.010
 they come back out and that's what the 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.240
 exploit the only thing you have to have 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.490
 careful is that there is a checkpoint 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.320
 right here in front 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.700
 that I think is updated having 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.760
 killed I do not know if there are two enemies there 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.290
 forward two species of guardians not 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.730
 I know if they are gentlemen or they are the 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.070
 guardians who stay at a price are 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.930
 the guardians that if you kill them the game 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.240
 will recognize that you advance to the next 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.940
 checkpoint and you have to be careful not 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.010
 kill all the enemies because 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.480
 you will advance to 750 and if you go to 76 point 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.030
 you have the problem of what do you have to 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.820
 go back to the orbit select the 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.370
 phase and come back here and see 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.590
 the intro that is the biggest roll then 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.720
 to have is better to sin for killing 15 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.490
 enemies and make sure you do not go to 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.920
 jump the one that will not jump the 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.150
 next checkpoint what to say I'm going to 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.850
 make a limit now and kill everyone 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.280
 those and kill 40 enemies but charge 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.580
 of the checkpoint and having to go out to 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.770
 orbit 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.330
 the tactical essence as simply 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.210
 you raise everything and be able to come with 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.030
 space 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.370
 since as you can see I've done it 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.070
 a little bit and I have a lot of things 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.900
 they release many very many pieces of 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.639
 fairly high level you find yourself 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.959
 with things 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.310
 peculiar to the commercial and also 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.389
 possibility of being legendary 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.250
 done about everything he's been doing 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.010
 from level 18 to 20 when 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.600
 was playing at a low level so 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.580
 I still did not get higher things 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.210
 seeks to get encrypted from 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.210
 legend 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.449
 how are these and get many 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.310
 many as you can see for everything 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.860
 that shines me you get very things 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.949
 fast very easily and above all 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.720
 level up also and improve the 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.270
 skills and what is important 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.470
 it's also that it's fun centers here 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.090
 you are riddling with bullets that 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.010
 viran you kill reinicia you wrote 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.139
 he peppered sacri villas is if it turns out 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.580
 it's fun after all the time 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.350
 if you're doing this for half 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.350
 hour an hour will be heavy but good 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.680
 it is useful and it becomes entertaining to 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.680
 beginning 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.010
 and nothing more to say can be done as 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.720
 he commented from the beginning of almost 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.020
 from the beginning of the game especially 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.660
 the part to exploit to a greater extent in 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.520
 smaller measure what is the level and 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.930
 basic weapons you can do though 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.400
 come here the first you get to this 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.870
 phase simply stay in this set 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.480
 point what I do recommend is 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.520
 put it in private so you can not 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.660
 not to do it cooperatively if you 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.960
 competitive play as many flowers as possible 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.220
 kill people kill everything you've killed 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.770
 killing all the English although you can 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.280
 do it with care you'll get 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.170
 the double of objects the double I mean 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.449
 the other person will also get 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.879
 objects 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:51.289
 it's things and if you want to be cooperative I 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:52.969
 I have not personally tried alone 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:55.399
 since the cooperative to do that 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:57.529
 mission stuff is a very trick 

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:59.719
 very interesting beast that I hope that 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:02.719
 it is useful to very useful as investment 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:04.800
 as I said in twenty- two minutes in two 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:08.659
 levels to take 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.659
 with nothing to say until next time
