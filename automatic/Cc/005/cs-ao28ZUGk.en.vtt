00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hi everyone threshold to the max and we 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.700
 finds himself for a new video on 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.069
 gta 5 and today I'm going to you 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.670
 show how to get this vehicle 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.269
 it's said sorry for my language 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.740
 English 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.330
 really I'm not very good at 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.310
 English so it's a vehicle 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.430
 only available on the consoles 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.449
 new generation is also 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.760
 only for players who already have 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.600
 played at gta 5 before on the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.430
 old consoles 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.890
 so I think the connection to 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.990
 rockstar social games club is 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.460
 obligatory it's really very simple 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.160
 to get it we can go get it 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.590
 with any character and this 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.290
 vehicle it is really nice since 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.460
 it is an armored vehicle and fully 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.200
 customizable so to go the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.399
 recover it's very simple it takes 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.320
 to have a little bit advanced in 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.120
 the story because you have to finish 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.000
 the first unknown mission is 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.550
 unhinged tonia with franklin who gets 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.289
 name ok but just this time then me 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.670
 for my part I had a little bug is 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.890
 that after doing this mission the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.989
 vehicle was not at the indicated location 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.000
 So I did the second mission of 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.710
 tonia is good because it's you and 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.060
 the vehicle he was finally available to 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.960
 the place indicated so I mount it on 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.729
 the map follows so the vehicle is there 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.290
 How beautiful it is beautiful whose 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.939
 first-person view is enough 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.340
 complicated to use it I must confess 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.630
 but frankly the vehicle there he has 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.229
 really class plus a vehicle 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.180
 armored 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.229
 frankly it's cool so once 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.360
 that you took the vehicle 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.610
 you will be attacked by 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.869
 trucks especially and so you have two 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.729
 solutions either you get out of the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.950
 car kill you everybody be 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.720
 you leave you run small race 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.520
 pursuit but nothing complicated 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.560
 have to roll a little bit and you go 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.210
 sow them now the vehicle 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.920
 it's up to you what you do 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.630
 so want me I went the soonest 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.860
 bet we can really put what we 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.840
 wants so we can really have a 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.270
 vehicle that has class and frankly 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.649
 the vehicle I find really pissed off 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.420
 I kept the vehicle then I 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.430
 stored in my garage but if you 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.930
 lose it do not worry because 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.659
 that once you realized the little 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.189
 mission with the vehicle y spawn to two 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.020
 different places on the map 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.399
 and I show you right away and 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.170
 also when you put the lights on 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.700
 well road it lights fires above 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.049
 of the car of the given kinds we are going 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.420
 say we'll say that like that 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.560
 well he's really cool that 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.420
 so guys that's all for this 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.220
 video i hope you liked it i 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.720
