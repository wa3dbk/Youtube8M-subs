00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.469
 rank of giga on the mwc 2015 we are 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.750
 Alcatel Qatar has a new one here 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.389
 presented the one touch idol 3 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.980
 or actually there are two new devices 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.320
 because the device comes in two 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.180
 different display sizes that is 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.510
 now here is the larger version that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.150
 alcatel one touch panel 3 5.5 the name 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.580
 said the device already has a 55 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.270
 inches in the diagonal measure the display 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.590
 dissolves in full HD on seat technology 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.050
 means we have beautiful ones here 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.610
 lateral view intense colors 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.940
 that is really very pleasant 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.070
 to look at the display as a processor 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.960
 Here comes a snapdragon 615 to 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.289
 use that is already a 64 bit 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.149
 carrier processor from qualcomm and 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.739
 accelerates the device actually 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.600
 quite good as well that for that 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.359
 this is the incident 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.250
 that makes everything pretty nice and fluffy her 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.550
 See that already comes here already 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.129
 android 5.0 lollipop looks to use 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.220
 If the settings when I 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.520
 just think it's good you are building yours 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.119
 already android 5.0 point 2 that is 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.850
 actually our latest version and 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.220
 java that the clou on the device is just 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.440
 also the fact that you are one-sided 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.979
 can use so well as rum and 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.509
 this way 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.280
 especially interesting is that too 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.960
 that's the way to talk on the phone 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.369
 Anyone can use it from us or 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.530
 not everyone but many of us know 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.420
 that maybe in the device has one 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.399
 a bit more symmetrical then looks 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.869
 you pull this out of the bag and have to 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.190
 First of all, look again, you keep it 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.649
 because right and here it does not matter 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.050
 can both keep that in mind as well 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.970
 also on the ear 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.960
 the one that always understands the opposite 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.020
 clearly here are two phones 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.820
 built-in microphones so installed 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.770
 Great thing we look at the two 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.420
 then we'll look at it again 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.950
 from the side here we have the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.300
 power button okay now stop in this time 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.120
 quote right around here 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.160
 the power button here is a bay in 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.990
 you either have two sim cards 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.910
 can accommodate or a sim card 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.930
 and a micro sd card there you have it 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.850
 the full selection 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.530
 I think that's a really nice one too 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.680
 feature if you install two sim cards 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.260
 are active duel are capable 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.630
 You can also use both 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.820
 So sim cards use so far 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.930
 also good 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.150
 Here we have the volume rocker 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.050
 lip in front on the front an 8 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.050
 megapixel camera 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.049
 on the back a 3 10 megapixel 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.689
 Camera you already see the device 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.549
 supported on double-take and double 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.700
 Tap to sleep, too, I think that's right 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:48.260
 cool plus we also have stereo 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:51.829
 front speakers so the alcatel one 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.930
 touch idol 3 and the 55 inch version 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.209
 I personally find quite interesting 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.709
 the device for that it already live 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.319
 if I say no name but already so 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.739
 not in the one of not in the a 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.319
 league co-producer is to come in 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.629
 germany for 299 euros on the market 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.700
 so that's a pretty good one too 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.939
 It could also be a good competition 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.409
 for example, lassmann or the pretext 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:19.700
 1 6 from huawei 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:23.060
 So yes some cool thing like 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.540
 I'm pretty good at first sight 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.030
