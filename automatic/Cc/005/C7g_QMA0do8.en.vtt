00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
honestly if the game doesn't look that

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.910 
honestly if the game doesn't look that
good<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.570> cut<00:01:39.750> scenes<00:01:39.990> look<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.500> I've

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920

seen final fantasy games with cutscenes

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.240 
seen final fantasy games with cutscenes
that<00:01:42.780> look<00:01:43.020> better<00:01:43.259> than<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.710> okay<00:01:44.810> but

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
that look better than that okay but

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.620 
that look better than that okay but
anyway<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.549> don't<00:01:47.970> want<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.180> linger<00:01:48.329> too<00:01:48.509> much

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
anyway I don't want to linger too much

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.030 
anyway I don't want to linger too much
on<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.840> graphics<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.619> know<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.770> they're

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
on the graphics just know that they're

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.460 
on the graphics just know that they're
really<00:01:50.250> not<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.610> good<00:01:50.820> um<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.840> gameplay<00:01:52.049> is

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
really not that good um the gameplay is

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.490 
really not that good um the gameplay is
fun<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> first<00:01:53.729> few<00:01:53.909> hours<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.509> then<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
fun for the first few hours and then it

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.830 
fun for the first few hours and then it
gets<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:56.040> little<00:01:56.250> redundant<00:01:56.719> especially<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
gets a little redundant especially the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.139 
gets a little redundant especially the
surveillance<00:01:58.290> camera<00:01:58.790> admissions<00:01:59.790> those

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
surveillance camera admissions those

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.440 
surveillance camera admissions those
were<00:02:00.479> getting<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.840> bit<00:02:01.020> annoying<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:02.119> all<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
were getting a bit annoying and all the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.120 
were getting a bit annoying and all the
side<00:02:03.630> quests<00:02:03.659> are<00:02:04.200> really<00:02:04.469> they're<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:04.890> not

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
side quests are really they're just not

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.459
