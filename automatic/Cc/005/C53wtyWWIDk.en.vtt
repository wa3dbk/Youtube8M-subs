00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
really should go back 100 hit points and

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.970 
really should go back 100 hit points and
a<00:00:05.339> little<00:00:05.670> bit<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.850> shield<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.799> really<00:00:07.799> not

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
a little bit of shield is really not

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.749 
a little bit of shield is really not
enough<00:00:12.590> we<00:00:13.590> defend<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.099> tower<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.460> that's

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
enough we defend the tower and that's

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:28.730 
enough we defend the tower and that's
that's<00:00:15.179> all<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.570> matters<00:00:17.750> sorry<00:00:25.699> and<00:00:27.349> as<00:00:28.349> you

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
that's all that matters sorry and as you

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.400 
that's all that matters sorry and as you
can<00:00:28.920> see<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.400> do<00:00:29.910> decent<00:00:30.539> damage<00:00:30.660> even<00:00:31.050> though<00:00:31.380> I

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
can see I do decent damage even though I

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.510 
can see I do decent damage even though I
have<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.430> much<00:00:32.669> defensive<00:00:33.480> items<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.770> that's

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
have so much defensive items and that's

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.240 
have so much defensive items and that's
why<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.149> always<00:00:36.329> use<00:00:36.930> magic<00:00:37.410> penetration<00:00:37.590> ruins

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
why I always use magic penetration ruins

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.020 
why I always use magic penetration ruins
and<00:00:38.450> sometimes<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.600> even<00:00:39.780> buy<00:00:40.280> some<00:00:41.280> some<00:00:41.730> magic

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
and sometimes I even buy some some magic

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.940 
and sometimes I even buy some some magic
penetration<00:00:42.180> items<00:00:44.989> because<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.140> because<00:00:46.800> your

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
penetration items because I because your

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.170 
penetration items because I because your
abilities<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.090> such<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> low<00:00:49.789> ability<00:00:50.789> power

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
abilities of such a low ability power

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.069 
abilities of such a low ability power
ratio<00:00:52.370> I<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:53.910> better<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.390> decrease

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
ratio I think it's better to decrease

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.790 
ratio I think it's better to decrease
the<00:00:56.329> magic<00:00:57.329> resistance<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> enemy<00:00:58.260> then

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the magic resistance of the enemy then

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.869 
the magic resistance of the enemy then
to<00:00:59.489> well<00:01:00.210> improve<00:01:00.930> your<00:01:01.170> ability<00:01:01.879> ability

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
to well improve your ability ability

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.109 
to well improve your ability ability
power<00:01:06.320> we<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.710> shouldn't<00:01:08.100> initiate<00:01:08.850> inner

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
power we we shouldn't initiate inner

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.320 
power we we shouldn't initiate inner
only<00:01:09.450> when<00:01:09.720> there<00:01:09.900> was<00:01:10.020> only<00:01:10.170> three<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.680> us

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
only when there was only three of us

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.410 
only when there was only three of us
every<00:01:12.330> Pantheon<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.640> sin<00:01:14.640> could<00:01:14.880> come<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.270> us

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
every Pantheon and sin could come to us

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.190 
every Pantheon and sin could come to us
and<00:01:15.450> not<00:01:16.320> run<00:01:16.650> around<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.159> forest<00:01:17.369> killing

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
and not run around in the forest killing

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.039 
and not run around in the forest killing

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.160 
points that that's just not fair that's
really<00:02:54.320> not<00:02:54.470> fair<00:02:55.450> but<00:02:56.450> as<00:02:56.570> you<00:02:56.660> can<00:02:56.810> see<00:02:56.990> the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
really not fair but as you can see the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.790 
really not fair but as you can see the
only<00:02:57.410> thing<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:58.000> well<00:02:59.000> saved<00:02:59.540> me<00:02:59.780> was<00:03:00.110> my<00:03:00.320> w

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800
