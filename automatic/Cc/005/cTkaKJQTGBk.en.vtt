00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.720 
tomorrow's gonna be a great great night
some<00:00:31.020> smaller<00:00:31.290> scenes<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.220> atmosphere<00:00:32.610> of

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
some smaller scenes the atmosphere of

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.140 
some smaller scenes the atmosphere of
the<00:00:32.880> game<00:00:33.590> a<00:00:34.590> lot<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.250> fans<00:00:35.520> are<00:00:35.700> get<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> see<00:00:36.030> it

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
the game a lot of fans are get to see it

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.300 
the game a lot of fans are get to see it
in<00:00:36.300> national<00:00:36.660> or<00:00:37.080> international<00:00:37.380> club<00:00:37.890> art<00:00:38.070> I

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
in national or international club art I

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.830 
in national or international club art I
think<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.300> gonna<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> little<00:00:39.660> different

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
think it's gonna be a little different

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.540 
think it's gonna be a little different
because<00:00:40.170> there's<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> lot<00:00:40.740> of<00:00:40.860> new<00:00:41.010> faces<00:00:41.160> here

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
because there's a lot of new faces here

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.000 
because there's a lot of new faces here
so<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.120> think<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.960> lot<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.260> players<00:00:43.470> feel<00:00:43.890> like

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
so I think a lot of players feel like

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.820 
so I think a lot of players feel like
they<00:00:44.130> have<00:00:44.160> improved<00:00:45.000> no<00:00:45.900> it's<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.290> 20<00:00:46.650> down

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
they have improved no it's the 20 down

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.400 
they have improved no it's the 20 down

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
in the immediate future in the long run

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.550 
in the immediate future in the long run
so<00:01:20.760> it's<00:01:20.940> important<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.450> us<00:01:21.540> how'd<00:01:22.230> it<00:01:22.260> go

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
so it's important for us how'd it go

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.140 
so it's important for us how'd it go
there's<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> lot<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.280> problems<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.760> stand<00:01:24.120> I

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
there's a lot of problems on the stand I

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.970 
there's a lot of problems on the stand I
think<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.450> important<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.870> you<00:01:25.260> know<00:01:25.409> keep

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
think it's important that you know keep

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.500 
think it's important that you know keep
building<00:01:26.190> game-by-game<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:27.000> not<00:01:27.150> really<00:01:27.360> look

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
building game-by-game it not really look

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.800 
building game-by-game it not really look
beyond<00:01:28.430> any<00:01:29.430> friendly<00:01:30.150> or<00:01:30.270> any<00:01:30.390> qualifier

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
beyond any friendly or any qualifier

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.330 
beyond any friendly or any qualifier
thing<00:01:31.020> every<00:01:31.200> game<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.440> important<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.100> think

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
thing every game is important I think

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.890 
thing every game is important I think
you<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.670> she<00:01:33.120> played<00:01:33.270> with<00:01:33.480> a<00:01:33.720> lot

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
you have that she played with a lot

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.080 
you have that she played with a lot
throwing<00:01:34.320> appearance<00:01:34.740> mr.<00:01:34.890> Marino<00:01:35.190> player<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
throwing appearance mr. Marino player it

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.520 
throwing appearance mr. Marino player it
makes<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.480> much<00:01:36.570> more<00:01:36.870> excited<00:01:37.230> to<00:01:37.290> play<00:01:37.470> it

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
makes that much more excited to play it

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.900 
makes that much more excited to play it
and<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.740> should<00:01:37.890> play<00:01:38.010> for<00:01:38.160> that<00:01:38.280> plan<00:01:38.460> more<00:01:38.670> so

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
and we should play for that plan more so

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.610 
and we should play for that plan more so
I<00:01:39.120> think<00:01:39.540> having<00:01:39.780> those<00:01:40.050> has<00:01:40.230> been<00:01:40.410> filled

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
I think having those has been filled

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.770 
I think having those has been filled
with<00:01:40.800> you<00:01:40.950> would<00:01:41.190> be<00:01:41.370> be<00:01:42.120> a<00:01:42.150> definite<00:01:42.480> benefit

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
with you would be be a definite benefit

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.570 
with you would be be a definite benefit
I<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> group's<00:01:43.650> good<00:01:43.830> it's<00:01:43.980> young<00:01:44.220> it's

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
I think the group's good it's young it's

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.120 
I think the group's good it's young it's
it's<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.150> improving<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.380> know<00:01:46.500> with<00:01:46.920> every

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
it's it's improving you know with every

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.610 
it's it's improving you know with every
game<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.460> i<00:01:47.520> think<00:01:47.760> it's<00:01:47.940> it's<00:01:48.570> going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.840> be

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
game and i think it's it's going to be

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.740 
game and i think it's it's going to be
the<00:01:49.740> future<00:01:50.370> soccer<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.090> country<00:01:51.390> is

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
the future soccer in this country is

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.910 
the future soccer in this country is
going<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.230> exceptional<00:01:52.650> when<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.800> got

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
going to be exceptional when you got

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.010 
going to be exceptional when you got
players<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.580> think<00:01:53.940> make<00:01:54.330> a<00:01:54.360> difference<00:01:54.750> like

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
players I think make a difference like

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.560 
players I think make a difference like
you<00:01:55.230> know<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> Freddy's<00:01:55.830> Josie<00:01:56.610> Sasha's<00:01:57.300> like

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
you know the Freddy's Josie Sasha's like

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.160 
you know the Freddy's Josie Sasha's like

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
Michael Bradley's residues these guys
