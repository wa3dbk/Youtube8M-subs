when<00:05:05.750> you<00:05:05.810> start<00:05:06.050> doing<00:05:06.200> like<00:05:06.530> three-way

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
when you start doing like three-way

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.610 
when you start doing like three-way
tandems<00:05:07.729> here<00:05:08.000> it<00:05:08.360> gets<00:05:08.690> pretty<00:05:08.780> crazy<00:05:09.229> I<00:05:09.440> mean

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
tandems here it gets pretty crazy I mean

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.420 
tandems here it gets pretty crazy I mean
a<00:05:09.710> three-way<00:05:10.640> tandem

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
a three-way tandem

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.110 
a three-way tandem
drift<00:05:11.940> is<00:05:12.180> just<00:05:13.170> a<00:05:13.770> three-way<00:05:14.400> tandem<00:05:14.820> jump

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
drift is just a three-way tandem jump

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.030 
drift is just a three-way tandem jump
drift<00:05:15.390> is<00:05:15.540> just<00:05:15.720> awesome<00:05:16.140> I<00:05:16.230> was<00:05:16.380> doing<00:05:16.650> I<00:05:16.830> was

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
drift is just awesome I was doing I was

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.770 
drift is just awesome I was doing I was
doing<00:05:17.190> those<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:17.610> other<00:05:17.730> night<00:05:17.970> with<00:05:18.240> some<00:05:18.660> of

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
I was just like man that drift section

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.740 
I was just like man that drift section
is<00:05:40.590> pretty<00:05:40.830> awesome<00:05:41.010> because<00:05:41.730> i<00:05:42.090> had<00:05:42.600> always

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
is pretty awesome because i had always

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.280 
is pretty awesome because i had always
battled<00:05:43.380> and<00:05:43.650> tandem<00:05:44.550> at<00:05:45.200> mainly<00:05:46.200> at

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
battled and tandem at mainly at

circuits and i never knew about this

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:50.960 
circuits and i never knew about this
section<00:05:50.100> and<00:05:50.220> i<00:05:50.280> know<00:05:50.340> it's<00:05:50.610> not<00:05:50.730> you<00:05:50.940> know

that comes up in the excuse me in the

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.710 
that comes up in the excuse me in the
online<00:05:57.950> drift<00:05:58.950> tournaments<00:05:59.550> but<00:06:00.060> i<00:06:00.420> don't

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
online drift tournaments but i don't

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.630 
online drift tournaments but i don't
know<00:06:00.780> it's<00:06:00.900> fun<00:06:01.140> it's<00:06:01.380> a<00:06:01.650> fun<00:06:01.860> drift<00:06:02.100> section<00:06:02.490> i

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
know it's fun it's a fun drift section i

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.240 
know it's fun it's a fun drift section i
like<00:06:03.090> i<00:06:03.270> like<00:06:03.570> to<00:06:03.780> run<00:06:03.960> it<00:06:04.110> it's<00:06:04.320> uh<00:06:04.560> it

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
like i like to run it it's uh it

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.420 
like i like to run it it's uh it
requires<00:06:05.670> some<00:06:05.940> comes<00:06:06.330> some<00:06:07.110> car<00:06:07.320> control<00:06:07.620> but

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
requires some comes some car control but

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.220 
requires some comes some car control but
it's<00:06:08.940> definitely<00:06:09.210> fun<00:06:09.660> once<00:06:09.840> you<00:06:09.900> get<00:06:10.080> it<00:06:10.200> down

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
it's definitely fun once you get it down

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.320 
it's definitely fun once you get it down
i<00:06:10.380> would<00:06:10.560> i<00:06:10.650> would<00:06:11.100> call<00:06:11.520> it<00:06:11.670> an<00:06:11.760> advanced

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
i would i would call it an advanced

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.690 
i would i would call it an advanced
section<00:06:12.680> but<00:06:13.680> i<00:06:13.890> don't<00:06:14.160> know<00:06:14.220> if<00:06:14.340> you're<00:06:14.520> if

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
section but i don't know if you're if

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.100 
section but i don't know if you're if
you're<00:06:14.850> like<00:06:15.120> an<00:06:15.300> intermediate<00:06:15.810> advanced

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
you're like an intermediate advanced

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.690 
you're like an intermediate advanced
drifter<00:06:16.530> you<00:06:16.650> should<00:06:16.830> have<00:06:16.950> no<00:06:17.130> problem<00:06:17.160> with

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
drifter you should have no problem with

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.660 
drifter you should have no problem with
it<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:18.510> hardest<00:06:19.080> part<00:06:19.230> about<00:06:19.590> it<00:06:19.830> is<00:06:20.010> the<00:06:20.340> jump

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
it the hardest part about it is the jump

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.570 
it the hardest part about it is the jump
and<00:06:20.910> to<00:06:21.750> keep<00:06:21.960> your<00:06:22.170> drift<00:06:22.440> going<00:06:22.980> after<00:06:23.490> the

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
and to keep your drift going after the

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.490 
and to keep your drift going after the
jump<00:06:23.790> because<00:06:24.150> if<00:06:24.300> you<00:06:24.450> turn<00:06:24.720> in<00:06:24.930> too<00:06:25.140> hard

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
jump because if you turn in too hard

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.610 
jump because if you turn in too hard
your<00:06:26.340> your<00:06:26.880> back<00:06:27.270> end<00:06:27.540> will<00:06:27.780> spin<00:06:28.170> all<00:06:28.440> the<00:06:28.470> way

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
your your back end will spin all the way

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.680 
your your back end will spin all the way
around<00:06:28.770> immediately<00:06:29.520> when<00:06:30.060> you<00:06:30.090> land<00:06:30.420> like

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
around immediately when you land like

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.960 
around immediately when you land like
there<00:06:31.200> is<00:06:31.320> absolutely<00:06:31.920> no<00:06:32.310> way<00:06:32.340> that<00:06:32.610> you'll

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
there is absolutely no way that you'll

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.480 
there is absolutely no way that you'll
be<00:06:33.120> able<00:06:33.240> to<00:06:33.360> get<00:06:33.600> it<00:06:33.690> back<00:06:33.870> if<00:06:34.260> you<00:06:34.860> go<00:06:35.040> too<00:06:35.100> far

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
be able to get it back if you go too far

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
be able to get it back if you go too far
now<00:06:36.530> however<00:06:37.530> you<00:06:38.250> don't<00:06:38.280> want<00:06:38.640> to<00:06:38.760> just<00:06:39.000> jump

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
now however you don't want to just jump

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.810 
now however you don't want to just jump
it<00:06:39.690> straight<00:06:40.080> either<00:06:40.350> because<00:06:40.890> then<00:06:41.640> you'll

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
it straight either because then you'll

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.190 
it straight either because then you'll
just<00:06:42.000> go<00:06:42.150> straight<00:06:42.480> so<00:06:42.660> you<00:06:42.720> have<00:06:42.900> to<00:06:43.050> have<00:06:43.170> a

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
just go straight so you have to have a

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.610 
just go straight so you have to have a
balance<00:06:43.470> of<00:06:43.950> what<00:06:44.910> you're<00:06:45.060> doing<00:06:45.090> and<00:06:45.600> I<00:06:46.410> kind

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
balance of what you're doing and I kind

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.860 
balance of what you're doing and I kind
of<00:06:46.710> take<00:06:46.890> it<00:06:47.010> in<00:06:47.130> reverse<00:06:47.460> this<00:06:47.730> time<00:06:47.970> not

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
of take it in reverse this time not

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.540 
of take it in reverse this time not
actually<00:06:49.350> in<00:06:49.470> Reverse<00:06:49.740> but<00:06:49.980> do<00:06:50.130> the<00:06:50.220> section

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
actually in Reverse but do the section

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.380 
actually in Reverse but do the section
