00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
does shear out quite a bit but you can

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.310 
does shear out quite a bit but you can
build<00:01:42.220> on<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.520> which<00:01:42.790> is<00:01:43.060> nice<00:01:43.330> because<00:01:43.570> at

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
build on it which is nice because at

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.200 
build on it which is nice because at
first<00:01:44.560> I<00:01:44.740> thought<00:01:44.890> maybe<00:01:44.950> it<00:01:45.250> might<00:01:45.580> be<00:01:45.880> too

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
first I thought maybe it might be too

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.990 
first I thought maybe it might be too
fair<00:01:46.690> or<00:01:47.260> too<00:01:47.560> light<00:01:47.800> for<00:01:47.830> medium<00:01:48.430> skin<00:01:48.700> tones

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
fair or too light for medium skin tones

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.420 
fair or too light for medium skin tones
and<00:01:49.270> darker<00:01:49.600> but<00:01:50.110> since<00:01:50.350> it<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:50.650> buildable<00:01:51.100> it
