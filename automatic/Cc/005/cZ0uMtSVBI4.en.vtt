00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.619 
now have all six of that in your base
and<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.190> made<00:01:02.370> sense<00:01:02.640> because<00:01:03.000> they<00:01:03.149> gave<00:01:03.359> so

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
and that made sense because they gave so

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.200 
and that made sense because they gave so
many<00:01:03.750> base<00:01:04.080> amenity<00:01:04.589> slots<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.760> only<00:01:06.030> had

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
many base amenity slots but only had

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.300 
many base amenity slots but only had
four<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.260> could<00:01:07.439> place<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.159> it

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
four that you could place with so it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.560 
four that you could place with so it
kind<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> made<00:01:08.670> sense<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.119> they<00:01:09.270> did<00:01:09.540> that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
kind of made sense that they did that

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.440 
kind of made sense that they did that
and<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:10.530> reduced<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.850> warp<00:01:12.180> base

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and then they reduced the warp base

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.359 
and then they reduced the warp base
cooldown<00:01:13.080> time<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.560> only<00:01:13.710> 10<00:01:14.010> minutes<00:01:14.310> so

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
cooldown time to only 10 minutes so

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.670 
cooldown time to only 10 minutes so
that's<00:01:14.549> pretty<00:01:14.729> cool<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.119> my<00:01:15.150> opinion<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.530> now

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
that's pretty cool in my opinion so now

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.990 
that's pretty cool in my opinion so now
if<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> base<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.340> will<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.700> able<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
if you have a base you will be able to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.810 
if you have a base you will be able to
warp<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:18.990> base<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.500> from<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.729> know

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
warp to your base with from you know

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.460 
warp to your base with from you know
every<00:01:21.119> 10<00:01:21.390> minutes<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.869> that's<00:01:21.960> really<00:01:22.290> good

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
every 10 minutes and that's really good

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.649 
every 10 minutes and that's really good
so<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.340> next<00:01:23.369> thing<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.759> they<00:01:24.000> added<00:01:24.390> was

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
legends characters and it seems like

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.800 
legends characters and it seems like
they<00:02:02.219> want<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.820> going<00:02:03.119> forward<00:02:03.270> for

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810

any<00:02:04.020> new<00:02:04.259> legends<00:02:04.590> characters<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:06.090> that's

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
any new legends characters so that's

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.960 
any new legends characters so that's
basically<00:02:06.960> adding<00:02:07.619> an<00:02:07.740> option<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.429> then<00:02:08.940> a

perk to legendary subscribers and then

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.430

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
it all depended on basically I guess

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.700 
it all depended on basically I guess
some<00:02:36.090> player<00:02:36.300> feedback<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:37.140> they<00:02:37.320> wanted<00:02:37.650> to

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
have to do some of these since some of

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.060 
have to do some of these since some of
these<00:02:43.920> are<00:02:44.160> actually<00:02:44.640> kind<00:02:44.820> of<00:02:44.850> difficult<00:02:45.330> so

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
these are actually kind of difficult so

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.650 
these are actually kind of difficult so
the<00:02:47.070> next<00:02:47.100> thing<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.760> they've<00:02:48.060> changed<00:02:48.390> is

earth<00:02:50.820> revision<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.720> biggest<00:02:52.020> thing

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
earth revision is the biggest thing

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.900

me is sorceries fury it hits just as
hard<00:03:04.800> if<00:03:05.010> not<00:03:05.040> harder<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.820> some<00:03:06.060> cases<00:03:06.300> they

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
hard if not harder in some cases they

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.810 
hard if not harder in some cases they
made<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.500> where<00:03:07.620> Earth's<00:03:07.860> knock<00:03:08.220> downs<00:03:08.520> are

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
made it to where Earth's knock downs are

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.120 
made it to where Earth's knock downs are
more<00:03:09.030> vertical<00:03:09.510> which<00:03:09.690> means<00:03:09.960> if<00:03:10.200> you're<00:03:10.740> you

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
more vertical which means if you're you

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.950 
more vertical which means if you're you
know<00:03:11.310> knocking<00:03:11.880> down<00:03:12.060> an<00:03:12.330> enemy<00:03:12.450> they're<00:03:12.840> not

knocked barely away from me previously
Earth's<00:03:25.080> powers<00:03:25.650> would<00:03:25.890> knock<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.459> enemy<00:03:27.120> like

versus<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.730> think<00:04:02.970> supposed<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.510> be<00:04:03.600> soothing

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
versus I think supposed to be soothing

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.979 
versus I think supposed to be soothing
hands<00:04:04.320> but<00:04:05.160> um<00:04:05.340> they<00:04:06.030> basically<00:04:06.390> made<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.750> like

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
hands but um they basically made it like

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.100 
hands but um they basically made it like
Furies<00:04:07.769> or<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.430> sorcery<00:04:08.940> pets<00:04:09.300> power<00:04:09.780> costs

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
Furies or the sorcery pets power costs

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.750 
Furies or the sorcery pets power costs
right<00:04:10.380> here<00:04:10.590> they<00:04:10.709> put<00:04:10.980> it<00:04:11.100> into<00:04:11.370> one<00:04:11.550> ability

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
right here they put it into one ability

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.759 
right here they put it into one ability
so<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.239> get<00:04:12.540> both<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.050> golems<00:04:13.350> with<00:04:13.560> one

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
so you get both of the golems with one

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.860 
so you get both of the golems with one
power<00:04:14.010> points<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.610> then<00:04:15.150> you'll<00:04:15.300> get<00:04:15.510> four<00:04:15.780> to

power points and then you'll get four to

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.659 
actually really really liking it because
earth<00:05:06.990> was<00:05:07.259> one<00:05:07.530> of<00:05:07.620> my<00:05:07.710> favorite<00:05:08.099> powers<00:05:08.430> for

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
earth was one of my favorite powers for

earth was one of my favorite powers for
the<00:05:08.789> longest<00:05:09.180> time<00:05:09.330> but<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:10.110> lot<00:05:10.530> of<00:05:10.560> players

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 
raids and I think earth was just really

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.640 
raids and I think earth was just really
one<00:05:17.400> of<00:05:17.430> those<00:05:17.639> sleeper<00:05:18.509> powers<00:05:18.900> that<00:05:19.139> had<00:05:19.620> a

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
one of those sleeper powers that had a

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.550 
one of those sleeper powers that had a
lot<00:05:19.860> of<00:05:19.889> potential<00:05:20.280> to<00:05:20.610> be<00:05:20.909> top<00:05:21.690> dps<00:05:21.900> but<00:05:22.380> just

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
lot of potential to be top dps but just

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.680 
lot of potential to be top dps but just
needed<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:22.889> have<00:05:23.039> some<00:05:23.099> fixes<00:05:23.729> now<00:05:24.419> the<00:05:24.509> only

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
needed to have some fixes now the only

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:25.999 
needed to have some fixes now the only
thing<00:05:24.780> I<00:05:25.020> would<00:05:25.199> really<00:05:25.500> say<00:05:25.710> that<00:05:25.860> Earth

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
thing I would really say that Earth

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.070 
thing I would really say that Earth
still<00:05:26.400> needs<00:05:26.669> is<00:05:26.880> they<00:05:27.060> need<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.509> add<00:05:27.690> a

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
still needs is they need to add a

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.170 
still needs is they need to add a
mechanic<00:05:28.710> with<00:05:28.979> pets<00:05:29.310> in<00:05:29.550> general<00:05:30.000> that

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
mechanic with pets in general that

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.300 
mechanic with pets in general that
allows<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.810> pets<00:05:31.050> to<00:05:31.259> block<00:05:31.530> along<00:05:31.949> with<00:05:32.190> the

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
allows the pets to block along with the

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.939 
allows the pets to block along with the
player<00:05:32.580> because<00:05:33.570> I<00:05:33.780> mean<00:05:34.320> during<00:05:34.530> a<00:05:34.710> boss

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
fight let's say the boss is a one-shot

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.140

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
way still he's going to be doing what my

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.589 
way still he's going to be doing what my
pets<00:05:40.919> doing<00:05:41.190> right<00:05:41.400> now<00:05:41.610> you<00:05:42.300> know<00:05:42.389> just

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
pets doing right now you know just

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.749 
pets doing right now you know just
continuing<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:43.560> attack<00:05:43.889> and<00:05:44.130> staying<00:05:44.490> and

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
continuing the attack and staying and

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.120 
continuing the attack and staying and
within<00:05:45.090> range<00:05:45.449> and<00:05:45.780> can<00:05:45.990> possibly<00:05:46.199> die<00:05:46.770> and<00:05:47.070> I

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
within range and can possibly die and I

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.219 
within range and can possibly die and I
can't<00:05:47.370> do<00:05:47.550> anything<00:05:47.759> about<00:05:47.969> that<00:05:48.120> now<00:05:48.960> if<00:05:49.080> they

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
can't do anything about that now if they

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.529 
can't do anything about that now if they
added<00:05:49.530> to<00:05:49.710> where<00:05:49.889> the<00:05:50.280> pet<00:05:50.550> could<00:05:50.789> block<00:05:51.090> along

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
added to where the pet could block along

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.270 
added to where the pet could block along
with<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:52.020> player<00:05:52.349> or<00:05:52.680> something<00:05:53.099> like<00:05:53.219> that

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
with the player or something like that

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.459 
with the player or something like that
it<00:05:54.090> would<00:05:54.240> give<00:05:54.449> the<00:05:54.599> pets<00:05:54.870> a<00:05:55.080> lot<00:05:55.319> more

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
it would give the pets a lot more

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:57.469 
it would give the pets a lot more
survivability<00:05:56.069> other<00:05:56.430> than<00:05:56.669> just<00:05:56.909> throwing<00:05:57.180> a

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
survivability other than just throwing a

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.510 
survivability other than just throwing a
shield<00:05:57.780> on<00:05:58.020> my<00:05:58.380> pet<00:05:58.590> and<00:05:58.800> hoping<00:05:59.159> that<00:05:59.370> it

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
shield on my pet and hoping that it

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.939 
shield on my pet and hoping that it
stays<00:05:59.550> alive<00:06:00.270> so<00:06:01.050> that's<00:06:01.199> really<00:06:01.380> it<00:06:01.530> for<00:06:01.830> this

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
stays alive so that's really it for this

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:04.459 
stays alive so that's really it for this
game<00:06:02.190> update<00:06:02.610> and<00:06:02.789> I<00:06:02.880> really<00:06:03.210> hope<00:06:03.419> that<00:06:03.930> more

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:04.469 
game update and I really hope that more

game update and I really hope that more
is<00:06:04.680> added<00:06:05.039> to<00:06:05.069> it<00:06:05.340> because<00:06:05.490> it<00:06:05.639> is<00:06:05.969> a<00:06:06.000> small

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
is added to it because it is a small

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.080 
is added to it because it is a small
update<00:06:06.630> and<00:06:07.159> the<00:06:08.159> earth<00:06:08.340> revision<00:06:08.940> it's

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090

because that is why we have a lot of

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:39.390 
because that is why we have a lot of
players<00:06:37.680> with<00:06:37.949> low<00:06:38.190> skill<00:06:38.520> points<00:06:38.880> and<00:06:39.029> high<00:06:39.180> n

players with low skill points and high n
content<00:06:39.880> or<00:06:40.000> just<00:06:40.300> don't<00:06:40.570> really<00:06:40.870> know<00:06:40.990> what

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
content or just don't really know what

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.469 
content or just don't really know what
they're<00:06:41.530> doing<00:06:41.919> but<00:06:42.639> I'm<00:06:42.940> really<00:06:43.210> glad<00:06:43.360> that

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 
they're doing but I'm really glad that

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:45.270 
they're doing but I'm really glad that
they<00:06:43.750> are<00:06:43.870> adding<00:06:44.199> this<00:06:44.320> to<00:06:44.380> the<00:06:44.560> game<00:06:44.740> finally

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
they are adding this to the game finally

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.249 
they are adding this to the game finally
because<00:06:45.639> they<00:06:45.850> needed<00:06:46.210> to<00:06:46.389> have<00:06:46.930> it<00:06:47.110> to<00:06:47.229> where

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:47.259 
because they needed to have it to where

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:49.320 
because they needed to have it to where
players<00:06:47.620> couldn't<00:06:48.039> skip<00:06:48.280> content<00:06:48.820> so<00:06:49.030> this<00:06:49.210> is

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
players couldn't skip content so this is

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.540 
players couldn't skip content so this is
going<00:06:49.449> to<00:06:49.539> be<00:06:49.660> another<00:06:49.930> way<00:06:50.199> to<00:06:50.530> make<00:06:51.070> players

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
going to be another way to make players
