00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.780
 such friends then again with this 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.090
 song we hope the novel does not tell me 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.250
 they will remove for all the problems 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.190
 with the previous video but we're going to 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.640
 go on to explain this quickly before 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.200
 that nothing the audio they heard is the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.750
 version a version of the mariachi 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.850
 international huatulco 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.820
 I do not expect a greeting is not angry 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.430
 for them and well let's start 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.580
 quickly at the entrance what we do 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.580
 is 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:20.930
 mm and travel 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.930
 and my family 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.340
 and then when it comes in that would be the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:31.850
 entrance comes out very easy 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:36.910
 then for the first beautiful ornament cani 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.910
 we left 2000 alone 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.319
 and then everything happened to me 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.890
 I use 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.630
 lovely gift 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.630
 with fish 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:20.660
 the sun or just solÃ­s solÃ­s real the taste 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.190
 of you but they are plump we 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.860
 orzamentos takes it because I repeat it 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.880
 here in this case the mariachi of whom 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.590
 we take the audio makes him eat but 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.510
 in the original version because it is with 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.530
 guitar then we can do it with 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.450
 the prosecutor with the guitar or also with 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.560
 several issues expose in agreement 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.560
 next comes 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.570
 another tito track that would be 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:10.410
 sun and then it has a little side that is the 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.790
 reason yes but shooting by the sun if the 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.760
 Sun 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.760
 Solfa me re elect would be him 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:34.050
 to stick to the belt as an auxiliary pain 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.050
 and soldier 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:46.300
 and then then immediately to himself 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.300
 but I do not think so 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.410
 maybe where they have a little bit more 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.150
 problems is in this coming dome 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.150
 because he came out he was not 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.490
 to fine tune it then 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:17.030
 Y 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.530

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:40.540
 the other one we're going to grab from the same 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.540
 it's going to be exactly the same the first 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.130
 row 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:57.600
 and the obstacles is the reason to repopulate 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:00.500
 all natural the same with the 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.590
 next natural 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.669
 what else does it follow since the only part 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.669
 what happens the intermediate 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.420
 yes 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.210

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:44.720
 be more problem than more 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.260

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.300

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.680
 but basically this is the song not 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:38.400
 it gives you more problem to return the video 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:41.069
 so that they can appreciate it from 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:44.300

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:46.740
