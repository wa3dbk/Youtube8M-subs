 it was going everyone is zero for 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.340
 fixed controls overclocking men 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.480
 in France you are welcome to 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.400
 unpacking this new video 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.550
 today we will introduce you 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.680
 a map of the rog range for republic 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.590
 of gamer so of asus but not just 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.739
 which an exceptional video card 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.879
 in fact it is the agetic 780 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.070
 posidon the card the double 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.270
 air and liquid cooling 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:08.590
 but above all as usual 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:10.990
 start with the box and yes so of 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.450
 start with the box of this gtx 580 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.120
 posidon platinum of course the map of 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.830
 asus republic of gamer which includes a 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.400
 air and cooling system 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.810
 liquid 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.100
 that's what we see on the back of 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.880
 the box with this exploded view 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.890
 corresponding to the direct cu h2o the way 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.760
 which asus called this system of 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.950
 liquid cooling 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.500
 here we have the different layers 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.780
 the pcb going through the watercooling 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.220
 radiator and ventilation but the 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.470
 more importantly it's in the box so 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.720
 we start of course to open it to 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.790
 prepare the bundle that consists of a 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.190
 first element that is artistic 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.500
 metal of the rog republic of range 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.310
 gamer always indispensable then and 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.500
 we need 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.150
 of course of feeding with the 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.510
 double connector pci express 6 pins 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.880
 towards a pin and still the little 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.330
 sleeve with the dvd drivers and 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.310
 software 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.800
 the installation manual but that 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.000
 rarely do we need it and that's 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.470
 all that I propose to you now 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.180
 is that we keep a little bit of 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.700
 go inside with the card in them 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.879
 same and here it is this ethics 780 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.590
 posidon the rog range is mentioned 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.040
 as well as the small logo position all to 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.110
 right 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.239
 we have our double fan of 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.760
 90 mm that blows on this huge 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.360
 radiator compound both of a is in 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.630
 aluminum 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.300
 direct cooling system cu h2o 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.790
 the constructor asus has of course thought of 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.070
 everything with the possibility of putting 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.350
 1/4 tips the republic of gamer logo 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.420
 it is powered according to your 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.070
 processor load and the card is 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.730
 she herself fueled by a feeling and 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.010
 tasteless 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.900
 if we turn the map back we find 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.940
 our famous ring play proper to 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.800
 asus brand cards always in 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.930
 aluminum still dell who 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.170
 will stiffen and protect 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.580
 this beautiful because the backplate is 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.680
 also up to date and to leave room for 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.840
 elsewhere proper to just but also to the 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.970
 viewing your diet with 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.320
 a green or red led to know if 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.320
 you have correctly connected your 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.360
 pci-express always connectivity us 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.540
 let's go on the front with the double dvi 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.440
 dvi dvi as well as to port hdmi and a 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.870
 displayPort 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.920
 that's all for the map at the level 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.420
 visual now what are you 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.800
 proposes is to disassemble for 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.320
 check what they pay to have under this 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.320
 cooling system with cd 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.469
 so here is the dismantling of this gtx 280 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.989
 posidon the backplate and duplicate with 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.640
 some vices we can see that this is 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.859
 of the word morons of aluminum that is there 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.420
 to stiffen the whole thing it's not 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.920
 a few screws on the bracket 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.189
 also for to remove this imposing 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.769
 direct cu h 2 it's done 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.719
 the little politics to dismount the 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.980
 fan and it's done 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:57.280
 we will be able now you 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.980
 show this live cu h2o so we have 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.859
 a copper block that comes into contact 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.720
 live with the gpu only about 110 with 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.459
 the entire radiator that is in 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.530
 aluminum we see everywhere 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.030
 thermal kippas just recover 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.370
 the heat of shocking elements like 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.290
 the memories as well as the floors 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.900
 feeding and all this of course 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.370
 can leave either in the fins of the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.949
 radiator or in the system of 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.150
 liquid cooling 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.590
 it's an element that is quite imposing 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.360
 you transfer to the data level 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.919
 it is quite heavy but whatever it is 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.599
 either the finish is always one for 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.460
 is not sure of the price of us gas and that's 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.409
 quite normal what you think 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.440
 we go to pcb now and yes we 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:38.440
 found the same pcb as the 280 gtx 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.970
 direct cu2 since asus used the 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.650
 same base we find our 12 chips 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.370
 memories for the 3 gigabytes of home 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.349
 delusions 5 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.630
 this time of brand elpida at the level 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.050
 of feeding this gpu and the 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.000
 memory 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.979
 we have ten stages of feeding or 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.080
 at the memory gpu and pl 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.030
 all that of course powered by an 8 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.460
 pins and six pins to provide a 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.840
 maximum power on the back of the card 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.729
 you find the connectivity prolos 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.409
 employer for the ached forward it's up to 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.970
 both of the memory of the gesture but 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:07.900
 also to check the tensions you're 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.940
 of course the monitoring in front of both 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.530
 connectors for the celi allowing 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.520
 make oven and at will 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.550
 So here is a video of unpacking 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.500
 this gtx and 780 posidon platinum 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.060
 finished we hope you have more 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.490
 pleasure to watch it we have it 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.050
 been with a very nice card with a 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.719
 exclusive cooling system of 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.039
 at asus of direct pcu h2o you can 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.349
 now if you wish to comment 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.139
 the video on our youtube channel but 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:35.639
 also on our website www.me which 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.139
 meditate france.com since we are going 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.180
 able to present you the complete test 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.830
 of this monster at any rate you 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.050
 wish everyone a good evening 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.409
 Have a nice day to ciao liga
