00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.310
 Talk about guys on the keith channel. 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.290
 Who speaks guilherme ab 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.290
 the actress cate pot four maneuvers 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.890
 today I will teach with the floor 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.349
 It's a great site for you to send a new one. 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.300
 great from the emotion of commanding the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.740
 fifth defron because he is very similar 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.200
 without imagining that you will run a fit 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.969
 only in the front attack so what you 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.730
 going to do goes parallel with the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.800
 box and as well as fifty defron you 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.329
 play it up parallel 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.460
 never go between them whenever you go 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.980
 give a new obvious angle orientation that 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.500
 You go over the crate and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.719
 ended up in the maneuver until falling then 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.370
 you send know how to send the fifth defron 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.219
 What you have to do is hold the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.890
 front stretch the right form of manaus 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.510
 gras is to surrender or be in control 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.399
 as if it were a new manual 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.780
 Just of course when you're learning. 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.280
 Can you do that by picking up new ones? 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.200
 will learn much easier 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.689
 so what will you do the important 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.600
 do you know how to balance the weight at the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.939
 front to position it right and 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.700
 back flexed and the whole weight in front 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.710
 will run this way here you can see that 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.960
 your leg will be flexed only 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.710
 accompanying arrived at the end what 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.210
 you will do 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.430
 You have to be relieved if you stay 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.770
 a pressure will think it will do 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.500
 So he's going to fall for Chuchu. 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.409
 so here is a minimum of 12 here 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.329
 just to get you down on the 46 with 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.610
 that he also hits the stretch of 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.810
 moth then also want to send it to him 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.090
 to pass all here is who on the bases in 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.250
 big will work your feet as if 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.619
 be a manual fit and you will hold 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.950
 on the front leg came parallel in the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.950
 edge 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.039
 the tip to send them farm is you 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.479
 Put him in control if you vote for him 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.000
 very strongly here 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.220
 if you step too hard an only pension 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.170
 the carnival ahead to give the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.390
 spending you going so hard that it goes 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.040
 to stop this is going to end up falling to 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.260
 front you have to imagine that you 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.239
 will give some grids running can not 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.129
 to give that one there was serious 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.890
 it will lock even though the 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.680
 Llodra uncertain without touching the use because 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.849
 you already go with the perception of 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.810
 control and not locking with the lousada ac 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.849
 of course when you are learning 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.849
 easier catching with 11 even 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.790
 This is it, guys at ronaldo levels . 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.739
 frontside us big here in a sad 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.560
 spot four channel maneuvers on 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.790
 skateboard causes what in 2014 has a lot 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.409
 thing out there 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.019
 Is this you, of any doubt, but? 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.849
 our social networks which is a new work 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.519

 This happens to who she envies
