satin but more like matte finish I found

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.110 
satin but more like matte finish I found
it<00:03:41.170> really<00:03:41.440> difficult<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:42.100> blend<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.580> now<00:03:42.850> I

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
it really difficult to blend this now I

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.540 
it really difficult to blend this now I
used<00:03:43.750> my<00:03:43.959> NARS<00:03:44.290> sheer<00:03:44.410> glow<00:03:44.620> which<00:03:45.220> even

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
used my NARS sheer glow which even

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.190 
used my NARS sheer glow which even
though<00:03:45.610> it<00:03:45.700> says<00:03:45.910> glow<00:03:46.330> there's<00:03:46.780> no<00:03:46.959> glow<00:03:47.140> to

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
though it says glow there's no glow to

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.590 
though it says glow there's no glow to
that<00:03:47.380> foundation<00:03:47.770> it<00:03:48.190> is<00:03:48.370> it's<00:03:48.640> pretty<00:03:49.000> mad

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
that foundation it is it's pretty mad

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.580 
that foundation it is it's pretty mad
maybe<00:03:50.110> satin<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.770> little<00:03:51.100> bit<00:03:51.250> but<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:52.660> really

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
maybe satin a little bit but it really

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.040 
maybe satin a little bit but it really
gets<00:03:53.800> super<00:03:54.310> blotchy<00:03:54.550> and<00:03:54.790> super<00:03:55.510> hard<00:03:55.810> to

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
gets super blotchy and super hard to

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.710 
gets super blotchy and super hard to
blend<00:03:56.260> in<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:56.980> I<00:03:57.250> use<00:03:57.910> this<00:03:58.090> with<00:03:58.270> my<00:03:58.390> tinted

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
blend in so I use this with my tinted

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.630 
blend in so I use this with my tinted
moisturizer<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.500> any<00:03:59.920> foundations<00:04:00.490> that<00:04:00.550> I

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
moisturizer and any foundations that I

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.730 
moisturizer and any foundations that I
have<00:04:00.940> that<00:04:01.150> have<00:04:01.360> a<00:04:01.570> moisturizing<00:04:02.080> effect<00:04:02.350> to

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
have that have a moisturizing effect to

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.880 
have that have a moisturizing effect to
it<00:04:02.770> and<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:04.120> felt<00:04:04.570> like<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:05.110> combination<00:04:05.380> of

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
it and I felt like the combination of

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.949 
it and I felt like the combination of
the<00:04:06.040> two<00:04:06.190> products<00:04:06.670> work<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.120> best<00:04:07.330> now<00:04:07.570> I<00:04:07.750> did

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
the two products work the best now I did

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.500 
the two products work the best now I did
not<00:04:08.110> think<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.680> worked<00:04:08.920> great<00:04:09.160> with<00:04:09.459> any<00:04:10.000> of<00:04:10.390> my

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
not think it worked great with any of my

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.850 
not think it worked great with any of my
foundations<00:04:11.080> that<00:04:11.140> are<00:04:11.260> meant<00:04:11.500> for<00:04:11.650> a<00:04:11.680> matte

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
foundations that are meant for a matte

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.559 
foundations that are meant for a matte
finish<00:04:11.890> I

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569

that<00:04:12.719> it<00:04:12.840> just<00:04:13.079> got<00:04:13.200> really<00:04:13.530> sticky<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.609> gross

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
that it just got really sticky and gross

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.310 
that it just got really sticky and gross
and<00:04:14.849> hard<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.390> bind<00:04:15.569> and<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:15.870> did<00:04:16.019> not<00:04:16.109> look

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
and hard to bind and it did not look

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.069

like this primer I think it's great I
could<00:04:21.359> see<00:04:21.600> why<00:04:21.810> they<00:04:22.079> boast<00:04:22.410> 15<00:04:22.889> hours

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
could see why they boast 15 hours

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.070 
could see why they boast 15 hours
because<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:23.729> definitely<00:04:23.970> kept<00:04:24.449> my<00:04:24.539> foundation
