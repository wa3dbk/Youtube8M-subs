with my dad in the shop and we've been

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.160 
with my dad in the shop and we've been
messing<00:00:06.899> about<00:00:07.200> making<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.890> few<00:00:08.099> jigs<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.730> some

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
messing about making a few jigs and some

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.680 
messing about making a few jigs and some
extra<00:00:10.370> tools<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.759> stuff<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:11.969> we<00:00:12.269> could<00:00:12.450> use

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
extra tools and stuff that we could use

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.910 
extra tools and stuff that we could use
push<00:00:13.559> sticks<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.070> such<00:00:15.230> earlier<00:00:16.230> today<00:00:16.619> we

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
push sticks and such earlier today we

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.179 
push sticks and such earlier today we
made<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.960> gouge<00:00:18.960> sharpening<00:00:19.740> jig<00:00:20.039> and

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
made a gouge sharpening jig and

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.740 
made a gouge sharpening jig and
obviously<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:20.789> not<00:00:20.939> glued<00:00:21.240> together<00:00:21.420> or

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
obviously it's not glued together or

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.140 
obviously it's not glued together or
anything<00:00:21.960> like<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.260> right<00:00:22.590> now<00:00:22.710> but<00:00:24.260> this

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
anything like that right now but this

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.730 
anything like that right now but this
arm<00:00:28.130> can<00:00:29.130> be<00:00:29.279> adjusted<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.880> angle<00:00:30.740> pivoting

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
arm can be adjusted in angle pivoting

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.569 
arm can be adjusted in angle pivoting
about<00:00:31.980> here<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:33.920> then<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.160> put<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> nut

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
about here and then you can put a nut

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.670 
about here and then you can put a nut
and<00:00:35.820> washer<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.630> wing<00:00:36.840> nut<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.170> there<00:00:37.290> tighten

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
and washer and wing nut in there tighten

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.310 
and washer and wing nut in there tighten
that<00:00:37.770> down<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.329> then<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.719> put<00:00:39.930> your

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
that down and then you can put your

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.990 
that down and then you can put your
lathe<00:00:41.010> turning<00:00:44.180> gouges<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.950> spindles

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
lathe turning gouges and spindles

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.260 
lathe turning gouges and spindles
through<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.910> use<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.180> on

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
through here and then you can use it on

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.790 
through here and then you can use it on
a<00:00:51.300> slow<00:00:51.600> speed<00:00:51.840> grinder<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:53.449> sharpen<00:00:54.449> your

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
a slow speed grinder to sharpen your

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.720 
a slow speed grinder to sharpen your
your<00:00:55.800> tools<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:57.109> get<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.140> glued<00:00:59.010> up

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
your tools so get that glued up

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.970 
your tools so get that glued up
it<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> nice<00:01:00.510> friction<00:01:00.930> fit<00:01:01.079> I'm<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> only

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
it is a nice friction fit I'm the only

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.010 
it is a nice friction fit I'm the only
problem<00:01:02.399> we<00:01:02.489> had<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.570> ran<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:05.450> in<00:01:06.450> here

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
problem we had that we ran to is in here

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.859 
problem we had that we ran to is in here
the<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.950> router<00:01:11.580> bit<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.210> course<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.600> round

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the the router bit of course is round

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:21.499 
the the router bit of course is round
and<00:01:14.150> needs<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.270> square<00:01:17.150> corner<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:20.509> tried

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
and needs a square corner so we tried

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.390 
and needs a square corner so we tried
our<00:01:21.659> best<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.320> flattened<00:01:22.770> out<00:01:22.860> with

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
our best to get that flattened out with

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.359 
our best to get that flattened out with
the<00:01:23.549> file<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.270> think<00:01:24.689> my<00:01:24.750> dad<00:01:25.189> did<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.340> one

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
the file I think my dad did this one

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:36.530 
the file I think my dad did this one
sorry<00:01:29.369> did<00:01:31.970> anyway<00:01:34.520> anyway<00:01:35.520> maybe<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.119> did<00:01:36.390> that

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
sorry did anyway anyway maybe I did that

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:45.530 
sorry did anyway anyway maybe I did that
one<00:01:36.950> but<00:01:37.950> I'm<00:01:38.040> gonna<00:01:38.159> say<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.460> was<00:01:41.840> anyway<00:01:44.540> then

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
one but I'm gonna say it was anyway then

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.880 
one but I'm gonna say it was anyway then
we<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:47.090> had<00:01:48.090> my<00:01:48.270> first<00:01:48.600> experience<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.470> double

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
we I had my first experience with double

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.810 
we I had my first experience with double
sided<00:01:50.040> machine<00:01:50.869> I<00:01:51.869> found<00:01:52.100> some<00:01:53.100> examples<00:01:53.729> on

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
sided machine I found some examples on

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.819 
sided machine I found some examples on
the<00:01:53.939> web<00:01:54.119> where<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.450> put<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> couple<00:01:55.140> pins<00:01:55.439> in

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the web where you put a couple pins in

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.550 
the web where you put a couple pins in
and<00:01:56.100> basically<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.479> flip<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.079> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
and basically you can flip it and that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.109 
and basically you can flip it and that
way<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.710> can<00:02:00.469> profile<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.920> handle<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.700> these

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
way I can profile the handle of these

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.770 
way I can profile the handle of these
push<00:02:03.540> sticks<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.369> learned<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.579> few<00:02:05.780> important

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
push sticks I learned a few important

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.770 
push sticks I learned a few important
lessons<00:02:07.229> while<00:02:07.469> doing<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:08.599> number<00:02:09.599> one

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
lessons while doing this number one

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.400 
lessons while doing this number one
double-check<00:02:10.619> your<00:02:11.330> machine<00:02:12.330> paths

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
double-check your machine paths

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.780 
double-check your machine paths
to<00:02:13.680> make<00:02:13.830> sure<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.250> you're<00:02:14.430> not<00:02:14.520> actually

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
to make sure that you're not actually

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.330 
to make sure that you're not actually
going<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.300> hit<00:02:15.480> your<00:02:15.630> pin<00:02:15.870> with<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.080> bit<00:02:16.350> that's

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
going to hit your pin with a bit that's

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.050 
going to hit your pin with a bit that's
what<00:02:17.580> happens<00:02:18.290> I've<00:02:19.290> got<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.530> be<00:02:19.760> say<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.940> I'm

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
what happens I've got to be say that I'm

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.140 
what happens I've got to be say that I'm
very<00:02:21.090> surprised<00:02:21.750> actually<00:02:22.110> at<00:02:22.530> how<00:02:22.800> far<00:02:23.150> this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
very surprised actually at how far this

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.390 
very surprised actually at how far this
pit<00:02:24.570> actually<00:02:25.170> could<00:02:25.410> cut<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.890> steel<00:02:26.160> before

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
pit actually could cut the steel before

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.910 
pit actually could cut the steel before
it<00:02:26.670> broke<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.810> pin<00:02:28.110> was<00:02:28.320> level<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:28.770> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
it broke that pin was level with the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.760 
it broke that pin was level with the
surface<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.940> that's<00:02:30.840> all<00:02:31.020> that's<00:02:31.170> left<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.620> it

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
surface and that's all that's left of it

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.910 
surface and that's all that's left of it
so<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.130> cut<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.930> good<00:02:33.930> half<00:02:34.170> inch<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.650> steel

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
so it cut a good half inch of the steel

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.490 
so it cut a good half inch of the steel
away<00:02:35.190> before<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:36.600> failed<00:02:38.270> so<00:02:39.620> yeah<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.650> mean<00:02:40.950> I

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
away before it failed so yeah I mean I

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.950 
away before it failed so yeah I mean I
bet<00:02:43.500> it's<00:02:43.650> possible<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.340> two<00:02:44.820> mil<00:02:45.170> steel<00:02:46.170> with

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
bet it's possible the two mil steel with

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.080 
bet it's possible the two mil steel with
with<00:02:48.960> this<00:02:49.170> system<00:02:49.620> but<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:50.400> don't<00:02:50.910> think<00:02:51.000> I

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
with this system but I don't think I

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.850 
with this system but I don't think I
would<00:02:51.210> recommend<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.930> think<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.680> need<00:02:52.830> to

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
would recommend it I think you need to

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.740 
would recommend it I think you need to
have<00:02:53.070> coolant<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.730> all<00:02:54.210> that<00:02:54.390> kind<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.630> stuff

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
have coolant and all that kind of stuff

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.400 
have coolant and all that kind of stuff
and<00:02:55.110> take<00:02:55.440> much<00:02:55.860> lighter<00:02:56.190> passes<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:57.410> and

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
and take much lighter passes then and

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.560 
and take much lighter passes then and
probably<00:02:58.590> slower<00:02:59.040> speeds<00:02:59.430> than<00:02:59.670> what<00:03:00.300> I<00:03:00.330> was

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
probably slower speeds than what I was

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.810 
probably slower speeds than what I was
using<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.260> cut<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.620> wood<00:03:01.800> when<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.310> did<00:03:02.640> this

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
using to cut the wood when it did this

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.500 
using to cut the wood when it did this
so<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:05.280> other<00:03:05.430> thing<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.360> learned<00:03:08.510> is

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
so the other thing that I learned is

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.320 
so the other thing that I learned is
double-check<00:03:10.440> your<00:03:10.620> tab<00:03:10.860> Heights<00:03:11.270> they<00:03:12.270> were

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
double-check your tab Heights they were

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.090 
double-check your tab Heights they were
actually<00:03:12.720> supposed<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.110> be<00:03:13.230> four<00:03:13.500> tabs<00:03:13.800> on

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
actually supposed to be four tabs on

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.350 
actually supposed to be four tabs on
this<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.600> make<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:16.350> rough<00:03:16.800> cut<00:03:17.490> through<00:03:18.120> the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
this and I make a rough cut through the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
this and I make a rough cut through the
material<00:03:18.810> then<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.080> pass<00:03:19.350> do<00:03:20.070> a<00:03:20.100> final<00:03:20.550> pass<00:03:21.380> to

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
material then I pass do a final pass to

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.860 
material then I pass do a final pass to
just<00:03:23.040> trim<00:03:23.280> up<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:24.209> get<00:03:24.360> everything<00:03:24.570> nice<00:03:24.810> and

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
just trim up and get everything nice and

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.050 
just trim up and get everything nice and
smooth<00:03:25.290> well<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:26.190> was<00:03:26.310> supposed<00:03:26.550> to<00:03:26.640> pull<00:03:26.850> up

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
smooth well it was supposed to pull up

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.020 
smooth well it was supposed to pull up
to<00:03:27.690> 0.25<00:03:28.350> inches<00:03:28.980> so<00:03:29.190> half<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.430> thickness<00:03:29.910> of

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
to 0.25 inches so half the thickness of

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.300 
to 0.25 inches so half the thickness of
this<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.360> leave<00:03:30.510> part<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.959> tab<00:03:31.200> here<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.680> it

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
this and leave part of a tab here and it

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.360 
this and leave part of a tab here and it
didn't<00:03:33.350> so<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:34.530> didn't<00:03:34.830> work<00:03:34.980> out<00:03:35.130> so<00:03:35.190> well

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
didn't so that didn't work out so well

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.120 
didn't so that didn't work out so well
and<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:36.330> end<00:03:36.570> result<00:03:37.020> of<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.380> was<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:38.070> we

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
and the end result of it was that we

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.490 
and the end result of it was that we
wrecked<00:03:38.550> a<00:03:38.670> couple<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.150> spindles<00:03:40.140> when<00:03:40.350> they

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
wrecked a couple of spindles when they

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.840 
wrecked a couple of spindles when they
broke<00:03:41.120> worked<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.239> couple<00:03:42.360> of<00:03:43.520> push<00:03:44.520> sticks

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
broke worked a couple of push sticks

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.380 
broke worked a couple of push sticks
when<00:03:45.380> they<00:03:46.380> broke<00:03:46.620> free<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.390> obviously

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
when they broke free and obviously

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.479 
when they broke free and obviously
wandered<00:03:48.840> into<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.140> bit<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:50.130> I'm<00:03:50.280> just

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
wandered into the bit and I'm just

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.890 
wandered into the bit and I'm just
really<00:03:50.730> glad<00:03:50.820> that<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.300> didn't<00:03:51.630> end<00:03:51.780> up

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
really glad that that didn't end up

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.780 
really glad that that didn't end up
breaking<00:03:52.110> another<00:03:52.500> bit<00:03:52.770> because<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.610> sure

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
breaking another bit because it sure

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.400 
breaking another bit because it sure
could<00:03:54.060> have<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.330> think<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.959> other<00:03:58.080> thing<00:03:58.380> that

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
could have I think the other thing that

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.530 
could have I think the other thing that
I<00:03:58.620> learned<00:03:58.890> is<00:04:01.820> probably<00:04:02.820> a<00:04:02.880> better<00:04:03.030> idea<00:04:03.180> to

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
I learned is probably a better idea to

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.840 
I learned is probably a better idea to
get<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.530> corner<00:04:04.860> really<00:04:05.010> secure<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:06.709> leave

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
get the corner really secure and leave

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.580 
get the corner really secure and leave
enough<00:04:08.850> space<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:09.390> that<00:04:09.840> there's<00:04:10.050> doesn't

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
enough space so that there's doesn't

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.240 
enough space so that there's doesn't
break<00:04:10.890> out<00:04:11.040> anything<00:04:11.459> here<00:04:13.100> behind<00:04:14.100> your

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
break out anything here behind your

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.130 
break out anything here behind your
edges<00:04:14.610> I<00:04:15.859> was<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.890> little<00:04:17.160> bit<00:04:17.280> too<00:04:17.459> greedy<00:04:17.790> with

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
edges I was a little bit too greedy with

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.560 
edges I was a little bit too greedy with
how<00:04:19.140> close<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.650> got<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:20.040> my<00:04:20.190> edges<00:04:20.580> and

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
how close I got to my edges and

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.150 
how close I got to my edges and
of<00:04:23.570> course<00:04:23.900> that's<00:04:24.020> not<00:04:24.260> died<00:04:24.560> down<00:04:24.740> anymore

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
of course that's not died down anymore

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.010 
of course that's not died down anymore
but<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.670> end<00:04:25.850> result<00:04:26.210> of<00:04:26.300> that<00:04:26.360> is<00:04:26.510> that<00:04:26.690> this

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
but the end result of that is that this

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.880 
but the end result of that is that this
thing<00:04:27.230> can<00:04:27.410> move<00:04:27.620> on<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.460> without<00:04:29.560> having<00:04:30.560> it

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
thing can move on you without having it

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.640 
thing can move on you without having it
and<00:04:30.980> I<00:04:31.040> almost<00:04:31.190> had<00:04:31.430> another<00:04:32.500> disaster<00:04:33.500> when

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
and I almost had another disaster when

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.680 
and I almost had another disaster when
that<00:04:33.800> moved<00:04:34.070> on<00:04:34.250> me<00:04:34.460> so<00:04:35.420> anyway<00:04:37.270> I'm<00:04:38.270> really

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
that moved on me so anyway I'm really

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.410 
that moved on me so anyway I'm really
learning<00:04:39.160> so<00:04:40.160> it's<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:40.640> steep<00:04:40.880> learning<00:04:41.060> curve

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
learning so it's a steep learning curve

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
learning so it's a steep learning curve
with<00:04:41.630> this<00:04:41.810> stuff

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
with this stuff

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.000 
with this stuff
I<00:04:42.470> won't<00:04:43.040> make<00:04:43.250> those<00:04:43.460> mistakes<00:04:43.670> again<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:44.210> hope

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
I won't make those mistakes again I hope

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.470 
I won't make those mistakes again I hope
feel<00:04:46.010> free<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:46.250> call<00:04:46.490> me<00:04:46.550> very<00:04:46.940> dumb<00:04:47.240> and

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
feel free to call me very dumb and

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.040 
feel free to call me very dumb and
stupid<00:04:47.630> if<00:04:48.050> I<00:04:48.170> do<00:04:49.510> because<00:04:50.510> then<00:04:50.690> I<00:04:50.720> didn't

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
stupid if I do because then I didn't

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.910 
stupid if I do because then I didn't
learn<00:04:51.170> my<00:04:51.380> lesson<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.830> first<00:04:51.860> time<00:04:52.100> so<00:04:53.920> anyway

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
learn my lesson the first time so anyway

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.890 
learn my lesson the first time so anyway
I<00:04:56.140> had<00:04:57.140> fun<00:04:58.030> it<00:04:59.030> was<00:04:59.210> a<00:04:59.240> neat<00:04:59.480> learning

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
I had fun it was a neat learning

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.590 
I had fun it was a neat learning
experience<00:05:00.410> I<00:05:01.000> think<00:05:02.000> I<00:05:02.150> know<00:05:02.210> how<00:05:02.390> to<00:05:02.420> do

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
experience I think I know how to do

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.820 
experience I think I know how to do
double<00:05:02.750> most<00:05:03.050> sided<00:05:03.290> machining<00:05:03.710> now

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
double most sided machining now

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.220 
double most sided machining now
effectively<00:05:04.640> and<00:05:05.030> I'm<00:05:05.630> very<00:05:05.810> happy<00:05:06.140> about

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
effectively and I'm very happy about

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.920 
effectively and I'm very happy about
that<00:05:06.380> so<00:05:07.150> plus<00:05:08.150> I<00:05:08.270> got<00:05:08.420> a<00:05:08.450> bunch<00:05:08.660> of<00:05:08.750> push

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
that so plus I got a bunch of push

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.970
