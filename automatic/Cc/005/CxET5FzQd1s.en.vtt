00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
out in public it's not necessarily

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
that red wig and then she goes out and

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.620 
that red wig and then she goes out and
she's<00:03:53.640> all<00:03:53.850> oh<00:03:54.060> um<00:03:55.160> that<00:03:56.160> wasn't<00:03:56.370> me<00:03:56.700> well
