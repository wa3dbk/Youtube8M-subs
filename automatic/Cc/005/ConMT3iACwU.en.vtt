in<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.070> open<00:00:51.430> highway<00:00:51.820> that<00:00:52.030> seems<00:00:52.239> to<00:00:52.450> never

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
in the open highway that seems to never

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.969 

I<00:01:12.149> wonder<00:01:12.869> if<00:01:12.960> there<00:01:13.079> are<00:01:13.109> people<00:01:13.500> praying<00:01:13.770> in

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
I wonder if there are people praying in

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.039 
I wonder if there are people praying in
those<00:01:14.100> tiny<00:01:14.369> towns<00:01:14.750> intercessors<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.929> those

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
those tiny towns intercessors in those

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.929 
those tiny towns intercessors in those
coffee<00:01:16.320> shops<00:01:16.679> and<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.399> the<00:01:17.460> buildings<00:01:17.850> that

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
coffee shops and in the buildings that

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.270 
coffee shops and in the buildings that
scrape<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> sky<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:19.020> wonder<00:01:19.890> if<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> farmer

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
scrape the sky I wonder if the farmer

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.399 
scrape the sky I wonder if the farmer
murmurs<00:01:20.850> his<00:01:21.030> requests<00:01:21.569> and<00:01:21.719> if<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> camper

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
murmurs his requests and if the camper

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.260 
murmurs his requests and if the camper
down<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> road<00:01:22.920> talks<00:01:23.609> to<00:01:23.759> God<00:01:23.909> about<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
down the road talks to God about the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.260 
down the road talks to God about the
things<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.630> his<00:01:24.719> heart<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.609> I<00:01:26.609> wonder<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
things on his heart and I wonder if you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.620 
things on his heart and I wonder if you
would<00:01:27.420> pray<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.780> me<00:01:28.429> me<00:01:29.429> under<00:01:29.819> this<00:01:29.969> big<00:01:30.270> sky

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
with the blossoming hope and God's

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.699 
with the blossoming hope and God's
promise<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.630> my<00:01:33.780> people<00:01:34.020> who<00:01:34.229> are<00:01:34.319> called

country<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:44.179> think<00:01:45.179> if<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.390> could<00:01:45.539> just

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
country I think if we could just

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.870 
country I think if we could just
possibly<00:01:45.989> join<00:01:46.470> together<00:01:46.649> even<00:01:47.520> all<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.670> us

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
possibly join together even all of us

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.580 
possibly join together even all of us
from<00:01:48.030> different<00:01:48.390> states<00:01:48.599> opinions<00:01:49.349> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
from different states opinions and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.910 
from different states opinions and
experiences<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.610> God<00:01:51.270> might<00:01:52.170> smile<00:01:52.500> down<00:01:52.770> on

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
experiences and God might smile down on

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.580 
experiences and God might smile down on
