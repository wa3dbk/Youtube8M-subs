I've had and design for the last four
years<00:00:10.110> not<00:00:10.800> much<00:00:10.980> has<00:00:11.130> changed<00:00:11.190> over<00:00:11.580> that

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
years not much has changed over that

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.910 
years not much has changed over that
time<00:00:11.759> just<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:13.019> know<00:00:13.110> some<00:00:13.320> minor<00:00:13.469> stuff<00:00:13.740> here

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
time just you know some minor stuff here

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.939 
time just you know some minor stuff here
in<00:00:14.009> there<00:00:14.190> like<00:00:14.580> top<00:00:14.910> sheets<00:00:15.179> now<00:00:15.509> bamboo<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
in there like top sheets now bamboo the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.700 
in there like top sheets now bamboo the
salt<00:00:17.220> glass<00:00:17.550> instead<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.420> fiberglass<00:00:18.900> side

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
salt glass instead of fiberglass side

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.010 
salt glass instead of fiberglass side
cut<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.369> pretty<00:00:20.939> tight<00:00:21.180> compared<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.840> what<00:00:21.990> I

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
cut is pretty tight compared to what I

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.050 
cut is pretty tight compared to what I
think<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.529> lot<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> other<00:00:22.949> guys<00:00:23.130> are<00:00:23.460> using

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
think a lot of the other guys are using

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.910 
think a lot of the other guys are using
these<00:00:24.269> days<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.600> think<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> seven<00:00:25.619> six

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
these days I think it's like a seven six

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.130 
these days I think it's like a seven six
so<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.609> allows<00:00:26.849> me<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.210> get<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.359> little<00:00:27.930> bit

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
so that allows me to get a little bit

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.050 
so that allows me to get a little bit
more<00:00:28.289> tighter<00:00:28.590> turn<00:00:28.920> when<00:00:29.519> you're<00:00:29.640> cruising

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
more tighter turn when you're cruising

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.900 
more tighter turn when you're cruising
