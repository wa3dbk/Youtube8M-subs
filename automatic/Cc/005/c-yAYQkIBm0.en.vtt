 long time to work 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.140
 the vast majority of races are 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.160

 We specialize in dog training. 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.450
 work then we think it's better 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.210
 saying a greater probability of good 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.000
 individuals in this race but not all

 a litter for questions that only the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.230
 nature explains that each individual has 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.650
 a specific function here we have 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.439

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.640
 observe that while the other animals 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.000
 are interested in employing pulling 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.270
 cloth napkins that guy who just wants ly

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.439
 Extreme situations Dark shooting 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.079
 large agglomerations 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.590
 these animals are prepared to deal with 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.580
 with crime facing the front 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.370
 each one specializes in an area 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.590
 identification of missing persons 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:16.800

 drugs and explosives the material used in 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.080
 training is produced in laboratories 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.660
 from europe and the united states 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.879
 note that we have four boxes of 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.489
 exactly the same 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.580
 The difference is that in one of 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.360
 From here you have a sachet with a synthetic 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.840
 drugs 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:43.760
 his job is to identify this drug 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:47.220
 let's see how he does well you opa 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.099
 to the front means he found 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:56.489
 and after work everybody deserves to 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:59.910
 reward goes there boy until you get to 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.400

 play but more of the reward 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.579
 the shelf life of the animal is ten years 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:24.090
 the tupã is almost retiring is a 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:27.299

 docility but do not be surprised at a 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.250
 The only word that prevails is the 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.769
 aggressiveness 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.100
 the police dog on the job is like a 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.169
 weapon is ready to act at any 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.799
 moment and now we are going to simulate a 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.070
 attack 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.510
 for this we will need volunteers 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.510
 who gets one step ahead 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.350

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.660
 that's right, leave it to me 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.690
 if they do not have the courage left over 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.350
 In this simulation I'm going to be the target. 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:51.720
 for this I must prepare to observe the 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.720
 what life does in a few seconds 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:04.560
 My goodness us 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.560
