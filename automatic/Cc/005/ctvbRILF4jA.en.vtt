00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:06.950
 for those who are interested in 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.470
 produce pecans should know that it is a 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.209
 long-term cultivation this means that 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.669
 the return on investment is not 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:16.160
 immediately the pecán begins to produce 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:18.560
 from the fourth or fifth year and reaches 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.720
 its maximum peak after 15 years 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.270
 but you can even produce 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.340
 200 years old since this is a tree 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.900
 very long-lived then we go to 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.520
 next to know what are the 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.910
 agronomic requirements of this 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.910
 culture 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.000
 it was thought in a beginning that the cold was going 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.520
 to be the limiting the lack of cold 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.010
 above all we see that quite ductile 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:53.949
 se data perfectly to our area 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.989
 of the noa and in the limitation that is the water 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.519
 the more water available, the 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.070
 the pecán is best expressed 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.739
 before between production has very good 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.800
 filling the nut and the plant grows 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.920
 almost without and without barriers followed by his 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.430
 garden a follow-up of this 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.670
 health and nutrition is not a high 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.950
 West requires high high amounts of 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.320
 nitrogen and zinc like a micro 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.869
 element in culture or deciduous 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.810
 be it in winter is totally without 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.270
 leaves in the cold does nothing any 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.340
 Late frost could affect the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.740
 first buds that's why they are chosen 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.310
 varieties that have more rotations 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.950
 late for those icy zones and in 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.009
 case that unfortunately some 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.320
 frost may affect the pecán has 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.010
 234 buds per axilla 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.560
 so if it stops if it freezes, it dies 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.110
 the first outbreak has the possibility of 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.510
 regrow again so we're not going to 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.460
 lose neither the plant the production could 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.310
 go down a bit because of the topic that you have lost 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.820
 energy but not that we're not going to have 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.890
 fruit scenes in tucumán in the person 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.940
 that is cultivating good us in the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.770
 group we have two this two participants 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.840
 two members who are in the area of 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.750
 metal one in river stone I put you 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.200
 old we also know that by near the 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.590
 Cerro there is another plantation by the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.430
 moment but it jumps is a province that 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.950
 be almost entirely except some 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.580
 limiting the area east a bit 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.019
 saline and very desertic this everything 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.239
 It is also possible to produce tucumán freckles 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.239
 also except the eastern boundary zone 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.820
 also because of its salinity and lack of 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.010
 rains would be a limitation but the 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.770
 rest and also it is not a crop of 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.770
 height is not recommended perhaps for 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.110
 and the valley because it's humid but not 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.770
 for the amaya zone of the neighborhood the 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.130
 Santamaría Valley is not a crop 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.770
 advisable 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.770
 for this whole tropical area or 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.210
 subtropical walks very well 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.580
 they speak of varieties what are the 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.860
 varieties that are already good 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.480
 we have here from the nursery and 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.160
 in the area not approving 12 varieties 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.010
 they are walking very well being kim carr and 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.400
 super that the noble as pollinators 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.170
 pauni desirable also scarce is that 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.100
 has been responding very well, although in 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.590
 the south of the country do not recommend them here 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.000
 it came out quite early and with very good 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.060
 fruit quality then we have mahan 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.790
 millán that are fruits of big size 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.920
 that the problem that you have these 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.050
 varieties is that it is difficult to fill it 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.660
 you have to have a very good amount of water 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.170
 so that the noes comes out of nothing 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.050
 ok try to produce some nuts 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.470
 good big size if we are not able 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.239
 to be able to fill your seed and what is 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.890
 the variety of jorge that more demand in 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.810
 market for the type of fruit that 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.090
 produces we could say that the fauna and 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.940
 the fauna is inside the pollinated 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.700
 now it is a support in a variety 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.459
 crest 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.340
 giving a lot internationally but 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.200
 Pecan is always done with several 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.000
 varieties we did not know that the 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.889
 pollination is crossed by by its 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.870
 difference of time in maturation of the 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.479
 same variety of the male flower and the 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.220
 female then you have to look for another 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.530
 variety that complements the one 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.870
 we are producing that also to weigh 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.000
 of being pollinator is very good fruit 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.860
 not all pollinators dora's current 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.930
 they are very good fruits then you have to 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:48.260
 choose every day no less than 34 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.260
 varieties for each producing farm
