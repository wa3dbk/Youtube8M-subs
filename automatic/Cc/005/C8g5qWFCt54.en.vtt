00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.689
 the little we know so far and today 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.119
 I'm a mysterious human that existed 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.099
 in the empty century which is named in 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.630
 a put link read by me korovin that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.420
 there are in the island's marine forest 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.719

 neptune empty century put the island free 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.610
 he gave jim he puts grip on that is mentioned 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.440
 to me and I go the residents of the island of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.309
 today they started a promise to a great 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.780
 man that later turned out to be game and 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.090
 they promised that they would keep the noa 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.270
 safe until one day reach 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.579
 island here today and the promise almost breaks 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.859
 during the events of the saga 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.500
 from the island I jim when lucy is 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.660
 He asked to protect the island no matter what 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.300
 that will cost even if the noa had 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.550
 to be destroyed in the process 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.860
 thanks to the Chinese princess or yes that 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.080
 call sea ​​kings to endure 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.960
 the ship and stop light and the ship does not 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.090
 the first thing that was destroyed was completely destroyed 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.250
 mentions about this flu it is that it is 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.530
 an apology letter to the princess 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.290
 mermaid who lived in the empty century that 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.680
 it turned out to be the ancestral weapon poseidón 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.300
 for not being able to fulfill his promise 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.730
 after the battle with the new 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.790
 pirates saw jim neptune only robin 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.100
 they talk about the neptune says it's a 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.200
 human and tells him what he knows about him that 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.240
 a promise was kept between him and the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.130
 inhabitants of the island I have about 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.710
 should protect the noa until the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.290
 day getting good that's all that 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.630
 we know so far now I will start with 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.420
 theories good the first thing I will say is 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.970
 about his name and today I go that in 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.660
 English would mean happy boy or boy 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:04.050
 joy does not remind them of something like that is a 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.240
 I saw them as Roger and Lutfi then this 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.850
 It makes me think that I and I go alone was a 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.040
 nickname that his friend mermaid put him on seeing 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.960
 how happy he was and good heart that he 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.270
 he had and his real name carries 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.680
 in his name perhaps he omitted it for some 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.110
 reason that we do not know 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.850
 maybe it was very dangerous to name your 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.100
 true name for the countries in 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.170
 conflict or that belonged in the 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.540
 empty century to the civilization of the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.550
 good bits has already clarified that too 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.740
 I have a somewhat crazy theory but 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.960
 since it appeared this character 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.810
 I have in mind and now I will tell you is 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.150
 about the straw hat what would happen if 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.540
 really the first carrier of this 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.780
 fire hat and I'll tell you how 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.630
 it is impossible to maintain it by 800 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.760
 years but good in one piece everything is 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.430
 possible and could have been made from a 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.460
 special material or something like that I do not say that 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.770
 be the one piece as some say xvii 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.590
 but yes a kind of symbol of 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.660
 inherit the will of that good person 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.550
 I just wanted to mention this theory 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.370
 I've been with her for a long time 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.830
 good head x now theorize about 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.860
 the promise that he made today I go to the 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.860
 mermaid princess of that era my theory 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.840
 is the following yogis from this 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.560
 already lived underwater and were 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.870
 equally 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.270
 eliminated so I and I go and they 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.430
 promised to bring them to the surface to 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.000
 live with humans and for this I think 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.459
 water like that is the I think not to I do not know if it was 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.190
 carpenter or something like that but as we know 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.160
 they saw them a very advanced civilization 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.560
 and he could have done it is not a boat 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.630
 gigantic within the district I have 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.239
 known as the ship of promise 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.580
 there is the base of the new pirates 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.069
 gauguin and it's where the flying pirates 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.260
 they have made an alliance with them point no 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.930
 it was a gift from holly I go to the 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.299
 inhabitants of island yo jean and should be 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.819
 at the bottom of the ocean until the 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.910
 The appointed time should not be 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.590
 destroyed but could not fulfill its 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.959
 promise since they arrived I have them 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.030
 sudden at that time the 20 kings and 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.280
 they destroyed the civilization of the days 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.739
 and that's why I 'm not going to tell them to 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.290
 the wings that protected the ship not to 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.180
 until the day will come when another person 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.940
 with his same will to reach him by 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.220
 so they can live with humans 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.740
 normally and that person is light and so 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.520
 is he will bring them to the surface with 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.460
 everyone 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.680
 hands those hundred thousand chapters of good 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.440
 nothing else I hope you liked the 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.050
 video if all the law comments on your 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.840
 theories and if you want to keep receiving 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.740
 my theories subscribe a greeting and until 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.740
 the next video
