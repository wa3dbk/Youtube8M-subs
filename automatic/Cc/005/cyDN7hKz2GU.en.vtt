00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.870
 we are going to have the best chance of course that is a bag of scarves 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.869
 at baby piece 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:11.780
 we have 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.790
 beautiful pieces from that 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.339
 at the door 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.910
 what do you need for a very good de ns the sauce that is of course owner 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.419
 that's why we start with that 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:23.529
 boulder full 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.529
 the honda and some white wine 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.230
 and of course a little bit of water yes because it is also important 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.399
 in the end, the sandwich in the end room allows the user to go anywhere 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.860
 for resolve we are people who say that is not made so healthy 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.730
 it is very nice and tasty 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.910
 about 200 250 creams were already good butter 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.340
 and it must be closed very slowly that they say they give 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.360
 in a small bowl 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.360
 if in the microwave london very briefly 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.920
 leave them all too well 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.160
 also a 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.290
 well those are the 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.670
 at a dead sparrow 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 what I do with it 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.980
 large tablespoons with the ground on you can be the good ones for 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.710
 but it can also be a bit of white wine from hatch 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.710
 also 2 replay prof 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.920
 a little bit of water after that can the throbbing gym but I will first 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.720
 just guess the herbs that go through at the end 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.410
 he picked up a few 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.410
 beautiful leaves on the ground 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.830
 the karen people 8 8 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.090
 now make up for the rest 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.090
 also for four people or more 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.840
 mpe 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.950
 visitors only gets worse 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.090
 use it is natural 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.650
 the trickiest part of all is the couple from the site of the egg yolk with with 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.820
 welfare 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.460
 and the line in the water 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.460
 I put it on the fire on the feeling that left of the cup then to 2 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.040
 that is a bit the hague where is that figure is standard no less than 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.359
 not too far because otherwise it's really about finding the net 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.459
 the surrounding neighborhoods 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.930
 the site can stain at the right time to stop it is starting to be something 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.439
 binding through that disease becomes the fact that the killer is always the same 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.529
 take the heat back from the fire and see how it goes 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:35.139
 have even more back on the fire but you can see a bit of air 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:37.979
 begins 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:42.079
 this is just a little play with the pan that is here sized 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.339
 That left the lawyer head it is important that you get hands off it 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:51.599
 the moment a what a thick bottom she has that the case shape is well divided 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.499
 is the teeth that the talking to get over one always 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.829
 much better result to get it now it starts something 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.189
 to become fatter this may cause these animals to have 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.619
 Hey 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:05.479
 maybe it's a bit 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.339
 he threw up 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:10.039
 well then goes very slowly 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.969
 the melted butter thus removes the bee from the firing 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.379
 both are also people who do it 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.379
 the clarified butter I always do it with 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:27.359
 as matter comes from suit you additionally it is important to be very good it 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.699
 poisoned rapid test 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.699
 also was a bit of a special left or right 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:49.549
 that is the opta important we will be right and all again 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.129
 from firing 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.930
 and then the pan with the cup two proves that the level of heat 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:00.999
 stays in a pan stays in the metal 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:06.819
 you do not all know very quickly cools but you see when it starts 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.059
 to become the group 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:11.189
 you have to feel good 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.929
 exactly how much you need to do 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:16.609
 So 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.150
 this is just about the 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.009
 the structure it must have damn yes then it is in fact normal only 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:23.980
 but finish it 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.980
 had written with the herbs 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.979
 both teams of course 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.699
 because I think it's fine you know 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.289
 two points through 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.289
 when a pinch of salt well there is one 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.120
 well and then can keep one warm 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.080
 obama called 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.150
 that the army is not busy to use it immediately and on it 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.520
 meat was to do but you can also hear it for a very short time on wembley 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.779
 Saving does mean that you can occasionally beat 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:12.409
 not too long of course it should just keep nice and warm should I think 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:16.599
 I have the courage not unbelievably looking right under steel is going to act again 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.050
 Why be doing it is you can also put a real problem in it 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.599
 casting 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:28.240
 and then you will just be a bartender for about an hour 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.509
 must come back 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.789
 we use and 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.759
 that goes well too 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:35.969
 the
