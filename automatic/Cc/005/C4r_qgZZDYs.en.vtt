00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.530 
make the shotguns kind of the same is
mw2<00:01:54.380> I<00:01:55.380> think<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.860> game<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.790> best<00:01:57.329> with

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
mw2 I think that game was the best with

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.469 
mw2 I think that game was the best with
shotguns<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.340> shotguns<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.490> mw2<00:02:00.090> or

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
shotguns but shotguns in mw2 or

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.569 
shotguns but shotguns in mw2 or
secondary<00:02:00.960> weapons<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.740> they<00:02:02.219> are<00:02:02.340> still

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
secondary weapons and they are still

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.060 
secondary weapons and they are still
probably<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.570> strongest<00:02:03.840> shotguns<00:02:04.590> any<00:02:04.829> call

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
probably the strongest shotguns any call

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.490 
probably the strongest shotguns any call
duty<00:02:05.250> game<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:06.509> I'm<00:02:06.869> sure<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> lot<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.439> people

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
duty game so I'm sure a lot of people

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.719 
duty game so I'm sure a lot of people
think<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:08.009> way<00:02:08.069> if<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.119> take

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
think this way if you just take

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.880 
think this way if you just take
w<00:02:10.000> two<00:02:10.149> shotguns<00:02:10.629> and<00:02:10.840> make<00:02:11.319> them<00:02:11.500> primary

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
w two shotguns and make them primary

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.890 
w two shotguns and make them primary
weapons<00:02:12.310> they<00:02:13.000> would<00:02:13.209> be<00:02:13.330> amazing<00:02:13.750> because

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
weapons they would be amazing because

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.830 
weapons they would be amazing because
they're<00:02:14.349> already<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.159> strong<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:16.599> they<00:02:16.750> have

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
they're already so strong and they have

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.170 
they're already so strong and they have
a<00:02:16.870> good<00:02:16.959> amount<00:02:17.140> range<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.670> all<00:02:18.819> I<00:02:18.940> kind

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
a good amount range and that all I kind

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.210 
a good amount range and that all I kind
of<00:02:19.239> stuff<00:02:19.420> but<00:02:19.989> just<00:02:20.140> make<00:02:20.260> some<00:02:20.379> primaries<00:02:20.950> so

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
of stuff but just make some primaries so

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.369 
of stuff but just make some primaries so
they<00:02:21.340> wouldn't<00:02:21.519> be<00:02:21.700> like<00:02:21.940> an<00:02:22.209> Opie<00:02:22.780> secondary

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
they wouldn't be like an Opie secondary

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.080 
they wouldn't be like an Opie secondary
weapon<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:23.950> mean<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.760> know<00:02:24.819> make<00:02:24.970> them

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
weapon I mean you know make them

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.400 
weapon I mean you know make them
primaries<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:25.750> think<00:02:25.959> I'll<00:02:26.019> be<00:02:26.110> freaking

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
primaries and I think I'll be freaking

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.699 
primaries and I think I'll be freaking
amazing<00:02:26.620> like<00:02:27.190> this<00:02:27.340> past<00:02:27.610> 12<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.299> mw2<00:02:29.230> is

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
amazing like this past 12 in mw2 is

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.250 
amazing like this past 12 in mw2 is
freaking<00:02:30.160> amazing<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.790> people<00:02:31.629> use<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:32.049> as

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
freaking amazing and people use that as

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.369 
freaking amazing and people use that as
a<00:02:32.290> primary<00:02:32.709> weapon<00:02:33.340> but<00:02:34.330> yes<00:02:34.599> as<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.870> secondary

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
a primary weapon but yes as a secondary

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.619 
a primary weapon but yes as a secondary
weapon<00:02:35.769> that's<00:02:36.129> fast<00:02:36.489> 12<00:02:36.849> in<00:02:37.000> your<00:02:37.090> pocket<00:02:37.480> is

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
weapon that's fast 12 in your pocket is

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.530 
weapon that's fast 12 in your pocket is
a<00:02:37.660> bit<00:02:37.989> o<00:02:38.110> P<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:39.190> if<00:02:39.489> they<00:02:39.670> do<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:40.090> it'll<00:02:40.390> be

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
a bit o P so if they do that it'll be

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.660 
a bit o P so if they do that it'll be
really<00:02:40.750> interesting<00:02:41.049> to<00:02:41.680> see<00:02:42.069> what<00:02:42.459> they<00:02:42.519> do

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
really interesting to see what they do

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.150 
really interesting to see what they do
with<00:02:42.879> weapon<00:02:43.480> proficiencies<00:02:44.160> especially

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
with weapon proficiencies especially

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.589 
with weapon proficiencies especially
like<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.489> ones<00:02:45.670> for<00:02:45.849> the<00:02:45.940> shotguns<00:02:46.420> like

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
like the ones for the shotguns like

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.839 
like the ones for the shotguns like
range<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.230> damage<00:02:47.349> I<00:02:47.769> don't<00:02:48.549> think<00:02:48.609> they'll

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
range and damage I don't think they'll

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.729 
range and damage I don't think they'll
be<00:02:48.970> Opie<00:02:49.329> even<00:02:49.780> putting<00:02:50.019> like<00:02:50.200> damage<00:02:50.590> and

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
be Opie even putting like damage and

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.150 
be Opie even putting like damage and
range<00:02:50.859> on<00:02:51.160> mw2<00:02:51.879> spas-12<00:02:52.510> because<00:02:53.500> it's<00:02:54.040> a

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
range on mw2 spas-12 because it's a

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.250 
range on mw2 spas-12 because it's a
primary<00:02:54.579> weapon<00:02:54.940> so<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.269> think<00:02:55.569> you<00:02:55.840> need<00:02:55.989> stuff

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
primary weapon so I think you need stuff

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.740 
primary weapon so I think you need stuff
like<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.859> another<00:02:57.670> thing<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.299> you

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
like that and another thing is that you

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.630 
like that and another thing is that you
want<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.079> shotguns<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.709> be<00:02:59.980> usable<00:03:00.609> by

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
want the shotguns to be usable by

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.509 
want the shotguns to be usable by
themselves<00:03:01.540> like<00:03:01.930> an<00:03:02.049> mw3<00:03:02.500> when<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.310> first

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
themselves like an mw3 when you first

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.520 
themselves like an mw3 when you first
start<00:03:03.760> using<00:03:04.000> like<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.450> spas-12<00:03:04.750> it's<00:03:05.440> a

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
start using like the spas-12 it's a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.430 
start using like the spas-12 it's a
level<00:03:05.650> one<00:03:05.980> it's<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.819> pain<00:03:07.329> to<00:03:07.629> use<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:08.079> to<00:03:08.260> get

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
level one it's a pain to use it to get

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.770 
level one it's a pain to use it to get
up<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:09.099> the<00:03:09.190> damage<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.640> range<00:03:09.970> proficiencies

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
up to the damage and range proficiencies

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.539 
up to the damage and range proficiencies
because<00:03:11.319> once<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:11.739> put<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.069> damage<00:03:12.400> and

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
because once you put the damage and

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.909 
because once you put the damage and
range<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.209> past<00:03:13.450> 12<00:03:13.840> then<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.769> is

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
range on this past 12 then it is

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.670 
range on this past 12 then it is
somewhat<00:03:15.430> usable<00:03:15.970> almost<00:03:16.389> like<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.569> plane<00:03:16.930> spaz

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
somewhat usable almost like a plane spaz

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.809 
somewhat usable almost like a plane spaz
fall<00:03:18.099> from<00:03:18.250> mw2<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.169> don't<00:03:20.919> want<00:03:21.069> them<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.669> do

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
fall from mw2 so I don't want them to do

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.819 
fall from mw2 so I don't want them to do
that<00:03:21.970> in<00:03:22.150> black<00:03:22.329> ops<00:03:22.540> 2<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.959> want<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.380> shotguns

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
that in black ops 2 I want the shotguns

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.890 
that in black ops 2 I want the shotguns
be<00:03:24.010> good<00:03:24.280> by<00:03:24.489> themselves<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.239> then<00:03:25.419> extra

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
be good by themselves and then extra

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.440 
be good by themselves and then extra
good<00:03:26.139> if<00:03:26.349> you<00:03:26.769> use<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:27.160> guns<00:03:27.340> while<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.239> get

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
good if you use the guns while and get

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.420 
good if you use the guns while and get
range<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.139> damage<00:03:29.260> on<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.829> that's<00:03:30.220> how<00:03:30.400> I

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
range and damage on it that's how I

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.250 
range and damage on it that's how I
think<00:03:30.760> it<00:03:30.849> should<00:03:30.970> be<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.450> so<00:03:31.900> let<00:03:32.019> me<00:03:32.109> know<00:03:32.200> in

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
think it should be and so let me know in
