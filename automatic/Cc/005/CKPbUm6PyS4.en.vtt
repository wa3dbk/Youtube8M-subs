Andrew authority and we are hanging out

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.450 
Andrew authority and we are hanging out
at<00:00:06.600> Kyocera<00:00:07.350> here<00:00:07.710> at<00:00:07.859> Mobile<00:00:08.069> World<00:00:08.220> Congress

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
at Kyocera here at Mobile World Congress

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.660 
at Kyocera here at Mobile World Congress
2015<00:00:08.970> taking<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.750> look<00:00:10.080> at<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.559> Kyocera<00:00:11.099> torque

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
2015 taking a look at the Kyocera torque

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.320 
2015 taking a look at the Kyocera torque
and<00:00:12.389> this<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:13.080> ruggedized<00:00:14.000> smartphone<00:00:15.000> so

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
and this is a ruggedized smartphone so

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.670 
and this is a ruggedized smartphone so
starting<00:00:15.809> off<00:00:15.960> with<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.260> design<00:00:16.529> you're

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
starting off with the design you're

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.130 
starting off with the design you're
gonna<00:00:16.770> notice<00:00:16.980> it's<00:00:17.279> fairly<00:00:17.910> thick<00:00:18.300> but

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
gonna notice it's fairly thick but

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.179 
gonna notice it's fairly thick but
that's<00:00:19.260> because<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> ruggedized

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
that's because of the ruggedized

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.980 
that's because of the ruggedized
capabilities<00:00:20.939> which<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.270> will<00:00:21.420> talk<00:00:21.630> about<00:00:21.689> in

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
capabilities which we will talk about in

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.870 
capabilities which we will talk about in
a<00:00:22.020> second<00:00:22.410> here<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:23.400> actually<00:00:23.670> really

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
a second here but it's actually really

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.870 
a second here but it's actually really
easy<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.930> hold<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.439> use<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.070> one<00:00:26.369> hand<00:00:26.670> despite

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
easy to hold and use in one hand despite

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.429 
easy to hold and use in one hand despite
of<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.210> thickness<00:00:27.570> because<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:27.960> relatively

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
of the thickness because it's relatively

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.519 
of the thickness because it's relatively
compact<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.189> size<00:00:29.660> but<00:00:30.660> just<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> specs

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
compact in size but just get the specs

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.500 
compact in size but just get the specs

customizations that you will find from
Kyocera<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.729> actually<00:01:30.060> not<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> very

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
Kyocera but it's actually not a very

Kyocera but it's actually not a very
heavy<00:01:31.079> skin<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.130> does<00:01:32.280> keep<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.820> lot<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
heavy skin and it does keep a lot of the

elements of stock Android which is
really<00:01:36.479> nice<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:37.680> should<00:01:37.890> get<00:01:38.009> some

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
really nice so you should get some

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.440 
really nice so you should get some
really<00:01:38.460> great<00:01:38.670> performance<00:01:38.820> with<00:01:39.299> this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
really great performance with this

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.730 
really great performance with this
device<00:01:39.750> because<00:01:40.079> they've<00:01:40.229> kept<00:01:40.530> things

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
device because they've kept things

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.819 
device because they've kept things
relatively<00:01:41.280> lightweight<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.119> slim<00:01:42.840> now

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
relatively lightweight and slim now

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.050 
relatively lightweight and slim now
let's<00:01:43.979> talk<00:01:44.100> about<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.460> things<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.850> make

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
let's talk about the things that make

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.539 
let's talk about the things that make
this<00:01:45.299> phone<00:01:45.630> unique<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.829> first<00:01:47.100> thing<00:01:47.340> is

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
this phone unique and the first thing is

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.080 
this phone unique and the first thing is
with<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.329> display<00:01:48.840> itself<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.729> screen

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
display the Kyocera torque currently

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.490 
display the Kyocera torque currently
does<00:03:11.610> not<00:03:11.760> carry<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.180> technology<00:03:12.750> but

hopefully we will see this particular
technology<00:03:16.290> being<00:03:17.100> brought<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.670> their

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
technology being brought to their

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.230 
technology being brought to their
devices<00:03:18.410> fairly<00:03:19.410> soon<00:03:19.740> and<00:03:20.610> then<00:03:20.820> one<00:03:21.030> last

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
devices fairly soon and then one last

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.970 
devices fairly soon and then one last
thing<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.450> just<00:03:21.480> want<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.810> mention<00:03:22.200> with<00:03:22.530> the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
thing I just want to mention with the

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.270 
thing I just want to mention with the
Kyocera<00:03:23.910> torque<00:03:24.330> here<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.710> the<00:03:25.950> front

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
Kyocera torque here is that the front

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.100 
Kyocera torque here is that the front
you're<00:03:26.520> gonna<00:03:26.760> notice<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.240> there's<00:03:27.450> not<00:03:27.780> a

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
you're gonna notice that there's not a

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.800 
you're gonna notice that there's not a
speaker<00:03:28.920> at<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.250> top<00:03:29.460> and<00:03:29.730> that's<00:03:30.150> because<00:03:30.630> it

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
speaker at the top and that's because it

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.830 
speaker at the top and that's because it
actually<00:03:31.080> uses<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:32.010> display<00:03:32.460> to<00:03:33.420> deliver

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
actually uses the display to deliver

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.950 
actually uses the display to deliver
sound<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.470> your<00:03:34.620> ear<00:03:34.980> what<00:03:35.760> which<00:03:36.210> Kyocera<00:03:36.840> is

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
sound to your ear what which Kyocera is

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.110 
sound to your ear what which Kyocera is
calling<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.410> smart<00:03:37.860> sonic<00:03:38.400> receiver<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:39.030> the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
calling a smart sonic receiver so the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.480 
calling a smart sonic receiver so the
display<00:03:39.480> actually<00:03:39.720> vibrates<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:41.010> deliver

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
display actually vibrates to deliver

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.140 
display actually vibrates to deliver
sound<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.780> calls<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.530> audio<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.520> your<00:03:44.730> ears

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
sound and calls and audio to your ears

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.500 
sound and calls and audio to your ears
similar<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.140> what<00:03:46.800> we<00:03:46.890> saw<00:03:47.100> with<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.510> sharp

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
similar to what we saw with the sharp
