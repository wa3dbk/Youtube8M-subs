yes known as district and also when it
forms<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.440> battling<00:03:59.920> Megazord<00:04:00.549> the<00:04:01.180> head<00:04:01.570> is

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
forms the battling Megazord the head is

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.100 
forms the battling Megazord the head is
missing

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
missing

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.210 
missing
yeah<00:04:02.530> on<00:04:03.340> dude<00:04:03.850> origami<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.540> holds<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.900> head

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
yeah on dude origami it holds the head

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.680 
yeah on dude origami it holds the head
and<00:04:06.220> just<00:04:06.370> idea<00:04:06.730> i<00:04:06.970> just<00:04:07.000> shows<00:04:07.330> over<00:04:07.510> here

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
and just idea i just shows over here

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.880 
and just idea i just shows over here
which<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:08.110> guess<00:04:08.260> they<00:04:08.470> moved<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:08.799> the

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
which I guess they moved to the

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.350 
which I guess they moved to the
formation

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
formation

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.430 
formation
they<00:04:10.200> do<00:04:10.490> they<00:04:11.490> do<00:04:11.550> keep<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.270> changes<00:04:13.260> where

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
they do they do keep the changes where

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.740 
they do they do keep the changes where
you<00:04:13.590> have<00:04:13.740> to<00:04:13.830> pull<00:04:14.040> these<00:04:14.220> off<00:04:14.480> well<00:04:15.480> I've<00:04:15.570> got

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
you have to pull these off well I've got

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.920 
you have to pull these off well I've got
that<00:04:15.960> on<00:04:16.280> to<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.370> battling<00:04:17.790> formation<00:04:18.360> and<00:04:18.600> is

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
that on to the battling formation and is

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:19.880 
that on to the battling formation and is
actually<00:04:19.140> formed<00:04:19.350> differently<00:04:19.650> in<00:04:19.830> the

Japanese version the legs as opposed to

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:41.400 
Japanese version the legs as opposed to
form<00:04:22.590> on<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.710> size<00:04:22.980> of<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.490> Megazord

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.030 

all<00:04:41.890> right<00:04:42.100> so<00:04:42.220> now<00:04:42.340> we<00:04:42.400> have<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.900> Beto

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
all right so now we have the Beto

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.240 
all right so now we have the Beto
combination<00:04:45.040> before<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:45.400> feel<00:04:45.640> like<00:04:46.090> I<00:04:46.210> feel

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
combination before I feel like I feel

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.760 
combination before I feel like I feel
what's<00:04:48.250> that<00:04:48.400> I'll<00:04:48.550> call<00:04:48.730> it<00:04:49.290> as<00:04:50.290> you<00:04:50.410> guys<00:04:50.620> see

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
what's that I'll call it as you guys see

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.050 
what's that I'll call it as you guys see
it<00:04:50.920> is<00:04:51.040> different<00:04:51.340> from<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.610> Japanese

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
it is different from the Japanese

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.330 
it is different from the Japanese
version<00:04:52.360> it's<00:04:52.750> really<00:04:53.200> much<00:04:53.380> kind<00:04:54.100> of<00:04:54.130> weird

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
version it's really much kind of weird

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.180 
version it's really much kind of weird
the<00:04:54.940> really<00:04:55.180> awkward<00:04:55.420> part<00:04:56.020> is<00:04:56.140> that<00:04:56.290> this<00:04:57.070> is

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
the really awkward part is that this is

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.950 
the really awkward part is that this is
the<00:04:57.280> first<00:04:57.490> time<00:04:57.700> we<00:04:58.420> actually<00:04:58.450> use<00:04:58.840> the

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
the first time we actually use the

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.130 
the first time we actually use the
helmet<00:04:59.260> just<00:04:59.650> like<00:04:59.830> in<00:05:00.430> shake<00:05:00.970> injure<00:05:01.300> yes<00:05:02.020> I

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
helmet just like in shake injure yes I

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.140 
helmet just like in shake injure yes I
see<00:05:02.290> the<00:05:02.410> helmets<00:05:02.710> already<00:05:02.920> inside<00:05:03.400> they<00:05:04.030> may

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
see the helmets already inside they may

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.490 
see the helmets already inside they may
go<00:05:04.300> zip<00:05:04.450> ended<00:05:04.660> up<00:05:04.780> in<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.020> soil<00:05:05.200> and<00:05:05.320> it<00:05:05.410> would

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
go zip ended up in the soil and it would

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.430 
go zip ended up in the soil and it would
go<00:05:05.590> right<00:05:05.770> on<00:05:05.950> but<00:05:06.340> for<00:05:06.670> us<00:05:06.790> it's<00:05:07.240> they<00:05:08.230> use

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
go right on but for us it's they use

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.260 
go right on but for us it's they use
that<00:05:08.590> same<00:05:08.830> helmet<00:05:09.160> but<00:05:09.430> we<00:05:09.550> just<00:05:09.670> put<00:05:09.910> this<00:05:10.060> on

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
that same helmet but we just put this on

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.090 
that same helmet but we just put this on
the<00:05:10.450> top<00:05:10.690> which<00:05:10.960> is<00:05:10.990> really<00:05:11.110> strange

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
the top which is really strange

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.750 
the top which is really strange

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
Chico's own that hasn't happened since

the help also another chain is that the

the help also another chain is that the
back<00:05:19.810> part<00:05:20.200> of<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.470> indeed<00:05:20.710> absorb<00:05:21.130> is

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
back part of the indeed absorb is

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.250 
back part of the indeed absorb is
actually<00:05:21.580> converted<00:05:21.850> into<00:05:22.120> a<00:05:22.270> shield<00:05:22.750> system

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
actually converted into a shield system

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.590 
actually converted into a shield system
for<00:05:23.470> the<00:05:23.560> u.s.<00:05:23.860> one<00:05:24.070> wall<00:05:24.340> on<00:05:24.850> Japanese<00:05:25.420> one

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
for the u.s. one wall on Japanese one

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.090 
for the u.s. one wall on Japanese one
the<00:05:25.720> whole<00:05:25.870> thing<00:05:26.110> is<00:05:26.260> really<00:05:26.380> connected<00:05:26.890> into

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
the whole thing is really connected into

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.800 
the whole thing is really connected into
the<00:05:27.130> back<00:05:27.370> which<00:05:27.610> is<00:05:27.760> simply<00:05:28.090> you've<00:05:28.600> lowered

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
the back which is simply you've lowered

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.720 
the back which is simply you've lowered
this<00:05:29.080> piece<00:05:29.350> over<00:05:29.530> here<00:05:29.680> and<00:05:30.130> it<00:05:30.430> connects

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
this piece over here and it connects

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.340 
this piece over here and it connects
onto<00:05:31.030> the<00:05:31.120> three<00:05:31.300> prong<00:05:31.600> and<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:31.960> block<00:05:32.170> and

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
onto the three prong and the block and

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.800 
onto the three prong and the block and
in<00:05:32.440> 2012<00:05:32.860> it<00:05:33.160> to<00:05:33.640> the<00:05:33.730> feed<00:05:34.000> sides<00:05:34.300> connected

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
in 2012 it to the feed sides connected

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.490 
in 2012 it to the feed sides connected
me<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:34.930> their<00:05:35.350> own<00:05:35.500> arms<00:05:36.870> this<00:05:37.870> change<00:05:38.290> is

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
me to their own arms this change is

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.120 
me to their own arms this change is
really<00:05:38.830> really<00:05:39.280> good<00:05:39.670> I<00:05:39.910> it's<00:05:40.660> not<00:05:40.840> bad<00:05:41.290> I<00:05:41.830> mean

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
really really good I it's not bad I mean

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.860 
really really good I it's not bad I mean
it's<00:05:42.550> not<00:05:42.790> like<00:05:42.850> of<00:05:43.180> course<00:05:43.420> it<00:05:43.510> won't<00:05:43.570> be<00:05:43.720> like

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
it's not like of course it won't be like

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.360 
it's not like of course it won't be like
the<00:05:43.960> show<00:05:44.170> because<00:05:44.710> you<00:05:44.920> guys<00:05:45.040> said<00:05:45.280> well

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
the show because you guys said well

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.340 
the show because you guys said well
match<00:05:45.610> nothing<00:05:46.120> that<00:05:46.270> won't<00:05:46.480> match<00:05:46.750> but<00:05:47.170> it's

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
match nothing that won't match but it's

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.770 
match nothing that won't match but it's
I<00:05:47.710> guess<00:05:47.920> the<00:05:48.130> helmet<00:05:48.670> is<00:05:48.790> similar<00:05:49.210> to<00:05:49.450> it<00:05:49.600> in

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
I guess the helmet is similar to it in

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.130 
I guess the helmet is similar to it in
some<00:05:50.080> ways<00:05:50.260> but<00:05:51.220> on<00:05:51.430> you<00:05:51.880> know<00:05:52.000> it's<00:05:52.270> it's<00:05:52.990> a

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
some ways but on you know it's it's a

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.140 
some ways but on you know it's it's a
decent<00:05:53.530> thing<00:05:53.680> you<00:05:54.100> can<00:05:54.220> also<00:05:54.340> do<00:05:54.580> different

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
decent thing you can also do different

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.000 
decent thing you can also do different
gear<00:05:55.570> combinations<00:05:56.260> that<00:05:56.350> are<00:05:56.560> not<00:05:56.740> in<00:05:56.920> the

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
gear combinations that are not in the

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.370 
gear combinations that are not in the
show<00:05:57.250> for<00:05:57.460> example<00:05:57.870> nominate<00:05:58.870> the<00:05:59.050> pin<00:05:59.260> over

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
show for example nominate the pin over

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.380 
show for example nominate the pin over
here<00:05:59.680> can<00:05:59.890> be<00:05:59.950> connected<00:06:00.250> to<00:06:00.520> the<00:06:00.670> arms<00:06:01.120> and

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
here can be connected to the arms and

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.630 
here can be connected to the arms and
you<00:06:01.540> can<00:06:01.750> do<00:06:01.840> weird<00:06:02.170> things<00:06:02.290> with<00:06:02.890> them<00:06:03.100> it's

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
you can do weird things with them it's

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.610 
you can do weird things with them it's
good<00:06:03.940> we<00:06:04.270> will<00:06:04.450> get<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:04.720> battle<00:06:05.050> week<00:06:05.230> makers

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
good we will get the battle week makers

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.140 
good we will get the battle week makers
what<00:06:05.800> in<00:06:05.890> the<00:06:05.950> future<00:06:06.250> but<00:06:06.700> we<00:06:06.880> are<00:06:06.970> just

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
what in the future but we are just

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.250 
what in the future but we are just
waiting<00:06:07.300> for<00:06:07.420> the<00:06:07.540> soldiers<00:06:07.900> to<00:06:07.930> come<00:06:08.020> out

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 
waiting for the soldiers to come out

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.080 
waiting for the soldiers to come out
because<00:06:08.470> then<00:06:08.710> that<00:06:08.920> is<00:06:09.070> what<00:06:09.250> we<00:06:09.400> see<00:06:09.850> finally

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
because then that is what we see finally

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:21.290 
because then that is what we see finally
the<00:06:10.270> whole<00:06:10.420> formation<00:06:10.780> of<00:06:11.050> anything

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.780 

overall<00:06:22.300> it's<00:06:22.690> a<00:06:22.960> okay<00:06:23.350> toy<00:06:23.740> I<00:06:24.160> would<00:06:24.490> say<00:06:24.670> is

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
overall it's a okay toy I would say is

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.820 
overall it's a okay toy I would say is
the<00:06:24.910> best<00:06:25.090> but<00:06:25.630> it's<00:06:25.960> something<00:06:26.140> at<00:06:26.620> least<00:06:26.740> we

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
the best but it's something at least we

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.500 
the best but it's something at least we
got<00:06:26.950> that<00:06:27.160> really<00:06:27.340> so<00:06:27.580> it's<00:06:27.760> that's<00:06:27.880> the<00:06:28.120> main

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
got that really so it's that's the main

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.790 
got that really so it's that's the main
part<00:06:28.750> of<00:06:28.960> the<00:06:29.050> whole<00:06:29.200> they<00:06:29.320> were<00:06:29.440> getting<00:06:29.680> all

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
part of the whole they were getting all

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.130 
part of the whole they were getting all
four<00:06:30.100> instead<00:06:30.580> of<00:06:30.700> where<00:06:31.180> we<00:06:31.300> lost<00:06:31.630> an<00:06:31.900> arm

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
four instead of where we lost an arm

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.710 
four instead of where we lost an arm
back<00:06:32.410> and<00:06:32.590> we<00:06:33.430> lose<00:06:33.640> the<00:06:33.820> labor<00:06:34.060> supply<00:06:34.270> but

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
back and we lose the labor supply but

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.720 
back and we lose the labor supply but
it's<00:06:34.900> actually<00:06:35.170> pretty<00:06:35.350> cool<00:06:35.620> but<00:06:36.160> you<00:06:36.610> know

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730 
it's actually pretty cool but you know

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.870 
it's actually pretty cool but you know
it's<00:06:37.270> okay<00:06:37.660> I<00:06:38.260> guess<00:06:38.530> it<00:06:39.040> wouldn't<00:06:39.370> it's<00:06:39.730> not

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
it's okay I guess it wouldn't it's not

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.540 
it's okay I guess it wouldn't it's not
