00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:27.699
 [Music] 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.369
 there are many many but many of you 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.829
 they have been asking me to make a video 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:37.399
 how to make a maruchan soup and today 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.969
 today I'm going to do a march in front of 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.350
 you who want me to do this and 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.899
 well the first thing that we are going to occupy is going to 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.299
 be a shopping and meritxell city 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.370
 we are also going to occupy water very well 

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:51.710
 serving because this thing is fine that 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.409
 encourage the dad who has been in command for a while and 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.689
 basically basically already and a fork 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.100
 but the fork I do not have there what 

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:00.309
 first thing you're going to do is uncover that 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.309
 thing 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.360
 so if you go to the males nowadays 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.360
 it removes the stress 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:20.580
 they only go instant instantly to niní 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:22.900
 instant year and then we will not live like this 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.560
 then 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.200
 to this mother 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.119
 let's grab very carefully for 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.119
 not burn because I'm well cool 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.530
 and then let's grab 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.530
 this 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:48.450
 and then do this and is he is 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:52.180
 fighting the win win win and the wind and 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.850
 we put this for there too 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.780
 and I have to leave the expected 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.610
 some 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.090
 a good time 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.909
 how not to find the fork 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.500
 covered it with a spoon so we have to 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.739
 wait for a while ice while 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.480
 can be eaten cookies 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.879
 for example, I am addicted to 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.180
 brutally addicted chocolate super 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:19.280
 addicted and now it's a lot that but that's 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.870
 a cookie I also hate leaves me 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.870
 literally is the change of origin 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.660
 it's been two minutes and he gave me 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:35.300
 time to go for the fork and then 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:41.670
 well, five minutes have passed and 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:44.450
 the supina merchán chile has remained 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.450
 and that rancor 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:53.250
 and then here is the plastic product 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.540

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.880
