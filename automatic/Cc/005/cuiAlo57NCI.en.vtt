00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.899
 Even if you have the opportunity, potatoes in the bed 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:08.750
 you may have thought about growing them in pails or in a sack 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.850
 grow. At least I did, and I can tell you exactly why. 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.019
 From the harvest quantity, of course, raised beds are ideal, 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:17.920
 and I will continue to use it. 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.910
 But no matter how carefully I harvest the potatoes, apparently always stay 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.790
 such a few tiny things in the ground. Of course I try everything 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.490
 but some are so small that I seem to overlook them. 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.260
 It takes revenge for years. I do not know what they are doing in the meantime, 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.840
 but even three years later, potatoes still come from the raised bed, where 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.330
 should not be one. 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.020
 And woe, you do not have enough time for two or three weeks to take care of everything. 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.080
 The potatoes seem to grow faster than anything else. 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.000
 Since then I have already thought about alternatives. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.240
 I've already said a bit in my potato video for growing in pails. 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.800
 So now it's about potatoes in the bag. 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.269
 Which bag do I take? 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.109
 As absolutely stable with me have empty bags of potting soil, 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.770
 Bark mulch and so forth exposed; You can even do that several times 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.520
 use. 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.060
 They just will not break. Before planting I wash them in the short time 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.509
 Rainwater bucket off and then let it dry in the sun to fungal infestation 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:19.460
 submissions. Then holes come in, and really many. At my first sacked potatoes 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.049
 At the time, I only made a few drainage holes at the bottom. The 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.600
 was not enough at all. The soil in the bags became really mushy. Since 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.170
 I perforate the sacks thoroughly. Here come later in any case 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.579
 more holes. Before I fill the sacks, I label them, and that 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.500
 both with the variety and with the date. This is more practical than when you 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.890
 Do it afterwards, because you're going to roll over the edge. 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.109
 Next is foliage at the bottom. 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.469
 This can be a nice thick layer, because on the one hand it works 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:48.580
 a drainage, 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.250
 on the other hand, potatoes, which then grow very far down, meet up 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.730
 soft foliage instead of compressed earth. 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.900
 The risk that the earth in the bags over time too much 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.150
 strangely enough, is strangely much bigger than in anyway 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.939
 the tubs. 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.109
 Therefore, there are other countermeasures with which I work for 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:07.320
 care for airy and loose soil. 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.840
 The earth that comes on the foliage, I always mix from compost, a bit of sand, 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.390
 Topsoil and foliage. 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.790
 Both in the topsoil and in the compost are always worms and others 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.520
 small animals that work the soil permanently beautiful. 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.560
 So the foliage is food on the one hand, 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.499
 On the other hand, it also loosens up the earth itself. 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:29.669
 From this earth I give about a hand and a half to the foliage and press everything 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:33.309
 nice in the corners, so that the whole thing remains stable and does not tip over later. 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:36.260
 On this second layer then come the seed potatoes, 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.700
 and in a 20-liter bag a single. Potatoes need much more 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.879
 Place, as one might think, believe me! Even in a 60-liter sack join 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.629
 Only two seed potatoes for me, that's enough. I will have another experiment too 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.039
 take up the space, but later. 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.709
 On the seed potatoes then comes an ample hand bread loose 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.019
 Earth mixture, and then they are actually already so far. The whole 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.399
 early potatoes rarely reach their final destination 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:06.379
 Place, but in the impending frost I put them, for example, on the wall 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.569
 or if it is colder in the greenhouse. So I do not carry around 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.309
 the sacks crush the earth and damage the first roots, 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:16.510
 I put the sacks on flat coasters. 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.860
 Like other plants, potatoes do not like it when they are in the morning 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.560
 wake up and the sun is suddenly behind instead of forward. 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.060
 That's why I mark at these coasters where south is. That is the 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.709
 Direction that you find yourself quite easy as a layman, continue there at noon 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.570
 the sun is shining 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.860
 No matter where the potatoes are in the next few weeks, they always stand in the 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.890
 same direction. 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.840
 But now let them grow a bit and then look again.
