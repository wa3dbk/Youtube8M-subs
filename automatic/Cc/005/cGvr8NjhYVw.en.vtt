00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:12.240
 Hello 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.630
 this program is usually 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.500
 I'm Igor Morzharetto and this is the newest 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.950
 Russian car Volga 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.759
 Cyber 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:19.669
 car with a complicated history when demand 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.319
 it was Americans now area 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.869
 let's see what he has together 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.259
 april map of russia 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.710
 but firstly the design 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.519
 for me typical for Americans 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.189
 90s American per se if 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.270
 elongated hair shifted Moscow 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.430
 in front of the cabin 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.420
 in itself gives out pure thunder Americans 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.690
 players on the problems adapted 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.789
 changed the grille appeared 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.719
 the release of the deer have changed a little 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.239
 front lights in general 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.300
 probably all 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.320
 under the hood of this rising Americans 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.000
 maybe two engines 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.180
 both american chrysler do in america here 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.350
 here is the most common 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.600
 motor for taking bribes a liter 143 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.190
 horsepower another 37 ten years ruble 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.770
 more horsepower 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.720
 two short five-speed options 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.870
 Mechanics 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.380
 or AvtoVAZ here 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.380
 engine 2 4 liters combined automatons 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.370
 but now let's see how it looks 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.400
 co-owner 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.400
 the driver 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.619
 you're doing everything 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.920
 let's see all of what comes to eat 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.270
 Volkova typical American 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.860
 car 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.130
 klitschko transitions published with torpedo 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.250
 this is typical american 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.649
 plastics after two of his good 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.390
 the quality of the technique is inherent in the book 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.560
 Kendrick is such a embarrassing mortgage loan though 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.960
 kind of like all contemporary 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.479
 sufficient dashboard 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.540
 therapy white little device beautiful 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.000
 done 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 revenue that's like enough 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.740
 boxes southerners can work in manual 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.570
 mode and this is how it immediately disappears 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.840
 a beard is what is just called what 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.000
 it is very cheap 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.950
 air conditioner usmanov base in all 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.310
 pickings about a certain point Soviet 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.300
 the same can be said about digital 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.480
 modern tourist code 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.719
 infrastructure 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.709
 damage unpretentious housing 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.829
 deserving by car 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.379
 but on the other side of them 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.439
 Kind of like stop no use 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.379
 can imagine 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.669
 then naturally got the backlight to 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:23.679
 conflict 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:26.029
 from the individual each dry and now 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:27.539
 everything is fine but i'm saying everything 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:29.309
 wonderful all collected 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:31.809
 we ask that two are regulated 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.629
 airbags 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.629
 sue we have 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:41.569
 comes alive Paraguayan team relies 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.239
 light bulbs for the first time included all belts 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.239
 that is, passed into 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.609
 everything is clear move 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.609
 nadraga 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:59.879
 under the hood 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.909
 engine installed here 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.069
 for as many as four tenths of meters 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.509
 he is so familiar for a long time already enough 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.759
 tried to stop even the old Volga and 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:13.419
 impudence tested victor good good 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:13.969
 business 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:15.790
 another thing is that with an old friend not 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.699
 combined in any way 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.339
 but since that time in high latitudes 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:23.129
 to set 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.120
 power steering really do not like 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.139
 even during which our Volga Volga 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:27.799
 Spartacus 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.699
 lived an independent life and here everything 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.099
 normally I sit as it should be 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.029
 let's average 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:36.069
 such a world car 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.949
 nothing outstanding and everything is all in place everything 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:39.779
 there is 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:41.419
 door handles lies 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.489
 armrests 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.900
 That would be a general failure there still seems to be 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.279
 all classes and all 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:51.339
 not like in great cars 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.889
 so here are wooden sound switches 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.679
 life in the wheel well, nothing outstanding in 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:59.119
 This area is quite convenient 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:01.309
 comfort lies in your hand wow 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:02.819
 deer 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.439
 of course it looked a little 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.329
 strange alien because that's how 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.339
 next to the Kremlin wall of gas resources 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:11.689
 this scene with some kind of very ready 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.749
 machines developed 40 years ago 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:16.039
 progress enough 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.029
 new car it was designed 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.169
 and i like chrysler sebring 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.379
 lead status will be held in April he 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.189
 produced in america 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.279
 until 2100, the gas was not only bought a license 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:30.429
 for the supply of the production of this 

00:04:30.429 --> 00:04:32.050
 car and factory 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.319
 he paid the job again 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.059
 English design bureau 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:38.499
 which here is a little changed external 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:39.729
 car view 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.559
 name appeared news wife grille 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:44.659
 radiator more familiar to us such 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.589
 preferred essentially continuity 

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:49.389
 car from old in the bay new headlights 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.990
 new lanterns 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.840
 new seats kuzmin and here still 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.349
 fewer foreigners than 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.220
 engaged in the suspension of the car she listened 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.669
 the other is completely different 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.050
 clearance because in the cup of this 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.499
 vehicle ground clearance is already with Russian 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:08.229
 which is nice but they are still about what for example 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.039
 there were fashion repeaters there 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:11.879
 cornering mirrors 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.430
 still some little things in principle yes 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.380
 Americans themselves say that especially 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.430
 changed dramatically 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.180
 here so as with this hike due 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.810
 the cops were american 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.509
 suspension 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:24.770
 but just a car crashed 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.770
 shelves loosen up in the hallways normally 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.199
 need to say that 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.289
 when gas two years ago announced 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:35.949
 what they buy factory produces 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.090
 chrysler sebring cars had a lot 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.590
 doubters as far as possible 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.659
 adapt to Russian conditions 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.309
 american car 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:45.650
 however everything is possible 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.909
 kernes poison for example this suspension 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:51.159
 others like how 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.129
 collectively running engine and 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:56.419
 Automatic transmission very nice even negative 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.509
 in them failures are nothing new in american 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:01.129
 boxes sometimes 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.309
 there is such a thing 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:04.569
 twitching to switch 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.509
 there is no speed 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:10.509
 if galliullin desire is possible 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.690
 manual speed switch 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.410
 mode, but I have no such desire 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.320
 what for 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.979
 need to be comfortable 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.229
 on the layout of Eurobonds without 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:23.569
 comments to Geneva 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:24.729
 car dealership 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:27.369
 but if you compare with the usual Volga 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:28.809
 two goals 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:31.919
 no air above your head 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.870
 Volga driver personal 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.699
 driver 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:36.439
 This is a man who periodically go 

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:39.059
 hats so here in the hat the man was tall 

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:42.009
 omen 8 that above would not have known 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:43.619
 the same goes for the rear passenger 

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:44.339
 because
