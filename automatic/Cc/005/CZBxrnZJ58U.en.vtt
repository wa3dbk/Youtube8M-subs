if<00:00:01.770> your<00:00:01.920> double<00:00:02.220> pane<00:00:02.370> windows<00:00:02.790> have

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
if your double pane windows have

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.019 
if your double pane windows have
moisture<00:00:03.449> on<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.899> inside<00:00:04.500> what<00:00:05.130> do<00:00:05.190> you<00:00:05.250> do<00:00:05.400> do

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
moisture on the inside what do you do do

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.270 
moisture on the inside what do you do do
you<00:00:06.060> replace<00:00:06.420> them<00:00:06.629> well<00:00:07.259> maybe<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:07.589> do<00:00:07.740> but

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
you replace them well maybe you do but

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.770 
you replace them well maybe you do but
now<00:00:08.700> there's<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.000> way<00:00:09.150> where<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.480> can<00:00:09.599> actually

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
now there's a way where you can actually

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.140 
now there's a way where you can actually
repair<00:00:10.440> these<00:00:10.679> windows<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.460> save<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.059> little

people<00:00:29.420> I've<00:00:29.690> seen<00:00:29.870> these<00:00:30.050> all<00:00:30.290> over<00:00:30.500> these

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:30.620 
people I've seen these all over these

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.810 
people I've seen these all over these
double<00:00:30.890> pane<00:00:31.040> windows<00:00:31.340> where<00:00:31.490> they<00:00:31.550> start<00:00:31.790> to

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
double pane windows where they start to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.940 
double pane windows where they start to
get<00:00:32.000> foggy<00:00:32.510> on<00:00:32.540> the<00:00:32.630> inside<00:00:33.020> so<00:00:33.200> why<00:00:33.770> does<00:00:33.920> that

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
get foggy on the inside so why does that

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.540 
get foggy on the inside so why does that
happen

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
happen

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.090 
happen
pure<00:00:35.240> physics<00:00:35.630> moisture<00:00:36.560> comes<00:00:36.770> in<00:00:36.890> in<00:00:37.040> the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
pure physics moisture comes in in the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.310 
pure physics moisture comes in in the
window<00:00:37.340> through<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:37.730> heating<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:38.210> cooling

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320

expansion contraction cycle

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.680 
expansion contraction cycle
it's<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:40.940> heating<00:00:41.210> of<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.330> day<00:00:41.420> of<00:00:41.630> the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
it's the heating of the day of the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.299 
it's the heating of the day of the
desert<00:00:42.020> all<00:00:42.260> right<00:00:42.410> now<00:00:42.500> in<00:00:42.680> years<00:00:42.860> past<00:00:43.070> I've

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
desert all right now in years past I've

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.340 
desert all right now in years past I've
thought<00:00:43.520> you<00:00:44.300> just<00:00:44.390> got<00:00:44.540> to<00:00:44.660> throw<00:00:45.020> these<00:00:45.200> away

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
thought you just got to throw these away

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.170 
thought you just got to throw these away
get<00:00:45.710> a<00:00:45.739> new<00:00:45.920> one<00:00:46.100> if<00:00:46.550> you<00:00:46.700> want<00:00:46.880> them<00:00:46.970> to<00:00:47.000> be

get a new one if you want them to be

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.549 
get a new one if you want them to be
clear<00:00:47.450> but<00:00:47.660> you<00:00:47.750> have<00:00:47.900> a<00:00:47.930> new<00:00:48.080> method<00:00:48.380> where

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559

you can restore these I have a method

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.630 
you can restore these I have a method
it's<00:00:51.170> actually<00:00:51.470> 20<00:00:51.680> years<00:00:51.950> old<00:00:52.160> believe<00:00:52.370> it<00:00:52.550> or

it's actually 20 years old believe it or
not<00:00:52.960> new<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.110> this<00:00:54.230> area<00:00:54.440> but<00:00:55.250> yeah<00:00:55.760> I<00:00:56.420> can

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
not new to this area but yeah I can

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.690 
not new to this area but yeah I can
restore<00:00:57.530> that<00:00:57.710> window<00:00:58.040> get<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:58.340> moisture<00:00:58.670> out

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
restore that window get the moisture out

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.760 
restore that window get the moisture out
without<00:00:59.090> replacing<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.780> glass<00:00:59.870> all<00:01:00.620> right

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
without replacing the glass all right

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.340 
without replacing the glass all right
now<00:01:01.280> does<00:01:02.000> that<00:01:02.030> work<00:01:02.329> for<00:01:02.570> every<00:01:02.870> window<00:01:03.170> like

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
now does that work for every window like

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.540 
now does that work for every window like
this<00:01:03.530> I<00:01:03.590> mean<00:01:03.710> some<00:01:03.860> of<00:01:03.920> them<00:01:04.040> look<00:01:04.160> pretty<00:01:04.280> far

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
this I mean some of them look pretty far

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.370 
this I mean some of them look pretty far
gone<00:01:04.580> there<00:01:05.270> are<00:01:05.449> windows<00:01:05.720> that<00:01:05.780> are<00:01:06.020> not<00:01:06.170> good

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
gone there are windows that are not good

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.140 
gone there are windows that are not good
candidates<00:01:06.770> for<00:01:06.920> a<00:01:07.070> variety<00:01:07.340> of<00:01:07.700> reasons

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
candidates for a variety of reasons

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.900 
candidates for a variety of reasons
either<00:01:08.660> it's<00:01:08.869> been<00:01:09.020> too<00:01:09.200> long<00:01:09.490> or<00:01:10.490> other

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
either it's been too long or other

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.719 
either it's been too long or other
situations<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.080> yes<00:01:12.380> not<00:01:12.680> all<00:01:12.950> windows<00:01:13.580> are

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
situations so yes not all windows are

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.580 
situations so yes not all windows are
good<00:01:13.880> candidates<00:01:14.300> that's<00:01:15.020> why<00:01:15.170> I<00:01:15.200> do<00:01:15.380> glass

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
good candidates that's why I do glass

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.230 
good candidates that's why I do glass
replacement<00:01:16.130> as<00:01:16.190> well<00:01:16.369> that's<00:01:16.640> right<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.030> if

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
replacement as well that's right so if

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.690 
replacement as well that's right so if
if<00:01:17.990> it<00:01:18.470> doesn't<00:01:18.770> work<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:19.160> can<00:01:19.310> replace<00:01:19.640> that

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
if it doesn't work you can replace that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.400 
if it doesn't work you can replace that
window<00:01:20.090> right<00:01:20.660> here<00:01:20.690> in<00:01:20.960> people's<00:01:21.229> homes

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
window right here in people's homes

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.350 
window right here in people's homes
right<00:01:22.130> I<00:01:22.340> actually<00:01:22.670> replaced<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.240> glass

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
right I actually replaced the glass

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.900 
right I actually replaced the glass
within<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.020> frame<00:01:24.290> a<00:01:25.009> lot<00:01:25.399> of<00:01:25.490> people<00:01:25.759> don't

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
within the frame a lot of people don't

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.850 
within the frame a lot of people don't
realize<00:01:26.210> that<00:01:26.240> windows<00:01:26.810> or<00:01:27.170> glass<00:01:27.410> can<00:01:27.710> be

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
realize that windows or glass can be

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.210 
realize that windows or glass can be
replaced<00:01:28.190> within<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:28.640> frame<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:29.840> do<00:01:29.899> that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
replaced within the frame and I do that

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.710 
replaced within the frame and I do that
that's<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.310> great<00:01:31.460> service<00:01:31.819> okay<00:01:32.300> well<00:01:32.509> this

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720
