00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.619
 worth it so let's start this 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.360

 basketball court so encourage and 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.670
 more we start good friends first thing is 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.940
 make this rectangle that are 21 of 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:47.539
 wide by 43 long is to say 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.719
 we are here and we count 21 wide and 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.940
 then including this we counted 43 of 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:01.870
 long once they have this we stop 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:07.480
 here and we are going to count 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:14.560
 here we count 3 1 2 3 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:16.890
 here we count 212 and here 2b we repeat 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.890
 here 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:27.979
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 3 1 2 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:39.009
 here 212 here 212 v 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.009
 and so connect 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.000
 and good to do the same thing on the other side 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.930
 now we are going here leaving a space and 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 we have 2 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.080
 two 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.710
 two 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.710
 and 3 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.730
 we repeat 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.970
 two 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.970
 two 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.460
 2b 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.460
 and 3 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.370
 well guys here we count 1 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.270
 here too 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.090
 and here 3 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:26.239
 if on this side too 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.239
 1 1 and 3 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.920
 we put this line in the middle 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.320
 and it will stay like this now 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.770
 let's go here and let's do this same thing is 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.250
 say that we are going to square this center and 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.590
 we do this and we count here 2 1 2 and 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.980
 here we break 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.319
 we put these three that is symmetrical with 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:59.420
 this 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:03:04.090
 and we tell the future 1 so here 3 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.090
 1 2 3 1 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:11.410
 123 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:16.770
 so 1 and 1 2 3 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.770
 without guys they were going to throw a line here 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.090
 so connect with this 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.670
 well guys were going to be the same of this 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.860
 side a tip that I give you to do 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.400
 this is that they are going to start with this line 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:47.140
 that is , they are 1 2 3 4 5 b 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:54.579
 we stopped here we counted here 1 2 in 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:57.069
 the third we do this would be 3 b 4 and 5 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.750
 and they will repeat everything we did here 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.849
 on this side so I'm going to finish 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.799
 all this and when I finish I go back with 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.390
 you and they will stay this way 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.730
 as you can see on the screen now 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.200
 let's make the baskets so let's go 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.200
 to get carried away by this line 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:18.120
 here 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:21.600
 We were going to count 7 high 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.500
 without guys we put here quickly this 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.390
 A) Yes 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.390
 we put a small picture here 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.430
 and we are going to put this like this 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:43.530
 normal around the red 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.530
 and we extend one more 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.850
 We extend one more 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:59.780
 well and now we put any block 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:02.389
 we put a hopper 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.910
 so I was looking down guys 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.010
 they were going to be the same on the other side and 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.380
 we have completely finished what 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.590
 is the basket and well they can fill the 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.889
 floor I used this clay put it by 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.940
 all the floor here do the line of 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.940
 outside or cause 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.860
 and put what is bricks out 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.630
 well guys and here we have the result 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.220
