think<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.390> was<00:01:12.450> working<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.170> has<00:01:13.290> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
think it was working because it has a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.260 
think it was working because it has a
really<00:01:13.920> clean<00:01:14.159> sound<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.670> sounds<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.119> like

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
really clean sound it sounds just like

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.289 
really clean sound it sounds just like
