this<00:03:15.579> way<00:03:15.730> you've<00:03:15.879> got<00:03:15.909> this<00:03:16.150> little<00:03:16.510> bit<00:03:16.629> of

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
this way you've got this little bit of

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.990 
this way you've got this little bit of
webbing<00:03:17.139> down<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.650> side<00:03:17.889> here<00:03:18.189> that's<00:03:18.760> where

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
webbing down the side here that's where

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.140 
webbing down the side here that's where
your<00:03:19.120> first<00:03:19.239> pegging<00:03:19.689> point<00:03:19.959> wants<00:03:20.169> to<00:03:20.290> be<00:03:20.439> so

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
your first pegging point wants to be so

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.729 
your first pegging point wants to be so
peg<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.299> out<00:03:22.480> nice<00:03:22.719> and<00:03:22.750> tight<00:03:23.139> and<00:03:23.680> then

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.159 
peg that out nice and tight and then
just<00:03:24.730> slowly<00:03:24.969> work<00:03:25.599> the<00:03:25.810> way<00:03:25.959> around<00:03:27.989> next<00:03:28.989> one

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
just slowly work the way around next one

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:34.589 
just slowly work the way around next one
there<00:03:32.340> don't<00:03:33.340> worry<00:03:33.549> too<00:03:33.819> much<00:03:33.849> about<00:03:34.060> how<00:03:34.449> it

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599

now you've got your front poles in place

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.730 
now you've got your front poles in place
simply<00:04:21.489> take<00:04:21.820> a<00:04:21.849> few<00:04:22.120> more<00:04:22.270> pegs<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:22.810> drop

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
simply take a few more pegs and drop

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.350 
simply take a few more pegs and drop
them<00:04:23.889> into<00:04:24.039> the<00:04:24.250> front<00:04:24.520> pegging<00:04:24.849> points<00:04:25.210> it's

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
them into the front pegging points it's

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.749 
them into the front pegging points it's
best<00:04:25.539> to<00:04:25.630> do<00:04:25.810> this<00:04:25.990> with<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.320> door<00:04:26.530> shut<00:04:26.919> so<00:04:27.610> if

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.450 
door you can do so very easily and
you'll<00:04:32.199> notice<00:04:32.500> I've<00:04:32.650> only<00:04:32.919> took<00:04:33.039> use<00:04:33.310> the

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
you'll notice I've only took use the

you'll notice I've only took use the
minimal<00:04:33.940> about<00:04:34.150> pegging<00:04:34.539> points<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.020> stuff

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
minimal about pegging points and stuff

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.629 
minimal about pegging points and stuff
like<00:04:35.320> that<00:04:35.500> but<00:04:35.740> if<00:04:35.949> you<00:04:36.039> are<00:04:36.219> sort<00:04:36.460> of<00:04:36.490> in<00:04:36.610> a

out the way you can obviously lengthen

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.880 
out the way you can obviously lengthen
the<00:06:40.600> tension<00:06:41.020> strap<00:06:41.230> to<00:06:41.380> make<00:06:41.530> it<00:06:41.680> a<00:06:41.740> bit

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:41.890 
the tension strap to make it a bit

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.270 
the tension strap to make it a bit
easier<00:06:42.190> for<00:06:42.250> getting<00:06:42.640> it<00:06:42.730> on<00:06:42.820> the<00:06:42.940> clip<00:06:44.280> once

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
easier for getting it on the clip once

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.290 
easier for getting it on the clip once
it's<00:06:45.460> clip<00:06:45.700> sharp<00:06:46.000> pull<00:06:46.210> it<00:06:46.360> tight

it's clip sharp pull it tight

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.970 
it's clip sharp pull it tight
then<00:06:49.300> again<00:06:49.570> just<00:06:49.750> wrap<00:06:50.110> this<00:06:50.290> section<00:06:50.770> around

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980 
then again just wrap this section around

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.420 
then again just wrap this section around
just<00:06:51.760> to<00:06:51.820> make<00:06:51.880> it<00:06:52.030> easy<00:06:52.330> to<00:06:52.450> get<00:06:52.690> in<00:06:52.840> the<00:06:52.930> bag

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
what I've done with this one just roll

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.330 
what I've done with this one just roll
it<00:06:58.120> inside<00:06:58.420> itself<00:06:59.140> just<00:06:59.680> so<00:06:59.800> it's<00:06:59.920> about<00:07:00.070> half

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
it inside itself just so it's about half

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.430 
it inside itself just so it's about half
the<00:07:00.370> length<00:07:00.580> of<00:07:00.850> what<00:07:01.030> it<00:07:01.120> normally<00:07:01.270> is<00:07:01.600> that

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 
the length of what it normally is that

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.380 
the length of what it normally is that
makes<00:07:02.710> it<00:07:02.830> a<00:07:02.890> lot<00:07:03.040> easier<00:07:03.370> to<00:07:03.430> get<00:07:03.700> in<00:07:03.820> the

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
makes it a lot easier to get in the

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.930 
makes it a lot easier to get in the
bottom<00:07:04.690> section<00:07:04.930> of<00:07:05.200> the<00:07:05.290> bully<00:07:05.470> in<00:07:05.680> so<00:07:05.980> top
