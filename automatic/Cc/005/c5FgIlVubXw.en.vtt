we take a look at standard contraptions

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.330 
we take a look at standard contraptions
and<00:00:12.360> farms<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:12.870> say<00:00:13.049> hey<00:00:13.290> that's<00:00:13.860> too<00:00:14.190> small

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
and farms and say hey that's too small

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.340 
and farms and say hey that's too small
how<00:00:14.730> about<00:00:14.940> we<00:00:15.059> make<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.360> 10<00:00:15.570> times<00:00:15.780> bigger<00:00:16.139> and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
how about we make it 10 times bigger and

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.460 
how about we make it 10 times bigger and
this<00:00:16.830> one<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.400> absolutely<00:00:17.670> no<00:00:18.390> exception<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
other day once all of my exams are

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.910 
other day once all of my exams are
finished<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.689> got<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> little<00:00:22.289> bit<00:00:22.500> bored<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:22.890> I

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
finished I got a little bit bored so I

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.519 
finished I got a little bit bored so I
hopped<00:00:23.189> onto<00:00:23.400> mcedit<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.140> what<00:00:25.380> I

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
hopped onto mcedit and this is what I

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.160 
hopped onto mcedit and this is what I
managed<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.890> create<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> humongous<00:00:27.689> and

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
managed to create it is a humongous and

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.980 
managed to create it is a humongous and
highly<00:00:28.949> efficient<00:00:29.460> gold<00:00:29.670> farm<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.359> spawns<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
highly efficient gold farm this spawns a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.319 
highly efficient gold farm this spawns a
whole<00:00:31.230> bunch<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.800> zombie<00:00:32.130> pigman<00:00:32.579> produces<00:00:33.300> a

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
whole bunch of zombie pigman produces a

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.180 
whole bunch of zombie pigman produces a
lot<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.540> gold<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.050> causes<00:00:34.710> major<00:00:35.040> problems

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
lot of gold and causes major problems

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.610 
lot of gold and causes major problems
for<00:00:35.700> my<00:00:35.790> computer<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.840> let's<00:00:37.110> take<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> closer

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
for my computer so let's take a closer

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.580 
for my computer so let's take a closer
look<00:00:37.770> at<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:39.660> if<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.079> take<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> look<00:00:40.440> around

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
look at it so if we take a look around

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.130 
look at it so if we take a look around
here<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.129> will<00:00:41.280> notice<00:00:41.579> two<00:00:41.820> things<00:00:42.140> portals

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
here you will notice two things portals

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.619 
here you will notice two things portals
and<00:00:43.410> zombie<00:00:43.920> pigman<00:00:44.309> there<00:00:44.910> are<00:00:45.059> lots<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.390> both

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
and zombie pigman there are lots of both

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.569 
and zombie pigman there are lots of both
the<00:00:46.020> portals<00:00:46.469> are<00:00:46.710> worth<00:00:46.860> spawning<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the portals are worth spawning in the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.610 
the portals are worth spawning in the
pigment<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.450> may<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.629> wondering<00:00:48.930> why<00:00:49.469> on

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
pigment and you may be wondering why on

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.220 
pigment and you may be wondering why on
earth<00:00:49.649> are<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.430> big<00:00:50.700> well<00:00:51.329> zombie<00:00:51.809> pigmen

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
earth are they so big well zombie pigmen

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.869 
earth are they so big well zombie pigmen
spawning<00:00:52.590> actually<00:00:53.100> depends<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.579> how<00:00:53.820> many

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
spawning actually depends on how many

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.090 
spawning actually depends on how many
portal<00:00:54.449> blocks<00:00:54.660> there<00:00:54.840> are<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.949> can

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
portal blocks there are and as you can

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.160 
portal blocks there are and as you can
see<00:00:56.160> from<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.760> farm<00:00:57.090> there<00:00:57.600> are<00:00:57.750> quite<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> lot

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
see from this farm there are quite a lot

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.200 
see from this farm there are quite a lot
of<00:00:58.289> portal<00:00:58.770> blocks<00:00:58.949> which<00:00:59.250> means<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.030> get

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
of portal blocks which means that we get

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.599 
of portal blocks which means that we get
a<00:01:00.480> lot<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.870> zombie<00:01:01.199> pigmen<00:01:01.590> now<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> 2

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
a lot of zombie pigmen now this is a 2

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.910 
a lot of zombie pigmen now this is a 2
layer<00:01:03.030> design<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.409> bottom<00:01:04.769> layer

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
layer design that is the bottom layer

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.440 
layer design that is the bottom layer
and<00:01:05.100> then<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.760> head<00:01:05.909> up<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> top

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
and then if we head up to the top

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.000 
and then if we head up to the top
it<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.720> much<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.960> same<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:07.950> see

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
it is much the same but as you can see

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.160 
it is much the same but as you can see
I've<00:01:08.400> actually<00:01:08.760> got<00:01:09.150> an<00:01:09.299> alternate<00:01:09.869> account

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
I've actually got an alternate account

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.320 
I've actually got an alternate account
that<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.470> logged<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.400> server<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.299> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
that is logged on to the server so that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.850 
that is logged on to the server so that
it<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.720> load<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> world<00:01:13.260> because<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> issue

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
it can load the world because the issue

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.160 
it can load the world because the issue
is<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.490> farm<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.030> size<00:01:15.270> anything<00:01:16.049> that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
is with a farm this size anything that

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.350 
is with a farm this size anything that
spawns<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> opposite<00:01:17.369> side<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.000> farm

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
spawns on the opposite side of the farm

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.420 
spawns on the opposite side of the farm
these<00:01:18.869> spawns<00:01:19.200> fairly<00:01:19.680> quickly<00:01:19.950> which<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
these spawns fairly quickly which is a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
these spawns fairly quickly which is a
bit<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.759> problem<00:01:20.939> but<00:01:21.509> anyway<00:01:21.780> if<00:01:21.960> we<00:01:21.990> head

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
bit of a problem but anyway if we head

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.960 
bit of a problem but anyway if we head
down<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> bottom<00:01:22.860> here<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.520> literally

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
down to the bottom here I have literally

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.999 
down to the bottom here I have literally
just<00:01:24.360> turned<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.020> peaceful<00:01:25.409> mode<00:01:25.590> so

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
just turned it on to peaceful mode so

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.710 
just turned it on to peaceful mode so
there<00:01:26.100> are<00:01:26.189> only<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.430> few<00:01:26.490> zombie<00:01:26.970> pigmen<00:01:27.330> but

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
there are only a few zombie pigmen but

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.690 
there are only a few zombie pigmen but
we've<00:01:27.840> got<00:01:28.080> ourselves<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.619> crusher<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.460> flip

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
we've got ourselves a crusher if we flip

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.069 
we've got ourselves a crusher if we flip
this<00:01:29.790> lever<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.270> will<00:01:30.390> see<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.689> all<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
this lever you will see that all of the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.200 
this lever you will see that all of the
zombie<00:01:31.380> pigmen<00:01:31.680> suffocates<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.430> their<00:01:32.909> drops

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
zombie pigmen suffocates and their drops

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.490 
zombie pigmen suffocates and their drops
end<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.960> chest

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
end up in this chest

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.620 
end up in this chest
now<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.009> chest<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.520> filling<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:36.060> fairly

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
now this chest is filling up fairly

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.630 
now this chest is filling up fairly
quickly<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.380> will<00:01:37.470> see<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.920> fills<00:01:38.189> up<00:01:38.310> even

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
quickly you will see it fills up even

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640 
quickly you will see it fills up even
faster<00:01:38.850> when<00:01:39.390> they<00:01:39.479> all<00:01:39.659> die<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.500> get

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
faster when they all die and we get

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.020 
faster when they all die and we get
ourselves<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.280> lot<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.850> gold<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.600> rotten<00:01:43.079> flesh

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
ourselves a lot of gold and rotten flesh

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.090 
ourselves a lot of gold and rotten flesh
as<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.899> mentioned<00:01:46.320> at<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.530> beginning<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.979> this

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
as I mentioned at the beginning of this

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.039 
as I mentioned at the beginning of this
video<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.670> was<00:01:47.880> all<00:01:48.030> meant<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.689> little

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
video this was all meant to be a little

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:49.639 
video this was all meant to be a little
bit<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.259> fun

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
bit of fun

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.889 
bit of fun
I<00:01:49.680> used<00:01:50.130> mcedit<00:01:50.790> predominantly<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
I used mcedit predominantly for the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.480 
I used mcedit predominantly for the
building<00:01:52.229> process<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.159> didn't<00:01:53.399> really

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
building process and it didn't really

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.130 
building process and it didn't really
take<00:01:53.790> too<00:01:54.000> long<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.630> thought<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.899> would

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
take too long and I thought I would

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.480 
take too long and I thought I would
upload<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.649> YouTube<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.310> showcase

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
upload it to YouTube just to showcase

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.639 
upload it to YouTube just to showcase
how<00:01:56.939> insane<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.420> could<00:01:57.750> get<00:01:57.930> with<00:01:58.110> gold<00:01:58.380> farm

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
how insane you could get with gold farm

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.410 
how insane you could get with gold farm
construction<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.490> one<00:01:59.640> thing<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.969> would<00:02:00.060> say

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
construction but one thing I would say

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.539 
construction but one thing I would say
is<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:01.409> considering<00:02:02.070> building<00:02:02.250> this

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
is if you are considering building this

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.880 
is if you are considering building this
in<00:02:02.759> survival<00:02:03.329> mode<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.750> would<00:02:04.469> highly<00:02:04.860> suggest

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
in survival mode I would highly suggest

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.819 
in survival mode I would highly suggest
and<00:02:05.490> not<00:02:05.670> doing<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.689> issue<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.439> that

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
and not doing it the issue is is that

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.229 
and not doing it the issue is is that
although<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> very<00:02:08.789> impressive

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
although this is a very impressive

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.990 
although this is a very impressive
structure<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.440> actual<00:02:10.860> rates<00:02:11.129> considering

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
structure the actual rates considering

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.370 
structure the actual rates considering
the<00:02:12.150> size<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the size of it and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.840 
the size of it and
so<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.710> amount<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.040> time<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.550> would<00:02:14.640> take<00:02:14.670> to

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
so the amount of time it would take to

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.780 
so the amount of time it would take to
build<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.360> are<00:02:15.570> just<00:02:16.170> not<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.530> good<00:02:16.830> if<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.520> did

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
build it are just not that good if I did

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.820 
build it are just not that good if I did
this<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.240> built<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:18.840> survival<00:02:19.470> using

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
this and built it in survival using

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.860 
this and built it in survival using
obsidian<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.430> I'd<00:02:20.520> hand<00:02:20.850> mind<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.420> would

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
obsidian that I'd hand mind I would

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.440 
obsidian that I'd hand mind I would
expect<00:02:22.260> billions<00:02:22.890> upon<00:02:23.190> billions<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:24.030> items

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
expect billions upon billions of items

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.610 
expect billions upon billions of items
of<00:02:24.600> gold<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.990> second

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
of gold a second

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.770 
of gold a second
not<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.100> little<00:02:26.190> trickle<00:02:26.670> again<00:02:27.090> here<00:02:27.390> so

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
not the little trickle again here so

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.820 
not the little trickle again here so
that's<00:02:27.960> just<00:02:28.080> something<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.440> take<00:02:28.590> into

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
that's just something to take into

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.500 
that's just something to take into
consideration<00:02:28.860> before<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.970> hop<00:02:30.150> into<00:02:30.480> your

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
consideration before you hop into your

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.330 
consideration before you hop into your
survival<00:02:31.050> world<00:02:31.200> with<00:02:31.650> your<00:02:31.800> diamond<00:02:32.160> pick

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
survival world with your diamond pick

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.130 
survival world with your diamond pick
ready<00:02:32.580> ready<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.270> gather<00:02:33.450> up<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.810> bunch<00:02:33.840> of

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
ready ready to gather up a bunch of

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.130 
ready ready to gather up a bunch of
obsidian<00:02:34.440> don't<00:02:35.130> do<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.810> having<00:02:36.810> said<00:02:37.110> all

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
obsidian don't do it having said all

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.080 
obsidian don't do it having said all
that<00:02:37.260> there<00:02:37.590> were<00:02:37.710> plenty<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.340> very<00:02:38.610> efficient

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
that there were plenty of very efficient

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.820 
that there were plenty of very efficient
gold<00:02:39.300> farm<00:02:39.600> design<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.110> can<00:02:40.350> find<00:02:40.590> that

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
gold farm design so you can find that

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.320 
gold farm design so you can find that
are<00:02:40.920> much<00:02:41.100> more<00:02:41.340> survival<00:02:41.850> friendly<00:02:42.180> than

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
are much more survival friendly than

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.030 
are much more survival friendly than
this<00:02:42.480> one<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.140> I'll<00:02:43.230> put<00:02:43.440> links<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:43.740> all<00:02:43.890> of
