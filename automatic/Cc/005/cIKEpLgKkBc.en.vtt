research trying to figure out this

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.420 
research trying to figure out this
guitar<00:02:43.239> a<00:02:43.480> lot<00:02:44.050> of<00:02:44.230> them<00:02:44.380> in<00:02:44.739> almost<00:02:44.980> all<00:02:45.220> of

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
guitar a lot of them in almost all of

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.240 
guitar a lot of them in almost all of
the<00:02:45.580> Mo's<00:02:46.269> rights<00:02:46.510> we<00:02:46.690> saw<00:02:47.260> had<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.590> backplate

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
the Mo's rights we saw had a backplate

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.759 
the Mo's rights we saw had a backplate
here<00:02:48.580> but<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.360> few<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.720> them<00:02:50.019> we<00:02:50.170> saw<00:02:50.380> which<00:02:50.620> was

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
here but a few of them we saw which was

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.880 
here but a few of them we saw which was
I<00:02:50.950> guess<00:02:51.190> pre<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.670> backplate<00:02:52.739> was<00:02:53.739> this

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
I guess pre the backplate was this

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.800 
I guess pre the backplate was this
indented<00:02:55.050> thing<00:02:56.050> with<00:02:56.170> grommets<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.690> is
