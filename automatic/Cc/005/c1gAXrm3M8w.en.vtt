00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.900
 me 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.900
 me 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.800
 none 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.160
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.950
 me 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.920
 me 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:46.930
 We become all like Aosewa Yes Well look Thank you for your viewing is Takeuchi 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:52.570
 This time a little bit of severe news is continuing 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:56.260
 Well there are so many things that 's geeky, but a simple and effective video artist 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.840
 It was full up too much and really got a lot of Hankyu in May 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.100
 I the 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:06.560
 Well , I think it's kind of a bonus and I think I want to go for a piece 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:10.400
 It is probably an interesting rule when buying in the Deep Impact Reference Heavy Prize 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.740
 Even the deep impact fan did not notice much 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.549
 I would like to introduce 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.770
 a First of all, the company is not so expensive because deep impact production pieces are recognized 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:25.460
 Of course there are lots of high conditions but 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.210
 Yeah I think what it feels like I think 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:33.649
 Other Macara anela without buying a lip at a deep impact production is popular 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:37.700
 Better was that Toka it is than to say good things like that Thats profitable teapot 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:41.509
 It is sometimes said that you hate deep impact 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.200
 That's not the case, but it is said that I am not interested in a horse that doesn't have much 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:50.049
 By the way there is 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.000
 Actually I would like to talk that there is a high recovery and one way to aim . 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:57.190
 It is a story of severe 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.920
 Yes, it's already over, but it's over 2000m high prize horse 4 bar It 's very interesting 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:04.619
 That there is a tendency 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.200
 The race is a recovery rate with the deep production piece running more than 6000 meters in the race for 24 laps 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.569
 Is expensive 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:15.709
 In Well less it's less only out is a tendency that the recovery rate is low waiting for not running 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:19.640
 Of course I won't lose it, of course, because there are a lot of deep production pieces strong 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:25.220
 Although there are plenty of activities below, the collection is high at 6000m 18 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:30.500
 It is a place that will be a deep impact production piece 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:33.870
 In particular, it has been running more than 6000 meters, and 3 halons remain from 1st to 3rd after rising from the previous run 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:39.720
 The recovery rate is 220% 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.480
 That's how it feels like it's that 2013 160 letters is a single plus 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.220
 That this is interesting 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.739
 Since the corresponding horse is small to you might be ants also affix Te Well Dawn here in Mar this year 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:55.350
 As we have 3 wins in 2015 too 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:58.310
 Yeah more Well I 13 years Chapter 2 14 years 4 won I mean than feeling 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:03.530
 Well I do not know whether it will increase more than this 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.569
 That number of hits is now too much and will continue to increase rapidly in the future with 13 ton oil etc. 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:11.290
 Because I think 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:15.890
 Well, it will have passed since prospects, such as say Na or not you win more than last year 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:19.220
 I am grateful to this , but I do not understand the reason well 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.560
 I have a lot of running and experience 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:28.510
 Un'ato is Well that are much practice race Well 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:33.579
 That's right I'm getting cardio and lung function is rising 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:37.290
 I wonder where that might be the reason for that 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:41.489
 If this good grade is going to continue 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:47.150
 Well just run the horse that falls under this and check everything a bit and if there is something different 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:51.010
 Do you at whether that I, such about'd say it Well these simple want to see it 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:55.209
 It is a place where a good recovery rate can be targeted 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:59.230
 Talk to you folded a lot of strange Those who in Yeah Well yes I Deep Impact fan 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.410
 I think that it will be the news among those horse racing fans I will talk about this when I drank alcohol 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.950
 And a little 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:09.000
 I think I can not face you 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:13.990

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.380

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:33.450

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:37.590
 The number of channel registrations that I delivered a lot with my elder sisters that people in the world did not know
