00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.720
 at 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.710
 at 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.570
 hi friends it's heptathlon itself 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.130
 find for a new video 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.060
 mystery this monday what we panic 2 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.060
 hello to you 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.520
 hello to all here today 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.779
 little discovery so at the beginning I 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.400
 wanted to make a video about UFOs 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.010
 etc. 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.730
 dumont chiad of the fort a shot of water etc 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.840
 but in the end I searched the internet 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.000
 I searched on the internet two three 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.860
 stuff and I came across gta 5 the 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.970
 meteorite so apparently there are some 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.540
 textures that were found from the 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.850
 meteorite 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.250
 we have news of this meteorite and 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.059
 israel would have been found online so 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.559
 attention you will surely say his 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.809
 textures that tears older etc. 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.940
 yes maybe because it's a brand 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.010
 which was created on xbox only xbox 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.840
 and he found it on ps3 she is there 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.949
 not so I would surely put you 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.020
 pictures because I was not able to 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.670
 save you will surely put a 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.060
 gameplay of this meteorite that was 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.770
 found by Americans so 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.970
 apparently the Francophone community is 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.610
 has not spoken yet so that's why 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.450
 so we do it very severe because full 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.200
 millions of views and for that pays 50% 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.119
 benefits 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.750
 that's what you're waiting for this time 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.000
 it's a nice ticket of 500 euros 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.740
 that's all right so here's the 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.590
 meteorite would have been found so I the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.910
 say well would have been found if on xbox 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.399
 so I think you'll go test I 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.800
 do not know maybe ball learns the 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.509
 first boxer and it's true that when 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.429
 you will have xbox and you may be able to 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.660
 test so I quickly thwarts audi 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.270
 how do you find it so you go on 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.459
 your social club social account in the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.640
 activities gta 5 you add a map that 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.770
 is called 747 sand box of both so 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.420
 it's a clash map that has been 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.700
 created and precisely there are lots of stuff 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.770
 that there are jets etc you can you 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.750
 confront and the meteorite was found 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.020
 so I often find them pictures 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.509
 just above in to the airport 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.030
 not very nice very not very high by 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.379
 report to this consensus was waiting for a 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.650
 normal meteorite it is not very 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.140
 high 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.849
 she does not move one can be a little to 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.530
 terror of on something like that one 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.970
 can land on there's not you so m 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.440
 that's why she's not very high 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.330
 it seems odd that it with just 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.500
 the observer what is true that the 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.660
 Americans had found textures 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.430
 near the observatory 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.200
 solo from the meteorite is that 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.460
 precisely it was assumed that this 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.460
 meteorite could land on 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:36.780
 the observatory to break parts 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:39.000
 of this observatory precisely but 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.900
 after yes we had rather bus to 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.460
 the observatory so we do not know too much 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.480
 it's weird to find it here especially 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.070
 to the airport 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.800
 So is she still would make 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.780
 way to tails far from the path straight ahead 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.370
 it could be possible and it could 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.080
 an impact near the pilatus mount not towards 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.360
 my dog ​​but near the xi'an mount of 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.400
 observers forgiveness Thursday matters 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.600
 what and what impact could this 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.490
 move the structure something like 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.170
 that no idea good in my opinion it is 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.000
 rather a texture that has been changed 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.290
 like the part was created there is no 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.800
 so2 weird sore because there are some 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:16.290
 throwing pink fighter planes and 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.490
 bob cargo bob cargo ships that are chrome 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.750
 so it's pretty weird anyway 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.220
 what would it be not a texture 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.060
 which has been changed because the textures 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.100
 have already been changed 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.900
 you have already shown an image there 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.070
 not very long mystery videos or 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.990
 then more simply it's a 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:38.040
 homosexual coffee this map 1 2 lo 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:41.610
 exactly it's possible too 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.880
 listening do not listen to us so here we go 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.980
 but hello anyway so here is said 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.980
 you are you can you can always 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.450
 tell you your assumptions if you have 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.590
 maybe on this map about things 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.190
 like that if you tested it too 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.530
 this map 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.820
 it could be interesting if you 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.050
 have if you can change 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.700
 detection or stuff like that I 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.890
 know that there are some who arrive at the 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.000
 do in subscribers and ben do not hesitate 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.690
 not to give advice on 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.620
 comments etc 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.930
 I do not know if you have anything to 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.510
 to say on this meteorite precisely bah 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.090
 I do not know what to think after that 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.709
 it is seen that gta 5 is going soon 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.590
 go out on pc I think we 're going a lot 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.450
 no longer able to change textures etc 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.860
 the terraces with the assiduous of this 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:26.430
 side so we'll see we'll see but hey 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.290
 it's the meteorite recover the texture 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.850
 been found that it is certain and certain 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.400
 after that is the one we 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.360
 speak near the observatory no idea 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.630
 would there be a trick of 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.130
 the observatory also no idea but 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.210
 that is if it's good it's a meteorite 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.560
 little bit disappointing because for 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.330
 the moment there is nothing but maybe in 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.310
 a next update as we say 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.410
 always there would be something on 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.550
 do not know anything yet 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.560
 Here is all that I had to act 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.960
 on it after the real question 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.400
 that must be asked is why 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.060
 rockstar meteorite in tracking 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.229
 yeah that's the real question 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.199
 why there would be one and theoretical 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.539
 in this gta 5 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:08.100
 nothing is that he would say that I have 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:09.419
 heard rumors that your friend 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.870
 a thousand times of course from the use 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:18.060
 they make noises so I sell 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:20.370
 so yes I have chick I heard 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.900
 rumors in a friend came all one does not 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.770
 would not say no 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:28.830
 who thinks that the meteorite would arrive at 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.210
 the end when 60% is with trevor 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.470
 then you have to go get something 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.479
 would have to take a plane from the airport 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.000
 of his airport is not going to pick up 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.260
 what's the matter, we do not really know this and that's 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.650
 still strange to me it seems to me 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.789
 complicated yellow so that's so yes I 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.229
 old you wanted to add because 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.400
 I cut no no we blow 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.930
 said it seems complicated to me this 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.550
 airline history club in any case if 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.599
 you like this video you naked it a 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.220
 commented to go see our chains 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.080
 respective as each time we 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.500
 resume gaming videos qg in hand so if 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.090
 you want to have a video coming out 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.030
 surely today or tomorrow 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.520
 oh yeah and well I would put a 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.289
 also so alain spoil his judgments 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.130
 peace talks hold this was 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:12.210
 do not agree okay let's go yes daqui I 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.199
 think I 'd put one in any 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.909
 way today or tomorrow 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:19.530
 finally rather tomorrow and we think 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:23.220
 also resume the delta force xtreme 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:28.199
 maybe that's with perhaps alpha 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:30.120
 if he can or so as a dangerous and 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:32.580
 it could be interesting good 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.880
 Team one has water through or off 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.800
 tank 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.270
 that's quite florent pagny so in 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.070
 anyway that's if you liked you 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.960
 can leaked subscribe we end up 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.400
 next monday finally not monday 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.900
 next as we are in vacation mode 6 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.950
 and a video every two days but I 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.750
 think this week I'm doing a 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.340
 video a day but we will meet again 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.050
 surely in two weeks for a 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.520
 new mystery so this time I 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.919
 think before talk of UFOs 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.260
 I'm still discovering something 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:59.610
 I think we 'll talk about UFOs finally 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.659
 There you go, that's all I had to say 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.860
 do you have a small rivals 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:07.169
 for the end, no, no 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.700
 ok could talk very soon 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:10.529
 so to be very soon 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.969
 certainly for the League of 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:16.710
 champions this week 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:19.520
 arif is true does exist in Corsican so 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.520
 this is hi everyone
