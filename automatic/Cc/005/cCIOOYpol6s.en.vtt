really want to hit these parts right

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.340 
really want to hit these parts right
here<00:00:44.940> because<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> goes<00:00:45.480> real<00:00:45.750> critical<00:00:46.230> to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350

here because it goes real critical to
make<00:00:46.559> tender<00:00:46.950> neat<00:00:47.129> that's<00:00:48.090> why<00:00:48.420> uh<00:00:48.450> some<00:00:49.320> of

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
make tender neat that's why uh some of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.170 
make tender neat that's why uh some of
those<00:00:49.500> head<00:00:49.920> gasps<00:00:50.129> accessibility<00:00:50.820> goes<00:00:50.969> bad

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
those head gasps accessibility goes bad

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.350 
those head gasps accessibility goes bad
for<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> fail<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> most<00:00:53.120> okay

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
for the fail the most okay

areas but if I move up step to the three
thousandth<00:04:47.909> of<00:04:47.969> an<00:04:48.120> inch<00:04:48.409> see<00:04:49.409> what<00:04:49.560> it<00:04:49.650> does

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
thousandth of an inch see what it does

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.220 
thousandth of an inch see what it does
definitely<00:04:51.620> one<00:04:52.630> shudders<00:04:53.630> blocks<00:04:53.900> pretty

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
definitely one shudders blocks pretty

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.860 
definitely one shudders blocks pretty
good<00:04:54.850> I'll<00:04:55.850> have<00:04:55.910> to<00:04:56.150> take<00:04:56.330> it<00:04:56.390> to<00:04:56.540> the<00:04:56.600> machine

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
good I'll have to take it to the machine

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.040 
good I'll have to take it to the machine
shop<00:04:56.900> butt<00:04:57.320> off<00:04:58.000> make<00:04:59.000> sure<00:04:59.180> this<00:04:59.360> tape<00:04:59.660> isn't
