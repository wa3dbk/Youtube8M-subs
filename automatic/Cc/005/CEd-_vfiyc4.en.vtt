okay<00:00:03.020> we<00:00:04.020> are<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.200> little<00:00:04.380> bit<00:00:04.589> older<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:04.890> wiser

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
okay we are a little bit older and wiser

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.570 
okay we are a little bit older and wiser
nothing<00:00:05.970> impalas<00:00:06.420> wiring<00:00:07.010> both<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.280> bulbs

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
nothing impalas wiring both of the bulbs

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.570 
nothing impalas wiring both of the bulbs
were<00:00:08.700> burnt<00:00:08.940> out<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.780> apparently<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:11.070> had<00:00:11.280> one

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
were burnt out and apparently I had one

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.910 
were burnt out and apparently I had one
bad<00:00:12.090> super-bright<00:00:13.019> LED<00:00:13.469> bulb

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
bad super-bright LED bulb

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.620 
bad super-bright LED bulb
apparently<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.700> other<00:00:14.880> one<00:00:15.179> was<00:00:15.389> in

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
apparently the other one was in

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.269 
apparently the other one was in
backwards<00:00:16.350> because<00:00:16.410> there's<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.680> positive<00:00:16.859> and

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
backwards because there's a positive and

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.580 
backwards because there's a positive and
a<00:00:17.340> negative<00:00:17.369> side<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.740> so<00:00:21.170> this<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
a negative side to it so this is the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.230 
a negative side to it so this is the
comparison<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:25.369> an<00:00:26.369> incandescent<00:00:26.760> bulb

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
comparison of an incandescent bulb

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.570 
comparison of an incandescent bulb
regular<00:00:27.990> bulb<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.800> used<00:00:29.189> by<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> way

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
regular bulb that is used by the way

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.860 
regular bulb that is used by the way
it's<00:00:29.699> not<00:00:29.880> brand<00:00:30.179> new<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.710> LED<00:00:32.099> bulb

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
it's not brand new and the LED bulb

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.150 
it's not brand new and the LED bulb
super-bright<00:00:33.870> now<00:00:34.590> I'm<00:00:34.710> going<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> put<00:00:35.040> them

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
super-bright now I'm going to put them

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:45.799 
super-bright now I'm going to put them
back<00:00:35.340> into<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> sockets<00:00:36.090> again<00:00:44.750> now<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
back into the sockets again now the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.580 
back into the sockets again now the
incandescent<00:00:46.260> bulb<00:00:46.760> came<00:00:47.760> out<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.120> my<00:00:48.590> youth

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
incandescent bulb came out of my youth

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.930 
incandescent bulb came out of my youth
on<00:00:49.940> time<00:00:50.940> now<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> only<00:00:51.780> ordered<00:00:52.110> four<00:00:52.350> bulbs

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
on time now I only ordered four bulbs

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.240 
on time now I only ordered four bulbs
two<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.180> each<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.449> cars<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.710> average<00:00:55.980> car

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
two for each of my cars the average car

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.560 
two for each of my cars the average car
actually<00:00:56.550> does<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.910> two<00:00:57.149> by<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.300> way<00:00:57.510> so

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
actually does have two by the way so

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:06.679 
actually does have two by the way so
it's<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.960> back<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:05.689> can

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
it's going to back up so you can

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.950 
it's going to back up so you can
actually<00:01:06.840> get<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.110> side-by-side<00:01:07.380> comparison

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:34.140 

-<00:01:25.470> I'm<00:01:26.470> getting<00:01:26.830> some<00:01:32.400> go<00:01:33.400> get<00:01:33.580> that<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.850> twist

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
- I'm getting some go get that and twist

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
- I'm getting some go get that and twist

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.570 

it's<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.320> much<00:01:58.500> hands<00:01:58.740> face<00:01:59.010> and<00:01:59.040> say<00:01:59.550> that's

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.670 

these<00:02:40.860> bulbs<00:02:41.130> are<00:02:41.430> fragile<00:02:42.000> by<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.209> way<00:02:42.680> be

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
these bulbs are fragile by the way be

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.600 
these bulbs are fragile by the way be
careful<00:02:43.980> with<00:02:44.100> them<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:47.190> can't<00:02:47.459> see

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
careful with them so that you can't see

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.699 
careful with them so that you can't see
the<00:02:47.730> actual<00:02:47.970> quality<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.600> super<00:02:48.840> great<00:02:49.170> on

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
the actual quality of it super great on

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.040 
the actual quality of it super great on
the<00:02:49.830> actual<00:02:50.130> license<00:02:50.550> plate<00:02:50.810> because<00:02:51.810> there's

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
the actual license plate because there's

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.229 
the actual license plate because there's
a<00:02:52.110> glare<00:02:52.380> with<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.650> camera<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.730> can<00:02:53.970> see

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
a glare with the camera but you can see

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.830 
a glare with the camera but you can see
the<00:02:54.989> white<00:02:55.170> bright<00:02:55.470> difference<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.660> here<00:02:57.660> in

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
the white bright difference and here in

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.870 
the white bright difference and here in
person<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:59.250> plate<00:02:59.459> looks<00:02:59.700> significantly

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
person the plate looks significantly

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.729 
person the plate looks significantly
brighter<00:03:00.570> on<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.840> left<00:03:01.110> than<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.410> does<00:03:01.560> on<00:03:01.590> the

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
brighter on the left than it does on the

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.560 
brighter on the left than it does on the
right<00:03:02.780> it's<00:03:03.780> significantly<00:03:04.440> more<00:03:04.980> readable

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
right it's significantly more readable

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.670 
right it's significantly more readable
so<00:03:06.570> anyway<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.810> wants<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.079> get<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.230> second<00:03:07.560> light

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
so anyway I wants to get a second light

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.000 
so anyway I wants to get a second light
in<00:03:07.890> there<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.340> should<00:03:08.400> look<00:03:09.030> pretty<00:03:09.269> good<00:03:09.450> so

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
in there it should look pretty good so

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.759 
in there it should look pretty good so
and<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:12.090> how<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.299> do<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:12.840> this<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.739> a

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
and that is how to do this this is a

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.329 
and that is how to do this this is a
2002<00:03:14.489> Chevy<00:03:14.790> Impala
