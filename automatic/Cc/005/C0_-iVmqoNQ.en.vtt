00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
though on the block is a steel so it

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.330 
though on the block is a steel so it
doesn't<00:00:54.300> really<00:00:54.420> erode<00:00:54.809> into<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.410> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
real light because the wire brush will

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.890 
real light because the wire brush will
take<00:01:02.160> out<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:05.270> aluminum<00:01:06.270> kind<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.479> where<00:01:06.630> camp

up<00:03:11.549> to<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.910> what<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:12.900> ended<00:03:13.230> up<00:03:13.350> doing<00:03:13.530> was

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
up to that what I ended up doing was

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.360 
up to that what I ended up doing was
feeding<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.060> belt<00:03:15.299> on<00:03:15.620> everything<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:17.130> very

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
feeding the belt on everything the very

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.170 
feeding the belt on everything the very
last<00:03:17.670> thing<00:03:18.329> that<00:03:18.359> I<00:03:18.750> put<00:03:19.079> it<00:03:19.200> on<00:03:19.850> as<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:20.910> tried<00:03:21.150> a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
last thing that I put it on as I tried a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.080 
last thing that I put it on as I tried a
couple<00:03:21.239> different<00:03:21.510> scenarios<00:03:22.489> was<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.730> left<00:03:23.910> it

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
couple different scenarios was I left it

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.490 
couple different scenarios was I left it
about<00:03:25.489> just<00:03:26.489> started<00:03:26.820> on<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.090> one<00:03:27.470> slid<00:03:28.470> out

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
about just started on this one slid out

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.900 
about just started on this one slid out
a<00:03:28.620> little<00:03:28.799> bit<00:03:28.920> on<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.070> one<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.459> worked<00:03:29.760> it

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
a little bit on this one and worked it

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.270 
a little bit on this one and worked it
around<00:03:30.180> this<00:03:30.810> pulley<00:03:31.079> right<00:03:31.350> here<00:03:31.650> finally

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
around this pulley right here finally

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.620 
around this pulley right here finally
got<00:03:32.400> up<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:32.760> over<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.060> then<00:03:33.180> just<00:03:33.450> kind<00:03:33.600> of

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
got up and over and then just kind of

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.530 
got up and over and then just kind of
kept<00:03:33.870> working<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:34.410> back<00:03:34.650> on<00:03:34.859> and<00:03:35.329> once<00:03:36.329> that

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
kept working it back on and once that

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.050 
kept working it back on and once that
was<00:03:36.660> on<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:38.130> probably<00:03:38.310> have<00:03:38.549> about<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.760> quarter

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
was on you probably have about a quarter

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.270 
was on you probably have about a quarter
inch<00:03:39.329> of<00:03:39.450> play<00:03:39.600> in<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.019> bail<00:03:40.200> something<00:03:41.160> like

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
inch of play in the bail something like

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.330 
inch of play in the bail something like
that<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.730> did<00:03:42.299> put<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.480> wrench<00:03:42.690> on<00:03:42.900> there<00:03:43.220> if<00:03:44.220> you

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
that I did put a wrench on there if you

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.220

want<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.609> move<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.150> play<00:03:45.450> back<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.930> forth<00:03:46.140> you

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
want to move the play back and forth you

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.979 
want to move the play back and forth you
know<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.560> you<00:03:47.100> got<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.370> little<00:03:47.549> bit<00:03:47.730> of<00:03:47.989> as

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
know you you got that little bit of as

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
yeah shock it's right here and this gas

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.729 
yeah shock it's right here and this gas
shock<00:04:08.069> has<00:04:08.730> two<00:04:09.000> bolts<00:04:09.300> on<00:04:09.390> it<00:04:09.510> that<00:04:10.319> in<00:04:10.530> turn

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
shock has two bolts on it that in turn

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.990 
shock has two bolts on it that in turn
pushes<00:04:11.459> up<00:04:11.790> this<00:04:12.860> tensioner<00:04:13.860> pulley<00:04:14.129> when

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
pushes up this tensioner pulley when

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.240 
pushes up this tensioner pulley when
you're<00:04:15.150> putting<00:04:15.330> this<00:04:15.480> back<00:04:15.720> on<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.290> actually

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
you're putting this back on I actually

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.219 
you're putting this back on I actually
end<00:04:17.579> up<00:04:17.639> wedging<00:04:18.180> something<00:04:18.540> up<00:04:18.720> in<00:04:18.989> between

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
end up wedging something up in between

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.170 
end up wedging something up in between
here<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:20.100> pair<00:04:20.280> of<00:04:20.370> needle-nosed<00:04:20.699> that<00:04:20.910> at<00:04:21.030> a

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
here the pair of needle-nosed that at a

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.460 
here the pair of needle-nosed that at a
problem<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:21.690> can<00:04:21.780> kind<00:04:21.959> of<00:04:21.989> keep<00:04:22.109> working

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
problem so you can kind of keep working

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.379 
problem so you can kind of keep working
in<00:04:22.590> get<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.280> up<00:04:23.370> as<00:04:23.490> far<00:04:23.669> as<00:04:23.699> you<00:04:23.850> can't<00:04:24.120> just<00:04:24.330> so

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
in get it up as far as you can't just so

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.000 
in get it up as far as you can't just so
you<00:04:24.449> can<00:04:24.540> get<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.720> two<00:04:24.870> bolts<00:04:25.169> started<00:04:25.320> but

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
you can get the two bolts started but

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.710 
you can get the two bolts started but
this<00:04:26.190> thing<00:04:26.430> feels<00:04:26.729> kind<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.180> mushy<00:04:27.360> when<00:04:27.600> you

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
this thing feels kind of mushy when you

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.990 
this thing feels kind of mushy when you
put<00:04:27.900> it<00:04:28.020> up<00:04:28.139> because<00:04:28.320> you're<00:04:28.790> fighting<00:04:29.790> a<00:04:29.850> lot

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
put it up because you're fighting a lot

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.270 
put it up because you're fighting a lot
of<00:04:30.180> pressure<00:04:30.389> so<00:04:31.229> when<00:04:31.590> you're<00:04:31.740> running<00:04:32.010> two

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
of pressure so when you're running two

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.310 
of pressure so when you're running two
screws<00:04:32.610> up<00:04:32.790> it<00:04:32.970> feels<00:04:33.180> like<00:04:33.479> you're<00:04:34.139> going<00:04:34.260> to

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
screws up it feels like you're going to

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.170 
screws up it feels like you're going to
crack<00:04:34.650> it<00:04:34.860> so<00:04:35.070> I<00:04:35.280> just<00:04:35.550> kept<00:04:35.760> going<00:04:36.000> back<00:04:36.030> and

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
crack it so I just kept going back and

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.940 
crack it so I just kept going back and
forth<00:04:36.570> with<00:04:36.750> them<00:04:36.900> a<00:04:36.930> little<00:04:37.139> bit<00:04:37.290> at<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.500> time<00:04:37.530> I

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
forth with them a little bit at a time I

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.500 
forth with them a little bit at a time I
actually<00:04:38.370> even<00:04:38.610> tapped<00:04:38.970> down<00:04:39.180> here<00:04:39.360> with<00:04:39.450> like

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
actually even tapped down here with like

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.330 
actually even tapped down here with like
a<00:04:39.600> rubber<00:04:39.780> mallet<00:04:40.050> just<00:04:40.320> because<00:04:40.979> it<00:04:41.100> doesn't

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
a rubber mallet just because it doesn't

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.370 
a rubber mallet just because it doesn't
pull<00:04:41.760> straight<00:04:42.270> up<00:04:42.450> because<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.960> two<00:04:43.169> bolts

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
pull straight up because the two bolts

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.020 
pull straight up because the two bolts
are<00:04:43.500> off-center<00:04:43.950> it's<00:04:44.310> not<00:04:44.400> like<00:04:44.520> ones<00:04:44.790> here

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
are off-center it's not like ones here

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.420 
are off-center it's not like ones here
and<00:04:45.180> ones<00:04:45.360> here<00:04:45.630> would<00:04:46.260> be<00:04:46.410> even<00:04:46.919> pull<00:04:47.190> it

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
and ones here would be even pull it

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.510 
and ones here would be even pull it
wants<00:04:48.419> a<00:04:48.510> rack<00:04:48.840> as<00:04:49.530> you're<00:04:49.740> doing<00:04:49.979> it<00:04:50.100> so<00:04:50.490> I

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
wants a rack as you're doing it so I

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.710 
wants a rack as you're doing it so I
just<00:04:50.669> kind<00:04:50.850> of<00:04:50.970> tapped<00:04:51.240> it<00:04:51.389> with<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.510> rubber

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
just kind of tapped it with a rubber

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.540 
just kind of tapped it with a rubber
hammer<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.260> kept<00:04:52.470> working<00:04:52.680> in<00:04:52.919> slowly<00:04:53.280> going

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
hammer and kept working in slowly going

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.990 
hammer and kept working in slowly going
up

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
up

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.730 
up
I<00:04:54.030> got<00:04:54.570> about<00:04:54.840> two-thirds<00:04:55.260> of<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.380> way<00:04:55.500> up<00:04:55.560> so

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
I got about two-thirds of the way up so

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.320 
I got about two-thirds of the way up so
it's<00:04:55.860> probably<00:04:56.100> about<00:04:56.280> 3/8<00:04:56.669> of<00:04:56.789> a<00:04:56.880> gap<00:04:57.120> here

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
it's probably about 3/8 of a gap here

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.969 
it's probably about 3/8 of a gap here
then<00:04:57.900> I<00:04:57.990> went<00:04:58.139> up<00:04:58.260> top<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.590> I<00:04:58.620> just<00:04:58.800> kind<00:04:58.919> of

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
then I went up top and I just kind of

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.680 
then I went up top and I just kind of
watched<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.520> going<00:05:00.030> back<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:00.300> forth<00:05:00.510> making

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
watched it going back and forth making

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.200 
watched it going back and forth making
sure<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:00.900> wasn't<00:05:01.169> finding<00:05:01.380> on<00:05:01.620> anything

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
sure I wasn't finding on anything

if<00:06:31.680> I<00:06:31.860> try<00:06:32.010> to<00:06:32.040> on<00:06:32.190> another<00:06:32.460> tooth<00:06:32.670> that<00:06:32.850> would

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
if I try to on another tooth that would

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.600 
if I try to on another tooth that would
be<00:06:33.000> way<00:06:33.150> past<00:06:33.180> that<00:06:34.100> we're<00:06:35.100> gonna<00:06:35.220> find<00:06:35.400> out

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
be way past that we're gonna find out

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.590 
be way past that we're gonna find out
aren't<00:06:35.640> we<00:06:36.950> all<00:06:37.950> right<00:06:38.100> so<00:06:38.580> that's<00:06:39.390> what<00:06:39.540> I

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
aren't we all right so that's what I

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.050 
aren't we all right so that's what I
have<00:06:39.750> on<00:06:39.900> that<00:06:40.230> set<00:06:40.620> up<00:06:40.740> I'm<00:06:41.550> not<00:06:41.700> going<00:06:41.850> to<00:06:41.940> try

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
have on that set up I'm not going to try

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.250 
have on that set up I'm not going to try
spinning<00:06:42.510> it<00:06:42.630> just<00:06:42.840> because<00:06:42.990> they<00:06:43.050> have<00:06:43.170> too

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
spinning it just because they have too

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.510 
spinning it just because they have too
much<00:06:43.380> stuff<00:06:43.620> hanging<00:06:43.830> around<00:06:44.130> I'm<00:06:44.250> just<00:06:44.400> going

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
much stuff hanging around I'm just going

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.280 
much stuff hanging around I'm just going
to<00:06:44.580> keep<00:06:44.730> assembling<00:06:45.210> it<00:06:45.330> together<00:06:45.600> until<00:06:46.140> I

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.290 
to keep assembling it together until I

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.590 
to keep assembling it together until I
have<00:06:46.670> pretty<00:06:47.670> much<00:06:47.760> everything<00:06:48.150> but<00:06:48.330> the

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
have pretty much everything but the

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.170 
have pretty much everything but the
cooling<00:06:49.020> the<00:06:49.560> cooling<00:06:49.590> stuff<00:06:50.460> on<00:06:50.640> it<00:06:50.820> you<00:06:51.120> know

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
cooling the cooling stuff on it you know

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.570 
cooling the cooling stuff on it you know
get<00:06:51.330> the<00:06:51.450> serpentine<00:06:51.870> belt<00:06:51.900> on<00:06:52.320> all<00:06:53.190> the<00:06:53.310> pumps

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
get the serpentine belt on all the pumps

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.390 
get the serpentine belt on all the pumps
and<00:06:53.670> everything<00:06:53.730> back<00:06:54.000> in<00:06:54.180> place<00:06:54.210> and

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
and everything back in place and

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.230 
and everything back in place and
hopefully<00:06:56.400> we'll<00:06:56.670> be<00:06:56.790> good<00:06:56.940> to<00:06:57.000> go

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
hopefully we'll be good to go

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.950 
hopefully we'll be good to go
I<00:06:57.920> might<00:06:58.920> actually<00:06:59.040> even<00:06:59.450> put<00:07:00.450> the<00:07:00.600> bottom

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
I might actually even put the bottom

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.810 
I might actually even put the bottom
section<00:07:01.170> together<00:07:01.410> and<00:07:01.830> spin<00:07:02.160> that<00:07:02.190> crank<00:07:02.610> one

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
section together and spin that crank one

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.280 
section together and spin that crank one
time<00:07:03.060> just<00:07:03.330> kind<00:07:03.480> of<00:07:03.540> make<00:07:03.660> sure<00:07:03.690> we're<00:07:04.050> okay

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
time just kind of make sure we're okay

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.120 
time just kind of make sure we're okay
with<00:07:05.130> those<00:07:05.220> marks<00:07:06.440> now<00:07:07.440> question<00:07:07.770> of<00:07:07.860> myself

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
with those marks now question of myself

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.960 
with those marks now question of myself
yeah<00:07:08.720> anyway<00:07:09.720> that's<00:07:10.380> where<00:07:10.500> we<00:07:10.620> are<00:07:10.710> yeah<00:07:11.130> I

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:11.970 
yeah anyway that's where we are yeah I

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.430 
yeah anyway that's where we are yeah I
probably<00:07:12.390> do<00:07:12.540> a<00:07:12.570> part<00:07:12.810> three<00:07:12.990> when<00:07:13.170> she's<00:07:13.320> all

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 
probably do a part three when she's all

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.170 
probably do a part three when she's all
together<00:07:13.620> and<00:07:14.010> go<00:07:14.730> from<00:07:14.880> there

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 
together and go from there

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.780 
together and go from there
