00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
about a week now and I had a little Hut

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.060 
about a week now and I had a little Hut
in<00:03:01.360> there<00:03:01.600> but<00:03:01.840> he<00:03:02.020> never<00:03:02.050> really<00:03:02.470> liked<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.860> I

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
in there but he never really liked it I

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.850 
in there but he never really liked it I
had<00:03:03.910> on<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.240> side<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.840> he<00:03:05.020> just<00:03:05.230> left<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.650> and

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
had on this side and he just left it and

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.060 
had on this side and he just left it and
didn't<00:03:06.730> care<00:03:06.850> for<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:08.380> when<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.650> took<00:03:08.740> that

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
didn't care for it so when I took that

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.920 
didn't care for it so when I took that
out<00:03:09.130> he<00:03:09.610> started<00:03:10.030> using<00:03:10.330> that<00:03:10.510> for<00:03:10.780> his

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
out he started using that for his

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.770 
out he started using that for his
designated<00:03:11.500> restroom<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:12.480> was<00:03:13.480> like<00:03:13.600> all<00:03:13.750> right

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780
