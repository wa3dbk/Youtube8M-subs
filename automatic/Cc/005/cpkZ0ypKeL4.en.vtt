00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.189
 online x the modern combat 4 online is 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.419
 that automatically files that I 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.150
 I'll leave you in the description of 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:29.780
 video you have to do the verification 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.580
 data through 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.800
 online or with wifi or through 3g 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.590
 eye experience as you will know the 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.150
 model 4 is in beta phase and then the 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.400
 updates that go for different 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.450
 devices the beta phase that works 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:51.180
 this works excellent in the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.250
 the xperia play obviously does not guide her 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.190
 if you guys will know suddenly it's the guide 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.020
 because for a ram theme and you have to 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.120
 have certain applications such as 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.840
 facebook that takes up about 30 mb 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.260
 of ram and stop her and with around 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.620
 140 friends the game is going to run you 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.140
 no problem 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.260
 all right 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.920
 the other clarified there are two possibility 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.760
 to be able to install this game online and 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.040
 offline online asks for you and checks 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.010
 license through radio no longer 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.140
 worry or get hot in the head 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.720
 I made this step through the mode 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.620
 online and it turned offline I did not 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:39.150
 it turned out there you vary how you want 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.150
 download them online offline 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.830
 well in the description of the video I'm going 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.250
 to leave that compressed in the archives 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.240
 of modern combat and apply a model 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.040
 combat four data 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.700
 the installation process is extremely 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.120
 Simple friends install the paticas of 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.510
 modern combat 4 anywhere 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.100
 of your sd card for example I do not the 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.770
 I have on a specific route I know 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.259
 I want to show 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.980
 I do not have it installed anywhere 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.470
 of the sd 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:22.060
 and here a model combat 4 appears 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.790
 and if I go to the android folder and then 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.340
 here it does not appear in the data files 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.620
 I apologize for moving both the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.090
 camera 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.090
 and we look for the folder 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.300
 we look for the folder 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.190
 that thousands 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:55.370
 and we press properties and I appear 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.370
 modern combat 4 1.86 gb people ok ok 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.609
 let's make the review fairly simple 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.540
 Apply online and online data that have 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:07.819
 to have yes or yes wifi or 3g enabled 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.530
 for verifying that if you 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:15.170
 they do it through without wifi or 3g no 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.860
 they will start the game and yes 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.400
 Clear 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:25.890
 the other and another review also important 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:28.530
 the data goes in the android data folder 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.350
 that yes follows the sequence yolis well 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.670
 first enter the scholarship through the 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.870
 I recommend that you use the computer 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.340
 I will do it through your phone 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.819
 but through the computer is something 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.250
 much easier because they are 2 GB are almost 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.680
 all gigabytes that have to copy already 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.660
 do through a computer and that's 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.450
 what I recommend and what is going 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.720
 to prove modern combat 4 apply 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.480
 first installation and then the data 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:00.220
 that looks to android data 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:03.340
 android data paste is online mode already 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.940
 then verify that they have the wifi 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:11.040
 and the data traffic activated 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.040
 again the ram of 140 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.280
 if also to free bite so that the 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.560
 game can run them pretty well and 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.130
 You will not be reading that's the catch 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.550
 I did through my phone so that 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.250
 see that they run look at me this game what 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.270
 Can use with 3g or without 3g after 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.270
 to install it 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:41.810
 let's open is fight 4 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.000
 I'm without wave nor 3g 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.500
 we wait rogue 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.870
 so follow the steps friends apply 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:57.180
 more data online via wifi and verification 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.780
 via 3g 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.199
 the pike can send you any part 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.199
 of lcd 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.820
 the votes android 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:13.670
 man 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:17.040
 data but still super simple 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.420
 it is used for the exterior but 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.870
 unfortunately when I have I do not know the 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.720
 I will be able to use it in the 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.200
 future coming 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:31.330
 that is running in these districts of 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.330
 everything is a term an abortion 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.560
 They will be your clients and sharing 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.920
 and if we remove 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Y 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:09.830
 they realize the music came to us with 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.830
 The iris 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:16.679
 so little friends manita life if 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:20.029
 you liked the video meditation worked 

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:20.029
 online verification 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:29.669
 the curious thing about 9.43 printing 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.669
 in an xperia and others 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.830
 look 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.650
 but no 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.820
 it's just that I arrived 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.720
 world 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:01.090
 if it's running full, so 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:04.090
 take advantage of losing the game of 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.090
 tell
