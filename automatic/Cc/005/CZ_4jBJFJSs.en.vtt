00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 tell us guys, how are you? 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.509
 extinguish in 4 to another test device 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.309
 water company of the Japanese company and all 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.969
 information about it you check now 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.340
 our review as well as m2 to with your 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.199
 older brother m4 also has water 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.270
 with a layer of glass in both the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.760
 front and rear of the smartphone 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.080
 but comparing the two devices we can 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.400
 to note some good differences 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.460
 significant 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.920
 the m4 alcohol was lighter with 136 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.470
 grams 149 grams compared to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.940
 previous generation and also a point 3 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.860
 thinner millimeters 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.630
 but the most interesting point in the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.790
 model is that it is clearly inspired 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.230
 on the xperia z line known as the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.730
 top of the line brand 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.670
 in addition it has features 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.710
 already recurring on Sony's smartphones 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.930
 power button found on the side 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.579
 device right is already a brand well 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.329
 recognized among the companions of the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.129
 company 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.930
 below it you will find your 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.690
 volume button 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.309
 for the camera as a device 5 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.070
 inches your positive economy 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.570
 regardless of the size of the hands 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.970
 but we are going to make a big difference 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.650
 model or m4 the account with certification 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.299
 ipv6 8 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.920
 translating this shows that he is 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.750
 resistant to dust when the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.030
 immersion in water up to one and a half meters 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.890
 depth for 30 minutes 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.350
 in our tests the device really 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.720
 went well but it 's a little detail when 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.090
 the m4 water is wet there is a loss 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.549
 significant difference in panel sensitivity 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.380
 it is not something permanent but really 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.630
 interferes during use 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.250
 therefore it is best to dry it before 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.650
 use it again 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.869
 as the line m according to sony entered the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.909
 devices considered as intermediaries 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.180
 the screen is one of the average aspects of the model 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.770
 to 5 inches with HD resolution are well 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.140
 with your teeth with what can be seen 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.119
 in the market so comfort and good 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.310
 viewing videos with some of the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.380
 virtues in our tests in our 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.659
 we sail for three hours by 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.390
 social networking news portals 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.399
 besides showing some videos at the moment 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.380
 somehow we had some kind of nuisance 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.360
 either with small characters or with 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.670
 videos and great quality 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.049
 so the m4 water also shows a 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.879
 school suitable for anyone who wants 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.450
 to enjoy various types of content 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.010
 the fully acceptable panel brightness 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.410
 to adjust it to the maximum to bring 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.150
 comfort to the user but in places 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.340
 you may have to 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.080
 slightly increase the brightness of the panel already 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.430
 that the image naturally asks for a little 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.349
 privacy 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.260
 another important point is the reflection of 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.209
 the xperia m4a when the device that 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.310
 more suffer from this defect though 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.900
 present some moments as well as all 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.190
 mainly with light source 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.870
 directly on the panel the m4 to 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.370
 which provides a practical hardware 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.720
 basically can supply any 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.750
 usage demand 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.360
 your snapdragon 615 processor that counts 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.930
 with two quad-core units being one with 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.700
 1.5 ghz and one with 1 ghz is able to 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.519
 basically run any application 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.530
 today with a 2 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.209
 gigabytes sony's smartphone gave 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.160
 fluidity to virtually all 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.799
 activities including the most 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.230
 heavy or real racing 3 for example not 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.480
 presented choking but revealed some 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.579
 common specialties the ability to 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.579
 Your gpu is not such a problem. 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.410
 a support so severe two chips one 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.280
 very positive feature in the scenario 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.260
 Brazilian 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.730
 the device also has 4 g 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.620
 bluetooth gps and nfc the possibility of 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.709
 memory expansion another good point 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.540
 positive in the model it is evident that the 16 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.370
 available gigabytes are not well 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.500
 sufficient when we have a device with 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.139
 beautiful potential to be explored 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.510
 sooner or later the native memory 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.130
 being insufficient so it is possible 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.980
 expand your storage quantity 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.130
 up to 128 gigabytes which is something 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.989
 extremely significant 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.850
 the sony as seen in some devices 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.950
 features very interesting features in the 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.930
 audiovisual sector, which increases the 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.690
 possibility of same level production 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.569
 amateur hdr for example is one of the 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.340
 tools available a mp4 water 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.019
 which produces very interesting photos in 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.420
 brightly lit environments 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.669
 differences between them in relation to 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.980
 videos analysis is pretty much the same 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.380
 the main camera with 3 megapixels 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.299
 capable of filming in full hd follows the line 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.970
 photographic and can meet demands 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.760
 the secondary with 5 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.070
 megapixel film on hd is more indicated 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.230
 for video calls 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.390
 according to the manufacturer 2,400 miles per 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.280
 would be able to 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.710
 give an approximate autonomy of two 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.350
 days following some usage patterns 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.060
 pre-established situations such as 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.010
 custom we also perform our 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.130
 battery default rating 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.570
 at the end of the period were 25 per cent 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.790
 is not a result 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.530
 awesome out of standards 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.770
 but considering that this is a good test 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.810
 demanding the m4 water had good performance 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.100
 the result a little distant from the 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.350
 two days promised by the company 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.540
 Japanese but with moderate use 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.740
 should last about a day and a half in 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.260
 fully functioning 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.910
 but this is very likely and if you 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.490
 Do you want to know how much this device costs? 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.800
 acc Bondfaro there you find the 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.600
 best deals from the best stores 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.240
 according to the evaluation of the 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.640
 analysis ebit of other users and 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.470
 An expert's assessment can be seen 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.630
 the price history to analyze if you are 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.760
 inexpensive can not also put a 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.530
 price alert when the product arrives 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.080
 in the amount you want to pay the bondfaro 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.700
 warns you and to make it even easier 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.470
 You can do all this straight into the 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.440
 smartphone or tablet with the app 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.630
 Thank you in pray for android. 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.380
 compare price up in store in front of 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.030
 salesman 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.590
 then the guy will never fool you anymore 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.910
 baixola that's pretty cool 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.550
 Good if you still have any questions. 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.600
