00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.580
 hello everyone hello and today I tell you 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.980
 I will tell about black clay more precisely about masks 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.529
 black clay black long tunic 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.840
 flax natural sorbent helping gently 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.510
 eliminate acne and clear oily 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.990
 and problem skin as well as get rid of 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.990
 dandruff 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.220
 Here is such a black clay today I will 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.220
 use and we will need to mix 2 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.770
 tablespoons of black clay with two 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.170
 tablespoons of warm boiled water 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.780
 that is, it is approximately one-to-one ratio 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.450
 one then needs everything carefully 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.360
 mix thoroughly and optionally 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.300
 add a few drops of tea oil 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.450
 tree now we are preparing a face mask 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.460
 and in preparation should not 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.800
 participate metal dishes or 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.580
 metal cutlery and i'm all 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.740
 do with a wooden spoon after 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.080
 how our dare stream was born such 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.170
 thick gruel we can put it on 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.450
 face I wear a thick thick layer 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.600
 especially on some problem areas 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.900
 skin avoiding of course the area around 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.130
 eye and focusing on the area 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.750
 nose cheeks and forehead 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.060
 the most important thing is not to give this mask 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.750
 dry when the clay starts to harden 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.740
 I will moisten my face with thermal water again 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.940
 leaving the mask for 10-15 minutes and then with 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.030
 using sponzhika 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.850
 starting to flush of course this is a process 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.510
 very laborious but trust me this 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.510
 worth it 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.110
 here so we successfully see or our mask 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.090
 now it remains to wash and sponzhik he 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.670
 always very dirty after use 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.800
 this mask all my sponges and brushes i 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.090
 I wash with antibacterial gel from 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.370
 one hundred beauty recipes 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.840
 I really like this gel, I even 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.840
 used it on face before 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.330
 it is now time for hair masks and for 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.400
 cooking hair masks for us 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.250
 need the same ingredients ie 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.050
 mix 2 tablespoons of clay with two 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.050
 tablespoons of warm water 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.370
 third ingredient added 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.470
 and this is egg yolk egg yolk we 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.390
 mix with clay with warm water 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.390
 and mix thoroughly 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.060
 put the resulting mixture 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.670
 only on the hair roots and on the scalp 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.260
 in order to cure dandruff if 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.520
 so there is and a little put out 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.520
 fatty roots 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.950
 Well , do not forget that in the shower clay 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.990
 can get on the tip and dry them a 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.790
 we don't need this so i put 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.790
 coconut oil on hair ends 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:49.410
 we wear a plastic cap and 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.670
 we leave our mask only for 20 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.860
 I will tell you honestly, I was very afraid 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.599
 how will this mask be washed off 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.540

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.599
 almost the first time I effect 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.370
 really liked the fat roots 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.650
 drank also this is a good replacement 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.750
 salt peeling in general, the effect to me 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.129
