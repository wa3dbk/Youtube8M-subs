00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
fibers that's kind of rough because

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.130 
fibers that's kind of rough because
you're<00:01:23.850> gonna<00:01:23.970> need<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.420> rub<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.990> that

compound into the watch so this compound
right<00:01:27.689> here<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.439> micro<00:01:28.890> abrasive<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.670> how

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
right here is a micro abrasive and how

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.450 
right here is a micro abrasive and how
it<00:01:30.210> works<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.600> actually<00:01:30.810> removes<00:01:31.470> very<00:01:32.040> very

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
it works is actually removes very very

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.730 
it works is actually removes very very
thin<00:01:32.880> layers<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.110> stainless<00:01:34.530> steel

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
thin layers of the stainless steel

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.429 
thin layers of the stainless steel
repolish<00:01:35.369> --is<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.850> removes<00:01:36.509> any<00:01:36.810> surface

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
repolish --is it and removes any surface

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.740 
repolish --is it and removes any surface
scratches<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.189> process<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> want
