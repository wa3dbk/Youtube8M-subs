00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:10.450
 Technology to make imagination a reality 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:15.599
 This reality more realistic than the actual unfolds before your eyes 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.599
 3d guide you to charm in cologne 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:24.279
 Hello Channel Haiti Im Jin Kyung is a reporter 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.540
 Program that moves between reality and virtual world . 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.860
 I'll see. 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:33.129
 Please put it on the scene. 4 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:38.410
 This technology you saw right now is a hologram. 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:43.840
 This hologram technology is used to project images projected on the floor at 15 degree angle 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:49.420
 It is the principle that the object looks in the air as it is reflected by the transparent film 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:54.879
 Minwook 3c Instructor Need glasses and special screen like 3d or 4d 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:57.760
 There is no limit to accounting and no new object. 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:02.350
 It can be a fire 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:08.170
 Hologram technology is blowing because they are made on the basis of the actual video 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:13.090
 It is possible to implement the same as actual hair until it shakes the collar of course . 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:18.310
 You can give a variety of effects to a stereoscopic image rather than a planar image. 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:22.659
 The disadvantage of not being restricted by young time and space is that hologram technology is popular 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:27.520
 I can say it's a good reason 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:30.159
 In this way, the hologram generated on the stage will be reflected on the transparent film 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:35.280
 It is made with reflection 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.280
 If so, where is the application of the hologram ? 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.740
 There is no need to mention the field where the elder g can be applied. 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.880
 It looks so different. 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.840
 The girl's age concert that I had seen recently yesterday is a hologram performance 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.289
 I have. 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.009
 From such concerts to musicals 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:58.119
 And what image the Hebrews then 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:02.829
 I'm available nationwide in several areas in the medical field 302 may burden 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:07.869
 If you say that hologram comes with it, it's next to our life. 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:10.740
 Daughter is always next to such as its life and we always go along with cell phone 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.760
 It will be a hologram. 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.070
 Girls' Generation in rebar performed holograms. 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:23.450
 July to grab the concert ramen 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.450
 It's a car feat Prada M. It's a concert for a hologram. 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:35.300
 Europe, America, Japan, etc. have a lot of interest in hologram technology. 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.300
 In Japan, we invest $ 4 billion in related technology 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.920
 Another technology that makes imagination a reality 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:48.390
 Aerial Car Stairway to the Sky or Auto 1 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.990
 I have exhibited a special wedge itself and how it does not move 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.130
 will be 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.450
 In situations where people are recognized as the same as the actual injury it to 1 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.510
 Let 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.050
 Such is our item 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:05.790
 Various new technologies are being developed. 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:10.050
 7 What do you need to be perfect to be perfect? 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:15.420
 The improvement time for opening flor p and then displaying it 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:21.180
 Since the two kinds of resolutions should be resolved before the nucleus is resolved when there 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.930
 Holography is a mole dish that is not addictive to automatically Perhaps we live in 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.930
 Would not 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.800
 Which is soon to imagine the reality and virtual reality, our side has already cracked rudder 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.660
 I have. 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:40.840
 Due to the development of hologram technology, we will continue to 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.840
 I look forward to expanding the future into infinite horizons. 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:51.159
 It's so colorful and fun. When did you get the model contrast ? 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.830
 I never saw any good side is really walking side is not good now distinguish fake 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:58.540
 It's a really realistic video. 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.920
 Hologram Reaction How did 4 Reactions seen idol and hologram 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.299
 fresh 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.159
 As the old song and the performance horse left more than nice this stage 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.090
 I was positive. 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:12.280
 4 I also plan to utilize hologram technology from the shoulder on stage. 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.229
 I found it. 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:22.210
 4 The artists will be to overcome the physical limitations can not meet the fans directly 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:26.530
 Before interventions can be considered as a countermeasure for example, in the hand as the music 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:30.880
 I think I'm leading the new it trend. 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.880
 Holograms have been combined with the performance of 4k pop singers and this one culture 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.760
 I showed the potential to be content. 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.270
 In addition, the government plans to intensively promote the content industry at the national level. 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:46.210
 I announced it. 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:48.520
 4 The progress of the contents industry promotion budget, which was only 0.2% of the budget, 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.570
 Is to expand to 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:56.740
 I can see my future prospects in the hologram content industry so bright 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:59.919
 Kookmin g 1 color'll simply show as well now so hot and Education 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.729
 I think the ad can be applied in various fields. 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.470
 So I think it's because of the child care that has been raising interest in the whole thing. 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.770
 How much is that? 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:13.630
 It looks like you're carrying a huge amount of four. 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:18.789
 4 Hologram technology is being studied and developed only in Korea and abroad 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:21.400
 In the case of Japan, a total of 4 billion hologram-related industries 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:26.620
 He said he would invest the dollar and buy it. 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:30.310
 4 We are working on a large-scale research project in Germany and the US 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:34.870
 4 In Korea, Korea Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:39.580
 He is also conducting holographic research in many places, including Kwangwoon University and Seoul National University. 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:43.900
 Why is there a reason why our country has a strong hardware but the content is weak? 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:47.020
 2 Holograms become the catalyst for the development of the domestic contents industry. 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.500
 I think it's going to be a four-year-old florist. 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.500
 Really just ah 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.560
 4 imseyoung reporter saw good news right now 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.560
 Yes
