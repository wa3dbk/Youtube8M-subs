00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.850
 well now do not teach how to poop 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.799
 in the form of pyramid this is very useful 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.480
 when they have to start some work 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:19.449
 at school 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.449
 etc first we double this part here 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.450
 so that we have a cross can 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.450
 throwing scissors 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.460
 a rule like me 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.420
 well here it's already after it's not going to 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.840
 stay like this 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.630
 then comes this part of here until the 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.710
 another extreme 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.780
 and 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:57.449
 and then they open it as they give a cross 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.449
 and I'm going to put my finger here 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.100
 without opposing thus until here 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:15.500
 it's not going to look like a square like that 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:19.310
 he is very father nothing else the bar of this 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.780
 extreme you put it on this side and so you 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.780
 you also go to the back 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.210
 it's a very simple step but used 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.439
 in my classes and it has worked for me 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.439
 good to deliver jobs 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.350
 and then they're going to open this part like this 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.020
 within the four sides that we did 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.020
 right now 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.200
 so that in the end they stay like this 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:06.450
 although there was no more for us the 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.450
 part of the center so open them close 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.039
 we have this and back too 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.650
 so they do not lower us down every part of 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.650
 these 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:32.440
 we open it down we go down to stay something 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.440
 A) Yes 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.950
 Let's see 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.750
 to 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.380
 me to stay a beautiful paper house 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:51.170
 to be able to put they have art or you can 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:54.550
 click on color and so on decorate 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.740
 this is going to be very father 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.510
 and it's very useful, thanks for watching this 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.950
 video I hope you like many 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.950
