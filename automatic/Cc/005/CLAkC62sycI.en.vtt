two cars are within the same category
should<00:00:10.440> be<00:00:10.559> interesting<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:10.950> see<00:00:11.130> which<00:00:11.309> one

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
should be interesting to see which one

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.039 
should be interesting to see which one
actually<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:12.269> better<00:00:12.540> than<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.780> two<00:00:12.929> now

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
actually is better than the two now

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
slap the hell about how the lack of

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.609 
slap the hell about how the lack of
black<00:00:21.150> button<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.570> let's<00:00:22.050> get<00:00:22.109> right<00:00:22.289> into<00:00:22.350> it

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
black button and let's get right into it

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.859 
black button and let's get right into it
with<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.820> drifting<00:00:24.240> start<00:00:24.510> off<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
with the drifting start off with the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.750 
with the drifting start off with the
Rowena<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> roman<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.250> fact<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.609> what

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
Rowena that a roman in fact is what

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.730 
Rowena that a roman in fact is what
enlighted<00:00:27.210> then<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.480> Phoenix<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.590> feel

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
enlighted then the Phoenix and I feel

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.169 
enlighted then the Phoenix and I feel
like<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.010> distance<00:00:29.340> covered<00:00:29.519> when<00:00:29.789> drifting

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
like the distance covered when drifting

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.640 
like the distance covered when drifting
as<00:00:30.330> much<00:00:30.510> greater<00:00:30.779> comparing<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
as much greater comparing it to the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.930 
as much greater comparing it to the
Phoenix<00:00:31.980> Phoenix<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.430> slightly<00:00:32.610> heavier<00:00:32.759> of

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
Phoenix Phoenix is slightly heavier of

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.000 
Phoenix Phoenix is slightly heavier of
course<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.390> without<00:00:34.380> being<00:00:34.530> said<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.920> much

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
course and without being said it's much

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.130 
course and without being said it's much
easier<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.760> drift<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.719> Rowena

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
easier to drift with the Rowena

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.479 
easier to drift with the Rowena
competitor<00:00:37.590> Felix<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.950> definitely<00:00:38.280> feel<00:00:38.370> like

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
competitor Felix I definitely feel like

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.869 
competitor Felix I definitely feel like
the<00:00:38.670> point<00:00:38.879> deserves<00:00:39.390> or<00:00:39.690> goes<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.950> ruiner

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
the point deserves or goes to the ruiner

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.479 
the point deserves or goes to the ruiner
now<00:00:42.510> if<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.200> Phoenix<00:00:43.500> here<00:00:43.710> it's

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
now if you can see the Phoenix here it's

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.130 
now if you can see the Phoenix here it's
kind<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> struggle<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.239> do<00:00:45.360> simple<00:00:45.750> drifting

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
kind of a struggle to do simple drifting

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.290 
kind of a struggle to do simple drifting
around<00:00:46.260> corners<00:00:46.710> even<00:00:46.950> at<00:00:47.070> high<00:00:47.219> speeds<00:00:47.550> feel

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
around corners even at high speeds feel

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.700 
around corners even at high speeds feel
like<00:00:48.420> there's<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.809> lot<00:00:48.960> more<00:00:49.079> effort<00:00:49.200> required

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
like there's a lot more effort required

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.470 
like there's a lot more effort required
to<00:00:50.280> drift<00:00:50.489> along<00:00:50.610> corners<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.270> cars

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
to drift along corners with this cars

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.900 
to drift along corners with this cars
its<00:00:51.809> sight<00:00:52.079> heavier<00:00:52.489> this<00:00:53.489> may<00:00:53.610> not<00:00:53.760> be<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
its sight heavier this may not be the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.490 
its sight heavier this may not be the
case<00:00:54.149> if<00:00:54.329> we<00:00:54.390> were<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.629> add<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> spoiler<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.260> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
case if we were to add a spoiler on to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.720 
case if we were to add a spoiler on to
it<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> huge<00:00:56.070> spoiler<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.579> get

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it you know a huge spoiler that you get

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.060 
it you know a huge spoiler that you get
with<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:56.910> car<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> saw<00:00:58.379> makes<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.800> easier

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
with this car that a saw makes it easier

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.369 
with this car that a saw makes it easier
to<00:00:59.100> drift<00:00:59.430> but<00:01:00.090> when<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.570> these<00:01:00.719> two<00:01:01.020> cars

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
to drift but when we have these two cars

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.990 
to drift but when we have these two cars
and<00:01:01.620> stock<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.309> do<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.760> previous

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
and stock like we do for the previous

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.520 
and stock like we do for the previous
episodes<00:01:03.329> we<00:01:03.809> could<00:01:03.840> see<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.379> much

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
episodes we could see that it's much

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.440 
episodes we could see that it's much
more<00:01:04.739> difficult<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.309> actually<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.700> drift<00:01:06.090> with

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
more difficult to actually a drift with

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.050 
more difficult to actually a drift with
the<00:01:06.570> Phoenix<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.080> yes<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> head<00:01:08.820> link

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the Phoenix so yes so for the head link

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.429 
the Phoenix so yes so for the head link
we've<00:01:09.210> got<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> room<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.930> hairs<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.290> know

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
we've got the room in the hairs we know

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.410 
we've got the room in the hairs we know
pretty<00:01:10.890> good<00:01:10.979> at<00:01:11.159> drifting<00:01:11.520> however<00:01:11.909> when<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
pretty good at drifting however when a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.940 
pretty good at drifting however when a
car<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.780> good<00:01:12.900> at<00:01:12.990> drifting<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.860> be

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
car is good at drifting they can be

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.770 
car is good at drifting they can be
pretty<00:01:14.100> poor<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.460> handling<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.030> what<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.570> feel

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
pretty poor at handling so what it feel

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.200 
pretty poor at handling so what it feel
exactly<00:01:16.020> deserves<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> point<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:17.210> because

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
exactly deserves the point here because

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.910 
exactly deserves the point here because
I<00:01:18.330> think<00:01:18.450> about<00:01:18.570> handling<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.770> want

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
I think about handling is that you want

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.990 
I think about handling is that you want
to<00:01:19.979> try<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.189> make<00:01:20.280> sure<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.490> call<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> lose

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
to try and make sure you call as a lose

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.240 
to try and make sure you call as a lose
control<00:01:21.450> at<00:01:21.659> very<00:01:22.170> high<00:01:22.229> speeds<00:01:22.619> around<00:01:22.979> sharp

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
control at very high speeds around sharp

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.740 
control at very high speeds around sharp
corners<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.790> wanna<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.420> know<00:01:24.450> take

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
corners if you wanna you know take

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.510 
corners if you wanna you know take
advantage<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.530> someone<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.100> race<00:01:26.250> or

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
advantage of someone in a race or

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.160 
advantage of someone in a race or
whatever<00:01:26.700> right<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.750> comes<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.049> this

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
whatever right and when it comes to this

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.569 
whatever right and when it comes to this
situation<00:01:28.409> here<00:01:28.950> amongst<00:01:29.159> both<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:29.490> these

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
situation here amongst both for these

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.249 
situation here amongst both for these
cars<00:01:29.850> Phoenix<00:01:30.270> definitely<00:01:30.630> deserves<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.049> point

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
cars Phoenix definitely deserves a point

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:31.730 
cars Phoenix definitely deserves a point
for<00:01:31.409> that

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
for that

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.469 
for that
it's<00:01:32.460> pretty<00:01:32.610> easy<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> happen<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.450> uh

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
it's pretty easy to happen it but uh

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.300 
it's pretty easy to happen it but uh
other<00:01:34.290> than<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.740> know<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:35.130> that

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
other than that you know it's not that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.710 
other than that you know it's not that
great<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.700> drifting<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.270> most<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.630> no

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
great for a drifting or what most be no

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.350 
great for a drifting or what most be no
butter<00:01:37.020> yeah<00:01:37.710> definitely<00:01:38.400> definitely<00:01:39.030> for

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
butter yeah definitely definitely for

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.440 
butter yeah definitely definitely for
handling<00:01:39.829> it's<00:01:40.829> pretty<00:01:41.009> comfortable<00:01:41.329> to<00:01:42.329> make

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
handling it's pretty comfortable to make

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
handling it's pretty comfortable to make
sure<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.689> don't<00:01:42.750> spin<00:01:42.990> out<00:01:43.079> or<00:01:43.200> whatnot<00:01:43.320> but

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
sure you don't spin out or whatnot but

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.710 
sure you don't spin out or whatnot but
for<00:01:43.770> sure<00:01:43.950> off<00:01:44.100> shotgun<00:01:44.549> durability<00:01:45.479> test

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
for sure off shotgun durability test

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.300 
for sure off shotgun durability test
turned<00:01:45.930> out<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.350> took<00:01:46.560> 19<00:01:46.950> stretch<00:01:47.189> I

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
turned out that this took 19 stretch I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.039 
turned out that this took 19 stretch I
did<00:01:47.460> already<00:01:47.610> want<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.210> show<00:01:48.509> an<00:01:48.659> entire

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
did already want to show an entire

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.300 
did already want to show an entire
village<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.680> it'll<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.890> pretty<00:01:49.979> boring

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
village but it'll be pretty boring

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.819 
village but it'll be pretty boring
better<00:01:50.549> they're<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.390> Phoenix<00:01:51.689> took<00:01:52.439> 15

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
better they're like the Phoenix took 15

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.289 
better they're like the Phoenix took 15
shots<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.399> they're<00:01:53.549> gonna<00:01:53.700> got<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> point<00:01:54.149> there

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
shots so they're gonna got a point there

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.910 
shots so they're gonna got a point there
so<00:01:54.450> call<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> 2-1<00:01:55.020> from<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.259> ruiner<00:01:55.590> but

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
so call it a 2-1 from the ruiner but

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.200 
so call it a 2-1 from the ruiner but
it's<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.159> over<00:01:56.399> yet<00:01:56.549> cuz<00:01:56.790> good<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> head-on

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
it's not over yet cuz good a head-on

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.030 
it's not over yet cuz good a head-on
collision<00:01:57.420> damage<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.770> one<00:01:58.950> is

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
collision damage and this one is

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.100 
collision damage and this one is
interesting<00:01:59.280> turned<00:01:59.790> up<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.240> time<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
interesting turned up that time the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.840 
interesting turned up that time the
camera<00:02:01.380> angle<00:02:01.619> here<00:02:01.890> looked<00:02:02.460> at<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> figures

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
camera angle here looked at a figures

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.609 
camera angle here looked at a figures
took<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.030> lot<00:02:03.149> more<00:02:03.270> damage<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:03.780> Rowena<00:02:04.469> took

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
took a lot more damage but Rowena took

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.770 
took a lot more damage but Rowena took
way<00:02:04.829> more<00:02:05.040> damage<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.520> see<00:02:05.670> there<00:02:05.850> with

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
way more damage you can see there with

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.359 
way more damage you can see there with
everything<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:07.439> all<00:02:07.649> over<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.950> place<00:02:08.160> so

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
everything now all over the place so

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.499 
everything now all over the place so
calmly<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.060> before<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.360> best

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
calmly to to before the best

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.089 
calmly to to before the best
customization<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.289> was<00:02:10.410> pretty<00:02:10.560> close<00:02:10.830> i<00:02:11.039> to

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
customization this was pretty close i to

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.670 
customization this was pretty close i to
look<00:02:11.730> very<00:02:11.790> closely<00:02:12.239> at<00:02:12.450> every<00:02:12.720> single

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
look very closely at every single

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.429 
look very closely at every single
aspect<00:02:14.219> of<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.549> customization<00:02:15.269> I<00:02:15.810> first

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
aspect of this customization I first

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.539 
aspect of this customization I first
thought<00:02:16.680> was<00:02:16.799> going<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.129> ruin<00:02:17.340> up<00:02:17.430> but

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
thought was going to be the ruin up but

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.280 
thought was going to be the ruin up but
then<00:02:17.700> looking<00:02:18.209> closely<00:02:18.510> there's<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.930> lot<00:02:19.140> more

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
then looking closely there's a lot more

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.709 
then looking closely there's a lot more
options<00:02:19.409> for<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:20.069> Phoenix<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.480> glass

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
options for the Phoenix with a glass

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.259 
options for the Phoenix with a glass
roof<00:02:22.049> you<00:02:22.290> know<00:02:22.319> from<00:02:23.189> this<00:02:23.400> man<00:02:23.730> bumpers

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.369 
engine change in front of whatever and
turns<00:02:26.879> out<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.390> know<00:02:27.480> Phoenix<00:02:27.870> ER<00:02:28.079> gets<00:02:28.319> a

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
turns out you know Phoenix ER gets a

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.990 
turns out you know Phoenix ER gets a
point<00:02:28.590> there<00:02:28.769> but<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.340> ruin<00:02:29.609> a<00:02:29.670> ruiner

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
point there but the ruin a ruiner

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.119 
point there but the ruin a ruiner
doesn't<00:02:30.269> have<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:31.439> know<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.560> little<00:02:31.859> it

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
doesn't have you know a little it

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.289 
doesn't have you know a little it
doesn't<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.549> some<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.849> things<00:02:32.879> that<00:02:33.239> the

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
doesn't have some of the things that the

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.449 
doesn't have some of the things that the
Phoenix<00:02:33.510> has<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.139> but<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.620> forces<00:02:34.920> car<00:02:35.159> this

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
Phoenix has but but the forces car this

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.949 
Phoenix has but but the forces car this
is<00:02:35.639> another<00:02:35.849> thing<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.209> was<00:02:36.269> kind<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.510> surprised

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
is another thing I was kind of surprised

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.869 
is another thing I was kind of surprised
off<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.829> Dooleys<00:02:38.099> test<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.549> did<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.760> couple

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
off the Dooleys test that did a couple

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.059 
off the Dooleys test that did a couple
times<00:02:39.269> so<00:02:39.959> now<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.379> actually<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.859> same

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
times so now it is actually the same

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.979 
times so now it is actually the same
every<00:02:41.370> time<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:42.180> at<00:02:42.269> first<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.659> know<00:02:42.780> look

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
every time so at first you know look

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.020 
every time so at first you know look
like<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.379> Phoenix<00:02:43.739> in<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.010> road<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.909> were

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
like the Phoenix in the road I were

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.220 
like the Phoenix in the road I were
pretty<00:02:45.150> close<00:02:45.359> to<00:02:45.510> each<00:02:45.629> other<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.019> then

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
pretty close to each other but then

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.800 
pretty close to each other but then
they'll<00:02:46.739> ruin<00:02:47.069> I<00:02:47.250> just<00:02:47.489> took<00:02:47.760> off<00:02:48.090> then<00:02:48.569> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
they'll ruin I just took off then the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.479 
they'll ruin I just took off then the
Phoenix<00:02:49.109> just<00:02:49.409> did<00:02:49.590> not<00:02:49.709> catch<00:02:49.919> up<00:02:50.129> you<00:02:50.370> know

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
Phoenix just did not catch up you know

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.699 
Phoenix just did not catch up you know
the<00:02:51.120> Verona<00:02:51.389> just<00:02:51.569> kept<00:02:51.750> going<00:02:52.109> and<00:02:52.200> going<00:02:52.290> in

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
the Verona just kept going and going in

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.280 
the Verona just kept going and going in
the<00:02:53.220> gap<00:02:53.400> increased<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:54.030> this<00:02:54.120> happened<00:02:54.540> for

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
the gap increased and this happened for

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.259 
the gap increased and this happened for
the<00:02:55.500> two<00:02:55.950> tests<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.549> did<00:02:56.639> for<00:02:56.819> this<00:02:56.939> and

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
the two tests that we did for this and

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.140 
the two tests that we did for this and
yeah<00:02:58.139> this<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.379> one<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.530> them<00:02:58.739> turns<00:02:59.669> out<00:02:59.819> the

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
yeah this is one of them turns out the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.059 
yeah this is one of them turns out the
very<00:03:00.389> nice<00:03:00.569> fast<00:03:00.840> though<00:03:01.079> we're<00:03:01.439> gonna<00:03:01.650> fill

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
very nice fast though we're gonna fill

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.339 
very nice fast though we're gonna fill
the<00:03:02.250> crash<00:03:02.489> but<00:03:02.730> currently<00:03:03.510> three<00:03:03.750> three<00:03:04.049> look

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
the crash but currently three three look

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.740 
the crash but currently three three look
at<00:03:04.439> close<00:03:04.709> pretense<00:03:05.280> for<00:03:05.609> ski<00:03:06.180> acceleration

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
at close pretense for ski acceleration

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.429 
at close pretense for ski acceleration
test<00:03:07.069> turns<00:03:08.069> out<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.719> bleed<00:03:09.719> the<00:03:09.810> ruiner<00:03:10.139> took

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
test turns out I bleed the ruiner took

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.129 
test turns out I bleed the ruiner took
around<00:03:10.709> eight<00:03:11.700> nine<00:03:12.060> ten<00:03:12.480> let<00:03:12.780> us<00:03:12.900> see<00:03:13.019> how

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
around eight nine ten let us see how

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.349 
around eight nine ten let us see how
much<00:03:13.230> yep<00:03:13.769> eight<00:03:13.980> nine<00:03:14.340> nine<00:03:14.579> point<00:03:15.000> one<00:03:15.030> five

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
much yep eight nine nine point one five

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.449 
much yep eight nine nine point one five
nine<00:03:15.419> point<00:03:15.810> one<00:03:15.840> five<00:03:16.049> seconds<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:17.129> let's<00:03:17.370> see

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
nine point one five seconds so let's see

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.199 
nine point one five seconds so let's see
how<00:03:17.549> long<00:03:17.669> the<00:03:18.680> V<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:20.069> takes<00:03:20.310> for<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.699> Phoenix

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
how long the V it takes for the Phoenix

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.390 
how long the V it takes for the Phoenix
not<00:03:21.419> a<00:03:21.479> Phoenix<00:03:21.919> you<00:03:22.919> know<00:03:22.979> should<00:03:23.190> be<00:03:23.250> around

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
not a Phoenix you know should be around

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.059 
not a Phoenix you know should be around
the<00:03:23.549> same<00:03:23.819> but<00:03:24.209> uh<00:03:24.560> looks<00:03:25.560> like<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.949> was

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
the same but uh looks like it was

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.670 
the same but uh looks like it was
slightly<00:03:26.310> slower<00:03:26.669> about<00:03:27.329> what<00:03:27.900> ten<00:03:28.260> point<00:03:28.530> o2

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
slightly slower about what ten point o2

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.159 
slightly slower about what ten point o2
so<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.970> was<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.120> huge<00:03:30.269> difference<00:03:30.720> but<00:03:30.930> for<00:03:31.079> us

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
so that was a huge difference but for us

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.960 
so that was a huge difference but for us
a<00:03:31.229> break<00:03:31.379> time<00:03:31.620> one<00:03:31.769> point<00:03:31.979> one<00:03:32.069> seven<00:03:32.250> for<00:03:32.909> the

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
a break time one point one seven for the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.270 
a break time one point one seven for the
Rowena<00:03:33.269> turns<00:03:33.720> out<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.139> was<00:03:34.260> exactly<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:35.040> same

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
Rowena turns out it was exactly the same

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.339 
Rowena turns out it was exactly the same
for<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.579> Phoenix<00:03:35.939> as<00:03:36.030> well<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:37.079> ruler

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
for the Phoenix as well so the ruler

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.379 
for the Phoenix as well so the ruler
takes<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.769> by<00:03:37.919> a<00:03:37.949> point<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.060> turns<00:03:39.269> out

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
takes it by a point so it turns out

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:40.670 
takes it by a point so it turns out
throwing<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.840> ten<00:03:40.019> out<00:03:40.139> of<00:03:40.169> ten<00:03:40.379> and<00:03:40.590> the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
throwing a ten out of ten and the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.050 
throwing a ten out of ten and the
Phoenix<00:03:40.919> and<00:03:41.069> that<00:03:41.159> are<00:03:41.310> ten<00:03:41.579> so<00:03:41.790> let<00:03:41.909> me<00:03:41.970> know

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
Phoenix and that are ten so let me know

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.069 
Phoenix and that are ten so let me know

opinion<00:03:46.949> because<00:03:47.159> I<00:03:47.250> thought<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.549> Phoenix

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
opinion because I thought the Phoenix

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.309 
opinion because I thought the Phoenix
would<00:03:47.939> win<00:03:48.150> but<00:03:48.359> turns<00:03:48.629> out<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.900> ruin<00:03:49.109> it<00:03:49.199> did

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
would win but turns out the ruin it did

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.990
