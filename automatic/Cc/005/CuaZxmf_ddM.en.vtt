tutorial on how i record my guitars
first<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.950> all<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.550> need<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.790> tube<00:00:12.150> amplifier

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
first of all you need a tube amplifier

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.829 
first of all you need a tube amplifier
with<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> serial<00:00:13.590> effects<00:00:14.009> loop<00:00:14.570> make<00:00:15.570> sure

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
with a serial effects loop make sure

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.260 
with a serial effects loop make sure
your<00:00:16.020> power<00:00:16.260> cable<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.980> always<00:00:17.340> connected<00:00:17.699> do

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
your power cable is always connected do

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.390 
your power cable is always connected do
not<00:00:18.510> remove<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.050> for<00:00:19.260> any<00:00:19.439> reason<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.130> will

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
not remove it for any reason it will

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.570 
not remove it for any reason it will
destroy<00:00:20.820> your<00:00:21.000> output<00:00:21.449> transformer<00:00:22.580> let's

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
destroy your output transformer let's

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.779 
destroy your output transformer let's
get<00:00:23.939> started<00:00:24.359> with<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.660> tutorial<00:00:25.760> place<00:00:26.760> a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
get started with the tutorial place a

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.550 
get started with the tutorial place a
cable<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> send<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.050> your<00:00:28.230> effects<00:00:28.590> loop

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
cable in the send of your effects loop

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.260 
cable in the send of your effects loop
then<00:00:31.560> connect<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> input<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:33.149> your

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
then connect it to the input of your

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.830 
then connect it to the input of your
audio<00:00:33.690> card<00:00:37.760> crank<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> amplifier<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
audio card crank the amplifier so the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.840 
audio card crank the amplifier so the
signal<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.350> strong<00:00:40.469> enough<00:00:43.160> now<00:00:44.160> connect

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
signal is strong enough now connect

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.760 
signal is strong enough now connect
another<00:00:45.210> cable<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> return<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.469> your

another cable in the return of your
effects<00:00:47.129> loop<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.850> will<00:00:47.910> work<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> silencer

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
effects loop it will work as a silencer

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.889

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
description of this video now you will

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.179 
description of this video now you will
need<00:01:35.939> impulses<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.720> use<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.650> lead<00:01:37.799> where<00:01:38.070> is

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
need impulses I use the lead where is

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.520 
need impulses I use the lead where is
this<00:01:38.340> big<00:01:38.610> box<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.689> bit<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.990> cash<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
this big box it's a bit of cash but I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.050 
this big box it's a bit of cash but I
think<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.579> best<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.000> most

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
think this are the best and most

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.350 
think this are the best and most
accurate<00:01:42.509> impulses<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.380> will<00:01:43.619> ever<00:01:43.890> find<00:01:44.360> now

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
accurate impulses you will ever find now

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.840 
accurate impulses you will ever find now
let's<00:01:45.659> load<00:01:45.840> some<00:01:45.899> Mesa<00:01:46.439> rectifier<00:01:47.189> impulses

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
let's load some Mesa rectifier impulses

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.910 
let's load some Mesa rectifier impulses
as<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.600> see<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.439> mix<00:01:49.710> several

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
as you can see you can mix several

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.069 
as you can see you can mix several
impulses<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> real<00:01:51.450> multiple<00:01:51.930> my

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
impulses just like a real multiple my

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.440 
impulses just like a real multiple my
confirmation<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:53.399> may<00:01:53.640> want<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.000> tweak<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
confirmation you may want to tweak the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.840 
confirmation you may want to tweak the
EQ<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.170> amplifier<00:01:55.710> as<00:01:55.920> well<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.490> find<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
EQ of the amplifier as well to find the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.020 
EQ of the amplifier as well to find the
best<00:01:57.090> tone<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:58.439> also<00:01:58.590> add<00:01:58.950> VST<00:01:59.670> effects

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
best tone you can also add VST effects

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.929 
best tone you can also add VST effects
like<00:02:00.329> delay<00:02:00.930> reverb<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.460> who<00:02:02.820> are

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
like delay reverb and so on who are

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.510 
like delay reverb and so on who are
maybe<00:02:03.119> some<00:02:03.479> extra<00:02:03.659> EQ<00:02:04.380> or<00:02:04.409> compression<00:02:04.950> it's

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
maybe some extra EQ or compression it's

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.929 
maybe some extra EQ or compression it's
up<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.939> you

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
up to you

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:41.260 
up to you
let's<00:02:07.869> see<00:02:08.170> how<00:02:08.289> this<00:02:08.440> sounds<00:02:08.769> like

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.400

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
and here it is a quick tutorial on how

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.490 
and here it is a quick tutorial on how
