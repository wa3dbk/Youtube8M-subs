them along the way

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.699 
them along the way
but<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.959> doesn't<00:02:39.290> leave<00:02:39.820> much<00:02:40.820> of<00:02:40.880> an<00:02:41.150> impact

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
little bit more you know what I mean

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.860 
little bit more you know what I mean
because<00:03:17.620> seasons<00:03:18.620> three<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:18.950> five<00:03:19.190> yeah<00:03:20.090> those

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
because seasons three to five yeah those

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.120 
because seasons three to five yeah those
happen<00:03:21.530> season<00:03:22.519> one<00:03:22.820> hat<00:03:23.060> one<00:03:23.330> but<00:03:24.260> season<00:03:24.890> two

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
happen season one hat one but season two

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.220 
happen season one hat one but season two
is<00:03:25.340> kind<00:03:25.519> of<00:03:25.670> lackluster<00:03:26.080> unfortunately<00:03:27.080> in

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
is kind of lackluster unfortunately in

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.979 
is kind of lackluster unfortunately in
because<00:03:27.680> it's<00:03:27.980> probably<00:03:28.160> due<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.720> very

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
because it's probably due to that very

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.400 
because it's probably due to that very
first<00:03:30.519> cancellation<00:03:31.519> by<00:03:31.670> NBC<00:03:32.269> I<00:03:32.480> have<00:03:33.170> no

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
first cancellation by NBC I have no

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.789 
first cancellation by NBC I have no
doubt<00:03:33.680> I<00:03:33.980> have<00:03:34.940> no<00:03:35.269> doubt<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.750> was<00:03:35.840> like<00:03:35.989> a<00:03:36.200> year

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
doubt I have no doubt it was like a year

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.030 
doubt I have no doubt it was like a year
later<00:03:37.489> that<00:03:37.760> they<00:03:38.330> brought<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.690> show<00:03:38.840> back<00:03:39.080> so

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
later that they brought the show back so

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.860 
later that they brought the show back so
being<00:03:40.430> off<00:03:40.610> air<00:03:40.940> for<00:03:41.090> like<00:03:41.209> almost<00:03:41.450> a<00:03:41.600> year<00:03:41.630> I

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
being off air for like almost a year I

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.310 
being off air for like almost a year I
believe<00:03:42.459> yeah<00:03:43.459> that's<00:03:43.730> kind<00:03:43.940> of<00:03:44.000> rough<00:03:44.290> when<00:03:45.290> I

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
believe yeah that's kind of rough when I

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.560 
believe yeah that's kind of rough when I
very<00:03:45.530> when<00:03:45.829> I<00:03:45.890> heard<00:03:46.190> TNT<00:03:46.670> bought<00:03:46.940> Southland<00:03:47.480> I

very when I heard TNT bought Southland I

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.720 
very when I heard TNT bought Southland I
