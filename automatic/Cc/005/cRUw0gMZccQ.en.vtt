00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.700 

all<00:02:05.290> around<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.830> outside<00:02:06.370> it's<00:02:07.180> going<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.420> be

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
all around the outside it's going to be

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.360 
all around the outside it's going to be
like<00:02:08.710> this<00:02:09.009> is<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.880> too<00:02:10.390> many<00:02:10.540> that's<00:02:10.869> too<00:02:11.020> many

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
like this is it too many that's too many

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.280 
like this is it too many that's too many
you're<00:02:13.360> going<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.540> go<00:02:13.630> all<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.870> way<00:02:13.960> around

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
you're going to go all the way around

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.440 
you're going to go all the way around
the<00:02:14.380> outside<00:02:14.530> in<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:15.370> pattern<00:02:15.880> kind<00:02:16.240> of<00:02:16.360> like

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
the outside in this pattern kind of like

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.850 
the outside in this pattern kind of like
a<00:02:16.860> circle<00:02:18.540> all<00:02:19.540> right<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.020> these<00:02:20.530> are<00:02:20.710> all

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
a circle all right and these are all

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.300 
a circle all right and these are all
going<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.460> have<00:02:22.380> one<00:02:23.380> behind<00:02:23.770> them<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.280> is

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
going to have one behind them that is

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.900 
going to have one behind them that is
double<00:02:27.310> as<00:02:27.400> high<00:02:29.430> these<00:02:30.430> are<00:02:30.550> going<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.730> be<00:02:30.790> too

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
double as high these are going to be too

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.800 
double as high these are going to be too
high<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:36.100> now<00:02:36.250> how<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:36.820> set<00:02:37.209> this<00:02:37.360> up<00:02:37.570> now

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
high so now how you set this up now

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.960 
high so now how you set this up now
usually<00:02:38.200> these<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.920> area<00:02:39.280> would<00:02:39.400> be<00:02:39.430> sunken

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
usually these this area would be sunken

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.199 
usually these this area would be sunken
into<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.360> ground<00:02:41.340> I'm<00:02:42.340> just<00:02:42.670> doing<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:43.000> like

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
into the ground I'm just doing it like

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.510 
into the ground I'm just doing it like
this<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.600> can<00:02:43.630> see<00:02:44.050> exactly<00:02:44.500> what<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.280> need

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
this you can see exactly what you need

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.890 
this you can see exactly what you need
here<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.870> then<00:02:50.050> what<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.650> need<00:02:50.800> is<00:02:51.900> there's

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
here so then what you need is there's

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.750 
here so then what you need is there's
going<00:02:52.990> to<00:02:53.050> be<00:02:53.110> eight<00:02:53.380> of<00:02:53.560> these<00:02:53.620> right<00:02:53.980> one<00:02:54.640> two

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
going to be eight of these right one two

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.380 
going to be eight of these right one two
three<00:02:54.790> four<00:02:55.320> -<00:02:56.320> four<00:02:56.530> yep<00:02:56.890> eight<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:58.270> you're

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
three four - four yep eight so you're

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.000 
three four - four yep eight so you're
going<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.540> set<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.810> up<00:02:58.870> like<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.260> now<00:02:59.680> what

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
going to set it up like that now what

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.750 
going to set it up like that now what
you're<00:03:00.130> going<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.310> do<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.520> you're<00:03:00.610> going<00:03:00.640> to

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.560 
you're going to do is you're going to
use<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:01.000> inscription<00:03:01.480> tools<00:03:02.970> all<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.030> ones

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
use the inscription tools all the ones

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.990 
use the inscription tools all the ones
that<00:03:04.840> are<00:03:04.930> not<00:03:05.050> on<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.380> diagonals<00:03:05.950> are<00:03:06.850> going

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
that are not on the diagonals are going

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.340 
that are not on the diagonals are going
to<00:03:07.060> be<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:08.530> water<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.870> these<00:03:10.959> ones<00:03:11.140> are<00:03:11.230> the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
to be the water so these ones are the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.910 
to be the water so these ones are the
solid<00:03:11.739> black<00:03:11.860> ones<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:13.739> ones<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:15.070> are<00:03:16.920> and

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
solid black ones the ones that are and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.310 
solid black ones the ones that are and
look<00:03:18.310> at<00:03:18.430> what<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:18.730> nope<00:03:19.720> that's<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.200> wrong

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
look at what the nope that's the wrong

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.840 
look at what the nope that's the wrong
one<00:03:21.989> all<00:03:22.989> right<00:03:23.110> all<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:24.070> other<00:03:24.220> ones<00:03:24.489> around

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
the outside are going to be the earth

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.720 
the outside are going to be the earth
we're<00:03:28.660> going<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:28.840> have<00:03:28.930> opes<00:03:29.380> did<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.160> again

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.699 

we<00:03:33.730> earthen<00:03:34.090> water<00:03:34.360> around<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.170> outside<00:03:35.500> like

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
we earthen water around the outside like

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.160 
we earthen water around the outside like
that<00:03:35.790> now<00:03:36.790> on<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.450> inside<00:03:37.810> you're<00:03:38.019> going<00:03:38.110> to

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
that now on the inside you're going to

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.259 
that now on the inside you're going to
use<00:03:38.380> fire<00:03:38.739> here<00:03:39.519> wherever<00:03:39.970> there's<00:03:40.209> water

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
use fire here wherever there's water

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.070 
use fire here wherever there's water
you're<00:03:40.780> going<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:40.959> put<00:03:41.080> fire<00:03:41.320> fire<00:03:41.709> fire<00:03:42.060> fire

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
the other way of doing it is

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.950 
the other way of doing it is
right-clicking<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:47.270> right-click<00:04:47.660> on<00:04:47.810> there

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
right-clicking you right-click on there

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.540 
right-clicking you right-click on there
like<00:04:48.140> that<00:04:48.170> and<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:48.530> basically<00:04:48.890> give<00:04:49.190> some<00:04:49.400> of

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
like that and you basically give some of

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.220 
like that and you basically give some of
your<00:04:49.640> your<00:04:50.150> LP<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.910> stone<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.930> that's

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
it requires LP to get that going but

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.140
