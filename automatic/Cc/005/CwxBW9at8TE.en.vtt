could find another track I would do some

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:09.430 
could find another track I would do some
more<00:00:07.790> gameplay<00:00:08.300> and<00:00:08.540> this<00:00:08.900> is<00:00:09.020> actually<00:00:09.290> round

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
more gameplay and this is actually round

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.870 
more gameplay and this is actually round
number<00:00:09.740> two<00:00:09.890> someone<00:00:10.280> else<00:00:10.400> made<00:00:10.580> this<00:00:10.700> track

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
number two someone else made this track

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.630 
number two someone else made this track
it's<00:00:11.090> not<00:00:11.240> a<00:00:11.270> wcp<00:00:11.870> mod<00:00:12.080> for<00:00:12.710> the<00:00:12.770> track<00:00:13.010> it's

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:13.640 
it's not a wcp mod for the track it's

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.830 
it's not a wcp mod for the track it's
someone<00:00:13.880> else<00:00:14.030> made<00:00:14.180> this<00:00:14.330> but<00:00:14.510> I<00:00:14.540> thought<00:00:14.720> I'd

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
someone else made this but I thought I'd

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.310 
someone else made this but I thought I'd
give<00:00:14.960> it<00:00:14.990> a<00:00:15.110> go

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
give it a go

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.530 
give it a go
so<00:00:15.830> if<00:00:15.950> Sam<00:00:16.160> bird<00:00:16.340> in<00:00:16.550> the<00:00:16.760> Virgin<00:00:17.060> Racing<00:00:17.210> car

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
so if Sam bird in the Virgin Racing car

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.360 
so if Sam bird in the Virgin Racing car
and<00:00:17.750> I<00:00:18.200> did<00:00:18.380> put<00:00:18.500> the<00:00:18.590> names<00:00:18.830> of<00:00:18.980> everyone's

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.370 
and I did put the names of everyone's

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.160 
and I did put the names of everyone's
heads<00:00:19.580> as<00:00:19.700> well<00:00:19.880> so<00:00:20.150> I<00:00:20.390> think<00:00:20.930> someone

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
heads as well so I think someone

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.240 
heads as well so I think someone
actually<00:00:21.380> suggested<00:00:21.830> that<00:00:21.920> for<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.160> last

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
actually suggested that for the last

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.620 
actually suggested that for the last
video<00:00:22.610> because<00:00:23.150> I<00:00:23.210> didn't<00:00:23.360> know<00:00:23.450> what<00:00:23.570> the

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
video because I didn't know what the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.720 
video because I didn't know what the
names<00:00:23.840> were<00:00:24.020> for<00:00:24.200> everyone<00:00:24.560> and<00:00:24.740> the<00:00:25.430> names<00:00:25.580> to

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
names were for everyone and the names to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.770 
names were for everyone and the names to
actually<00:00:25.940> change<00:00:26.150> every<00:00:26.390> race<00:00:26.539> as<00:00:26.660> well

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:26.780 
actually change every race as well

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.140 
actually change every race as well
because<00:00:26.960> you<00:00:27.020> can<00:00:27.170> change<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.970> drivers<00:00:28.970> for

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
because you can change the drivers for

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.400 
because you can change the drivers for
each<00:00:29.180> race<00:00:29.449> because<00:00:29.750> obviously<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.110> drivers

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
each race because obviously the drivers

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.589 
each race because obviously the drivers
changed<00:00:30.860> in<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:31.430> past<00:00:31.610> memory<00:00:32.000> races<00:00:32.329> all<00:00:32.480> the

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
changed in the past memory races all the

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.569 
changed in the past memory races all the
drivers<00:00:32.810> were<00:00:32.960> changed<00:00:33.350> sometimes<00:00:33.579> some

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
drivers were changed sometimes some

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.040 
drivers were changed sometimes some
people<00:00:34.610> were<00:00:34.910> a<00:00:34.970> place<00:00:35.180> I<00:00:35.329> don't<00:00:35.390> know<00:00:35.570> how

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
people were a place I don't know how

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.840 
people were a place I don't know how
that<00:00:36.200> works<00:00:36.380> but<00:00:36.560> I<00:00:36.829> know<00:00:37.160> that<00:00:37.280> some<00:00:37.489> drivers

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
that works but I know that some drivers

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.910 
that works but I know that some drivers
don't<00:00:38.000> stay<00:00:38.239> from<00:00:38.390> any<00:00:38.540> races<00:00:38.930> as<00:00:39.079> we<00:00:39.560> go<00:00:39.680> past

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
don't stay from any races as we go past

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.340 
don't stay from any races as we go past
Brabham<00:00:40.399> we<00:00:40.880> get<00:00:41.030> completely<00:00:41.690> squeezed<00:00:42.140> out

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
Brabham we get completely squeezed out

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.840 
Brabham we get completely squeezed out
and<00:00:42.620> think<00:00:42.829> that's<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.100> China<00:00:43.370> Racing<00:00:43.700> car

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
and think that's the China Racing car

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.520 
and think that's the China Racing car
not<00:00:44.030> too<00:00:44.149> sure<00:00:44.300> who<00:00:44.450> that<00:00:44.480> is<00:00:44.720> who's<00:00:45.260> lost

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
not too sure who that is who's lost

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.740 
not too sure who that is who's lost
their<00:00:45.680> front<00:00:46.010> wing<00:00:46.190> as<00:00:46.340> well<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:46.760> that<00:00:47.600> was<00:00:47.720> a

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
their front wing as well and that was a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.660 
their front wing as well and that was a
bit<00:00:47.989> that<00:00:48.380> was<00:00:48.500> just<00:00:48.649> no<00:00:48.890> gap<00:00:49.130> really<00:00:49.370> we<00:00:49.520> kind

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
bit that was just no gap really we kind

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.250 
bit that was just no gap really we kind
of<00:00:49.850> got<00:00:49.910> side<00:00:50.210> by<00:00:50.329> side<00:00:50.540> with<00:00:50.660> Brabham<00:00:51.020> but

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
of got side by side with Brabham but

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.500 
of got side by side with Brabham but
then<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.070> gap<00:00:52.280> just<00:00:52.579> closed<00:00:52.910> off<00:00:53.149> in<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.390> end

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
then the gap just closed off in the end

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.000 
then the gap just closed off in the end
so<00:00:53.750> it<00:00:53.840> wasn't<00:00:54.140> really<00:00:54.170> good<00:00:54.380> workers<00:00:54.739> tongue

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
so it wasn't really good workers tongue

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.620 
so it wasn't really good workers tongue
in<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.610> China<00:00:55.790> racing<00:00:56.030> Park<00:00:56.180> actually<00:00:56.360> gets

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
in the China racing Park actually gets

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.180 
in the China racing Park actually gets
past<00:00:56.870> us<00:00:57.050> with<00:00:57.079> a<00:00:57.230> no<00:00:57.320> front<00:00:57.710> wing<00:00:57.950> and

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
past us with a no front wing and

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.790 
past us with a no front wing and
Brabham's<00:00:58.910> going<00:00:59.090> really<00:00:59.420> slow<00:00:59.840> turns<00:01:00.530> making

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
Brabham's going really slow turns making

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.560 
Brabham's going really slow turns making
the<00:01:01.070> move<00:01:01.219> past<00:01:01.460> Brabham<00:01:01.820> we've<00:01:02.000> got<00:01:02.120> no<00:01:02.270> rooms

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
the move past Brabham we've got no rooms

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.419 
the move past Brabham we've got no rooms
to<00:01:03.050> go<00:01:03.200> anywhere<00:01:03.530> Brabham's<00:01:03.950> just<00:01:04.100> squeeze<00:01:04.280> it

00:01:04.419 --> 00:01:04.429 
to go anywhere Brabham's just squeeze it

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:06.160 
to go anywhere Brabham's just squeeze it
off<00:01:04.579> can<00:01:05.119> we<00:01:05.149> get<00:01:05.329> the<00:01:05.420> inside<00:01:05.689> of<00:01:05.840> both<00:01:06.020> of

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.260 
of the inside through I'm not too sure
what<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.219> corner<00:01:22.549> is<00:01:22.639> but<00:01:22.819> I'm<00:01:22.909> liking<00:01:23.090> the

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
what the corner is but I'm liking the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.969 
what the corner is but I'm liking the
track<00:01:23.450> actually<00:01:23.600> it's<00:01:23.899> not<00:01:24.020> really<00:01:24.289> a<00:01:24.319> wcp

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
track actually it's not really a wcp

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.800 
track actually it's not really a wcp
track<00:01:25.189> so<00:01:25.340> it's<00:01:25.459> not<00:01:25.549> properly<00:01:26.209> detailed<00:01:26.659> but

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
track so it's not properly detailed but

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.719 
track so it's not properly detailed but
it<00:01:26.869> is<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.229> track<00:01:27.409> of<00:01:27.529> the<00:01:27.590> underlay<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:27.979> it's

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
it is the track of the underlay so it's

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:29.949 
it is the track of the underlay so it's
better<00:01:28.939> than<00:01:29.090> nothing<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:29.569> I'm<00:01:29.779> really

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
better than nothing and I'm really

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:31.059 
better than nothing and I'm really
enjoying<00:01:30.049> it<00:01:30.259> it's<00:01:30.380> got<00:01:30.529> some<00:01:30.649> contact

was<00:01:48.259> severe<00:01:48.619> going<00:01:48.829> into<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.039> pit<00:01:49.279> and<00:01:49.520> that's

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
was severe going into the pit and that's

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.269 
was severe going into the pit and that's
gained<00:01:50.630> as<00:01:50.779> another<00:01:50.990> position<00:01:51.259> weapon<00:01:51.499> to<00:01:51.619> p15

Sarah's in so think processes leading

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:01.669 
I know it doesn't say the lap count at

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:03.219 
I know it doesn't say the lap count at
the<00:02:01.700> top<00:02:01.939> but<00:02:02.149> there<00:02:02.299> is<00:02:02.419> two<00:02:02.569> apps<00:02:02.719> ago<00:02:02.989> I<00:02:03.020> just

the top but there is two apps ago I just

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.479 
the top but there is two apps ago I just
took<00:02:03.349> away<00:02:03.469> that<00:02:03.709> counter<00:02:04.039> because<00:02:04.219> I<00:02:04.340> don't

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:04.489 
took away that counter because I don't

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:08.469 
took away that counter because I don't
know<00:02:04.549> why<00:02:05.409> 2005<00:02:06.409> and<00:02:06.679> sort<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.579> TV<00:02:08.060> style

think<00:02:38.230> it's<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.650> really<00:02:38.769> fun<00:02:38.860> mod<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.340> try<00:02:39.579> and

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
think it's a really fun mod to try and

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.890 
think it's a really fun mod to try and
do<00:02:39.849> that<00:02:40.000> as<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.150> go<00:02:40.239> on<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.420> outside<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.750> apt

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
do that as you go on the outside of apt

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.960 
do that as you go on the outside of apt
hit<00:02:41.409> the<00:02:41.530> wall<00:02:41.769> and<00:02:41.980> with<00:02:42.099> that's<00:02:42.700> pretty<00:02:42.909> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
hit the wall and with that's pretty the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.610 
hit the wall and with that's pretty the
scrappiest<00:02:43.599> fight<00:02:44.049> you'll<00:02:44.200> ever<00:02:44.290> see<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.530> your

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
scrappiest fight you'll ever see in your

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.099 
scrappiest fight you'll ever see in your
life<00:02:44.739> to<00:02:45.069> be<00:02:45.160> honest<00:02:45.370> just<00:02:46.120> literally<00:02:46.900> wheel

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
life to be honest just literally wheel

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:48.860 
life to be honest just literally wheel
to<00:02:47.290> wheel<00:02:47.319> buying<00:02:47.799> into<00:02:48.010> each<00:02:48.099> other<00:02:48.280> and

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
to wheel buying into each other and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.990 
to wheel buying into each other and
ending<00:02:49.870> ourselves<00:02:50.290> in<00:02:50.379> the<00:02:50.440> walls<00:02:50.650> nearly<00:02:51.099> and

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
ending ourselves in the walls nearly and

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.670 
ending ourselves in the walls nearly and
that's<00:02:52.329> kind<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.540> really<00:02:52.840> wrong<00:02:53.109> I<00:02:53.230> said<00:02:53.500> back

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
that's kind of really wrong I said back

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.089 
that's kind of really wrong I said back
we're<00:02:54.670> gonna<00:02:54.730> ignore<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.769> we've<00:02:56.769> got<00:02:56.890> beware

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
we're gonna ignore that we've got beware

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.890 
we're gonna ignore that we've got beware
me<00:02:57.220> in<00:02:57.280> front<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.519> a<00:02:57.579> Saracen<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.329> Chandhok

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
me in front of a Saracen and Chandhok

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.569 
me in front of a Saracen and Chandhok
who's<00:02:59.109> having<00:02:59.349> a<00:02:59.500> very<00:02:59.739> good<00:03:00.069> race<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:00.549> far

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
who's having a very good race so far

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.089 
who's having a very good race so far
looks<00:03:01.150> like<00:03:01.239> he's<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:01.840> p9<00:03:02.440> at<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.680> moment<00:03:02.980> and

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
looks like he's a p9 at the moment and

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.979 
looks like he's a p9 at the moment and
I'm<00:03:03.760> not<00:03:03.940> too<00:03:04.060> sure<00:03:04.239> how<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.420> point<00:03:04.659> to<00:03:04.780> work<00:03:04.930> I

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
I'm not too sure how the point to work I

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.990 
I'm not too sure how the point to work I
think<00:03:05.140> it's<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.290> top<00:03:05.470> 10<00:03:05.709> get<00:03:05.890> points<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.549> only

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
think it's the top 10 get points I only

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.250 
think it's the top 10 get points I only
can't<00:03:07.269> just<00:03:07.420> watch<00:03:07.569> performing<00:03:08.019> areas<00:03:08.200> that

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
can't just watch performing areas that

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.289 
can't just watch performing areas that
we've<00:03:08.379> got<00:03:08.470> Saracen<00:03:09.159> do<00:03:09.459> a<00:03:09.489> wheelie<00:03:09.879> and

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
we've got Saracen do a wheelie and

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.660 
we've got Saracen do a wheelie and
Burmese<00:03:11.079> lost<00:03:11.260> its<00:03:11.409> full<00:03:11.620> wing<00:03:11.829> behind<00:03:12.310> and

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
Burmese lost its full wing behind and

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.970 
Burmese lost its full wing behind and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
Sarah's losses for an angry wing so I

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.530 
Sarah's losses for an angry wing so I
don't<00:03:15.549> know<00:03:15.640> what's<00:03:15.819> gone<00:03:16.030> on<00:03:16.060> there<00:03:16.299> but

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
we're just gonna take the positions very

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.460 
we're just gonna take the positions very
nicely<00:03:18.639> and<00:03:19.030> we're<00:03:19.660> not<00:03:19.750> too<00:03:19.930> first<00:03:20.169> we're

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
nicely and we're not too first we're

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.530 
nicely and we're not too first we're
just<00:03:20.500> gonna<00:03:20.940> plow<00:03:21.940> our<00:03:22.090> way<00:03:22.209> through<00:03:22.419> the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
just gonna plow our way through the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.289 
just gonna plow our way through the
field<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:23.019> see<00:03:23.950> how<00:03:24.099> that<00:03:24.160> plans<00:03:24.519> out<00:03:24.760> as<00:03:24.940> I

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
field and see how that plans out as I

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:26.550 
field and see how that plans out as I
think<00:03:25.359> they<00:03:25.510> both<00:03:25.660> pit<00:03:26.049> there's<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.349> massive

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
think they both pit there's a massive

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.860 
think they both pit there's a massive
gap<00:03:26.859> now<00:03:27.040> between<00:03:27.069> P<00:03:27.910> 10<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.299> P<00:03:28.419> 11<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.840> think

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
gap now between P 10 and P 11 I think

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.650 
gap now between P 10 and P 11 I think
yeah<00:03:29.290> P<00:03:29.560> 11<00:03:29.799> has<00:03:29.919> pit<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:30.669> a<00:03:30.700> Chan<00:03:31.060> doc<00:03:31.239> in<00:03:31.450> front

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
yeah P 11 has pit so a Chan doc in front

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.000 
yeah P 11 has pit so a Chan doc in front
of<00:03:31.720> us<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:31.989> then<00:03:32.079> Senna<00:03:32.379> the<00:03:32.590> both<00:03:32.829> the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
of us and then Senna the both the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.069 
of us and then Senna the both the
teammates<00:03:33.459> in<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.760> hinges<00:03:34.269> I<00:03:34.389> believe<00:03:34.660> I'm

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
teammates in the hinges I believe I'm

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.330 
teammates in the hinges I believe I'm
getting<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.470> bit<00:03:35.620> better<00:03:35.739> at<00:03:35.950> knowing<00:03:36.069> all<00:03:36.280> the

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
getting a bit better at knowing all the

getting a bit better at knowing all the
teams<00:03:36.579> infirmary<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:37.389> better<00:03:37.840> do<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.200> from

bit where it's like a massive drop and
that's<00:04:04.060> quite<00:04:04.269> cool<00:04:04.419> most<00:04:04.989> slopes<00:04:05.230> are<00:04:05.440> drop

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
that's quite cool most slopes are drop

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.780 
that's quite cool most slopes are drop
so<00:04:05.859> it'd<00:04:05.980> be<00:04:06.010> pretty<00:04:06.220> weird<00:04:06.459> if<00:04:06.579> you<00:04:06.639> were

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
so it'd be pretty weird if you were

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.400 
so it'd be pretty weird if you were
going<00:04:07.060> up<00:04:07.209> a<00:04:07.329> slope<00:04:07.540> rather<00:04:07.840> than<00:04:07.959> skiing<00:04:08.230> down

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
going up a slope rather than skiing down

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.740 
going up a slope rather than skiing down
one<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:09.370> would<00:04:09.489> really<00:04:09.519> work<00:04:09.940> there's<00:04:10.480> a<00:04:10.540> go

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
one that would really work there's a go

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.559 
one that would really work there's a go
around<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.440> outside<00:04:11.560> of<00:04:12.040> chan<00:04:13.030> doc<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.480> we
