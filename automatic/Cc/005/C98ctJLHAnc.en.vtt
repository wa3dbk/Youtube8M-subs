roots<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.610> I'm<00:01:32.970> not<00:01:33.420> doing<00:01:33.960> my<00:01:34.200> whole<00:01:34.650> head<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
roots so I'm not doing my whole head I

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.399 
roots so I'm not doing my whole head I
am<00:01:35.430> doing<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.090> ends<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.570> my<00:01:36.600> hair<00:01:36.689> therefore<00:01:37.380> I

am doing the ends of my hair therefore I

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.310

don't have to have second day hair the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.109 
don't have to have second day hair the
reason<00:01:40.590> why<00:01:40.680> they<00:01:40.829> say<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.729> your

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
reason why they say that is so that your

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.280 
reason why they say that is so that your
