00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:44.340

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.500

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:36.210
 extremely now you are the last one up 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.130
 It can be so easy that you can 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.030
 several levels down 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:47.040

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:29.630

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:36.540

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:38.250

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:07.140

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:09.239
