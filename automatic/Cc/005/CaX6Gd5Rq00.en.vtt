00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.280 

through<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.260> legs<00:00:45.610> he<00:00:46.610> was<00:00:47.030> across<00:00:47.360> those

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
but yeah I think that probably helps a

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.569
