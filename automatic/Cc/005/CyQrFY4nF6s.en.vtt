00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.109
 Omar Berrio barry take dotcom today 

00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:09.670
 I'm going to talk to you about the new technology 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:14.380
 that has taken intel on its new board 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:19.119
 zeta 97 which are 1150 lg to 1150 for 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:21.330
 processors password the fast world 2 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.529
 who are taking out 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.010
 already with these new 197 and they are also going to 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.259
 work for broadway futures that 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.880
 are let's say the fifth generation of 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.989
 intel corp 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.980
 well, basically, it's 97 with 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.820
 compared to 187 the great improvement that has 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.750
 it shows in the storage part 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.989
 all the edges in theory 197 are going to 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.150
 include a new port that is m2 and 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.700
 The will include some will include 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.340
 the sata express port that is the one that 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.339
 I will speak in this video 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.180
 basically the sata express is a change 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.490
 that have to pass the connection or the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.250
 data transfer between discs 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.320
 storage or disk status 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.800
 solid state 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.870
 from a sata connection pass it to some 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:27.229
 lines or lanes of pci-express 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.170
 which can be multiple which allows 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.520
 reach at a speed of 10 gigabytes 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.040
 per second 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.310
 compared to the current paw 3 which is 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.770
 of 6 gigabytes per second 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.560
 basically what they do here is 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.680
 use the two good lines several 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.960
 pci-express lines that already existed in 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.700
 the motherboards to transmit the 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.070
 data and thus avoid having 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.620
 that be 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.470
 fixing the sata port to 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.150
 achieve this transfer speed 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.500
 that are coming, someone comes to live 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.369
 per second 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.350
 all this is basically the result of 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.360
 advance that is having everything 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.520
 storage the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.730
 the solid state disks units of 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:24.170
 solid state ssd and that same ssd 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.140
 also through connections 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.680
 pci-express also came with true 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.960
 advance then the express pan is 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.370
 it is simply the combination of sata 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.380
 with pci express 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.660
 which allows to connect discs so much 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.500
 with the sata express connection as the 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.350
 old discs sata versions 3 or 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.000
 versions 2 that will continue to operate 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.610
 with these with this new interface but 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.090
 also will allow the new m port 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.660
 point 2 that is basically 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.970
 ssv that are directly connected by 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.300
 pci-express then 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.570
 well that's basically what what 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.510
 means salt to express what 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.050
 is incorporating the chipset to 97 for 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.990
 intel I still have not heard anything of 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.300
 incorporation into the motherboards of 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.610
 aemead will play wait a bit to see 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.390
 that and it will also play wait a bit 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.880
 so that the unit manufacturers of 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.040
 solid state start to take units 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.580
 that take advantage of these 10 gigabytes for 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.350
 second 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.280
 of data transfer that are 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:46.180
 around up to 1969 megabytes per 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.010
 second transfer ok I hope that 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.940
 you liked the video that we see 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.940
 in the next
