00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the project itself oh right and they're

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600 
the project itself oh right and they're
starting<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.259> look<00:01:25.380> at<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.650> right<00:01:25.890> now<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
starting to look at this right now and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.399 
starting to look at this right now and
the<00:01:26.670> Europeans<00:01:27.270> are<00:01:27.450> leading<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> way<00:01:28.020> that's

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the Europeans are leading the way that's

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.440 
the Europeans are leading the way that's
right<00:01:28.650> what<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.009> their<00:01:29.189> idea<00:01:29.579> they've

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
right what is their idea they've

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.690 
right what is their idea they've
narrowed<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.840> down<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.229> three<00:01:31.590> proposals<00:01:32.040> okay

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
narrowed it down to three proposals okay

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.230 
narrowed it down to three proposals okay
one<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.829> kinetic<00:01:34.829> impactor<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.909> simply

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
one is a kinetic impactor that is simply

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.120 
one is a kinetic impactor that is simply
bumping<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> asteroid<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> rocket

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
bumping the asteroid with a rocket

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.700 
bumping the asteroid with a rocket
second<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> tractor<00:01:39.900> being<00:01:40.170> straight<00:01:40.560> out

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
second is a tractor being straight out

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.550 
second is a tractor being straight out
of<00:01:40.740> Star<00:01:41.189> Trek<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.729> third<00:01:42.329> get<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.930> third<00:01:43.290> is

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
of Star Trek and third get this third is

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.580 
of Star Trek and third get this third is

i<00:01:50.100> right<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.579> say<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.090> Russians<00:01:51.479> are

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
i right to say that the Russians are

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.780 
i right to say that the Russians are
pushing<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.470> guess<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.369> Russians

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
pushing that I guess that the Russians

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.929 
pushing that I guess that the Russians
wanna<00:01:54.090> Luke<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.990> astronaut<00:01:55.700> serious<00:01:56.700> stuff

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
wanna Luke the astronaut serious stuff

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.120 
wanna Luke the astronaut serious stuff

though if you have you believe an

though if you have you believe an
asteroid<00:01:59.610> that's<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.880> mile<00:02:00.210> across<00:02:00.570> mm-hmm

that could wipe out the entire planet
that's<00:02:03.780> right<00:02:03.960> that's<00:02:04.170> called<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.649> planet

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
that's right that's called a planet

remember<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.599> dinosaurs<00:02:28.080> didn't<00:02:28.440> have<00:02:28.590> an

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
remember the dinosaurs didn't have an

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.350 
remember the dinosaurs didn't have an
ear<00:02:28.890> shield<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.610> that's<00:02:29.819> why<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.120> dinosaurs

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
ear shield and that's why the dinosaurs

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.420 
ear shield and that's why the dinosaurs
a<00:02:30.780> knife<00:02:30.930> they<00:02:31.769> didn't<00:02:31.950> have<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.099> chance

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
a knife they didn't have a chance

a knife they didn't have a chance
against<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.060> radio<00:02:33.660> shield<00:02:34.050> might<00:02:34.290> be<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
against the radio shield might be the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.020 
against the radio shield might be the
first<00:02:34.800> step<00:02:34.860> but<00:02:35.160> what<00:02:35.310> happens<00:02:35.670> now<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.849> know

this<00:02:46.890> do<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.160> think<00:02:47.220> definitely<00:02:47.730> if<00:02:48.299> you<00:02:48.450> saw

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
this do you think definitely if you saw

the<00:02:52.110> Space<00:02:52.319> Shuttle<00:02:52.350> can't<00:02:52.830> even<00:02:53.130> reach<00:02:53.370> deep

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
the Space Shuttle can't even reach deep

the Space Shuttle can't even reach deep
space<00:02:54.060> we<00:02:54.600> would<00:02:54.750> have<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.049> have<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> new

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
space we would have to have a new

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.680 
space we would have to have a new
booster<00:02:55.890> rocket<00:02:56.280> capable<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.910> taking<00:02:57.180> us<00:02:57.510> into

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
a nuclear deflector shield and so we

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.150 
a nuclear deflector shield and so we
simply<00:03:03.840> don't<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.410> hardware<00:03:04.920> yet

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
simply don't have the hardware yet

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.680 
simply don't have the hardware yet
that's<00:03:05.549> why<00:03:05.819> they're<00:03:06.000> doing<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.420> four

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
that's why they're doing this four

the groundwork could be laid and we'll

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.160 
the groundwork could be laid and we'll
