00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.320 
as good as it can actually descends a
lot<00:01:04.500> better<00:01:04.710> more<00:01:05.250> confidence-inspiring

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330

descending but Azzurri pretty good it's

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.670 
descending but Azzurri pretty good it's
definitely<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.090> stiff<00:01:12.270> as<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.570> giant<00:01:12.990> but

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
definitely not as stiff as a giant but

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.710 
definitely not as stiff as a giant but
it's<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.220> lot<00:01:14.460> stiffer<00:01:14.700> than<00:01:14.880> any<00:01:15.119> Civello<00:01:15.479> out

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
it's a lot stiffer than any Civello out

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.050 
it's a lot stiffer than any Civello out
there<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.170> they're<00:01:16.920> descending<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:17.610> so

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
there and they're descending here so

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.390 
there and they're descending here so
definitely<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.890> it's<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.009> got<00:01:20.220> more

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
definitely just that it's just got more

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.090 
definitely just that it's just got more

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
are a lot of the bikes these days you

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
are a lot of the bikes these days you
really<00:01:27.180> are<00:01:27.450> paying<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:27.900> marketing<00:01:28.439> the

they're overheads is so useful they can
pop<00:01:34.229> out<00:01:34.350> these<00:01:34.530> cheap<00:01:34.890> bikes<00:01:35.130> yet<00:01:36.030> there<00:01:36.210> they

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
pop out these cheap bikes yet there they

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.660 
pop out these cheap bikes yet there they
are<00:01:36.869> genuine<00:01:37.470> high-performance<00:01:38.070> bicycles

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
are genuine high-performance bicycles

survey<00:05:36.250> load<00:05:36.490> and<00:05:37.860> we<00:05:38.860> have<00:05:39.040> here<00:05:39.190> third<00:05:39.700> of

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
survey load and we have here third of

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.470 
survey load and we have here third of
February<00:05:40.030> down<00:05:40.450> below<00:05:40.750> in<00:05:41.290> 817<00:05:42.250> 365<00:05:43.120> watt<00:05:43.330> so

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
February down below in 817 365 watt so

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.990 
February down below in 817 365 watt so
approximately<00:05:43.750> the<00:05:44.080> same<00:05:44.230> wattage

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
approximately the same wattage

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.480 
approximately the same wattage
one<00:05:46.000> second<00:05:46.480> slower<00:05:46.840> on<00:05:47.230> the<00:05:47.770> Azzurri

one second slower on the Azzurri

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.580 
one second slower on the Azzurri
so<00:05:49.180> you<00:05:49.270> got<00:05:49.360> a<00:05:49.390> nine<00:05:49.750> thousand<00:05:50.200> dollar<00:05:50.350> bike

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
so you got a nine thousand dollar bike

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.610 
so you got a nine thousand dollar bike
same<00:05:51.460> rider<00:05:51.760> on<00:05:52.270> a<00:05:52.300> two<00:05:52.930> and<00:05:53.020> a<00:05:53.080> half<00:05:53.169> thousand

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
same rider on a two and a half thousand

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.550 
same rider on a two and a half thousand
dollar<00:05:53.740> bike<00:05:54.000> okay<00:05:55.000> so<00:05:55.540> how<00:05:55.810> objective<00:05:56.050> can

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
dollar bike okay so how objective can

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.690 
dollar bike okay so how objective can
you<00:05:56.680> get<00:05:56.919> it<00:05:57.040> you<00:05:57.100> can't<00:05:57.310> get<00:05:57.460> more<00:05:57.610> objective

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
you get it you can't get more objective

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.390 
you get it you can't get more objective
than<00:05:58.090> that<00:05:58.450> cork<00:05:59.200> is<00:05:59.440> good<00:05:59.710> because<00:05:59.919> the<00:06:00.190> wind

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
than that cork is good because the wind

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.040 
than that cork is good because the wind
doesn't<00:06:00.610> really<00:06:00.790> isn't<00:06:01.360> really<00:06:01.570> a<00:06:01.600> factor

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
doesn't really isn't really a factor

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.930 
doesn't really isn't really a factor
every<00:06:02.590> what<00:06:02.680> the<00:06:02.770> wattages<00:06:03.220> is<00:06:03.400> pretty<00:06:03.790> much

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
every what the wattages is pretty much

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.690 
every what the wattages is pretty much
identical<00:06:04.470> it's<00:06:05.470> the<00:06:05.620> times<00:06:05.860> are<00:06:06.190> pretty<00:06:06.580> much

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
identical it's the times are pretty much

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.480 
identical it's the times are pretty much
identical<00:06:06.880> so<00:06:07.510> there<00:06:07.660> you<00:06:07.780> go

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
identical so there you go

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.219 
identical so there you go
nine<00:06:09.490> thousand<00:06:09.880> dollar<00:06:10.030> bike<00:06:10.240> two<00:06:11.020> and<00:06:11.110> a<00:06:11.140> half

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
nine thousand dollar bike two and a half

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:12.480
