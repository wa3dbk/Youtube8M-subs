00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.430
 Oh 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.150
 and well greet the cyclos friends caught 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.130
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.390
 new video the friends for a new 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.920
 kind of video if I can say that like 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.090
 it's just because it's my brother 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.480
 who will take control of the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.860
 controller 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.150
 I'm going to start over 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.169
 why else do who will play everything 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.460
 just because he got a little 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.960
 better to manage a few months 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.580
 it's not a pro away from there but it 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.690
 knows a little more passes than me a 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.650
 level technical gesture that's why 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.820
 I put a team with two players 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.680
 five stars including cuadrado and 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.280
 neymar on the left and side sides 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.480
 law 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.040
 then there is messi in tip after if a 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.019
 classic team so here it is going to be 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.160
 undo some to make us small 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.019
 what gives them and it's finally it's going 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.309
 try so here's so be indulgent 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.269
 it's the first time he's beaten 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.680
 must play in one of two bibles 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.879
 tremors are not going to talk it's me 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.110
 who commented from above as a 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.760
 real football match as if we look 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.900
 a real football match friends I think 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.040
 it may be worth it going 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.659
 bring a little novelty on the chip 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.769
 on the chain just a little style 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.180
 on the chain know no harm 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.710
 because there it's pretty enough to see 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.119
 so we're not here to take the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.610
 head when I inevitably put the win on 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.350
 is here for fun for the beauty of the game 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.119
 simply and so we end up 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:19.970
 as soon as we have our opponent has everything from 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:22.160
 following the years the guys 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.860
 there is a small technical problem it was 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.810
 not foreseen in the contract that no it was 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.480
 not expected in the contract that not at all 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.310
 no then it was not planned in the 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.040
 contract 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.750
 how do we do now 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.370
 how can someone now 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.020
 to explain to me someone can explain to me 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.420
 it was not written in the contract 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.410
 before starting the match 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.760
 no it was not who is me I ask 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.290
 my brother to show his styles and in 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.119
 fall like that, I say that I say nothing 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.670
 I wish you good luck and who we are going 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.200
 comment all on peeled water this is a 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.390
 crispo thing that's another thing 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.560
 but the two handsets I say it 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.180
 can hurt but after that happens 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.680
 he's a guy who does not know how to play 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.720
 hope to go thanks you for playing messi 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.950
 which gives Mexico and gives the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.240
 pace of this first match but if these 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.040
 left but so what makes the casters 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.750
 walhalla it's hot thanks call that 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.640
 give me ideas 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.400
 messi who gets a little bit blocked 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.140
 because nothing at all you have to stay 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.820
 attentive one because if they get to 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.330
 put a goal I do not know how he's going 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.100
 react after but it'll be hot leo 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.620
 messi who intercepts this balloon leo messi 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.500
 who gives himself wings there is in 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.510
 the public directly to the summer pressing 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.980
 neymar who recovers neymar who recovers 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.360
 who sends messi messi who gives to 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.100
 cuadrado cuadrado who receives the ball 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.690
 because i face the guardian cuadrado who is 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.610
 present facing the guard he waited for 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.410
 to do a roulette announced again 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.070
 halted badly to gluttony the 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.630
 greed 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.180
 but as I said before we are not 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.190
 there for inevitably the win we are there 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.239
 for fun playing what they are 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.220
 not here to win we're here to 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.640
 have fun of course no fault there is 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.769
 nothing at all raises 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.100
 the strike is magnificent it is the goal of 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.709
 guarin that i'm on the internet 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.330
 and that's one of his first strikes 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.830
 if I say no nonsense I think this 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.950
 even the first one is its first 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.510
 women 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.830
 and here is the loss of the ball it is paid cash 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.269
 go but if there is a fault on 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.129
 messi measure there there was fault 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.940
 it's the same we continue until 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.010
 try to hit 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.050

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.610

 on the salad guardian the sonabhy in 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.980
 action since for cuadrado yes 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.690
 magnificent magnificent lottery all 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.970
 the quadras doc equals just before the 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.069
 pause is well played we put the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.480
 counters to zero password called friends 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.480
 I still want to clarify 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:56.370
 oh there there we have not gone 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:02.519
 far from the goal we were hot there we had 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:05.069
 hot guys from the east are called 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.579
 little team because they hit and 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.090
 to go in 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:10.349
 she is in it was lounging at a shot 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.410
 to pay about around Renty 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.180
 halls for life but if help is to 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.289
 to go but if they continue and if they 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.940
 still quick to move you 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:23.039
 passes you pass is a foul and a blow 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.550
 frank to play that scorait 92 facts 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.550

 what it is for you oh no pole 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.090
 go to the Parisian market and you can 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.880
 come back largely neymar for quadra 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.669
 two early quadras still a crazy half 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.750
 volley is decidedly it's his match he 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.080
 put the meters back again 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.530
 zero 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.160
 well played give but if they decide where 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.110
 the contact 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.340
 messi who passes messi who is past leo 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.419
 messi who will face golf 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:59.500
 and to but otherwise we have to go counter a 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.699
 such an agreement no problem in that it 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.419
 had completely acquired to fable the 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.160
 time is published monday echoes 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.710

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.370

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.530
 cuadrado there high 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.530
 it was good but it did not succeed 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:20.410
 messi messi messi who did a little 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.630
 too high but what speeds up 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.430
 acceleration drama and rodrigues who the 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.830
 give to leo messi leo messi morlaÃ s 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:33.070
 what a nice stop to throw well played and 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.030
 well played sir lloris extension 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.620
 I will take orders from the guys 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.690
 for the extra match very very 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.460
 tight 2 everywhere the stats speak 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.479
 of themselves 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.090
 we will win against school is when 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.080
 even first time you understand 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.470
 this is the first time I wear 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.370
 in the nose I never want I'm 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.370
 never fell further 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.420
 no you will tell me peeled if they 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.460
 wish to flee the surface his cartons 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.400
 penalty is what happens 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.740
 after I say not capra fault but it is 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:10.010
 fell very quickly allegory tonight 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.010
 there it is to walk not serious 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.210
 here is it is well played peeled 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.819
 new 4 to 2 action she is very 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:24.129
 beautiful and we are completely passive 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:27.189
 on this action there sports names he goes 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:30.219
 to put it still pretty easy with 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:31.629
 pay an easy site with easy peeled 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:34.419
 Fortunately the price of defeat 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:35.830
 present since I took the hand 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:39.009
 clearly done one loses one of the taxes 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.080
 will come to an end understand when the worst in 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.389
 more account the flames and the fact that 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.770
 when we do nothing for the end of the match 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.849
 is whistled the guys so since 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.039
 I took the order 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:50.229
 bah we lost print quickly it made me 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:51.219
 taken three goals unfortunately there this 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:52.240
 was not the best example to 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:53.770
 to call myself I want to tell you no 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.270
 I did not look for excuses we stayed 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.379
 well done it's me I have a little 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.050
 all ruined but it does not matter 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:01.000
 so here I think maybe do a 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.500
 series with my brother precisely on 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.090
 styles is sure to offer you a 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.050
 better a better gameplay of course 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.340
 because he was not necessarily 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.270
 obvious ayem gier 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.909
 even though there have been some small 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.469
 ski resorts etc I hope this 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:13.960
 will want more here he fell against 

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:15.310
 we did not win it's a pity 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.879
 maybe some channels will come 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.560
 concluded 

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:19.599
 maybe next time we'll have it 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.949
 who knows we do not know we are 

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:22.360
 well all friends do not hesitate to like 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:24.430
 if you want to see a little more style 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.419
 on the channel I can offer you 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.039
 it's up to you to tell me in the 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:28.300
 comments friends we find ourselves 

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:31.409
 soon it was that the fli take care 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.409
 to go back to
