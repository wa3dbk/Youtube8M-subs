I'll<00:00:44.760> figure<00:00:45.360> out<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.600> guess<00:00:45.840> figure<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.469> out<00:00:46.559> I

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
I'll figure out I guess figure it out I

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.860 
I'll figure out I guess figure it out I
guess<00:00:46.910> so<00:00:47.910> mainly<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.480> my<00:00:48.629> legend
