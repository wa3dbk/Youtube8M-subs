so sir for this we decided to do sort of

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.360 
so sir for this we decided to do sort of
an<00:00:29.930> experiment<00:00:30.500> with<00:00:30.620> Keith<00:00:30.890> where<00:00:31.100> we<00:00:31.190> just

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:31.370 
an experiment with Keith where we just

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.130 
an experiment with Keith where we just
got<00:00:31.550> them<00:00:31.670> to<00:00:31.700> you<00:00:32.330> know<00:00:32.450> layer<00:00:32.810> some

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
got them to you know layer some

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.690 
got them to you know layer some
different<00:00:33.440> callings<00:00:33.770> guitars<00:00:34.130> it<00:00:34.370> was<00:00:34.460> one

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
different callings guitars it was one

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.640 
different callings guitars it was one
pass<00:00:34.910> through<00:00:34.940> improvisation<00:00:35.840> on<00:00:36.410> Keith's

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
pass through improvisation on Keith's

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.520 
pass through improvisation on Keith's
part<00:00:37.210> we<00:00:38.210> have<00:00:38.330> them<00:00:38.420> lay<00:00:38.540> down<00:00:38.720> a<00:00:38.990> rhythm

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
part we have them lay down a rhythm

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.380 
part we have them lay down a rhythm
track<00:00:39.710> a<00:00:39.830> fingerstyle<00:00:40.370> part<00:00:40.850> several

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
track a fingerstyle part several

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.810 
track a fingerstyle part several
different<00:00:41.630> lead<00:00:41.750> parts<00:00:42.110> on<00:00:42.230> each<00:00:42.350> guitar<00:00:42.820> and

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
different lead parts on each guitar and

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.360 
different lead parts on each guitar and
then<00:00:44.090> I<00:00:44.180> kind<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.480> cut<00:00:44.690> between<00:00:44.870> them<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:45.500> you

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
then I kind of cut between them and you

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:55.829 
then I kind of cut between them and you
know<00:00:46.460> try<00:00:46.700> to<00:00:46.730> create<00:00:47.059> a<00:00:47.150> mix<00:00:47.450> out<00:00:47.660> of<00:00:47.809> them

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.130 

so<00:00:56.839> on<00:00:56.989> this<00:00:57.140> uh<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.910> basic<00:00:58.910> rhythm<00:00:59.600> guitar

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
so on this uh the basic rhythm guitar

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.849 
so on this uh the basic rhythm guitar
part<00:01:00.440> I<00:01:00.710> wanted<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.100> use<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.670> Josephson<00:01:02.420> c6<00:01:03.350> 17

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
part I wanted to use the Josephson c6 17

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.800 
part I wanted to use the Josephson c6 17
on<00:01:04.189> the<00:01:04.369> directional<00:01:04.879> mics<00:01:05.149> and<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.540> space

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
on the directional mics and the space

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.980 
on the directional mics and the space
pair<00:01:06.170> basically<00:01:06.950> get<00:01:07.159> a<00:01:07.189> very<00:01:07.460> wide<00:01:07.810> image<00:01:08.810> on

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
pair basically get a very wide image on

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.590 
pair basically get a very wide image on
the<00:01:09.189> guitar<00:01:10.189> part<00:01:10.460> as<00:01:10.580> well<00:01:10.759> as<00:01:10.909> having<00:01:11.149> up<00:01:11.450> you

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
the guitar part as well as having up you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.749 
the guitar part as well as having up you
know<00:01:11.750> capture<00:01:12.289> the<00:01:12.409> room<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:13.039> environment

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
know capture the room the environment

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.210 
know capture the room the environment
and<00:01:14.360> all<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.780> details<00:01:15.259> in<00:01:15.470> case<00:01:15.619> guitar<00:01:16.039> and

and all the details in case guitar and

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.399 
and all the details in case guitar and
that's<00:01:16.340> what<00:01:16.580> those<00:01:16.759> omni<00:01:17.180> capsules<00:01:17.990> give<00:01:18.200> me

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
that's what those omni capsules give me

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.200 
that's what those omni capsules give me
as<00:01:18.530> well<00:01:18.830> as<00:01:19.009> having<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.610> space<00:01:19.850> pair

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
as well as having the space pair

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.450 
as well as having the space pair
configuration

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.990 

you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.260 

so<00:01:35.510> my<00:01:35.630> reason<00:01:35.930> for<00:01:36.140> using<00:01:36.290> XY<00:01:36.890> for<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.520> for

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
so my reason for using XY for the for

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.539 
so my reason for using XY for the for
the<00:01:38.360> other<00:01:38.510> guitar<00:01:38.750> part<00:01:39.200> was<00:01:39.440> because<00:01:39.680> since

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
the other guitar part was because since

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.450 
the other guitar part was because since
I<00:01:40.700> was<00:01:40.850> using<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:41.600> extremely<00:01:42.500> wide<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:43.310> know

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
I was using this extremely wide you know

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.190 
I was using this extremely wide you know
acoustic<00:01:44.000> guitar<00:01:44.299> part<00:01:44.509> very<00:01:44.750> big<00:01:45.020> guitar

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
acoustic guitar part very big guitar

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.499 
acoustic guitar part very big guitar
part<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:46.280> know<00:01:46.430> I<00:01:46.700> needed<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.270> make<00:01:47.479> sure

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
part and you know I needed to make sure

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.060 
part and you know I needed to make sure
that<00:01:48.050> I<00:01:48.110> was<00:01:48.290> gonna<00:01:48.380> be<00:01:48.500> able<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.710> fit<00:01:48.920> these

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
that I was gonna be able to fit these

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.880 
that I was gonna be able to fit these
other<00:01:49.280> parts<00:01:49.640> in<00:01:49.820> in<00:01:50.060> potentially<00:01:50.930> mono<00:01:51.200> or<00:01:51.710> a

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
other parts in in potentially mono or a

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.399 
other parts in in potentially mono or a
more<00:01:52.700> narrow<00:01:53.030> stereo<00:01:53.570> image<00:01:53.869> if<00:01:54.080> I<00:01:54.229> had<00:01:54.320> this

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
more narrow stereo image if I had this

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.499 
more narrow stereo image if I had this
wide<00:01:54.740> space<00:01:55.520> pair<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:55.909> those<00:01:56.060> tracks

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
wide space pair of those tracks

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.010 
wide space pair of those tracks
I'd<00:01:56.840> be<00:01:57.020> limited<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:58.940> wide<00:01:59.240> space<00:01:59.630> pair

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
I'd be limited to that wide space pair

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.649 
I'd be limited to that wide space pair
and<00:02:00.229> I<00:02:00.320> never<00:02:00.560> fitted<00:02:00.979> into<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.369> mix<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:02.270> XY

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
and I never fitted into a mix the XY

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.359 
and I never fitted into a mix the XY
gave<00:02:02.930> me<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.170> option<00:02:03.440> of<00:02:03.530> maybe<00:02:03.740> only<00:02:04.009> using

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
gave me the option of maybe only using

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.070 
gave me the option of maybe only using
one<00:02:04.550> of<00:02:04.580> those<00:02:04.759> microphones<00:02:05.149> or<00:02:05.570> narrowing

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
one of those microphones or narrowing

between<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.519> know<00:02:13.610> XY<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.239> obviously<00:02:14.810> clean

chef's MK fours with the mint X which

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.900 
chef's MK fours with the mint X which

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
cardioid capsules so also you know less

cardioid capsules so also you know less
room<00:03:15.290> tone<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.860> things<00:03:16.070> like<00:03:16.250> that
