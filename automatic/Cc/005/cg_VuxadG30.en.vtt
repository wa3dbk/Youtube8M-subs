the basis of his MRI scan you know he
had<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> very<00:00:18.210> large<00:00:18.570> brain<00:00:18.930> tumor<00:00:19.310> but<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.460> was

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
had a very large brain tumor but it was

had a very large brain tumor but it was
and<00:00:20.850> his<00:00:21.000> frontal<00:00:21.420> lobe<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:22.019> just<00:00:23.010> started

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
and his frontal lobe I just started

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.870 
and his frontal lobe I just started
having<00:00:23.430> these<00:00:24.119> really<00:00:24.480> odd<00:00:25.760> sensations<00:00:26.760> like

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
go through but for nura oncologists we

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.340

view this as a disease that you know
everybody<00:02:05.010> is<00:02:05.220> different<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:06.170> when<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.290> look

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
everybody is different so when you look

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.059 
everybody is different so when you look
at<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.830> bell<00:02:08.069> curve<00:02:09.379> you<00:02:10.379> can't<00:02:10.649> say<00:02:10.860> that

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
at the bell curve you can't say that

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.680 
at the bell curve you can't say that
everybody's<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> death<00:02:12.030> sentence<00:02:12.510> there's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
everybody's a death sentence there's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.750 
everybody's a death sentence there's
always<00:02:12.930> going<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.290> be<00:02:13.350> somebody<00:02:13.770> that's

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
always going to be somebody that's

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.000 
always going to be somebody that's
going<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:14.970> do<00:02:15.150> better<00:02:15.420> than<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.870> average<00:02:16.019> and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
going to do better than the average and

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.259 
going to do better than the average and
there's<00:02:17.189> always<00:02:17.400> going<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.700> be<00:02:17.790> somebody

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
there's always going to be somebody

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.550 
there's always going to be somebody
that's<00:02:18.360> going<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.689> have<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> chance<00:02:19.349> of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
that's going to have a chance of

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.550 
that's going to have a chance of
responding<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.370> therapy<00:02:20.629> and<00:02:21.629> so<00:02:22.079> with<00:02:22.379> that

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
responding to therapy and so with that

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.030 
responding to therapy and so with that
type<00:02:22.829> of<00:02:22.860> attitude<00:02:24.019> you<00:02:25.019> will<00:02:25.260> get<00:02:25.530> patients

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
type of attitude you will get patients

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.160 
type of attitude you will get patients
that<00:02:26.489> will<00:02:26.670> respond<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.329> treatment<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.870> will

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
that will respond to treatment that will

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.440 
that will respond to treatment that will
respond<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.799> therapy<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:30.269> will

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
respond to therapy and that will

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.509 
respond to therapy and that will
eventually<00:02:30.720> become<00:02:31.140> long-term<00:02:31.590> survivors

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
eventually become long-term survivors

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.479 
eventually become long-term survivors
like<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.420> tim<00:02:34.260> has<00:02:34.470> become<00:02:34.829> I<00:02:35.129> had<00:02:35.459> a

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
like like to tim has become I had a

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.990 
like like to tim has become I had a
incision<00:02:36.390> from<00:02:36.720> here<00:02:37.110> up<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.430> around<00:02:38.670> down<00:02:38.970> to

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
incision from here up and around down to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.940 
incision from here up and around down to
the<00:02:39.870> ear<00:02:40.079> and<00:02:41.540> they've<00:02:42.540> removed<00:02:43.379> pretty<00:02:43.799> good

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
the ear and they've removed pretty good

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.270 
the ear and they've removed pretty good
section<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.879> skull<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:46.200> get<00:02:46.470> at<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.920> tumor

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
section of the skull to get at the tumor

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.879 
section of the skull to get at the tumor
and<00:02:48.470> they<00:02:49.470> removed<00:02:50.310> about<00:02:50.579> 90%<00:02:51.569> of<00:02:51.629> it<00:02:51.889> which

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
and they removed about 90% of it which

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.140 
and they removed about 90% of it which
is<00:02:53.069> phenomenal

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.240 

they<00:02:57.150> had<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:57.750> stop<00:02:57.959> because<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:59.129> know

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
they had to stop because of you know

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.800 
they had to stop because of you know
what<00:02:59.970> vessels<00:03:00.329> are<00:03:00.420> something<00:03:00.629> that<00:03:00.659> were

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
what vessels are something that were

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.569 
what vessels are something that were
real<00:03:01.019> close<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.470> they<00:03:01.530> didn't<00:03:01.769> want<00:03:01.889> to<00:03:01.980> run

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
real close and they didn't want to run

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.789 
real close and they didn't want to run
the<00:03:02.700> risk<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.840> know<00:03:03.930> me<00:03:04.139> bleeding<00:03:04.500> out<00:03:04.620> or

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
the risk of you know me bleeding out or

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.789 
the risk of you know me bleeding out or
anything<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.629> they're<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:07.230> rest<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
anything so they're the rest of the

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.319 
anything so they're the rest of the
treatment<00:03:08.250> would<00:03:08.370> be<00:03:08.579> then<00:03:08.940> with<00:03:09.180> the

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
treatment would be then with the

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.839 
treatment would be then with the
radiation<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.290> chemo<00:03:10.579> if<00:03:11.579> you<00:03:11.790> are

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
radiation and the chemo if you are

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.640 
radiation and the chemo if you are
feeling<00:03:12.329> is<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:13.049> something<00:03:13.260> that

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
feeling is that this is something that

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.460 
feeling is that this is something that
you<00:03:13.889> want<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.220> try<00:03:14.519> to<00:03:15.290> optimize<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
you want to try to optimize the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.050 
you want to try to optimize the
treatment<00:03:16.889> for<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.129> patient<00:03:17.609> you<00:03:17.730> want<00:03:17.970> to

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
treatment for the patient you want to

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.729 
treatment for the patient you want to
try<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.239> push<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.690> envelope<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.169> as<00:03:19.379> far<00:03:19.620> as

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
try to push the envelope to as far as

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.949 
try to push the envelope to as far as
you<00:03:19.829> can<00:03:20.010> go<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.519> try<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.299> get<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.780> patient

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
you can go and try to get the patient

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.800 
you can go and try to get the patient
the<00:03:22.260> best<00:03:22.500> chance<00:03:22.799> for<00:03:22.889> survival<00:03:23.480> then<00:03:24.480> that's

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
the best chance for survival then that's

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.979 
the best chance for survival then that's
then<00:03:25.349> I<00:03:25.650> think<00:03:25.919> that's<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.280> main<00:03:26.489> difference

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
then I think that's the main difference

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.979 
then I think that's the main difference
and<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.919> in<00:03:29.099> Tim's<00:03:29.370> case<00:03:29.579> we<00:03:29.879> really<00:03:30.660> did

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
and and and in Tim's case we really did

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.629 
and and and in Tim's case we really did
push<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.410> envelope<00:03:31.560> he<00:03:31.919> had<00:03:32.069> two<00:03:32.280> surgeries

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
push that envelope he had two surgeries

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.300 
push that envelope he had two surgeries
he<00:03:33.090> had<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.540> full<00:03:34.260> gamut<00:03:34.500> radiation

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
he had the full gamut radiation

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.189 
he had the full gamut radiation
chemotherapy<00:03:35.699> but<00:03:36.359> he's<00:03:36.480> still<00:03:36.720> alive<00:03:36.959> today

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
chemotherapy but he's still alive today

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.520 
chemotherapy but he's still alive today
right<00:03:37.739> before<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.340> full<00:03:38.669> surgeries

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
right before the full surgeries

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.259 
right before the full surgeries
especially<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.650> second<00:03:40.949> one<00:03:41.069> I<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.400> remember

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
especially the second one I I remember

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.629 
especially the second one I I remember
talking<00:03:42.419> to<00:03:42.750> him<00:03:42.870> when<00:03:43.680> he<00:03:43.799> came<00:03:43.980> in<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.250> said<00:03:44.430> I

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
talking to him when he came in I said I

need you to hit this one out of the park

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.369 
need you to hit this one out of the park
and<00:03:47.000> he<00:03:48.000> just<00:03:48.239> laughed<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.780> said<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.169> yeah<00:03:49.290> I
