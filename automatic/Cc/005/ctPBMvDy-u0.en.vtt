00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
remember we tried to flatten this out as

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.690 
remember we tried to flatten this out as
much<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.659> possible<00:01:22.039> but<00:01:23.039> we<00:01:23.250> had<00:01:23.399> too<00:01:23.580> much

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
much as possible but we had too much

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.260 
much as possible but we had too much
water<00:01:24.289> two<00:01:25.289> by<00:01:25.439> sixes<00:01:25.920> here<00:01:26.520> when<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.000> had<00:01:27.119> too

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
water two by sixes here when we had too

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.779 
water two by sixes here when we had too
much<00:01:27.420> water<00:01:27.659> collecting<00:01:28.409> down<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:28.890> at<00:01:29.640> one

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
much water collecting down here at one

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.539 
much water collecting down here at one
point<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.149> was<00:01:30.179> 17<00:01:30.720> inches<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.649> put<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> laser

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
point it was 17 inches but I put a laser

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.539 
point it was 17 inches but I put a laser
line<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.600> now<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.189> we<00:01:35.189> should<00:01:35.399> be

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
line on it and now it's we should be

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.100 
line on it and now it's we should be
good<00:01:36.020> we<00:01:37.020> should<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.350> good<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.810> down<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:40.049> I

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
good we should be good so down here I

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.800 
good we should be good so down here I
think<00:01:40.259> we're<00:01:40.470> gonna<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.830> to<00:01:41.179> add<00:01:42.179> maybe<00:01:42.390> two

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
think we're gonna have to add maybe two

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.320 
think we're gonna have to add maybe two
stack<00:01:43.319> to<00:01:43.649> two<00:01:44.039> by<00:01:44.280> twelves<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:44.850> top<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.240> each

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
stack to two by twelves on top of each

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.219

all right so we've got all our supports
all<00:05:24.350> the<00:05:24.410> way<00:05:24.650> around

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
all the way around

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.360 
all the way around
we're<00:05:25.640> leaving<00:05:25.940> these<00:05:26.090> high<00:05:26.390> over<00:05:26.810> here

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
we're leaving these high over here

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.180 
we're leaving these high over here
because<00:05:28.370> we're<00:05:28.820> gonna<00:05:28.910> put<00:05:29.210> another<00:05:29.830> 2x4<00:05:30.830> or

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
because we're gonna put another 2x4 or

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.570 
because we're gonna put another 2x4 or
2x6<00:05:33.100> along<00:05:34.100> the<00:05:34.280> top<00:05:34.550> and<00:05:35.150> put<00:05:35.960> some<00:05:36.230> of<00:05:36.260> these

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
2x6 along the top and put some of these

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.000 
2x6 along the top and put some of these
braces<00:05:37.580> along<00:05:38.210> that<00:05:38.450> side<00:05:38.810> because<00:05:39.020> we're

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
braces along that side because we're

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.170 
braces along that side because we're
gonna<00:05:40.100> need<00:05:40.280> a<00:05:40.340> little<00:05:40.550> bit<00:05:40.669> more<00:05:40.910> height

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
gonna need a little bit more height

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.650 
gonna need a little bit more height
because<00:05:41.450> we<00:05:41.630> should<00:05:41.870> have<00:05:42.050> about<00:05:42.320> 13<00:05:42.860> or<00:05:43.660> 13

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
because we should have about 13 or 13

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.140 
because we should have about 13 or 13
inches<00:05:44.930> of<00:05:44.990> water<00:05:45.260> maybe<00:05:45.650> down<00:05:46.280> here<00:05:46.669> which

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
inches of water maybe down here which

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.050 
inches of water maybe down here which
will<00:05:47.180> give<00:05:47.480> us<00:05:47.860> about<00:05:48.860> three<00:05:49.190> inches<00:05:49.520> down<00:05:49.760> on

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
will give us about three inches down on

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.370 
will give us about three inches down on
this<00:05:50.390> end<00:05:50.630> but<00:05:52.060> that's<00:05:53.060> better<00:05:53.270> than<00:05:53.570> the<00:05:53.780> 17

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
this end but that's better than the 17

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.010 
this end but that's better than the 17
