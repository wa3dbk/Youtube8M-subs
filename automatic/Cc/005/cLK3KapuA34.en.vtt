last<00:00:07.950> time<00:00:08.219> I<00:00:08.460> showed<00:00:08.549> you<00:00:08.940> how<00:00:09.059> to

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
last time I showed you how to

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.910 
last time I showed you how to
successfully<00:00:09.360> calibrate<00:00:10.290> your<00:00:10.440> auto<00:00:10.650> guider

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
successfully calibrate your auto guider

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.459 
successfully calibrate your auto guider
in<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:12.030> video<00:00:12.360> I'm<00:00:12.690> going<00:00:12.959> to<00:00:13.019> show<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.260> how

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.410 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:13.500> start<00:00:13.799> an<00:00:14.010> auto<00:00:14.190> guided<00:00:14.520> session<00:00:14.939> and<00:00:15.119> what

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
to start an auto guided session and what

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.230 
to start an auto guided session and what
successful<00:00:15.990> auto<00:00:16.199> guiding<00:00:16.560> should<00:00:16.770> look<00:00:16.949> like

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
successful auto guiding should look like

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.000
