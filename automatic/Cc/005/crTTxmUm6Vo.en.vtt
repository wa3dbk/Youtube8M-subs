coming out too of it to about a foot and
a<00:00:20.760> half<00:00:20.910> two<00:00:21.240> feet<00:00:22.010> then<00:00:23.010> step<00:00:23.430> one<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:24.029> go

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
a half two feet then step one we go

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.620 
a half two feet then step one we go
ahead<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.900> take<00:00:25.800> take<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.279> screwdriver<00:00:26.970> or<00:00:27.300> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
ahead and take take a screwdriver or a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.089 
ahead and take take a screwdriver or a
bar<00:00:28.199> or<00:00:28.230> anything<00:00:28.800> similar<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.710> pigtail<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
bar or anything similar and pigtail the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.130 
bar or anything similar and pigtail the
wire<00:00:32.340> what<00:00:32.910> that's<00:00:33.120> doing<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.780> gives<00:00:34.020> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
wire what that's doing is that gives you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.040 
wire what that's doing is that gives you
some<00:00:34.380> excess<00:00:34.950> play<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.270> case<00:00:36.510> they<00:00:36.870> get

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
some excess play in case they get

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.470 
some excess play in case they get
snagged<00:00:37.469> by<00:00:37.860> anything<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.059> won't<00:00:39.270> break

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
snagged by anything and it won't break

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.040 
snagged by anything and it won't break
the<00:00:39.660> wire<00:00:40.040> and<00:00:41.040> go<00:00:41.370> ahead<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.879> separate<00:00:42.809> these

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the wire and go ahead and separate these

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.130 
the wire and go ahead and separate these
two<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.239> beak<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.930> make<00:00:46.110> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
two so you have a beak so you can make a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.709 
two so you have a beak so you can make a
connection<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:46.920> them<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.550> go<00:00:48.120> ahead<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.390> go

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
connection with them and go ahead and go

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:49.880 
connection with them and go ahead and go
ahead<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.930> do<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.320> both<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.770> your

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
ahead and do that to both of your

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.490 
ahead and do that to both of your
sensors<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.760> then<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.719> go<00:00:51.840> ahead<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.289> get

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
sensors and then we can go ahead and get

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.770 
sensors and then we can go ahead and get
them<00:00:52.620> installed<00:00:53.039> down<00:00:53.309> at<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> door<00:00:53.789> go<00:00:54.629> ahead

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
them installed down at the door go ahead

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.150 
them installed down at the door go ahead
and<00:00:54.960> start<00:00:55.320> by<00:00:55.670> giving<00:00:56.670> yourself<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:57.300> nice

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
and start by giving yourself a nice

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160 
and start by giving yourself a nice
amount<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.340> wire<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.820> work<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.329> before<00:01:00.899> you

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
amount of wire to work with before you

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.060 
amount of wire to work with before you
cut<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.660> make<00:01:03.840> your<00:01:04.049> splice<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
cut it just to make your splice in to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.160 
cut it just to make your splice in to
replace<00:01:05.460> your<00:01:05.640> sensors<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:07.110> ahead

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
replace your sensors and just go ahead

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.550 
replace your sensors and just go ahead
and<00:01:07.350> split<00:01:07.680> your<00:01:07.740> wire<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.540> separate<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> two

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
and split your wire and separate the two

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.090 
and split your wire and separate the two
so<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.220> make<00:01:11.820> your<00:01:11.970> connection<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.920> go

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
so you can make your connection and go

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.280 
so you can make your connection and go
ahead<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.310> undo<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:15.390> safety<00:01:15.689> your<00:01:16.080> old

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
ahead and undo your safety your old
