00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.680
 I do not know how to say it does not make any difference to them 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.539
 I want to say 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.730

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.529
 the video that you are going to continue that you are going to 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.289

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.529
 that he would improve in the 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.259
 camps is to say that I have less 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.410
 troops of what would be the town hall 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.410
 five 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.230
 I already have everything so you can do it 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:43.030
 with more giants or with more sun a 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.530
 try ok and well let's go to the video 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.739
 hello to all people what if they are 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.660
 welcome to a new video this time 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.940
 are two pharming attacks with 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.670
 City Hall 5 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.800
 and nothing I hope you like 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.960
 good guys we start with the first 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.730
 attack here you see that a team of 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.730
 radio in the mortar 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.840
 in pain but 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.740
 and well there and everything that speaks 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.360
 what formerly clear nurse 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.829
 especially when on the roads to 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.829
 that the giants of the administration 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.390
 I'm trying to prove it was here 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.390
 to break that 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:44.480
 really surrounded the idea with archer 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.040
 while the giants 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.040
 of distraction for dementia 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.200
 and they were 160 thousand gold and about 40,000 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.180
 you see 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.180
 40,000 gold and 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.910
 If 60,000 of choosing you know what 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:13.800
 wearing 90 archers is a spell of 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.850
 radio and 7 plantes and good rear of the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.850
 first attack farming 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.060
 now we go to the second 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.380
 and well here we are with the second to 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.810
 transforming 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.750
 there we see 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.430
 take advantage of outsiders with the 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.910
 students and loose another ray in 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.910
 mortars 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.450
 and in two ingested rafts 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.530
 out there 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.730
 basically to break everything 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.900
 And there it comes 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.900
 for you 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.680
 I met her inside 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.680
 in the wall unfortunately 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:26.319
 the bad but if you see 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.819
 when we were there he carried 46% 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:33.480
 and thanks to that 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.239
 builder cottage campaign paid the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.240
 50 percent but as you can see it has 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.190
 taken here puts it 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.910
 in the upper right corner has 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.800
 born 40 thousand decade 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.440
 although I could have taken more if 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.880
 would have made other armies and use 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.880
 45 giants 4507 elves and as a 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.120
