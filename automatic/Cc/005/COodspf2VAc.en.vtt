 what I see sincerity is right 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:22.139
 I realized that right before we go here I am in him 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.310
 I believe here that is, he sings honestly and for 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.760
 I am one of the most important 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.760
 indicators 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.540
 I like this 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.580
 oddly enough but the world in which almost 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.639
 there was nothing but one person and 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.400
 it was enough it is also one of 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:41.220
 the most important factors that I want 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.320
 look at the artist it was good how 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.220
 they will choose between you and here 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.840
 choose we already looked don't wait 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.509
 sardor has not yet spoken I mean 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.100
 we listened nicholas ii you suspension 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.660
 i'm told georgy or nikolay now 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.060
 goes further to the super final I would 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.800
 confused I don't know i would just i don't 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.360
 I know I â€™d wear a stealth hat so me 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.490
 could not see well what to say in this 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.410
 case I can not move away from the past 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.550
 a week when you so convincingly created 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.919
 image of italian 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.100
 you were so elegant to me even 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:15.000
 it seems in and you were quite a young father 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.039
 then now already the father of a child has 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.090
 ok vparut thanks all is well 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:22.320
 fibers so creating a week ago this 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.599
 gorgeous image 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.030
 an italian guy who is so cool 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:29.340
 I sang right now I have the feeling that you are Italian 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.620
 who performs in the competition today 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.620
 obligatory day of russian song 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.800
 so if you add a little bit to that 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:41.210
 accents I will believe you even more 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:45.180
 it seems that now there was a climax 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:48.060
 artist's song for Russia channel i.e. 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.380
 This is an ideal case and he even 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.120
 similar to Stas Mikhailov 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.760
 sorry of course the best way 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.840
 of this word but in fact everything is very 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:01.289
 format on nicely and there soundly if 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.900
 want to sleep great what are they him 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:06.210
 torment yes that's what they torment him here 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.409
 can I have great respect 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.559
 to producers 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:13.449
 but there is explained now there until 6 just 

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:16.449
 took the microphone and said just 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:18.869
 delightful and he has everything 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:22.269
 quite amazing feature that at 

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:25.479
 other members here in our team 

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:27.789
 no he is like an experienced fisherman he 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:30.069
 the beginning of the song is enough to search for this person 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:32.519
 here it hooks him on the hook and then in 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:36.399
 during the whole song 

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:38.229
 winded called bait yes and 

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:41.169
 here somehow and the end of the song you already 

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:44.439
 you become just completely in his what 

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:48.309
 called the power of his power him there 

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:51.369
 talent and such honey voices 

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:53.289
 it seems to me that here in this song is still 

00:07:51.369 --> 00:07:56.550
 nevertheless you showed your right nikolai 

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:59.079
 I liked the best qualities 

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:03.239
 It was a difficult task, but it did 

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:03.239
 well done thank you
