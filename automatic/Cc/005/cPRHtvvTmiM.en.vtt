we have to get it like how that is like
that<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:20.180> just<00:01:21.180> guess<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:22.619> easy

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
that I just guess really it's easy

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.940 
that I just guess really it's easy
enough<00:01:22.979> that's<00:01:23.970> fine<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.330> just<00:01:24.360> shake<00:01:27.950> until

all<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.250> lights<00:01:29.430> are<00:01:29.670> green<00:01:33.590> number<00:01:34.590> 42<00:01:35.130> is

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
all the lights are green number 42 is

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:44.520 
all the lights are green number 42 is
this<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.229> fire<00:01:39.320> left<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.590> water

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.190 

/<00:01:45.250> 43<00:01:45.580> is<00:01:46.409> tilt<00:01:47.409> until<00:01:48.070> you<00:01:48.159> get<00:01:48.280> there<00:01:49.080> pick<00:01:50.080> up

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
/ 43 is tilt until you get there pick up

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.899 
/ 43 is tilt until you get there pick up
the<00:01:50.290> bucket<00:01:50.470> pick<00:01:50.830> up<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.070> road<00:01:51.220> use<00:01:51.760> the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
the bucket pick up the road use the

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.700 
the bucket pick up the road use the
remote<00:01:52.060> on<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.540> TV<00:01:53.290> and<00:01:54.330> that<00:01:55.330> shows<00:01:55.659> it's<00:01:56.020> 27

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
remote on the TV and that shows it's 27

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:08.669 
remote on the TV and that shows it's 27
so<00:01:57.070> 27<00:02:04.200> number<00:02:05.200> 44<00:02:06.009> is<00:02:07.259> pick<00:02:08.259> up<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.410> brush

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
so 27 number 44 is pick up the brush

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.040 
so 27 number 44 is pick up the brush
there<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.899> should<00:02:11.140> use<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.739> brush<00:02:11.950> on<00:02:12.459> this

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
there you should use the brush on this

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.070 
there you should use the brush on this
next<00:02:14.050> ently<00:02:14.470> clicked<00:02:14.739> on<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.690> squares<00:02:16.690> but

next ently clicked on the squares but

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.720 
next ently clicked on the squares but
that's<00:02:17.650> why<00:02:17.920> because<00:02:18.100> it's<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.370> right<00:02:18.519> one

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
that's why because it's the right one

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.509 
that's why because it's the right one
but<00:02:19.180> not<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.660> right<00:02:19.959> one<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.290> be<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.440> bed<00:02:20.650> this

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
but not the right one to be a bed this

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:30.990 
but not the right one to be a bed this
one<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.910> be<00:02:22.030> human<00:02:25.019> there<00:02:29.220> 45<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:30.819> want<00:02:30.970> to

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
one to be human there 45 is you want to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.970 
one to be human there 45 is you want to
get<00:02:31.150> keep<00:02:31.720> pressing<00:02:32.050> this<00:02:32.140> dial<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.830> get

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
get keep pressing this dial to you get

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:45.949 
get keep pressing this dial to you get
45<00:02:38.940> there<00:02:43.470> 46<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.680> match<00:02:44.920> these<00:02:45.160> with<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.519> door

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
45 there 46 is match these with the door

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:55.350 
45 there 46 is match these with the door
so<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:46.989> would<00:02:47.350> be<00:02:48.570> like<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.380> like<00:02:50.410> that

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:09.250 

and<00:02:56.360> this<00:02:56.600> would<00:02:56.810> be<00:02:57.200> like<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:03.580> like<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:08.260> 47

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
and this would be like that like that 47

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.600 
and this would be like that like that 47
is<00:03:09.580> slide<00:03:10.580> this<00:03:10.819> to<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.240> left<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:13.220> then<00:03:13.370> don't
