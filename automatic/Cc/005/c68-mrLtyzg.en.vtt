00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
today's video we're going to be tackling

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.670 
today's video we're going to be tackling
the<00:00:20.730> third<00:00:20.910> base<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.359> cow<00:00:21.750> sun<00:00:22.080> temple<00:00:22.320> and

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
the third base on cow sun temple and

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.590 
the third base on cow sun temple and
this<00:00:23.250> was<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> very<00:00:23.550> highly<00:00:23.910> requested<00:00:24.300> video

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
this was a very highly requested video

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.210 
this was a very highly requested video
because<00:00:25.050> i<00:00:25.140> find<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.560> lot<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.710> people<00:00:25.800> have

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
because i find that a lot of people have

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.970 
because i find that a lot of people have
a<00:00:26.250> hard<00:00:26.580> time<00:00:26.900> on<00:00:27.900> offense<00:00:28.410> for<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.800> third

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
a hard time on offense for this third

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.349 
a hard time on offense for this third
base<00:00:29.189> because<00:00:29.609> there's<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.910> really<00:00:30.090> large

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
base because there's a really large

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.930 
base because there's a really large
choke<00:00:30.810> point<00:00:31.099> pretty<00:00:32.099> much<00:00:32.250> every<00:00:32.669> everything

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
choke point pretty much every everything

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.930 
choke point pretty much every everything
up<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.739> bomb<00:00:34.950> sites<00:00:35.280> or<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.700> mcom

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
up to the the bomb sites or the mcom

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.209 
up to the the bomb sites or the mcom
stations<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.170> gigantic<00:00:37.680> choke<00:00:37.950> point

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
stations is it's a gigantic choke point

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.400 
stations is it's a gigantic choke point
so<00:00:39.210> hopefully<00:00:39.540> i<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.750> give<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.079> guys<00:00:40.230> some

third<00:00:42.780> base<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.309> hopefully<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.340> guys<00:00:44.489> can

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
third base and hopefully you guys can

third base and hopefully you guys can
learn<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> couple<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.270> things<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> first

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
learn a couple of things so the first

learn a couple of things so the first
thing<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.800> isn't<00:00:47.280> probably<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> most

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
thing that isn't probably the most

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.940 
thing that isn't probably the most

important part about this first ARB
sorry<00:00:50.360> this<00:00:51.360> last<00:00:51.750> base<00:00:52.610> for<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.730> map<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
sorry this last base for this map is the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.240 
sorry this last base for this map is the
fact<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.930> not<00:00:55.110> want<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.710> chill<00:00:56.010> out

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
fact that you do not want to chill out

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.799 
fact that you do not want to chill out
in<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.640> backfield<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.270> i<00:00:57.360> am<00:00:57.480> doing<00:00:57.660> right

in the backfield like i am doing right
now<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.550> kind<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.579> throwing<00:00:59.820> grenades

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
now and just kind of throwing grenades

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.760 
now and just kind of throwing grenades
at<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> enemy<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.020> hoping<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.649> you're

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770

there's so many games i'm actually in
where<00:01:30.650> basically<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.009> my<00:01:32.369> allies<00:01:32.729> and

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
where basically the out my allies and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.800 
where basically the out my allies and
the<00:01:35.340> enemy<00:01:35.520> are<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:36.000> throwing<00:01:36.540> grenades

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the enemy are just throwing grenades

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.210 
the enemy are just throwing grenades
back<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.409> forth<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.890> does<00:01:38.070> not

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
back and forth and it does not

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.300 
back and forth and it does not
accomplish<00:01:38.700> anything<00:01:39.619> except<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.189> fact

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
accomplish anything except for the fact

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.219 
accomplish anything except for the fact
that<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.570> enemy<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.869> going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.079> win

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that the the enemy is going to win

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.219 
that the the enemy is going to win
basically<00:01:43.920> because<00:01:44.280> they're<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.759> going<00:01:44.880> to

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
basically because they're just going to

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.840 
basically because they're just going to
they<00:01:46.229> don't<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.560> tickets<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.399> that's

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
they don't have tickets you do that's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.889 
they don't have tickets you do that's
just<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.210> how<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.450> going<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.600> work<00:01:48.659> out

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
just going to how it's going to work out

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.510 
just going to how it's going to work out
so<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.740> I'd<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.130> when<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.280> actually

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
so what I'd like to do when I actually

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.300 
so what I'd like to do when I actually
am<00:01:50.850> able<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.210> push<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.229> go<00:01:52.530> on<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.130> right

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
am able to push up is to go on the right

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.620 
am able to push up is to go on the right
side<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.790> going<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.030> my<00:01:54.149> first<00:01:54.329> route

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
side this is going to be my first route

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.020 
side this is going to be my first route
that<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> usually<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.320> take<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.030> you

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that I usually like to take and you

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.569 
that I usually like to take and you
pretty<00:01:57.840> much<00:01:57.930> fault<00:01:58.229> follow<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.860> side<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
pretty much fault follow the side of the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.609 
pretty much fault follow the side of the
hill<00:01:59.700> or<00:02:00.240> mountain<00:02:00.329> or<00:02:00.689> whatever<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.229> all

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
hill or mountain or whatever that is all

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.410 
hill or mountain or whatever that is all
the<00:02:01.950> way<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.399> side<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.729> base<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.119> then

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the way to the side of the base and then

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.179 
the way to the side of the base and then
once<00:02:03.780> someone<00:02:04.200> has<00:02:04.229> actually<00:02:04.710> planted<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
once someone has actually planted the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.310 
once someone has actually planted the
income<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:06.119> can<00:02:06.450> pretty<00:02:06.990> much<00:02:07.049> clear

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
income you can pretty much clear

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.630 
income you can pretty much clear
everyone<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.950> actually<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.310> easier

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
everyone out so it actually is easier

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.249 
everyone out so it actually is easier
for<00:02:08.819> them<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.970> plant<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.509> then<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.110> can

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
for them to plant it and then you can

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.540 
for them to plant it and then you can
kind<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.470> chill<00:02:10.649> out<00:02:10.739> right<00:02:10.920> here<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.370> have

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
kind of chill out right here and I have

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.770 
kind of chill out right here and I have
some<00:02:11.760> allies<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.360> my<00:02:12.480> right

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
some allies to my right

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.150 
some allies to my right
me<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.290> they<00:02:13.350> can<00:02:13.530> kill<00:02:13.709> anyone<00:02:13.980> that's

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
me so that they can kill anyone that's

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.070 
me so that they can kill anyone that's
going<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.580> be<00:02:14.700> spawning<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.780> direction

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
going to be spawning in that direction

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.960 
going to be spawning in that direction
so<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.380> feel<00:02:16.560> pretty<00:02:16.770> safe<00:02:16.950> right<00:02:17.190> here<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.610> if

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
so I feel pretty safe right here and if

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.100 
so I feel pretty safe right here and if
you<00:02:18.000> have<00:02:18.180> an<00:02:18.270> ally<00:02:18.420> kind<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.780> watching<00:02:18.930> your

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
you have an ally kind of watching your

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.210 
you have an ally kind of watching your
back<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.410> if<00:02:19.500> you're<00:02:19.590> watching<00:02:19.709> your<00:02:19.950> back<00:02:20.040> as

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
back and if you're watching your back as

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.090 
back and if you're watching your back as
well<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> very<00:02:21.450> very<00:02:22.290> nice<00:02:22.560> defensive

well this is a very very nice defensive
position<00:02:23.459> where<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:23.850> pretty<00:02:23.970> much<00:02:24.090> take

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
position where you can pretty much take

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.430 
position where you can pretty much take
anyone<00:02:24.690> else<00:02:24.840> that's<00:02:24.990> going<00:02:25.140> for<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.350> m

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
anyone else that's going for the m

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.410 
anyone else that's going for the m
compensation<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.850> have<00:02:27.060> some<00:02:27.300> nice

nice<00:02:30.620> nice<00:02:31.620> place<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:31.980> chill<00:02:32.130> out<00:02:32.540> action<00:02:33.540> once

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
nice nice place to chill out action once

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
you actually take the a.m compensation

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.690 
you actually take the a.m compensation
you<00:02:35.880> can<00:02:36.090> move<00:02:36.209> up<00:02:36.420> towards<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.170> B<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.489> what

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
you can move up towards the B and what

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.550 
you can move up towards the B and what
I'd<00:02:38.790> like<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:38.940> do<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.390> like<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.540> once<00:02:40.410> I've

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
I'd like to do is I like to once I've

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.020 
I'd like to do is I like to once I've
taken<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.130> like<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.430> move<00:02:41.550> on<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.880> right

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
taken it I like to move on the right

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.150 
taken it I like to move on the right
side<00:02:42.239> again<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.810> then<00:02:43.319> make<00:02:43.560> my<00:02:43.739> way<00:02:43.770> over<00:02:43.950> to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
side again and then make my way over to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.560 
side again and then make my way over to
the<00:02:44.280> opening<00:02:44.700> where<00:02:44.880> they<00:02:45.000> actually<00:02:45.150> start<00:02:45.540> to

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
the opening where they actually start to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.650 
the opening where they actually start to
spawn<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.140> funnel<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.650> towards<00:02:47.180> this<00:02:48.180> temple

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
spawn and funnel in towards this temple

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.870 
spawn and funnel in towards this temple
area<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:50.070> find<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.550> get<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.700> lot<00:02:50.850> of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
area and I find that I get a lot of

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.430 
area and I find that I get a lot of
kills<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.269> way<00:02:51.480> because<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:52.080> can<00:02:52.230> kind<00:02:52.410> of

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
kills this way because you can kind of

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.340 
kills this way because you can kind of
just<00:02:52.500> throw<00:02:52.830> grenades<00:02:53.360> in<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.600> choke<00:02:54.810> point<00:02:54.840> I

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
just throw grenades in the choke point I

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.870 
just throw grenades in the choke point I
think<00:02:55.680> there's<00:02:55.920> only<00:02:56.010> really<00:02:56.250> one<00:02:56.430> way<00:02:56.670> for

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
think there's only really one way for

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.550 
think there's only really one way for
them<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.239> actually<00:02:57.420> get<00:02:57.750> into<00:02:57.989> this<00:02:58.080> point<00:02:58.380> and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
them to actually get into this point and

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.059 
them to actually get into this point and
so<00:02:58.950> if<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.220> just<00:02:59.400> kind<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.640> throw<00:02:59.819> grenades<00:03:00.180> in

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
so if you just kind of throw grenades in

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.840 
so if you just kind of throw grenades in
towards<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.190> area<00:03:02.310> you're<00:03:02.519> gonna<00:03:02.610> get<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.790> lot

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
towards that area you're gonna get a lot

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.370 
towards that area you're gonna get a lot
of<00:03:02.910> kills<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:03.690> going<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.870> make<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.110> very

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
of kills and it's going to make it very

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.809 
of kills and it's going to make it very
difficult<00:03:04.620> for<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.040> enemy<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.310> try<00:03:05.550> and

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
difficult for the enemy to try and

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.880 
difficult for the enemy to try and
actually<00:03:06.150> start<00:03:06.870> defending<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.800> am

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
actually start defending the am

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.920 
actually start defending the am
compensation<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:08.730> it's<00:03:09.480> definitely<00:03:09.750> one

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
compensation so it's definitely one

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.479 
compensation so it's definitely one
route<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.140> really<00:03:10.560> really<00:03:10.800> enjoy<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.340> think

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
route I really really enjoy and I think

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.910 
route I really really enjoy and I think
this<00:03:11.550> is<00:03:11.610> probably<00:03:11.819> my<00:03:12.030> favorite<00:03:12.060> route<00:03:12.920> so

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
this is probably my favorite route so

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.170 
this is probably my favorite route so
the<00:03:14.160> second<00:03:14.459> round<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:14.670> I'd<00:03:14.819> like<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.030> take

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
the second round that I'd like to take

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.759 
the second round that I'd like to take
is<00:03:15.420> where<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.630> go<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.170> left<00:03:16.380> side<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.590> the

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
is where I go on the left side of the

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.460 
is where I go on the left side of the
map<00:03:17.070> or<00:03:17.250> left<00:03:17.700> side<00:03:17.850> on<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.090> beach<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.660> make

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
map or left side on the beach and make

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.100 
map or left side on the beach and make
my<00:03:19.620> way<00:03:19.769> over<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.160> small<00:03:20.579> opening<00:03:21.110> towards

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
my way over to the small opening towards

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.780 
my way over to the small opening towards
this<00:03:22.230> direction<00:03:22.340> basically<00:03:23.340> behind<00:03:23.640> this

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
this direction basically behind this

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.180 
this direction basically behind this
gigantic<00:03:24.329> tree<00:03:24.570> over<00:03:24.750> here<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.140> there's<00:03:26.040> two

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
gigantic tree over here and there's two

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.830 
gigantic tree over here and there's two
ways<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.549> get<00:03:26.640> over<00:03:26.760> one<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.390> through<00:03:27.810> a

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
ways and get over one is through a

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.380 
ways and get over one is through a
little<00:03:28.260> mound<00:03:28.620> hill<00:03:28.980> thing<00:03:29.280> which<00:03:29.880> my<00:03:30.120> allies

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
little mound hill thing which my allies

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.580 
little mound hill thing which my allies
going<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.750> do<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:30.959> in<00:03:31.079> a<00:03:31.110> second<00:03:31.470> type<00:03:31.560> of

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
going to do that in a second type of

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.500 
going to do that in a second type of
leave<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.070> then<00:03:32.459> there's<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.820> opening<00:03:33.420> that

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
leave and then there's the opening that

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.590 
leave and then there's the opening that
the<00:03:33.570> enemy<00:03:33.840> just<00:03:34.140> came<00:03:34.320> through<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:35.549> is<00:03:35.790> kind

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
the enemy just came through this is kind

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.030 
the enemy just came through this is kind
of<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.780> choke<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.380> a<00:03:37.440> choke<00:03:37.650> point<00:03:37.680> and

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
of a choke it is a choke point and

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.020 
of a choke it is a choke point and
you're<00:03:38.130> going<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.310> want<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.459> make<00:03:38.579> sure<00:03:38.610> that

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
you're going to want to make sure that

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.479 
you're going to want to make sure that
you<00:03:39.360> get<00:03:40.110> over<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.620> wall<00:03:40.860> quickly<00:03:41.190> and

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
you get over the wall quickly and

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.069 
you get over the wall quickly and
establish<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.120> defensive<00:03:42.329> position<00:03:42.750> as

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
establish a defensive position as

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.410 
establish a defensive position as
quickly<00:03:43.320> as<00:03:43.500> possible<00:03:43.920> because<00:03:44.370> if<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.940> allow

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
quickly as possible because if you allow

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.920 
quickly as possible because if you allow
the<00:03:45.480> enemy<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.079> kind<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.470> just<00:03:47.390> mail<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:48.660> from

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
the enemy to kind of just mail you from

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.870 
the enemy to kind of just mail you from
the<00:03:49.019> other<00:03:49.140> side<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.549> can<00:03:50.730> get<00:03:50.820> pretty

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
the other side I it can get pretty

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.819 
the other side I it can get pretty
frustrating<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:51.989> then<00:03:52.109> I<00:03:52.200> would<00:03:52.320> just<00:03:52.500> resort

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
frustrating and then I would just resort

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.440 
frustrating and then I would just resort
going<00:03:53.220> back<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.790> first<00:03:54.030> route<00:03:54.299> that<00:03:54.420> I

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
going back to the first route that I

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.270 
going back to the first route that I
take<00:03:54.690> but<00:03:55.320> this<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.590> definitely<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.980> solid

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
take but this is definitely a solid

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.069 
take but this is definitely a solid
route<00:03:56.640> if<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:57.000> can<00:03:57.150> get<00:03:57.510> over<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.900> hill

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
route if you can get over the hill

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.500 
route if you can get over the hill
quickly<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.680> into<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.519> temple<00:03:59.970> area<00:04:00.120> and

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
quickly and into the temple area and

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.539 
quickly and into the temple area and
then<00:04:00.720> pretty<00:04:01.350> much<00:04:01.500> what<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.739> do<00:04:01.799> is<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.160> kind<00:04:02.459> of

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
then pretty much what I do is I kind of

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.090 
then pretty much what I do is I kind of
clear<00:04:02.730> out<00:04:02.760> any<00:04:02.970> one<00:04:03.180> that's<00:04:03.620> around<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.769> mcom

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
clear out any one that's around the mcom

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.979 
clear out any one that's around the mcom
stations<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.730> then<00:04:06.209> you<00:04:06.299> can<00:04:06.450> plant<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.810> and

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
stations and then you can plant it and

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.349 
stations and then you can plant it and
then<00:04:07.829> once<00:04:08.130> you've<00:04:08.340> got<00:04:08.579> it<00:04:08.700> planted<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.209> can

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
then once you've got it planted you can

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.390 
then once you've got it planted you can
just<00:04:09.510> chill<00:04:09.690> out<00:04:09.720> still<00:04:10.049> in<00:04:10.140> this<00:04:10.260> area<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.829> as

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
just chill out still in this area and as

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.860 
just chill out still in this area and as
long<00:04:11.579> as<00:04:11.760> someone<00:04:12.030> is<00:04:12.060> guarding<00:04:12.540> your<00:04:12.630> back

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
long as someone is guarding your back

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.690 
long as someone is guarding your back
and<00:04:13.140> making<00:04:13.739> sure<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.130> no<00:04:14.250> one's<00:04:14.430> going

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
and making sure that no one's going

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.000 
and making sure that no one's going
through<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.930> tunnel<00:04:16.380> or<00:04:16.560> not<00:04:16.709> tunnel

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
through that that tunnel or not tunnel

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.060 
through that that tunnel or not tunnel
but<00:04:17.190> archway<00:04:17.840> you<00:04:18.840> can<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.590> can<00:04:19.620> pretty<00:04:19.979> much

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
but archway you can you can pretty much

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.890 
but archway you can you can pretty much
defend<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.519> a.m<00:04:20.789> can-am<00:04:21.479> comm<00:04:21.690> station

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
defend the a.m can-am comm station

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.930 
defend the a.m can-am comm station
without<00:04:22.200> really<00:04:22.530> any<00:04:22.620> trouble<00:04:23.099> and<00:04:23.220> it's<00:04:23.729> you

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
without really any trouble and it's you

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.100 
without really any trouble and it's you
have<00:04:24.090> good<00:04:24.270> line-of-sight<00:04:24.419> on<00:04:24.750> anyone<00:04:24.990> that's

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
have good line-of-sight on anyone that's

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.440 
have good line-of-sight on anyone that's
going<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.289> go

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
going to go

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.610 
going to go
for<00:04:25.600> it<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:25.840> as<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.200> can<00:04:26.320> see<00:04:26.350> you<00:04:26.500> in<00:04:26.560> a

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
for it and as you can see you in a

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.560 
for it and as you can see you in a
second<00:04:26.920> people<00:04:27.040> just<00:04:27.310> kind<00:04:27.460> of<00:04:27.490> rush<00:04:28.180> towards

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
second people just kind of rush towards

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.660 
second people just kind of rush towards
it<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:28.810> you<00:04:28.930> just<00:04:29.080> get<00:04:29.230> a<00:04:29.290> lot<00:04:29.410> of<00:04:29.440> kills<00:04:29.710> so

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
it and you just get a lot of kills so

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.820 
it and you just get a lot of kills so
once<00:04:31.060> you've<00:04:31.240> actually<00:04:31.420> taken<00:04:31.780> out<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.320> a.m

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
once you've actually taken out the a.m

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.800 
once you've actually taken out the a.m
comm<00:04:33.160> station<00:04:33.370> you<00:04:33.820> can<00:04:33.850> make<00:04:34.480> your<00:04:34.600> way

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
comm station you can make your way

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.240 
comm station you can make your way
through<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.500> archway<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:35.950> I<00:04:36.130> was

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
through the archway that I was

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.280 
through the archway that I was
describing<00:04:36.430> earlier<00:04:36.730> it's<00:04:37.720> behind<00:04:38.080> me<00:04:38.260> right

describing earlier it's behind me right

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.620 
describing earlier it's behind me right
now<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:38.980> the<00:04:39.100> left<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.610> make<00:04:40.420> your<00:04:40.540> way

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
now and to the left and make your way

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.570 
now and to the left and make your way
over<00:04:40.660> to<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.960> b1<00:04:41.290> and<00:04:41.500> what<00:04:42.130> I'd<00:04:42.220> like<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.370> do

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
over to the b1 and what I'd like to do

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.610 
over to the b1 and what I'd like to do
is<00:04:42.850> pretty<00:04:43.570> much<00:04:43.690> clear<00:04:43.990> out<00:04:44.140> anyone<00:04:44.410> that's

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
is pretty much clear out anyone that's

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.100 
is pretty much clear out anyone that's
around<00:04:45.130> it<00:04:45.340> and<00:04:45.460> then<00:04:46.090> like<00:04:46.750> I<00:04:46.930> mentioned

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
around it and then like I mentioned

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.430 
around it and then like I mentioned
earlier<00:04:47.350> head<00:04:47.920> towards<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.460> back<00:04:48.790> of<00:04:49.000> the

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
earlier head towards the back of the

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.810 
earlier head towards the back of the
temple<00:04:50.440> area<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:50.890> then<00:04:51.010> just<00:04:51.190> throw<00:04:51.400> bombs

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
temple area and then just throw bombs

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.380 
temple area and then just throw bombs
the<00:04:52.780> bombs<00:04:53.050> grenades<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:54.040> use<00:04:55.030> your<00:04:55.240> grenade

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
the bombs grenades and use your grenade

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.510 
the bombs grenades and use your grenade
launcher<00:04:55.930> to<00:04:56.500> pretty<00:04:56.680> much<00:04:56.800> just<00:04:57.010> choked<00:04:57.310> up

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
launcher to pretty much just choked up

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.310 
launcher to pretty much just choked up
that<00:04:57.700> area<00:04:58.270> where<00:04:58.690> they're<00:04:58.810> coming<00:04:59.020> through

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
that area where they're coming through

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.190 
that area where they're coming through
and<00:04:59.530> I<00:05:00.250> find<00:05:00.640> that<00:05:00.760> this<00:05:00.880> makes<00:05:01.150> it<00:05:01.360> nearly

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
and I find that this makes it nearly

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.770 
and I find that this makes it nearly
impossible<00:05:02.380> for<00:05:02.920> them<00:05:03.160> to<00:05:03.220> actually<00:05:03.780> defuse

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
impossible for them to actually defuse

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.600 
impossible for them to actually defuse
the<00:05:04.990> bomb<00:05:05.170> site<00:05:05.410> is<00:05:05.650> it's<00:05:06.010> it's<00:05:06.250> very

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
the bomb site is it's it's very

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.790 
the bomb site is it's it's very
difficult<00:05:06.850> for<00:05:07.090> them<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:07.960> so<00:05:08.020> you're<00:05:08.710> going

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
difficult for them and so you're going

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.030 
difficult for them and so you're going
to<00:05:08.890> see<00:05:08.980> that<00:05:09.100> here<00:05:09.250> in<00:05:09.340> a<00:05:09.400> second<00:05:10.260> yea<00:05:11.260> it<00:05:11.410> is

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
to see that here in a second yea it is

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.400 
to see that here in a second yea it is
definitely<00:05:12.070> a<00:05:12.490> very<00:05:12.580> solid<00:05:13.300> strategy<00:05:14.050> that<00:05:14.380> I

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
definitely a very solid strategy that I

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.320 
definitely a very solid strategy that I
definitely<00:05:14.770> recommend<00:05:15.030> but<00:05:16.030> this<00:05:16.120> is<00:05:16.210> about

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
definitely recommend but this is about

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.700 
definitely recommend but this is about
