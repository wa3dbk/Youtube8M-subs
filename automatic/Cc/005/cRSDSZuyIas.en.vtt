00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 speaks welcome guys but this video 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.770
 Bible photograph I am bruno and that 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.099
 Today's video I'll show you how 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.099
 highlight the eyes using light on 5 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.500
 I'm already here with the dump you 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.350
 can use any version of lat long 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.570
 to do is this real if I'm already 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.150
 here on the develop tab and today we are going 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.040
 using the brush tool is only 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.809
 tool blush we will click here 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.239
 She's your last transit here from the side. 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.950
 right work that the small panel of her I 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.300
 I'll book here if you hold the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.530
 Alt key on the keyboard and here I will have the 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.690
 then you book all the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.890
 settings of the earlier and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.870
 First thing I'm going to do here then 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.550
 is to increase the exposure I will put here 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.920
 one more that I want to exaggerate well that 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.420
 It's up to you to achieve the effect on the screen. 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.910
 I'll put here a little bit of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.640
 clarity and light that is put here 35 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.939
 to give more texture and contrast that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.150
 eyes and increase the saturation that 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.710
 30 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.460
 I'll put a little bit of sharpness 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.040
 at least 30 I'm also putting here 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.939
 It's like this one without knowing if it will be good. 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.640
 is not 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.950
 After we paint our eyes there 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.900
 we will see that we can change 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.590
 that these settings have no problem 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.659
 we here I take a little less 31 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.090
 here in this part underneath the panel you 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:37.259
 here are where you can regulate the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:40.650
 size of the witch the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:46.770
 is usually puts faith in the ranking and 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:49.200
 70 80 and 70 today that is not to let the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.600
 edges of the painting is very sharp is very 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.640
 hard so it gets very soft 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.380
 flu left 80 percent to not 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.340
 to apply everything is done as soon as I click 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.969
 in the image 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.729
 and here if automatic high but you have 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.250
 marked you disable density here and 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.290
 I'll leave 100% 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.810
 for a while 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.700
 now I'll push the key to 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.110
 space bar and I'm going to show this 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.330
 Lupi I'm going to zoom in 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.970
 and I'm going to paint that it will leave the 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.090
 More or less size hug here . 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:26.000
 I need to change the sidewalk and 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.320
 I'm going to paint here only on them 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.590
 a little 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.780
 usually does not brush up on the edge 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.270
 I like to leave this ball much more 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.310
 Dark here I think it's much cooler 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:50.480
 and in the other the same thing 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:53.040
 bruschi there is darker 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.830
 usually does not happen here in our 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.830
 part here in the middle of the eye is and I do not 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.800
 The white part is also worse for me and I 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.470
 I think it's ugly when the person leaves the part 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.209
 lighter white here it is if you go 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.920
 highlight this white part has much 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.959
 be careful not to let not 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.760
 exaggerate the effect but I do not normally 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.709
 only to the ground that the middle of the eye I think 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.420
 that's perfect here we've already gone 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.310
 blank in both eyes here you see 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.900
 with cool black marble and now 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.519
 Do you want to have any configuration here 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.260
 You can then I'll do what I 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.640
 I'll have the temperature a little, I'll go 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.790
 leave a little more to the side of the 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:32.670
 hamburg than ever and the ink is a 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.320
 little side of green - 10 here because 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.000
 She has these two colors in one eye. 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.110
 little bit of yellow and green 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.360
 I think I 'm going to increase it a little bit more 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:47.670
 of legal saturation 4039 and a little bit 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.110
 more claudia eyes and now you 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.420
 will do what is practically 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.269
 ready and I came here in this 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.570
 here and I'm going to close this panel and 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.120
 you will have here a new slider 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.489
 How much is the motorcycle here? 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.980
 usually I do I put 10 I the 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.810
 I do here I let the image leave the 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.790
 normal size shoots one of her here and 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.709
 now you come here of those homes 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.100
 amount is increasing gradually and 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.660
 You see the result is very careful. 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.890
 not to exaggerate the crowd there are people who 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.590
 leave your eye like that 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.539
 so it 's cool, but it depends on the type of 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.740
 picture you will make if you went 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.120
 deliver a photo like this by a customer 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.990
 You see in the photo the kick I think he 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.030
 will not like 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.010
 so you have to leave the most natural 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.889
 possible that the person looks so see 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.540
 It has something different but it does not 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.570
 Can you know what you understand? 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.880
 but you know what I leave in 35 think 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.800
 That's cool and that's it people are good 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.169
 simple show the before and after to 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.690
 you here now 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.310
 This is the before and after eyes of you. 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.570
 You think it's too much, you slow down a bit. 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.780
 the amount of alcohol decreases plus one 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.770
 a little 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.650
 shaq on 30 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.960
 this is quite simple is an effect as well 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.540
 pretty cool huh gives a difference bag that 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.169
 the gold was well erased left the eye 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:07.440
 more clearly but this performance is not 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:11.310
 and only using the colors of the eye itself 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.950
 There's nothing much there if you want. 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:18.330
 change the color of the person's eyes 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:21.870
 you can enable the new witch 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.360
 O select here this ball that already 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.940
 area to paint the eye you can 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.290
 I change the temperature here and I 'm not going 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.410
 put here at the most to see the 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.479
 what happens 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.950
 well- managed if you want to leave more 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.760
 bluish you put to the blue side 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.610
 on here 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.100
 then you decrease the amount there to 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.510
 not to have such a strong effect so 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.550
 Rise a little bit again the way you do. 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.910
 What was it or could you come down here? 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.280
