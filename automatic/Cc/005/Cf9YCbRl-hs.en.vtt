00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.009
 a problem for us the next years 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.500
 decades when I always deal 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.120
 is the smartphone neck 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.279
 the smartphone market is created by it 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.950
 that all the time where with magath 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.960
 bad attitude on iphone tablet 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.939
 smartphone wherever it sits and 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.309
 people who have a smartphone neck 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.980
 the describe headache 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:29.960
 neck pain tingling in arms and in 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.300
 the hands and sometimes even nausea 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.770
 digestive problems air problems now 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.350
 the question is where does it come from? 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.899
 a one - sided burden on the neck 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.420
 by always overstretched forward 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:45.920
 is for the body for a long time 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.480
 unhealthy at the neck are not only 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.609
 muscles but also the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.879
 cervical spine and that should 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:55.039
 usually here is the front 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.960
 doctor country with glasses here is in front 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.690
 that is a bit bent and thereby can 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.089
 which is just as good as a shock absorber 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.979
 what happens when you do that 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.110
 head forward here all the time 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:10.190
 it is overstretched that they are not so 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.160
 is bent but just becomes and itself 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:19.330
 sometimes even so bent forward 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:22.250
 even if you do it yourself 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.410
 me on the smartphone or not me 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.820
 somewhere around occurs, and it depends on the 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.100
 is a problem with this then 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.480
 tension in the neck muscles 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.740
 can lead to everything being too tight 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.660
 pulls together and they have to think 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.970
 that between each vertebrae and there 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.070
 are already a lot on the neck 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.870
 the side nerves leak and if the 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.570
 be compressed by the tension 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.670
 then the problem is in poor and in the 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.750
 in the hands because the nerves just for 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.820
 responsible for the area 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.440
 In addition, the tension can be massive in 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.880
 pull your head that you say you get 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.730
 it also gives him a headache 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.800
 or be clear by the attitude that 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.190
 you much air swallowed a flat 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.600
 breathe and therefore respiratory problems and 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.190
 So digestion problems can come 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.400
 sms thumb is not the only problem 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.070
 but is once the whatsapp 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.940
 headache 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.619
 sms neck smarthome neck and what 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.840
 not the e-mail tingling in your fingers 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.940
 is a much bigger one and it will 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.050
 to take more and more 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.970
 the question what can you do there 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:24.000
 The simplest solution is not the head 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.500
 to the phone but the phone to the head 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.810
 That is something for the poor 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.510
 exhausting but you have the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.910
 maintain normal plate attitude 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.180
 besides, it is so that we humans too 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.590
 always tend to forward always 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.959
 to invade 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.850
 So exercises that set me up 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.770
 the back shoulder weather end 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.270
 the back muscles together 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.850
 which should raise me the milky way 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.070
 should strengthen and thus just 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.510
 also this overweight forward 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.880
 counteract and namely after again 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.110
 pull up 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.130
 Talk to you if you have such problems 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.720
 and maybe they have it 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.090
 can return with your doctor or 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.620
 with a good physiotherapist 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.690
 can give them exercises to him 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.410
 especially good for headaches 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.160
 Of course, there can be a thousand others 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.870
 cause 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.970
 that's just a case of him now 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.350
 many young people are involved in the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.540
 could this he will not even know it 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.380
 I can not go through the camera now 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.750
 bad judge 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.410
 but that's one of the new ones 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.410
 folk diseases
