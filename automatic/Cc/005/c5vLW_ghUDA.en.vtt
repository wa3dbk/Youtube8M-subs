00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
was a fake was because during was my

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.749 
was a fake was because during was my
back<00:01:41.319> like<00:01:41.500> it<00:01:41.709> was<00:01:41.740> literally<00:01:42.369> on<00:01:42.459> solar

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
back like it was literally on solar

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.600 
back like it was literally on solar
battery<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.780> power<00:01:43.990> light<00:01:44.469> wasn't<00:01:44.829> even

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
battery the power light wasn't even

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.679 
battery the power light wasn't even
showing<00:01:45.819> so<00:01:46.539> I<00:01:46.599> try<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:46.929> save<00:01:47.140> him<00:01:47.229> again<00:01:47.439> and<00:01:48.189> um

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
showing so I try I save him again and um

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.569 
showing so I try I save him again and um
why<00:01:49.689> you're<00:01:49.899> at<00:01:49.959> the<00:01:50.020> end<00:01:50.079> of<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:50.259> saving<00:01:50.649> it

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
why you're at the end of it saving it

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.910 
why you're at the end of it saving it

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
turned off so what happens is is

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.839 
turned off so what happens is is
whenever<00:01:54.700> on<00:01:55.030> no<00:01:55.270> clash<00:01:55.539> gba<00:01:55.929> emulator<00:01:56.849> you

00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:57.849 
whenever on no clash gba emulator you

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.050 
whenever on no clash gba emulator you
play<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.119> poke<00:01:58.420> when<00:01:58.569> I<00:01:58.629> move<00:01:58.780> on<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.939> if<00:02:00.939> you

you're like you're saving or something
oh<00:02:06.640> my<00:02:07.479> think<00:02:07.929> playing<00:02:08.229> not<00:02:08.410> sure<00:02:08.619> then<00:02:09.519> you

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
oh my think playing not sure then you

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.319 
oh my think playing not sure then you
lose<00:02:09.910> you<00:02:10.030> later

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 
lose you later

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.680 
lose you later
it<00:02:11.140> was<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.379> data<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:12.010> with<00:02:12.280> this<00:02:12.690> normally

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
it was the data and with this normally

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.300 
it was the data and with this normally
there<00:02:13.840> has<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:13.989> be<00:02:14.140> sufficient<00:02:14.379> data<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.040> lose

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
there has to be sufficient data to lose

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.520 
there has to be sufficient data to lose
like<00:02:16.060> if<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.359> try<00:02:16.630> doing<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:17.109> at<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.380> very

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
like if I try doing it at the very

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
see I'm gonna see it over here I think

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.120 
see I'm gonna see it over here I think
and<00:04:05.310> that's<00:04:05.520> that's<00:04:06.180> how<00:04:06.300> this<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.780> cover<00:04:07.130> if

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
and that's that's how this the cover if

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.190 
and that's that's how this the cover if
I<00:04:08.790> think<00:04:09.120> meant<00:04:09.300> to<00:04:09.390> be<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.510> bit<00:04:09.750> lighter<00:04:09.930> than

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
I think meant to be a bit lighter than

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.980 
I think meant to be a bit lighter than
this<00:04:10.320> one<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.910> think<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.540> can<00:04:12.630> actually<00:04:12.720> see

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.130 
this one I think so you can actually see
that<00:04:13.080> I<00:04:13.170> feel<00:04:13.380> more<00:04:13.709> see-through<00:04:13.950> home

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
that I feel more see-through home
