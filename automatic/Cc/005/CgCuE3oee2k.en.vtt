00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:11.000
 hello alexander is now winter and 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.160
 many herds of animals tell how 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.740
 the character endure yesterday how they live 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.340
 winter 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.180
 so that when wintering do not fall into 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.500
 numbness 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.039
 they are not sleeping are quite so 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.700
 semi active to survive 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.340
 severe frosts and all winter adversities they 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.350
 gather in the so-called club that is 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.860
 tightly pressed against each other and 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.410
 in such a way they allow to remain 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.000
 heat that will be he 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.239
 produces in winter they close their eyes 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.660
 don't sleep quietly eat no such 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.649
 way it produces heat or retain 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.979
 your ability in this vital activity 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:08.450
 it turns out that 6 months a year in my 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.220
 region they were not yes it is housing 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.270
 completely and how do you care for 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:20.189
 bees feed what you can 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:22.250
 if we talk about the winter period but nothing 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.570
 does not feed the bees is completely unnecessary 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.740
 all stocks for the winter 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.430
 are created but in summer or autumn 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.159
 autumn in what the water concept is August 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.140
 September is the last two months 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.439
 month the beekeeper should completely 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.450
 prepare the bees for wintering already for 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:48.049
 seven people they do not need anything they 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.189
 eat food that they have and 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:56.250
 please tell about devices 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:02:00.120
 hive what is or where did home start 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:04.010
 can block a couple from some 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:08.280
 a cardboard box and everything 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.910
 down to the hive which makes him a man 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.290
 the hive is done to beekeepers 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.050
 it was easy to maintain Che look for them 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.370
 development and contribute some kind of collectives 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.840
 again for your convenience therefore in 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:32.280
 mostly hive is of 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.530
 a rectangle in which cost 100 again 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.940
 same 100 is in wooden frames 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.940
 who are doing what is the present tense 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.320
 not only wooden hives are used 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:51.870
 but also a beehive of expanded polystyrene in the south 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.390
 the regions are pretty good 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.090
 get spread or from straw 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:02.030
 warmer climate they are able to live and 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.650
 of these hives that is the main one 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.700
 bee port protection and 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:12.750
 1 spheres of precipitation and pests and inside 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.900
 they build honeycombs on which they fold 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.489
 feed and bring their new generation 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.769
 tell me what products except honey 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.100
 gives people a bee's body 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:26.070
 for their livelihoods use 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.450
 nobody plants from which honey is made 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:36.890
 and pollen from which it turns out 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:41.180
 her gun honey it is considered carbohydrate pore 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.750
 pollen pollen is a protein food therefore 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.709
 we are people 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.240
 report we get these basic things 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.540
 product 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.830
 it is chalk and perga also 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:58.000
 the power of water collects pollen beyond that 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.410
 Bees also bring it to the hive propolis 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.510
 special 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.250
 sticky get essential substances that 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:11.540
 produce plants man collects 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.610
 smears the gap fixes everything 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.989
 space hives are these substances 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:20.470
 the substance therefore the person applies 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:25.160
 propolis as a natural antiseptic 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.330
 at what diseases when there 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.230
 healing of wounds 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.610
 it is a good disinfectant 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.510
 also human uses 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.980
 wax wax clearly highlights themselves 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.260
 from certain glands ie from nowhere 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:44.930
 it does not suffer will and highlights 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:49.580
 themselves from bees wax build 700 and 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:52.300
 and a person can use wax as 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.470
 for cosmetic purposes and in some 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.370
 decorative purposes well, for example the same 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.370
 wax candles 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:05.000
 very useful and valuable substance 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:08.570
 which we get from bees is uterine 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.140
 royal jelly also exude 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.610
 bees 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:16.210
 to feed the larvae of the bees and the main 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.670
 taraska look larvae new queens 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.560
 so this is called uterine 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:27.230
 milk 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:28.490
 it is also a very valuable product for 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.780
 a specific goal. 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:35.840
 Is it medical time? 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:39.140
 also people use the bodies of the bees themselves 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.710
 when they perish it is called 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:47.170
 dead bees 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:49.570
 and when the joints ache in varicose veins 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.910
 varicose veins with certain other 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.180
 diseases themselves are used and these 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.310
 dead bees 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.040
 specific products I don't know who 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.250
 either going to beekeepers bee venom 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.860
 yes and birth all the bumps are also in 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:10.110
 principle, you can collect and bee venom he 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:13.210
 also used for medical purposes 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.740
 Well, that's probably the main products before 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.740
 which we get from what 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.639
 for 1-3 people bees from newly tinydeal apple 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.830
 publish 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.830
 no canal part notified those
