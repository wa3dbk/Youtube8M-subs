00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
that and then run a component just

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.210 
that and then run a component just
because<00:02:50.470> it's<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.739> best<00:02:50.769> out<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.069> these

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
that's the same now let's look at the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.599 
that's the same now let's look at the
glyphs<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.410> I<00:02:54.129> magic<00:02:54.459> zone<00:02:54.930> just<00:02:55.930> makes<00:02:56.260> it

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
glyphs and I magic zone just makes it

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.059 
glyphs and I magic zone just makes it
absorb<00:02:57.609> all<00:02:58.109> damage<00:02:59.109> up<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.500> absorption
