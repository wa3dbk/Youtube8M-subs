art based than usual but I'll still give
away<00:00:09.870> some<00:00:10.110> cool<00:00:10.320> tips<00:00:10.950> tricks<00:00:11.610> and

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
away some cool tips tricks and

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.230 
away some cool tips tricks and
techniques<00:00:12.090> along<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.230> way<00:00:13.429> the<00:00:14.429> first<00:00:14.730> thing

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
techniques along the way the first thing

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.180 
techniques along the way the first thing
I<00:00:15.420> do<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.900> take<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> look<00:00:16.440> at<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> reference

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
I do is take a look at the reference

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.790 
I do is take a look at the reference
photo<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.789> maximize<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:19.109> my<00:00:19.289> secondary

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
photo and maximize it on my secondary

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.099 
photo and maximize it on my secondary
screen<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.820> can<00:00:20.880> always<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> look<00:00:21.660> at<00:00:21.960> it

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
screen so I can always have a look at it

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.920 
screen so I can always have a look at it
I<00:00:22.260> then<00:00:23.189> start<00:00:23.490> sculpting<00:00:23.789> away<00:00:24.300> on<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.600> new

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
I then start sculpting away on a new

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.759 
I then start sculpting away on a new
terrain<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:26.060> start<00:00:27.060> out<00:00:27.180> using<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.900> large<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
terrain I start out using a large and

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.359 
terrain I start out using a large and
smooth<00:00:29.220> brush<00:00:30.260> this<00:00:31.260> way<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.500> can<00:00:31.830> shape<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
smooth brush this way I can shape the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.049 
smooth brush this way I can shape the
overall<00:00:32.820> feel<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.510> mountains<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.850> then<00:00:35.850> go

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
overall feel of the mountains I then go

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.330 
overall feel of the mountains I then go
in<00:00:36.180> with<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.420> more<00:00:36.690> detailed<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.950> give<00:00:38.160> it

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
in with a more detailed one to give it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.630 
in with a more detailed one to give it
the<00:00:38.579> rough<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.300> edgy<00:00:39.510> look<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.920> way<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.430> will

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the rough and edgy look this way it will

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:50.349 
the rough and edgy look this way it will
actually<00:00:42.210> look<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.450> stone

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.369 

I<00:00:50.390> then<00:00:51.199> add<00:00:51.379> a<00:00:51.409> simple<00:00:51.949> grass<00:00:52.249> texture<00:00:53.379> it's

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
I then add a simple grass texture it's

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.110 
I then add a simple grass texture it's
always<00:00:54.769> good<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.219> see<00:00:55.399> how<00:00:55.579> your<00:00:55.789> terrain

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
always good to see how your terrain

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.500 
always good to see how your terrain
looks<00:00:56.510> with<00:00:56.899> texture<00:00:57.409> supplied<00:00:58.359> even<00:00:59.359> though

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
looks with texture supplied even though

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.380 
looks with texture supplied even though
it's<00:00:59.629> just<00:00:59.839> assemble<00:01:00.289> one<00:01:00.469> like<00:01:00.739> this<00:01:00.920> one<00:01:01.159> I

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.320 

then<00:01:08.390> add<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.930> outer<00:01:09.170> boundaries<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:10.330> some

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
then add the outer boundaries and some

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.940 
then add the outer boundaries and some
more<00:01:11.509> detail<00:01:13.869> this<00:01:14.869> is<00:01:15.080> a<00:01:15.110> good<00:01:15.380> time<00:01:15.649> to<00:01:15.830> make

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
more detail this is a good time to make

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.279 
more detail this is a good time to make
the<00:01:16.130> terrain<00:01:16.460> look<00:01:16.700> less<00:01:16.970> flat<00:01:17.299> so<00:01:17.929> I<00:01:17.960> start

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
the terrain look less flat so I start

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.730 
the terrain look less flat so I start
sculpting<00:01:18.380> away<00:01:19.070> on<00:01:19.220> that<00:01:19.429> I<00:01:20.020> then<00:01:21.020> rename<00:01:21.530> it

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
sculpting away on that I then rename it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.320 
sculpting away on that I then rename it
and<00:01:22.000> add<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.440> default<00:01:24.440> border<00:01:25.330> import

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
and add the default border import

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.999 
and add the default border import
package<00:01:26.890> order<00:01:27.890> basic<00:01:28.369> I<00:01:29.470> then<00:01:30.470> drag<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:30.860> into

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
package order basic I then drag it into

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.820 
package order basic I then drag it into
my<00:01:31.159> scene<00:01:31.580> set<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.539> position<00:01:32.750> variables<00:01:33.619> to

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
my scene set the position variables to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.219 
my scene set the position variables to
zero<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.459> make<00:01:35.149> sure<00:01:35.390> it<00:01:35.600> covers<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.200> whole

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
zero and make sure it covers the whole

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.969 
zero and make sure it covers the whole
terrain<00:01:37.659> now<00:01:38.659> I<00:01:38.690> can<00:01:38.990> just<00:01:39.229> use<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.740> height

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
terrain now I can just use the height

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.580 
terrain now I can just use the height
brush<00:01:40.369> to<00:01:41.090> sculpt<00:01:41.420> down<00:01:41.690> on<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.020> terrain<00:01:42.350> and

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
brush to sculpt down on the terrain and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.180 
brush to sculpt down on the terrain and
the<00:01:42.979> water<00:01:43.220> will<00:01:43.490> start<00:01:43.789> appearing<00:01:44.119> I<00:01:45.190> then

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
the water will start appearing I then

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.429 
the water will start appearing I then
bring<00:01:46.429> up<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.700> border<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.690> little<00:01:47.750> bit<00:01:48.259> and

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
bring up the border a little bit and

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.620 
bring up the border a little bit and
cover<00:01:48.950> some<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.520> mistakes<00:01:49.729> where<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:50.420> goes

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
cover some of the mistakes where it goes

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.059 
cover some of the mistakes where it goes
through<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.409> ground<00:01:52.600> now<00:01:53.600> I<00:01:53.659> add<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.020> path<00:01:54.440> this

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
through the ground now I add a path this

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.749 
through the ground now I add a path this
is<00:01:55.129> done<00:01:55.459> by<00:01:55.610> using<00:01:55.819> the<00:01:56.119> height<00:01:56.330> too<00:01:56.599> I<00:01:57.759> then

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
is done by using the height too I then

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.169 
is done by using the height too I then
select<00:01:59.179> all<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.869> different<00:02:00.289> props<00:02:00.619> and

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
select all of the different props and

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.199 
select all of the different props and
move<00:02:02.179> them<00:02:02.420> upwards<00:02:03.670> here<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.819> see<00:02:05.060> me

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
move them upwards here you see me

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.350 
move them upwards here you see me
creating<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.810> dirt<00:02:06.019> path<00:02:06.319> texture<00:02:07.009> I<00:02:07.360> made

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
creating the dirt path texture I made

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.470 
creating the dirt path texture I made
this<00:02:08.599> using<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:09.319> photorealistic<00:02:09.950> image<00:02:10.759> taking

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
this using a photorealistic image taking

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.229 
this using a photorealistic image taking
with<00:02:11.629> a<00:02:11.660> real<00:02:11.959> camera<00:02:12.319> I<00:02:12.790> then<00:02:13.790> apply<00:02:14.209> some

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
with a real camera I then apply some

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.470 
with a real camera I then apply some
filters<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:15.680> make<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.010> look<00:02:16.430> more<00:02:16.760> smooth<00:02:17.150> and

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
filters to make it look more smooth and

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.130 
filters to make it look more smooth and
a<00:02:17.959> bit<00:02:18.170> cartoony<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:20.060> just<00:02:20.360> adds<00:02:20.629> a<00:02:20.900> nice

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
a bit cartoony this just adds a nice

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.970 
a bit cartoony this just adds a nice
mood<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.830> game<00:02:22.129> I<00:02:22.989> then<00:02:23.989> painted<00:02:24.230> onto<00:02:24.830> the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
mood to the game I then painted onto the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.350 
mood to the game I then painted onto the
terrain

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.710 

I<00:02:32.950> then<00:02:33.950> load<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.490> nice<00:02:34.670> stone<00:02:34.970> texture<00:02:35.510> and

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
I then load in a nice stone texture and

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.760 
I then load in a nice stone texture and
applied<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:36.980> mountains<00:02:38.470> it's<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.590> good

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
applied to the mountains it's a good

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.310 
applied to the mountains it's a good
idea<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.460> have<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.760> same<00:02:41.000> texture<00:02:41.510> applied

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
idea to have the same texture applied

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.270 
idea to have the same texture applied
with<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.920> different<00:02:43.520> opacity<00:02:44.150> settings

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
with this different opacity settings

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.270 
with this different opacity settings
this<00:02:46.280> way<00:02:46.520> you<00:02:46.580> can<00:02:46.910> have<00:02:47.090> variety<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:48.280> nice

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
this way you can have variety and nice

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.930 
this way you can have variety and nice
blending<00:02:50.470> here<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.590> just<00:02:51.770> see<00:02:52.040> me<00:02:52.250> making<00:02:52.790> the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
blending here you just see me making the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.770 
blending here you just see me making the
path<00:02:53.210> a<00:02:53.480> bit<00:02:53.840> darker<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:55.790> make<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.150> path<00:02:56.390> blend

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
path a bit darker to make the path blend

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.160 
path a bit darker to make the path blend
better<00:02:57.050> between<00:02:57.560> grass<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.490> dirt<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:59.360> apply

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
better between grass and dirt I apply

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.340 
better between grass and dirt I apply
another<00:03:00.440> texture<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.610> do<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.720> same<00:03:02.960> to<00:03:03.230> the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
another texture I do the same to the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.880 
another texture I do the same to the
water<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:04.390> now<00:03:05.390> use<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:05.660> large<00:03:06.080> brush<00:03:06.140> with

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
water I now use a large brush with

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.340 
water I now use a large brush with
plenty<00:03:07.310> of<00:03:07.340> detail<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:08.420> make<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.780> grass<00:03:09.020> look

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
plenty of detail to make the grass look

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.150 
plenty of detail to make the grass look
less<00:03:09.680> clean<00:03:10.780> now<00:03:11.780> it's<00:03:11.960> time<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.260> position<00:03:12.620> the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
less clean now it's time to position the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.850 
less clean now it's time to position the
objects<00:03:13.640> around<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.210> scene<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.780> make<00:03:15.650> sure

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
objects around the scene and make sure

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.400 
objects around the scene and make sure
to<00:03:16.130> select<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.610> fence<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.300> drag<00:03:18.050> it<00:03:18.200> down<00:03:18.230> to

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
to select the fence and drag it down to

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.070 
to select the fence and drag it down to
the<00:03:18.770> project<00:03:19.220> pane<00:03:19.460> to<00:03:19.910> make<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.120> prefab<00:03:20.690> out<00:03:20.930> of

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
the project pane to make a prefab out of

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.430 
the project pane to make a prefab out of
it<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.760> then<00:03:22.760> make<00:03:22.970> some<00:03:23.240> empty<00:03:23.630> game<00:03:23.840> objects

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
it I then make some empty game objects

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.510 
it I then make some empty game objects
and<00:03:24.590> drag<00:03:25.220> for<00:03:25.640> fences<00:03:26.270> into<00:03:26.840> one<00:03:27.050> of<00:03:27.200> them

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
and drag for fences into one of them

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.360 
and drag for fences into one of them
this<00:03:28.520> way<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:28.820> can<00:03:29.120> have<00:03:29.150> packs<00:03:29.990> of<00:03:30.290> fences<00:03:30.800> so<00:03:31.340> I

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
this way I can have packs of fences so I

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.490 
this way I can have packs of fences so I
don't<00:03:31.610> have<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.970> duplicate<00:03:32.540> one<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.110> then

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
don't have to duplicate one and then

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.360 
don't have to duplicate one and then
move<00:03:33.740> and<00:03:34.010> so<00:03:34.430> on<00:03:35.350> make<00:03:36.350> sure<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.590> rename<00:03:37.160> them

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
move and so on make sure to rename them

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.699 
move and so on make sure to rename them
properly<00:03:37.850> so<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.600> can<00:03:38.780> quickly<00:03:39.020> find<00:03:39.200> them<00:03:39.590> in

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
properly so you can quickly find them in

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.990 
properly so you can quickly find them in
your<00:03:39.890> scene<00:03:41.770> the<00:03:42.770> same<00:03:43.100> technique<00:03:43.550> is<00:03:43.700> used

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
your scene the same technique is used

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.740 
your scene the same technique is used
for<00:03:44.390> applying<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.930> lamps<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:46.420> now<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:47.450> want<00:03:47.690> to

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
for applying the lamps and now I want to

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.400 
for applying the lamps and now I want to
apply<00:03:48.140> fire<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.070> fireplace<00:03:49.720> so<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:50.750> import

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
apply fire to the fireplace so I import

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.660 
apply fire to the fireplace so I import
the<00:03:51.560> default<00:03:52.040> particle<00:03:52.730> particles<00:03:53.300> I<00:03:54.459> drag<00:03:55.459> in

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
the default particle particles I drag in

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.199 
the default particle particles I drag in
the<00:03:55.820> flames<00:03:56.770> position<00:03:57.770> them<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.430> play<00:03:59.090> around

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
the flames position them and play around

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.780 
the flames position them and play around
with<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.660> light<00:03:59.870> I<00:04:00.340> would<00:04:01.340> like<00:04:01.489> it<00:04:01.640> to<00:04:01.670> be

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
with the light I would like it to be

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.350 
with the light I would like it to be
bigger<00:04:02.300> and<00:04:02.450> softer<00:04:03.250> so<00:04:04.250> I<00:04:04.280> add<00:04:04.550> an<00:04:04.820> extra

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
bigger and softer so I add an extra

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.160 
bigger and softer so I add an extra
light<00:04:05.570> that<00:04:06.020> can<00:04:06.320> take<00:04:06.530> care<00:04:06.770> of<00:04:06.830> that<00:04:07.100> I<00:04:08.170> then

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
light that can take care of that I then

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.410 
light that can take care of that I then
drag<00:04:09.440> it<00:04:09.590> onto<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:09.890> campfire<00:04:10.520> prefab<00:04:11.120> and

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
drag it onto the campfire prefab and

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.440 
drag it onto the campfire prefab and
drag<00:04:12.110> it<00:04:12.230> on<00:04:12.380> into<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.860> project<00:04:13.340> pane<00:04:13.520> now<00:04:14.420> I

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
drag it on into the project pane now I

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.960 
drag it on into the project pane now I
clean<00:04:14.870> up<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.200> hierarchy<00:04:15.470> by<00:04:16.250> deleting<00:04:16.640> old

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
clean up the hierarchy by deleting old

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:29.000 
clean up the hierarchy by deleting old
objects

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.640 

and<00:04:29.100> then<00:04:29.730> import<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.270> doc<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:31.080> sit<00:04:31.380> by<00:04:31.620> the

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
and then import a doc to sit by the

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.390 
and then import a doc to sit by the
water<00:04:31.950> I<00:04:35.690> create<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:36.720> custom<00:04:37.290> Collider<00:04:37.710> by

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
water I create a custom Collider by

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.790 
water I create a custom Collider by
making<00:04:38.790> a<00:04:38.910> series<00:04:39.450> of<00:04:39.480> empty<00:04:40.050> game<00:04:40.260> objects

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
making a series of empty game objects

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
making a series of empty game objects
with<00:04:41.130> colliders<00:04:41.700> attached

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.960 

finally<00:04:50.720> I<00:04:50.750> position<00:04:51.440> it<00:04:51.560> make<00:04:52.160> it<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.400> prefab

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
finally I position it make it a prefab

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.210 
finally I position it make it a prefab
and<00:04:53.240> make<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.960> last<00:04:54.140> changes<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:55.040> the
