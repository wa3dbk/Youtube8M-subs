texture which is pretty pretty much in
the<00:00:11.990> harmonic<00:00:12.500> distortion<00:00:12.860> of<00:00:13.459> the<00:00:13.580> pedal<00:00:13.850> and

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
the harmonic distortion of the pedal and

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.839 
the harmonic distortion of the pedal and
balanced<00:00:14.690> which<00:00:14.870> is<00:00:15.019> the<00:00:15.139> balance<00:00:15.320> between<00:00:15.849> 5%

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:16.849

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:25.579

first this is out with a maid in Mexico
finer<00:00:25.820> tornado<00:00:26.300> and<00:00:27.099> here's<00:00:28.099> a<00:00:28.160> clean<00:00:28.399> soon

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.960 

notice<00:00:54.680> that<00:00:54.890> when<00:00:55.010> pictures<00:00:55.370> all<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.580> way<00:00:55.790> up

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
notice that when pictures all the way up

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.270 
notice that when pictures all the way up
the<00:00:56.210> octave<00:00:56.870> fuzz<00:00:57.500> going<00:00:57.890> on

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
the octave fuzz going on

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:12.230 
the octave fuzz going on
I<00:00:58.990> see<00:00:59.990> 12th<00:01:00.260> fret

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.149 

then<00:01:13.240> we<00:01:13.299> could<00:01:13.450> turn<00:01:13.600> down<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.840> balance

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.609 

is<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> clean<00:01:18.570> signal<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.140> overpowering

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
is that the clean signal is overpowering

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.810 
is that the clean signal is overpowering
a<00:01:19.859> bit

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:40.250 

Oh

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.830 

Oh

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
Oh

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.610 
Oh
Oh

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:02:39.670 

you<00:01:50.620> turned<00:01:50.920> down<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.880> harmonic<00:01:52.300> distortion

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.110 

another<00:02:40.680> interesting<00:02:41.010> effect<00:02:41.519> that<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.849> egg

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
another interesting effect that the egg

another interesting effect that the egg
scrambler<00:02:42.480> has<00:02:42.689> is<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.079> when<00:02:43.230> it's<00:02:43.379> using

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
scrambler has is that when it's using

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.100 
scrambler has is that when it's using
conjunction<00:02:44.250> with<00:02:44.430> an<00:02:45.090> overt<00:02:45.390> or<00:02:45.540> an<00:02:45.689> amp<00:02:45.870> or

harmonix<00:02:49.110> my<00:02:49.230> tongue<00:02:49.349> off<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:49.650> we<00:02:49.709> have<00:02:49.799> here

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
harmonix my tongue off that we have here

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.679 
harmonix my tongue off that we have here
is<00:02:50.579> that<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.849> could<00:02:51.000> cut<00:02:51.150> through<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.450> sound

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
is that it could cut through the sound

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.949 
is that it could cut through the sound
with<00:02:51.840> its<00:02:52.019> octave<00:02:52.319> effect<00:02:53.420> here's<00:02:54.420> an<00:02:54.540> example

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:04.009 

here's<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.170> regular<00:02:58.470> guitar<00:02:58.920> tone<00:03:03.019> and

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
here's the regular guitar tone and

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:38.869 
here's the regular guitar tone and
here's<00:03:04.200> with<00:03:04.349> that<00:03:04.560> big<00:03:04.769> scrambler

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.030 

though<00:03:39.879> I'm<00:03:40.239> going<00:03:40.359> to<00:03:40.420> test<00:03:40.659> out<00:03:40.870> this<00:03:41.590> effect

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
though I'm going to test out this effect

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.800 
though I'm going to test out this effect
with<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.670> fender<00:03:43.329> basics<00:03:45.390> let's<00:03:46.390> see<00:03:46.569> how<00:03:46.689> it

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
with the fender basics let's see how it

00:03:46.810 --> 00:04:09.220 
with the fender basics let's see how it
sounds

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.140 

now<00:04:10.230> if<00:04:10.290> we<00:04:10.380> bring<00:04:10.500> up<00:04:10.710> texture<00:04:11.550> all<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.060> way

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
now if we bring up texture all the way

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:20.819 
now if we bring up texture all the way
up<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.960> bring<00:04:13.170> down<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.650> balance

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:36.980 

I

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.280 

make<00:04:37.990> sure<00:04:38.200> that<00:04:38.350> about<00:04:38.710> 50%<00:04:40.080> balance<00:04:41.080> all<00:04:41.200> the

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
make sure that about 50% balance all the

00:04:41.290 --> 00:05:02.020 
make sure that about 50% balance all the
way

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.570 

we<00:05:03.030> bring<00:05:03.180> balance<00:05:03.540> all<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.810> way<00:05:03.900> down<00:05:04.580> for

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
we bring balance all the way down for

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:52.490 
we bring balance all the way down for
nearly<00:05:05.820> all<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.210> way

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.530 

so<00:05:53.500> as<00:05:53.830> you<00:05:53.980> can<00:05:54.160> hear<00:05:54.400> the<00:05:54.790> epic<00:05:55.090> scrambler<00:05:55.480> is

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
so as you can hear the epic scrambler is

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.230 
so as you can hear the epic scrambler is
great<00:05:55.720> for<00:05:55.900> both<00:05:56.020> guitar<00:05:56.470> and<00:05:56.770> bass<00:05:57.010> and<00:05:57.430> it's

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
great for both guitar and bass and it's

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.390 
great for both guitar and bass and it's
a<00:05:58.300> good<00:05:58.450> noisemaker<00:05:59.020> it's<00:05:59.770> fun<00:05:59.950> to<00:06:00.040> play<00:06:00.160> with

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
a good noisemaker it's fun to play with

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.950 
a good noisemaker it's fun to play with
and<00:06:01.200> it's<00:06:02.200> highly<00:06:02.440> recommended<00:06:03.750> that's<00:06:04.750> all

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
and it's highly recommended that's all

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:17.430 
and it's highly recommended that's all
folks<00:06:10.170> it<00:06:11.170> looks<00:06:11.230> like<00:06:11.560> a<00:06:11.590> robot<00:06:12.190> face<00:06:15.840> like<00:06:16.840> it

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
folks it looks like a robot face like it

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.910 
folks it looks like a robot face like it
could<00:06:17.590> be<00:06:17.620> best<00:06:17.890> friends<00:06:18.070> with<00:06:18.280> the<00:06:18.460> fuzz<00:06:18.640> face
