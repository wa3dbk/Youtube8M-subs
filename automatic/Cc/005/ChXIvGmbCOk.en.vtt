you'll use the XDM well that right that
was<00:02:56.070> just<00:02:56.220> use<00:02:56.340> more<00:02:56.519> electron<00:02:57.060> oh<00:02:57.329> you<00:02:58.170> use

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
was just use more electron oh you use

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.259 
was just use more electron oh you use
those<00:02:58.500> two<00:02:58.799> in<00:02:59.010> those<00:02:59.220> challenges<00:02:59.730> you'll

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
those two in those challenges you'll

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.180 
those two in those challenges you'll
only<00:03:00.600> use<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.989> toad<00:03:01.320> once<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.950> little

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
only use the toad once that little

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.900 
only use the toad once that little
go-kart<00:03:02.670> typically<00:03:02.970> look<00:03:03.299> at<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.570> point<00:03:03.840> you

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
go-kart typically look at that point you

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.520 
go-kart typically look at that point you
only<00:03:05.910> use<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.299> once<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.870> that's<00:03:07.079> right<00:03:07.350> here

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
only use that once and that's right here

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.060 
only use that once and that's right here
so<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:09.000> only<00:03:09.180> use<00:03:09.359> that<00:03:09.570> once<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.109> it'll<00:03:10.920> be

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
so you only use that once and it'll be

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.470 
so you only use that once and it'll be
on<00:03:11.100> fire<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:11.640> any<00:03:11.760> car<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.150> hit<00:03:12.329> will

explode when you're using it I get to do

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.539 
explode when you're using it I get to do
them<00:03:15.060> get<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.500> think<00:03:17.190> there's<00:03:17.340> six
