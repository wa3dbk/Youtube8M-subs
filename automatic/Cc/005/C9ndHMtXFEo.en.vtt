00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.580
 so we actually got our 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.360
 coffee beans by a supplier who 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.400
 is based in the harbor 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.960
 it happens directly by boat that goes 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.619
 pick it up on farms 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.670
 you chouchi colombia all cases merit south 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.510
 mainly brazil we work 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.029
 a lot with brazil 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.990
 we also work with ski africa 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.970
 and Cameroon congo 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.140
 we also work with robusta 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.360
 therefore in fact our supplier 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.020
 prospects on farms in 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.250
 different countries 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.540
 he chooses coffee at the grain 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.070
 really to know if the bumps he has 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.120
 no wormhole 6 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.440
 here the really well dry then 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.340
 he tells us he presents it to us 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.770
 we look at him 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.470
 really texture we try it after we 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.670
 choose our tonnage from what we 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.650
 must for roasting what did 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.010
 our blends he send it to us in 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.809
 according to them 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.949
 our regular roasting so all 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.380
 weeks or fortnight and 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.270
 we do it he makes us arrive our bags 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:15.409
 of green coffee it is he who buy 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:18.080
 our green coffee all depends on the 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.820
 variety so our 100% arabica one has 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.710
 maybe grain different grains 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.600
 different arabica so I'll give you 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.350
 not the varieties what I think and 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.830
 recipes to us our italian we have five 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.039
 Arabica beans and a single grain of 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.569
 robusta for example Italian we have five 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.450
 arabica grains that are not 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.819
 identical to the mixture of tradition 80 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.800
 is still not the same grain we have 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:44.000
 these are the five grains that we work 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.049
 in Italian are not the same 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.360
 are not identical to coffee 80 it's 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.100
 it's really different cafes 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.959
 five mix are not how 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.190
 would I say are not going to give the same 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:02:02.170
 flavor in the mouth as the 80 or cetc 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.170
 else of two different origins 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.640
 we have a little coffee foot is 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.190
 necessarily between the two tropics between 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.500
 600 and 2000 meters lived in stud farms 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.620
 of the cap where they are more odor 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.720
 it is robust to later I handle 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.400
 coffee only once missed 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.680
 mix in all these are parents of the 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.200
 town 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.180
 on a day like this here and there 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.890
 it's a mix of 5 to actually it's the one 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.560
 who sells the most we will say it's 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.330
 really the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.260
 its beauty competitors there is a 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.260
 robust with aramits because it makes traveling 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:46.739
 so I put green coffee I 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.500
 mix support what I have to do 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.480
 after he can suck on top of 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.690
 roaster with both vacuums 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.640
 girl above 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.250
 I open this hit the house that goes 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.250
 knock down the green and gold coffee 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.920
 we fill 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.480
 it may be cowardly to suck the coffee 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.480
 rest i fill ref 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.129
 the roaster chance at 900 degrees 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.780
 lee for about 25 minutes then 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.629
 happiness is lit carnival of 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.760
 the temperature or cancel it does not come 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.560
 the moment we are going to say critical where it takes 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.530
 to be to check 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.420
 who are the bad coffees 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.099
 it was in the vendee 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.260
 so I wanted to greet but from 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.940
 that moment I'm going rugby with 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.340
 processor is there 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.700
 I get a little entrance fee 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.700
 late 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.000
 he will decide it was good weather and 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.910
 after these two colors I think that 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.760
 Latin is good I open the 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.730
 keystroke that stops the process and the 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.100
 coffee and one in the cooler and 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.250
 tainted for about a quarter 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.250
 time 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.280
 I inspired here by passing in late 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.930
 test 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.840
 there is also a big magnet to delay in 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.540
 coffee even if sorted by a yacht 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.220
 pictures of pebbles 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.680
 this is the bag you actually get 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.980
 all the dust and so draw inspiration there 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.270
 and like that it's full in him or in 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.270
 their and fight state 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.670
 no 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.940
 once it's inspired man and the 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.060
 machine en route 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.510
 we put the pocket gaffed soul corner on 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.510
 press the pedal 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.110
 we want him 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:44.739
 then the grind for all that is 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:46.689
 percolator of bars or individuals 

00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:50.309
 who come to get their coffee if they 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:54.610
 have a bar percolator a group 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:56.649
 that he's cooking traditional there 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.289
 can do the grind to 4 4 and a half on 

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:01.149
 rule according to the customer's material 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.279
 if it's a percolator if it's a 

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:05.349
 traditional coffee machine or a 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.550
 end of piston machines so if that's 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:10.599
 a job we will do the best more 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:13.209
 big so that the coffee stays well already 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.069
 take all its aroma and that does not pass 

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:16.569
 not through the filters and that at the end 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:18.369
 we end up in the cup with 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:22.059
 traditional coffee grounds we had 

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:24.909
 our sister of grind and then for 

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:28.239
 all that is perco his puffs in 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:30.159
 make more coffee and grind and end rain 

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:35.379
 will take time to spend more he will take 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:37.329
 its aroma level the conservation the coffee 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.729
 it can be kept cold 

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:42.009
 there you noticed the level side 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.200
 in the bagging room and he 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:46.780
 very cold 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.820
 in glass towers or in pots 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.320
 Plastic is not good he loses 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.050
 its aroma it really has to be 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.480
 closed or cold so actually we are 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.480
 advise to leave it in the packages 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.480
 offrions
