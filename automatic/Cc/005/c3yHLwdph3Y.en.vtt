00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.700
 our TV is in ferment today and in 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.559
 transfer we are at carrÃ¹ company 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.179
 agricultural fre for a very day 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.580
 particular on the same day that 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.020
 we celebrate craft beer in turin 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.330
 to the open fest ballad and we came 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.939
 to find the company's antonello musso 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.019
 agricultural freche is also a brewery 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.550
 our shoulders are agricultural 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.199
 collecting hops 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.380
 this initiative is precisely this hops 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.430
 for a day antonello's initiative 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.040
 which brought passionate visitors 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.540
 of beer to find out where the beer is born 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.340
 where one of the hops is grown 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.680
 ingredients that antonello uses for his 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.379
 beers then today is being made 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.850
 collection and how it works and what 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.649
 do 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.190
 yes I thought to do this this 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.809
 day a little to understand consumers 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.579
 beer regulars as one of the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.579
 main ingredients are good and so 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.170
 by doing we really understand in a way 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.820
 practice how the plant is made too 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.409
 because it is so important not to continue 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.799
 they are not even as made especially like 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.200
 comes how the non harvest is managed 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.390
 better chance than doing it in the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.550
 harvest day 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.460
 I rarely show you how 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.650
 how the plant developed the plant that 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.490
 arrives at about three and a half together 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.710
 height produces but did not go 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.000
 an incredible amount of cones that 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.780
 they are then collected 11 by hand and then 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.680
 quality brought for drying 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.950
 of hops and also 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.540
 certainly due to the variety la 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.660
 type of our land at 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.240
 to climatic conditions such as years 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.790
 this year for all that has been 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.420
 a bad year for hops and it was 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.280
 a great vintage 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.750
 here is one of the ingredients that 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.820
 it is produced by your company 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.080
 together with others to make beers 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.270
 of a real agricultural brewery that 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.490
 therefore it produces essentially everything if 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.340
 our company as well as being 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.709
 a farm that produces others 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.959
 other products such as hazelnuts and kiwi 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.209
 that you see here on the side we have the 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.720
 bees have the strawberries we have entered from 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.420
 two years also the beer beer talk 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.650
 obviously agricultural because in any case the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.790
 all of them are raw materials 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.330
 grown within our own 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.430
 company 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.250
 so not only 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.930
 hops but also barley and barley lo 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.379
 we grow in our fields here here 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.989
 next to the wolf bed after harvesting e 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.209
 was sent for the malting we have 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.680
 we are partners from the matter to ancona that 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.359
 it's called kobe that makes us 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.900
 transformation of our whole is one 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:49.280
 asshole that we use to say 100 for 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.829
 a hundred maybe exaggerated but let's say a 93 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.010
 100 in all our beers we do 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:59.060
 ours means two beers we have one 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:02.269
 yes we have an amber in our line 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.129
 a blonde or for one reason we have only 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.720
 two beers because producing c 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.439
 all our raw materials 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.530
 we have difficulty making a range 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.879
 of products so vast as to be able 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.430
 promise to make more beer 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.950
 so all our beers i feel of 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.599
 say that they are produced with our le 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.560
 our raw materials 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.569
 well we invite all friends 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.010
 of course to discover and we are there now 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.299
 we will move to turin to continue 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.549
 this day in the sign of beer 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.079
 thanks to tonello musso and his 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.000
 frey farm hop for a 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.810
 day and now we will go to the open 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.810
 thanks parties
