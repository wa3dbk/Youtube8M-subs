00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
how the harsh that was um but I mean it

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.389 
how the harsh that was um but I mean it
made<00:01:13.630> for<00:01:13.869> a<00:01:13.930> great<00:01:13.960> television<00:01:14.470> I<00:01:14.860> guess<00:01:15.070> and

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
made for a great television I guess and

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.580 
made for a great television I guess and
in<00:01:15.729> red<00:01:16.000> is<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.600> emotion<00:01:17.229> that<00:01:17.259> we<00:01:17.470> were

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
in red is that the emotion that we were

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.190
