around from the side it has this flex
panel<00:00:48.690> technology<00:00:48.840> which<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> fancy<00:00:49.890> way<00:00:50.039> of

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
panel technology which is a fancy way of

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.090 
panel technology which is a fancy way of
saying<00:00:50.190> elastic<00:00:50.969> all<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.140> does<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.530> allow

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
saying elastic all that does is allow

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
saying elastic all that does is allow
the<00:00:53.129> headgear<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.910> expand<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.899> contract

other headgear I use a lace system
rather<00:01:15.360> than<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.630> Velcro<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.920> much

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
rather than a Velcro I like this much

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.719 
rather than a Velcro I like this much
more<00:01:17.990> so<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> has<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> taper<00:01:19.920> it's

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
more so and then it has a taper it's

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.030 
more so and then it has a taper it's
tapered<00:01:21.090> down<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.229> sits<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
tapered down here so that it sits on the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.060 
tapered down here so that it sits on the
native<00:01:23.400> your<00:01:23.549> neck<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.450> that's<00:01:24.630> very<00:01:24.840> nice

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
native your neck so that's very nice

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.289 
native your neck so that's very nice
padding<00:01:26.070> wise<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.520> very<00:01:26.759> pretty<00:01:27.150> nicely

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
padding wise is very pretty nicely

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.120 
padding wise is very pretty nicely
padded<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.990> obviously<00:01:28.470> not<00:01:28.650> too<00:01:28.770> thick<00:01:28.979> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
padded it's obviously not too thick this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.469 
padded it's obviously not too thick this
padding<00:01:29.490> because<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.939> want<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.180> save<00:01:30.360> on

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
padding because you want to save on

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
padding because you want to save on
weight<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> would<00:01:31.560> say<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.829> about<00:01:32.009> 3/4<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
weight but I would say it's about 3/4 of

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.280 
weight but I would say it's about 3/4 of
an<00:01:32.790> inch<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.180> way<00:01:33.270> around<00:01:33.630> from<00:01:33.869> both<00:01:34.110> the

ear<00:01:37.530> pads<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> back<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.060> head<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.390> you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
ear pads to the back of the head so you

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.359 
ear pads to the back of the head so you
can<00:01:39.509> kind<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.869> see<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> has<00:01:40.290> maybe<00:01:40.560> about<00:01:40.799> 3/4

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
can kind of see it has maybe about 3/4

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.800 
can kind of see it has maybe about 3/4
of<00:01:41.400> an<00:01:41.520> inch<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.820> padding<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.240> there<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
of an inch of padding right there and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.350 
of an inch of padding right there and
then<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.009> also<00:01:44.189> synthetic<00:01:44.880> leather<00:01:45.119> so

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
then it is also synthetic leather so

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.149 
then it is also synthetic leather so
this<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.600> not<00:01:45.780> real<00:01:46.049> leather<00:01:46.229> again<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.979> save

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
this is not real leather again to save

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.880 
this is not real leather again to save
on<00:01:47.340> weight<00:01:47.720> it<00:01:48.720> has<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.930> nice<00:01:49.140> smooth<00:01:49.439> feel<00:01:49.680> to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
on weight it has a nice smooth feel to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.950 
on weight it has a nice smooth feel to
it<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> construction<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.790> pretty<00:01:51.420> nice<00:01:51.540> over

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
it the construction is pretty nice over

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.480 
it the construction is pretty nice over
on<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.530> should<00:01:52.680> be<00:01:52.770> able<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.950> get<00:01:53.040> you

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
on and you should be able to get you

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.980 
on and you should be able to get you
know<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> couple<00:01:53.880> years<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.390> good<00:01:54.600> use<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:54.930> of

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
this the chinstrap is only downside I

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.230 
this the chinstrap is only downside I
see<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.409> being<00:01:59.130> velcro<00:01:59.579> I'm<00:01:59.670> not<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> big<00:02:00.060> fan<00:02:00.210> of

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
see is being velcro I'm not a big fan of

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.420 
see is being velcro I'm not a big fan of
velcro<00:02:00.659> straps<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.110> more<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.530> belt<00:02:02.219> buckle

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
velcro straps on more of a belt buckle

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.850 
velcro straps on more of a belt buckle
style<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.479> because<00:02:03.600> over<00:02:04.020> time<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
style just because over time the the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.560 
style just because over time the the
strap<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> east<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.820> get<00:02:06.000> worn<00:02:06.240> out<00:02:06.329> as

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
strap on the east can get worn out as

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.800 
strap on the east can get worn out as
you<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:07.700> undoing<00:02:08.700> velcro<00:02:09.119> over<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.509> over

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
you know undoing velcro over and over

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.390 
you know undoing velcro over and over
over<00:02:09.959> time<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.530> starts<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.830> go<00:02:10.920> bad<00:02:10.950> so

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
over time it starts to go bad so

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.250 
over time it starts to go bad so
eventually<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:12.090> might<00:02:12.270> not<00:02:12.450> even<00:02:12.480> hook<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:13.020> at

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
eventually it might not even hook on at

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.520 
eventually it might not even hook on at
the<00:02:13.410> bottom<00:02:13.560> anymore<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:15.200> that's<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.349> only

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
the bottom anymore so that's the only

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.430 
the bottom anymore so that's the only
downside<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.920> see<00:02:17.130> with<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:19.110> inside

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
downside I see with that so the inside

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.990 
downside I see with that so the inside
liner<00:02:19.650> also<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.670> polyester<00:02:21.390> mesh<00:02:22.290> liner<00:02:23.010> so

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
liner also is a polyester mesh liner so

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.610 
liner also is a polyester mesh liner so
it's<00:02:24.330> very<00:02:24.599> nice<00:02:24.840> because<00:02:25.050> it's<00:02:25.260> not<00:02:25.380> leather

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
it's very nice because it's not leather

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.410 
it's very nice because it's not leather
like<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.069> outside<00:02:26.400> where<00:02:26.819> it's<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.209> gonna

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
like the outside where it's just gonna

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.030 
like the outside where it's just gonna
collect<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.989> drip<00:02:28.200> on<00:02:28.349> your<00:02:28.470> face<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.830> entire

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
collect and drip on your face the entire

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.400 
collect and drip on your face the entire
time<00:02:29.099> you're<00:02:29.489> sparring<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.569> absorbs<00:02:31.050> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
time you're sparring so it absorbs the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.530 
time you're sparring so it absorbs the
the<00:02:31.830> sweat<00:02:32.160> pretty<00:02:32.519> good<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.910> then<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.150> that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
the sweat pretty good and then it that

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.920 
the sweat pretty good and then it that
wicks<00:02:33.810> away<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.110> moisture<00:02:35.569> which<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> good

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
wicks away the moisture which is a good

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.770 
wicks away the moisture which is a good

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
that the nose protection is probably not

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.010 
that the nose protection is probably not
the<00:04:34.830> best<00:04:34.860> so<00:04:35.430> as<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:36.150> can<00:04:36.270> see<00:04:36.330> from<00:04:36.600> my<00:04:36.810> side
