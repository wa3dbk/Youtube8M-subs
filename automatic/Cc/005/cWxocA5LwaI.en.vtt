Joyce Luck from Black Hair Compass presents....
How to create a bigh bun with a textured bang.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.570
If you ask me, this style is quite "I love
Lucy" esque and is the perfect Holiday hairstyle.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.329
If you missed last week's episode on how to

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.370
achieve a heatless strecthed afro, be sure
to check it out.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.930
Take a look at how I parted my hair. I sectionedout a semi oval in the front where our textured bang will be.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.890
The rest of my hair is sectioned into bantu knots.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.110
and although you want to make sure
they're not too large so they will dry

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.090
completely, it doesn't really matter where you part your hair.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.470
My hair has been washed and conditioned and lightly coated my with oil.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.730
Make sure your hair is well detangled and
begin to dutch braid downward towards the

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.730
front of your head.
If you don't know how to dutch braid, check out my video explaining the process.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.479
Wrap your hair in preparation for bed.
No joke, I was

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.600
too tired. I was NOT ready for that early morning church service.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.119
Begin unraveling the bantu knots and gently comb them out.
After applying gel to the edges, brush the

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:59.119
After applying gel to the edges, brush the hair until it is smooth.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.479
Using a knee high stocking, tie the hair into a high bun.
Use a hair net, to form the bun.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.300
Unravel and fluff the braids...
Divide a 1/3 of the section, roll, tuck, and

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.690
Divide a 1/3 of the section, roll, tuck, and pin it in place.
There you have it, folks. A unique, but very

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.569
easy to do holiday hairstyle.
As always, thanks for tuning in, and Ill see

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.490
you all next week.
