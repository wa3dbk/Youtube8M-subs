but more than that a lesson in how just

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.150 
but more than that a lesson in how just
fine<00:00:10.520> can<00:00:10.970> be<00:00:11.150> just<00:00:11.660> fine<00:00:11.840> let's<00:00:12.800> drive<00:00:13.010> the

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
tack now if Toyota is anything it's a

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.810 
tack now if Toyota is anything it's a
conservative<00:00:20.930> company<00:00:21.380> with<00:00:22.100> the<00:00:22.250> possible

just<00:00:25.250> don't<00:00:25.369> take<00:00:25.730> chances<00:00:26.119> with<00:00:26.240> anything

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
just don't take chances with anything

the Celica the mr2 the Supra long gone
so<00:00:30.380> it's<00:00:30.920> hard<00:00:31.100> to<00:00:31.220> characterize<00:00:31.430> the

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
so it's hard to characterize the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.549 
so it's hard to characterize the
Highlander<00:00:32.449> as<00:00:32.599> much<00:00:32.929> of<00:00:33.079> anything<00:00:33.440> in

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
particular but it was the first

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.079 
particular but it was the first
mid-sized<00:00:36.289> crossover<00:00:36.949> and<00:00:37.159> it<00:00:37.460> maintains<00:00:37.850> its

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 
mid-sized crossover and it maintains its

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:39.669 
mid-sized crossover and it maintains its

that<00:00:57.679> would<00:00:57.829> wow<00:00:58.129> you<00:00:58.190> on<00:00:58.579> paper<00:00:58.850> but<00:00:59.420> using<00:00:59.809> it

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
that would wow you on paper but using it

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.109 
that would wow you on paper but using it
is<00:01:00.109> just<00:01:00.319> absolutely<00:01:00.440> Pleasant<00:01:01.429> I<00:01:01.489> never<00:01:01.789> once

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119 
is just absolutely Pleasant I never once

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.299 
is just absolutely Pleasant I never once
went<00:01:02.359> back<00:01:02.600> at<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.379> damn<00:01:03.559> thing<00:01:03.799> you<00:01:03.979> know<00:01:04.100> for

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
went back at the damn thing you know for

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.760 
went back at the damn thing you know for
me<00:01:04.460> that's<00:01:04.970> kind<00:01:05.120> of<00:01:05.360> rare<00:01:05.540> this<00:01:05.870> is<00:01:06.050> DVD<00:01:06.260> bass

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
me that's kind of rare this is DVD bass

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.560 
me that's kind of rare this is DVD bass
but<00:01:07.040> notice<00:01:07.340> how<00:01:07.490> smoothly<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.210> quickly<00:01:08.360> I

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
but notice how smoothly and quickly I

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.180 
but notice how smoothly and quickly I
can<00:01:08.780> get<00:01:08.930> around<00:01:09.170> with<00:01:09.350> touchscreen<00:01:09.830> inputs

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
can get around with touchscreen inputs

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.850 
can get around with touchscreen inputs
now<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:11.210> resolutions<00:01:11.960> not<00:01:12.140> great<00:01:12.500> this<00:01:12.680> is

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
now the resolutions not great this is

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.440 
now the resolutions not great this is
not<00:01:13.040> like<00:01:13.220> you'd<00:01:13.400> find<00:01:13.640> on<00:01:13.730> a<00:01:13.790> higher<00:01:14.090> trim

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
not like you'd find on a higher trim

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.880 
not like you'd find on a higher trim
Toyota<00:01:14.870> or<00:01:15.080> a<00:01:15.110> lexus<00:01:15.560> where<00:01:15.680> you'd<00:01:15.770> have<00:01:15.860> a

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
Toyota or a lexus where you'd have a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.500 
Toyota or a lexus where you'd have a
much<00:01:15.950> finer<00:01:16.430> dot<00:01:16.760> pitch<00:01:17.000> but<00:01:17.450> that

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
much finer dot pitch but that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.210 
much finer dot pitch but that
cost-cutting<00:01:18.050> move<00:01:18.350> doesn't<00:01:18.560> bother<00:01:18.800> me<00:01:19.100> when

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
cost-cutting move doesn't bother me when

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.890 
cost-cutting move doesn't bother me when
the<00:01:19.370> underlying<00:01:19.880> performance<00:01:20.540> is<00:01:20.690> good

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
the underlying performance is good

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.990 
the underlying performance is good
entering<00:01:21.440> an<00:01:21.560> address<00:01:21.710> is<00:01:22.190> easy<00:01:22.370> the<00:01:22.610> screen

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
entering an address is easy the screen

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.390 
entering an address is easy the screen
is<00:01:23.270> properly<00:01:23.990> responsive<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:24.860> I<00:01:25.070> found<00:01:25.310> the

is properly responsive and I found the

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.580 
is properly responsive and I found the
voice<00:01:25.580> command<00:01:26.000> was<00:01:26.120> also<00:01:26.450> very<00:01:26.660> solid<00:01:27.200> now

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
voice command was also very solid now

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.630 
voice command was also very solid now
once<00:01:27.770> you're<00:01:27.890> under<00:01:27.980> guidance<00:01:28.280> you've<00:01:28.520> got

once you're under guidance you've got
some<00:01:28.790> very<00:01:28.940> interesting<00:01:29.030> map<00:01:29.600> views<00:01:29.900> useful

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
some very interesting map views useful

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.140 
some very interesting map views useful
