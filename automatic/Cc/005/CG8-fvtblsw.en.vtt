00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:17.709 
would
I<00:05:16.310> think<00:05:16.819> everyone<00:05:17.150> owns<00:05:17.300> a<00:05:17.389> pair<00:05:17.569> of<00:05:17.599> these

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
I think everyone owns a pair of these

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:20.469 
I think everyone owns a pair of these
these<00:05:18.110> are<00:05:18.289> from<00:05:18.500> signs<00:05:19.039> they're<00:05:19.939> dark<00:05:20.150> brown

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
these are from signs they're dark brown

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.390 
these are from signs they're dark brown
they<00:05:21.110> look<00:05:21.289> black<00:05:21.500> but<00:05:21.560> they're<00:05:21.949> dark<00:05:22.129> brown

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
they look black but they're dark brown

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.829 
they look black but they're dark brown
they<00:05:22.849> don't<00:05:22.999> have<00:05:23.089> a<00:05:23.120> zipper<00:05:23.419> though<00:05:23.569> so<00:05:23.719> it

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:23.839 
they don't have a zipper though so it

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:25.360 
they don't have a zipper though so it
kind<00:05:23.990> of<00:05:24.020> makes<00:05:24.169> them<00:05:24.319> hard<00:05:24.499> to<00:05:24.529> get<00:05:24.680> on<00:05:24.770> really

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
kind of makes them hard to get on really

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.390 
kind of makes them hard to get on really
short<00:05:25.669> heel<00:05:25.879> but<00:05:26.330> very<00:05:26.539> comfortable<00:05:27.159> the<00:05:28.159> next

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
short heel but very comfortable the next
