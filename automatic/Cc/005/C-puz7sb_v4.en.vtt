let<00:01:46.619> me<00:01:46.740> tell<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.009> something<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> cherry

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
let me tell you something the cherry

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.420 
let me tell you something the cherry
Wynn<00:01:48.030> thing<00:01:48.329> will<00:01:48.570> fade<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.619> like<00:01:49.860> all<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
Wynn thing will fade just like all the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.219 
Wynn thing will fade just like all the
Tim<00:01:50.640> Tebow<00:01:50.820> stuff<00:01:51.270> will<00:01:51.479> fade<00:01:51.750> there<00:01:51.990> will<00:01:52.079> not

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
Tim Tebow stuff will fade there will not

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.289 
Tim Tebow stuff will fade there will not
be<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.470> same<00:01:52.680> player<00:01:53.040> right<00:01:53.310> afterwards<00:01:53.909> but

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
be the same player right afterwards but

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
be the same player right afterwards but
let<00:01:54.509> me<00:01:54.630> show<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.049> what<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> best<00:01:55.770> athletes

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
let me show you what the best athletes

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.109 
let me show you what the best athletes
have<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.729> common

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
have in common

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.260 
have in common
you<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.630> athlete<00:01:58.229> begins<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.880> is

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
you see athlete begins with a and a is

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.969 
you see athlete begins with a and a is
the<00:02:00.479> first<00:02:00.659> letter<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> alphabet<00:02:01.320> so

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
the first letter of the alphabet so

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.770 
the first letter of the alphabet so
people<00:02:02.490> choose<00:02:02.520> numerology<00:02:03.420> numbers

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
people choose numerology numbers

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.499 
people choose numerology numbers
basically<00:02:04.530> add<00:02:04.710> up<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.130> one<00:02:05.369> example<00:02:06.000> say

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
basically add up to one example say

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.809 
basically add up to one example say
someone<00:02:06.899> born<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.560> LeBron<00:02:08.009> James<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.580> born

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
someone born like LeBron James is born

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.089 
someone born like LeBron James is born
12<00:02:09.119> 30<00:02:09.390> 1984<00:02:10.200> well<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.709> do<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.830> math<00:02:10.950> 1<00:02:11.849> 2<00:02:12.260> 3<00:02:13.260> 0

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
12 30 1984 well you do the math 1 2 3 0

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.149 
12 30 1984 well you do the math 1 2 3 0
1<00:02:14.430> 984<00:02:15.329> adds<00:02:15.599> up<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.930> 28<00:02:16.409> and<00:02:16.590> unless<00:02:17.010> the

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
1 984 adds up to 28 and unless the

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.520 
1 984 adds up to 28 and unless the
number<00:02:17.400> adds<00:02:17.549> up<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.879> 22<00:02:18.389> or<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.900> 11<00:02:19.349> it

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
number adds up to a 22 or on 11 it

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.429 
number adds up to a 22 or on 11 it
always<00:02:19.859> gets<00:02:20.219> reduced<00:02:20.579> so<00:02:20.969> the<00:02:21.150> 22<00:02:21.599> becomes<00:02:21.989> 2

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
always gets reduced so the 22 becomes 2

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.589 
always gets reduced so the 22 becomes 2
plus<00:02:22.590> 8<00:02:22.889> equals<00:02:23.249> 10<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.639> 1<00:02:23.939> plus<00:02:24.150> 0<00:02:24.389> equals

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
plus 8 equals 10 and 1 plus 0 equals

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.349 
plus 8 equals 10 and 1 plus 0 equals
that<00:02:25.170> magic<00:02:25.590> number<00:02:25.799> 1<00:02:26.219> now<00:02:26.730> for<00:02:26.969> all<00:02:27.030> people

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
that magic number 1 now for all people

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:28.910 
that magic number 1 now for all people
who<00:02:27.450> think<00:02:27.629> that's<00:02:27.719> a<00:02:27.840> coincidence<00:02:28.049> this<00:02:28.739> is

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
who think that's a coincidence this is

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.830 
who think that's a coincidence this is

doesn't get reduced like other numbers
like<00:02:56.549> for<00:02:56.730> instance<00:02:56.969> if<00:02:57.090> something<00:02:57.359> adds<00:02:57.510> up

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
like for instance if something adds up

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.080 
like for instance if something adds up
to<00:02:57.719> 29<00:02:58.230> 2<00:02:58.709> plus<00:02:58.919> 9<00:02:59.099> equals<00:02:59.430> 11<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.819> does<00:02:59.969> not
