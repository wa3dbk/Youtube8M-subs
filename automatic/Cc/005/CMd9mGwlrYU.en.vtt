00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
you seen much of them at all I've seen

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.830 
you seen much of them at all I've seen
I've<00:01:34.350> seen<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.680> college<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.159> sometimes

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
I've seen in college but sometimes

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840 
I've seen in college but sometimes
college<00:01:36.890> doesn't<00:01:37.890> translate<00:01:38.189> your<00:01:38.430> game<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
college doesn't translate your game to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.940 
college doesn't translate your game to
the<00:01:38.939> NBA<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.470> adapt<00:01:40.770> you

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the NBA so you just have to adapt you

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.219 
the NBA so you just have to adapt you
don't<00:01:41.130> know<00:01:41.250> how<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.610> gonna<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.810> think

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
don't know how it's gonna be but I think

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.289 
don't know how it's gonna be but I think
both<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.649> them<00:01:43.920> are<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.430> really<00:01:44.670> good<00:01:44.970> like

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
both of them are like really good like

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.789 
both of them are like really good like
they<00:01:46.170> say<00:01:47.540> it<00:01:48.540> depends<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.079> depends<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.560> think

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
they say it depends it depends I think

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.920 
they say it depends it depends I think
the<00:01:49.860> workouts<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.579> gonna<00:01:50.790> determine<00:01:51.119> wasn't

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the workouts are gonna determine wasn't

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.740 
the workouts are gonna determine wasn't
gonna<00:01:52.049> be<00:01:52.200> number<00:01:52.380> one<00:01:52.619> who's<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.600> how<00:01:54.600> much
