 thinking is developing the new

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.820
 or 4 years so good this has us 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:04.939
 permanently active 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.020
 and it also makes us have the 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.630
 consumer a permanent connection to 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.070
 through the different varieties or 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.940
 wines that offer us one of the 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.509
 novelties is to pave a dessert wine 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.149
 that comes to complete in the trilogy of 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.369
 badly loved until this moment badly loved 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.619
 they were three wines from the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.039
 incorporation of badly loved sun flooring and 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.590
 day and has passed the collection to have 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.869
 four badly loved joy has a 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.479
 particularity that after heading 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.170
 our not logos and our team 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.130
 technician put it in barrels barrels of 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.810
 fourth use and left it outdoors 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.460
 in these three or four years of 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.440
 permanence of the wine within the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.229
 barrels and the inclement weather 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.540
 time where he had sun where he was cold was 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.659
 caused a strong concentration or a 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.440
 approximately 12% reduction at 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.990
 so much was a much more intense wine 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.280
 much more sweet with a graduation of 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.459
 20 degrees of alcohol or is important and 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.530
 The other characteristic of this wine is 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.230
 that is made from a 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.570
 very Argentine variety very ours that 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.180
 is the torrontés and when sebastián 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.540
 begins to develop in the year 2009 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.700
 when you start thinking about this wine 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.390
 think start thinking what are the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.400
 characteristics of his grandfather and good the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.019
 characteristics of your grandfather and what are 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.000
 the characteristics of the company 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.590
 first thing you do is choose an area and 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.530
 choose in uco valley as an area 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.840
 where it was going to be elaborated I say with the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.879
 grapes to be made this wine chooses 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.390
 two traditional varieties that are 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:54.280
 Malbec and Cabernet and choose as seal 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.160
 innovative to incorporate these two 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.290
 varieties a percentage of draft 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.660
 openwork also our valley 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.959
 de uco openwork is a French variety 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.450
 brought very recently in Argentina and that 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.140
 actually very few wineries have and 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.810
 the other novelty is aluvional the pear tree 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.209
 last year also the team sebastian 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.140
 with his team began working this 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:23.950
 the concept of terroir the concept of 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.190
 Iranian terroir wines past throws his 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.099
 first alluvium to the one that is of the query 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.170
 to an area of ​​the valley of sought this year 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.290
 complete this collection with a flood 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.579
 who is from the pear area in both 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.980
 cases is malbec but what sebastián 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.100
 expresses from these wines and what 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.210
 He says it's the future 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:52.800
 is this do not leave the side variety and 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.800
 start talking about terroir 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.459
 my job is basically the farms 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.440
 from the valley of uco where we already have today 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.900
 five farms five vineyards in five 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.550
 different places and I'll take care of 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.349
 that part and I manage the area of 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.209
 Investigation and development 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.520
 I believe that good in wine when one 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.890
 speaks of terroir the people who do the 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.829
 It came extremely important from the 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.540
 vineyard up to verify it and I think 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.160
 that it is important that there is a concept 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.660
 an idea a search through each 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.370
 came from what we have worked hard on 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.320
 divide and that each team in the hold 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.100
 have your objective your search the 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.830
 vineyards that work and a range of wines 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.410
 in charge the serial concept is for 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.000
 Argentine series within series are the 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.540
 three most important varieties of 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.100
 argentina torrontés malbec bonarda 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.790
 the three zones that we consider to be 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.610
 the best 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.590
 then the torrent of cafayate the 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.600
 malbec is from val de deuco and bonarda 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.510
 of santa rosa and that is the concept of 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.729
 series in zuccardi what we are dealing with is 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.889
 what we do inside the wine will be a 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.419
 little more specific with the areas the 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.210
 summit when we started the project in 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.710
 the year 97 was for 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.509
 to export a project to 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.970
 england then the one that came from 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.350
 quality and we start to mark all the 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.690
 vineyards because in this project it 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.610
 they select old vineyards and vineyards and 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.259
 of some parts began to mark with 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.360
 the cv the vineyards and then in the tank 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.880
 also put lacquer to mark it was 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.720
 for that project and after so much 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.400
 which then came to the label 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.500
 this red sugar wine that is the 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.610
 friend duel when they were guys when 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.260
 it was boy they called him tito and my grandfather 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.580
 that was the one that started the winery in the 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:39.550
 year 63 his whole life has been and is very 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.530
 innovative much search has always been 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.420
 encouraged to do good things he came not 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.940
 came from agriculture came from the 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.860
 constructive part I remember that he 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.660
 he always told us I did not know what he did not 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.240
 could be done and if some things that did not 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.590
 many of them could be made and worked 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.060
 the things that we have in the cellar 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.920
 they have to do with the imprint of what 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.490
 he has sought then happy me 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.990
 I proposed a single limit the place this 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.580
 wine comes from the one hundred consultation 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.620
 one hundred in the consultation a cut that has 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:12.160
 this 80% of Malbec 10% of Cabernet 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.990
 Sauvignon 8% openwork draft which is a 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.840
 variety that is a cross between 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.210
 malbec and a shore that there was not in 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:23.169
 Argentina and my dad brought it by 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:25.600
 first time it will be about 13 12 13 years and 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.289
 has a 2% chardonnay I think the 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.869
 future of Argentina is in the 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.219
 in the variety then it seems to me that 

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:33.619
 Argentina becomes a very 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:36.349
 large communication of regions 

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:38.059
 because because the region is unique and 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:40.999
 unrepeatable when he started talking about the 

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:42.589
 consult stop talking about something that 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:43.999
 you can do in another place to talk 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:46.369
 of the perfect wine also started to 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:50.740
 talk about the expression of a place z is 

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:52.939
 a cut wine that is the idea where 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.899
 they participated until a while ago only 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:55.669
 more then early and then 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:58.279
 we incorporated the cabernet and the idea is 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:01.309
 that each year the cut can change in 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:02.449
 the 2010 particularly a tasting 

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:03.909
 blindly in which we choose the 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:05.990
 components of the children that come 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:08.599
 particularly good we liked the 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.889
 cabernet malbec and the cabernet to me 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:12.289
 I really like this cut because I think that 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:14.240
 the malbec gives all the identity of the place 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:16.129
 to all the mouth volume but I think 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.279
 the cabernet always gives you a note 

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:21.289
 of a spine in the cellar 

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:24.529
 there has always been the energy of 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:26.779
 search and the energy to go for the 

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:28.039
 things that we believe and feel and for me 

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:31.099
 it is an interesting wine to know a 

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:33.009
 vertical of dz because from the start 

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:34.990
 until now 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:37.689
 gradual changes taking place but 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.589
 orienting towards these wines a lot 

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:41.080
 elegance 

00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:43.509
 - with very good balance wines that 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.879
 there are neither children nor over 

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:48.009
 neither concentrated nor over structured 

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:49.979
 but they are very juicy wines and wines that 

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:52.979
 one opens a bottle and he's going to take it 

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:52.979
 unsafe
