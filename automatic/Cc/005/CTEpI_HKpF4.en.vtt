00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
kid I've never bought them primarily

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.289 
kid I've never bought them primarily
because<00:02:35.360> this<00:02:36.099> fluorescent<00:02:37.099> red<00:02:37.430> color<00:02:37.819> kind

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
because this fluorescent red color kind

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.600 
because this fluorescent red color kind
of<00:02:38.420> looks<00:02:38.630> like<00:02:38.870> it'll<00:02:39.620> give<00:02:39.769> me<00:02:39.920> instant

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
cancer or something but actually Haribo

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.940 
cancer or something but actually Haribo
only<00:02:43.580> uses<00:02:44.000> natural<00:02:44.599> colorings<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.709> think

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
only uses natural colorings so I think

promising whoa this smells super intense

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.000 
promising whoa this smells super intense
is<00:03:01.880> what<00:03:02.120> it<00:03:02.239> looks<00:03:02.390> like<00:03:02.480> inside<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.739> like<00:03:03.859> I'm

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
think my verdict on these is 5 out of 10

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.430 
think my verdict on these is 5 out of 10
because<00:03:09.700> they<00:03:10.700> were<00:03:10.790> just<00:03:11.000> super<00:03:11.329> intense<00:03:12.049> and

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440

let's check the ingredients if that is

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.560 
let's check the ingredients if that is
true<00:04:35.410> there<00:04:36.410> is<00:04:36.440> saltiness<00:04:37.190> this<00:04:37.490> ability<00:04:38.240> to

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
true there is saltiness this ability to

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.200 
true there is saltiness this ability to
detect<00:04:39.020> salt<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:40.040> candy<00:04:40.430> will<00:04:40.699> definitely

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.230 
kind of look like liquorice at first
glance<00:07:01.290> but<00:07:01.560> I<00:07:01.919> think<00:07:02.400> they're<00:07:02.700> most<00:07:02.970> likely

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
glance but I think they're most likely

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.900 
glance but I think they're most likely
fruit<00:07:04.200> flavored

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.650 

yep<00:07:09.220> excellent<00:07:10.220> reasoning<00:07:10.640> skills<00:07:10.850> that<00:07:11.480> was

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:11.660 
yep excellent reasoning skills that was

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.710 
yep excellent reasoning skills that was
a<00:07:11.930> very<00:07:12.290> intense<00:07:12.830> berry<00:07:13.250> flavor<00:07:13.610> but<00:07:14.000> I<00:07:14.210> didn't

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 
a very intense berry flavor but I didn't

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.880 
a very intense berry flavor but I didn't
like<00:07:14.840> that<00:07:15.050> these<00:07:15.350> were<00:07:15.560> really<00:07:15.770> good

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:15.890 
like that these were really good

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.440 
like that these were really good
considering<00:07:16.760> they<00:07:17.240> look<00:07:17.570> kind<00:07:18.440> of<00:07:18.560> scary

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:19.450 
considering they look kind of scary

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.340 
considering they look kind of scary
so<00:07:20.450> I<00:07:20.480> think<00:07:20.630> my<00:07:21.110> verdict<00:07:21.980> is<00:07:22.280> 8<00:07:23.240> out<00:07:23.690> of<00:07:23.720> 10<00:07:24.020> all

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:24.350 
so I think my verdict is 8 out of 10 all

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.560 
so I think my verdict is 8 out of 10 all
right<00:07:24.560> that<00:07:24.770> was<00:07:24.920> it<00:07:24.950> for<00:07:25.280> my<00:07:25.460> German<00:07:25.940> candy
