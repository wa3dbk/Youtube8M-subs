00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.600 
down back there so take a look at these
quartz<00:02:42.830> veins<00:02:43.070> oh<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:47.209> guys<00:02:47.390> can<00:02:47.630> see<00:02:47.660> those

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
quartz veins oh you guys can see those

00:02:48.610 --> 00:03:28.800 
quartz veins oh you guys can see those
that's<00:02:49.610> all<00:02:49.880> courts

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.100 

let's<00:03:29.810> see<00:03:30.110> get<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:30.950> little<00:03:31.250> bit<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.400> my<00:03:32.110> metal

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
let's see get a little bit of my metal

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:48.750 
let's see get a little bit of my metal
detecting<00:03:33.590> on<00:03:33.710> this<00:03:33.890> video

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.510 

definitely<00:03:49.760> got<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:49.880> target<00:03:50.150> right<00:03:50.420> there<00:03:51.520> very

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
definitely got a target right there very

00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:17.210 
definitely got a target right there very
very<00:03:52.700> faint<00:03:54.190> that's<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.570> prospector<00:03:56.570> mode<00:04:12.430> okay

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.400

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
so here's the gold mine and I went all

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.460 
so here's the gold mine and I went all
the<00:04:22.740> way<00:04:22.770> back<00:04:23.010> in<00:04:23.220> there<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:25.080> probably<00:04:25.380> goes

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
the way back in there it probably goes

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.020 
the way back in there it probably goes
back<00:04:26.330> i'm<00:04:27.330> going<00:04:27.480> to<00:04:27.570> say<00:04:27.720> 21<00:04:28.650> feet<00:04:29.030> and

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
back i'm going to say 21 feet and

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.270 
back i'm going to say 21 feet and
there's<00:04:30.870> partial<00:04:31.170> cave-ins<00:04:31.380> in<00:04:31.680> there<00:04:34.280> got

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
there's partial cave-ins in there got

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.030 
there's partial cave-ins in there got
some<00:04:35.400> good<00:04:35.550> targets<00:04:35.940> but<00:04:36.830> that<00:04:37.830> rock<00:04:38.010> is

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
some good targets but that rock is

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.900 
some good targets but that rock is
really<00:04:38.400> hard<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:40.460> do<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.520> little<00:04:41.670> metal

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
really hard so do a little metal

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.010 
really hard so do a little metal
detecting<00:04:42.210> these<00:04:42.360> telling<00:04:42.600> piles<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:42.900> we're

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
detecting these telling piles and we're

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.560 
detecting these telling piles and we're
going<00:04:43.140> to<00:04:43.200> get<00:04:43.260> out<00:04:43.380> of<00:04:43.440> here
