00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello we'll see together how can the oven-proof fish 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:10.819
 for that 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:15.599
 we need a lee piece and what is the idea of â€‹â€‹launching a well dry 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.580
 some 20 meters hammamet 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.110
 for his part he had chosen epicuriales time after a small 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.140
 little spice 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.140
 legalists all 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.170
 the author and I'm going now our growth 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.280
 we make beautiful campaigns on its sides so that the marina da penetrates 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.280
 inside the seat 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.970
 we have four passing through the olympia 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.430
 we go there these years generously interior scenes 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.960
 outer 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.340
 to spice up the fragrance you can put fresh herbs inside 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.440
 a slice of lemon for example 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.440
 and we will tell them puppets 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.200
 by giving them following the refrigerator in question 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.020
 after picking well we will be able to bake and our growth we go to 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.820
 shareholder 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.820
 in a thicket about 150 degrees for example 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.930
 intellectual 2 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.060
 all its members without drying it up we go dew throughout the cooking 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.730
 the little trick to prevent them from being too dry is to cook them with 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.700
 videos 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.299
 thanks to their game it will also bring humility to the fish 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.299
 we have our growth on dragonflies 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.630
 and pour the marinade over again 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.240
 for his drink about a kilo the contract goes after twenty minutes of track 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.850
 we will check who would ring 300w use a thermometer with a 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.840
 sensitivity 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.060
 you then planted the probe between the head and the central is where 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.760
 you have the most bitter and so where cooking is the most difficult the 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.750
 actor temperature of your fish when you certain times to be 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.730
 from about 40 to 45 degrees 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.069
 if you are not equipped like a professional 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.179
 simply use the blade of a knife you said you were going to 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.839
 exactly in the same place 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.219
 we leave it for you about 35 years 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.759
 if you have to ask 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:19.139
 on your wrist where infinite poetry 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.969
 or still possible 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.930
 the bread knife blade and christians after slightly changing 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.579
 presence 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.849
 if you have to be proud but not simple the euro had for that its 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.319
 protected by passers-by to avoid burning with paper 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.590
