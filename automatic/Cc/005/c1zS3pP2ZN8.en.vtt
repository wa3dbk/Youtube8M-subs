00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
the root note of the chord and I keep

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.480 
the root note of the chord and I keep
these<00:00:13.830> two<00:00:14.070> fingers<00:00:14.429> together<00:00:15.830> and<00:00:16.830> pluck<00:00:17.220> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
these two fingers together and pluck the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.580 
these two fingers together and pluck the
D<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.720> G<00:00:18.960> at<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.170> same<00:00:19.380> time<00:00:19.710> like<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:24.590> so

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
D in the G at the same time like that so

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.269 
D in the G at the same time like that so
that's<00:00:25.769> your<00:00:25.920> basic<00:00:26.599> picking<00:00:27.599> for<00:00:28.279> basically

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
that's your basic picking for basically

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.749 
that's your basic picking for basically
at<00:00:29.429> each<00:00:29.609> chord<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:31.140> song<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.579> when

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
at each chord in the song this is when

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.850 
at each chord in the song this is when
it<00:00:32.880> changes<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.510> little<00:00:33.780> little<00:00:34.500> different

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
it changes to a little little different

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.880 
it changes to a little little different
picking<00:00:35.190> parts<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.640> when<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.890> go

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
what leads into it so to start off with

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.130 
what leads into it so to start off with
it<00:00:50.579> starts<00:00:50.969> off<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.420> chord<00:00:51.750> from<00:00:51.930> your

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.830 
there's a little repeated bit here like
that<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.530> then<00:02:54.340> there's<00:02:54.520> a<00:02:54.580> new<00:02:55.300> zip<00:02:55.600> right

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
that and then there's a new zip right

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.310 
that and then there's a new zip right
back<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.220> first<00:02:57.489> fret<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:58.959> do<00:02:59.110> this

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
back to the first fret and you do this

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.740 
back to the first fret and you do this
run<00:02:59.709> it's<00:03:00.160> kind<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:01.320> using<00:03:02.320> hammer<00:03:02.560> ons<00:03:02.890> and

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
run it's kind of using hammer ons and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.480 
run it's kind of using hammer ons and
it's<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.810> bit<00:03:05.020> tricky

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.190 

it<00:03:12.490> follows<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:12.910> basic<00:03:13.390> chord<00:03:13.660> structure<00:03:14.110> of

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
it follows a basic chord structure of

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.370 
it follows a basic chord structure of
the<00:03:14.320> one<00:03:14.500> chord<00:03:14.830> in<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.040> chorus<00:03:16.170> along<00:03:17.170> that

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
the one chord in the chorus along that

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.280 
the one chord in the chorus along that
chord<00:03:17.770> well<00:03:18.580> with<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.790> few<00:03:19.060> notes<00:03:19.330> that<00:03:19.660> are

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
chord well with a few notes that are

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.890 
chord well with a few notes that are
extended<00:03:20.760> kind<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.850> backwards<00:03:22.330> up<00:03:22.630> on<00:03:22.780> the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
extended kind of backwards up on the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.780 
extended kind of backwards up on the
lower<00:03:23.110> strings<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:24.550> goes<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:29.530> can<00:03:29.740> I<00:03:30.190> should

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
lower strings it goes you can I should

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.820 
lower strings it goes you can I should
probably<00:03:31.360> play<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:31.720> properly

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.040 

and<00:03:38.830> I<00:03:38.980> hold<00:03:39.610> this<00:03:39.850> shape<00:03:40.209> for<00:03:40.690> these<00:03:40.810> last

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
and I hold this shape for these last

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.460 
and I hold this shape for these last
notes<00:03:41.850> so<00:03:42.850> they<00:03:43.180> can<00:03:43.420> kind<00:03:43.570> of<00:03:43.690> all<00:03:43.870> ring<00:03:44.110> into

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
notes so they can kind of all ring into

00:03:44.470 --> 00:04:00.000 
notes so they can kind of all ring into
each<00:03:44.620> other<00:03:44.830> but<00:03:45.700> I<00:03:45.760> play<00:03:46.060> these<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:59.530> here's

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
each other but I play these so here's

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.220 
each other but I play these so here's
the<00:04:00.190> whole<00:04:00.370> solo<00:04:00.670> I'll<00:04:00.940> play<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.209> once<00:04:01.930> all<00:04:02.110> the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
the whole solo I'll play it once all the

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:25.650 
the whole solo I'll play it once all the
way<00:04:02.320> through

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.530 

that's<00:04:26.660> basic<00:04:27.290> solo<00:04:27.880> right<00:04:28.880> at<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.120> end<00:04:29.330> when

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
that's basic solo right at the end when

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.490 
that's basic solo right at the end when
it<00:04:29.660> goes<00:04:34.330> there's<00:04:35.330> that<00:04:35.510> option<00:04:35.750> too<00:04:36.110> instead

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
it goes there's that option too instead

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.080 
it goes there's that option too instead
of<00:04:36.560> doing<00:04:37.540> playing<00:04:38.540> that<00:04:39.490> second<00:04:40.490> fret<00:04:40.700> ie

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
of doing playing that second fret ie

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.770 
of doing playing that second fret ie
note<00:04:41.510> twice<00:04:43.000> you<00:04:44.000> can<00:04:44.060> go<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:47.120> then<00:04:47.270> back<00:04:47.540> into

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
note twice you can go and then back into

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:58.240 
note twice you can go and then back into
your<00:04:48.020> chorus<00:04:48.440> chords<00:04:56.590> maybe<00:04:57.590> I<00:04:57.740> can<00:04:57.919> even<00:04:58.040> do

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
your chorus chords maybe I can even do

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.000 
your chorus chords maybe I can even do
an<00:04:58.400> angle<00:04:58.810> maybe<00:04:59.810> I<00:04:59.960> could<00:05:00.230> see<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.590> picking<00:05:00.919> a

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
an angle maybe I could see the picking a

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.400 
an angle maybe I could see the picking a
bit<00:05:01.190> better<00:05:01.370> I<00:05:01.490> don't<00:05:01.760> know<00:05:01.850> if<00:05:01.970> you<00:05:02.090> can<00:05:02.410> but

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
bit better I don't know if you can but

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.790 
bit better I don't know if you can but
I'll<00:05:03.890> try<00:05:04.100> that<00:05:04.130> in<00:05:04.310> another<00:05:04.550> video
