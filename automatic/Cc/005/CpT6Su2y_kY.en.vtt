resources and infrastructure that we

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.629 
resources and infrastructure that we
will<00:04:22.360> need<00:04:22.660> in<00:04:23.169> order<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.590> create<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.280> viable

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639

nation<00:04:25.270> state<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:26.290> Northwest<00:04:26.740> still<00:04:27.220> has

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
nation state the Northwest still has

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.390 
nation state the Northwest still has
about<00:04:28.150> 90<00:04:28.419> to<00:04:28.540> 90<00:04:28.990> percent<00:04:29.380> white<00:04:29.590> population

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
about 90 to 90 percent white population

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.180 
about 90 to 90 percent white population
and<00:04:30.610> so<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.300> amount<00:04:31.600> of<00:04:31.810> cleanup<00:04:32.710> that<00:04:32.919> we

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
and so the amount of cleanup that we

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.000 
and so the amount of cleanup that we
will<00:04:33.340> have<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.669> do<00:04:33.850> is<00:04:34.120> very<00:04:35.080> minimal<00:04:35.260> the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
will have to do is very minimal the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.879 
will have to do is very minimal the
Northwest<00:04:36.430> has<00:04:36.580> things<00:04:36.880> like<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.180> coastline

Northwest has things like the coastline

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.570 
Northwest has things like the coastline
because<00:04:38.889> we<00:04:39.220> cannot<00:04:39.550> have<00:04:39.820> a<00:04:40.000> landlocked
