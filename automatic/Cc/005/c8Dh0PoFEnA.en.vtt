00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
so here we are at nitro with Tommy who

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.790 
so here we are at nitro with Tommy who
is<00:00:22.669> the<00:00:23.029> designer<00:00:23.179> this<00:00:23.960> is<00:00:24.109> our<00:00:24.259> first<00:00:24.529> board

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
is the designer this is our first board

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.650 
is the designer this is our first board
what<00:00:25.070> is<00:00:25.160> this<00:00:25.279> this<00:00:25.849> is<00:00:25.910> the<00:00:26.150> new<00:00:26.269> black<00:00:26.300> right

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
what is this this is the new black right

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.689 
what is this this is the new black right
this<00:00:26.930> is<00:00:27.079> basically<00:00:27.439> my<00:00:27.529> personal<00:00:28.399> favorite

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
this is basically my personal favorite

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.999 
this is basically my personal favorite
it's<00:00:29.570> an<00:00:29.630> all<00:00:29.750> Mountain<00:00:30.079> board<00:00:30.109> it<00:00:30.559> has<00:00:30.619> one

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
it's an all Mountain board it has one

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.130 
it's an all Mountain board it has one
new<00:00:31.130> feature<00:00:31.309> one<00:00:32.149> of<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.300> power<00:00:32.480> pod<00:00:32.750> boards

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
new feature one of the power pod boards

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.350 
new feature one of the power pod boards
basically<00:00:33.769> the<00:00:33.860> power<00:00:34.100> parts<00:00:34.430> are<00:00:34.610> two

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
basically the power parts are two

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.090 
basically the power parts are two
combined<00:00:35.750> radiuses<00:00:36.230> on<00:00:36.379> the<00:00:36.500> side<00:00:36.680> cut<00:00:36.920> like<00:00:37.070> a

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
combined radiuses on the side cut like a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.790 
combined radiuses on the side cut like a
larger<00:00:37.519> one<00:00:37.699> and<00:00:37.909> a<00:00:38.300> small<00:00:38.449> one<00:00:38.629> edit<00:00:39.199> so<00:00:39.710> you

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
larger one and a small one edit so you

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.290 
larger one and a small one edit so you
get<00:00:39.949> these<00:00:40.129> additional<00:00:40.550> bumps<00:00:40.879> on<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:41.089> side

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
get these additional bumps on the side

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.060 
get these additional bumps on the side
so<00:00:41.870> when<00:00:41.989> you<00:00:42.050> put<00:00:42.199> the<00:00:42.320> board<00:00:42.500> on<00:00:42.589> edge<00:00:42.769> you

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
so when you put the board on edge you

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.889 
so when you put the board on edge you
get<00:00:43.220> additional<00:00:43.460> edge<00:00:43.729> grip<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:44.239> makes<00:00:44.780> it

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
get additional edge grip and makes it

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.899 
get additional edge grip and makes it
board<00:00:45.079> much<00:00:45.229> more<00:00:45.409> easy<00:00:45.559> to<00:00:45.620> maneuver<00:00:46.070> the

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
board much more easy to maneuver the

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:48.399 
board much more easy to maneuver the
black<00:00:47.089> light<00:00:47.239> comes<00:00:47.479> in<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.690> golfing<00:00:48.019> version

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
black light comes in the golfing version

little<00:01:12.320> bit<00:01:12.440> of<00:01:12.560> camber<00:01:13.000> basically<00:01:14.000> what<00:01:14.090> we

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
little bit of camber basically what we

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:15.760 
little bit of camber basically what we
call<00:01:14.360> low<00:01:14.509> rider<00:01:14.750> clambered<00:01:15.320> but<00:01:15.619> it's<00:01:15.740> a

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
expensive design for park riding jibbing

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:24.520

but<00:01:22.190> with<00:01:22.729> camber<00:01:23.180> we<00:01:23.840> see<00:01:23.990> a<00:01:24.020> lot<00:01:24.049> about<00:01:24.259> team

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
but with camber we see a lot about team

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.230 
but with camber we see a lot about team
riders<00:01:24.799> using<00:01:25.040> for<00:01:25.159> camber<00:01:25.399> boards<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:26.119> who

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
riders using for camber boards so who

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.550 
riders using for camber boards so who
would<00:01:26.329> ride<00:01:26.540> a<00:01:26.570> board<00:01:26.810> like<00:01:26.930> this<00:01:27.200> it's

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
would ride a board like this it's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.260 
would ride a board like this it's
probably<00:01:27.680> like<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:27.979> intermediate<00:01:28.729> Park<00:01:29.000> rider

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
probably like a intermediate Park rider

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.350 
probably like a intermediate Park rider
to<00:01:30.020> upper<00:01:30.799> level<00:01:31.070> Park<00:01:31.250> rider<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:32.119> where<00:01:32.270> does

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
to upper level Park rider so where does

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.969 
to upper level Park rider so where does
the<00:01:32.479> name<00:01:32.509> bad<00:01:32.899> seed<00:01:33.140> come<00:01:33.350> from<00:01:33.530> oh<00:01:33.680> it's

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
the name bad seed come from oh it's

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.469 
the name bad seed come from oh it's
pretty<00:01:34.189> much<00:01:34.340> driven<00:01:34.579> by<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:34.820> graphics<00:01:35.360> you

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
pretty much driven by the graphics you

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:36.760 
pretty much driven by the graphics you
know<00:01:35.630> we<00:01:35.840> came<00:01:35.990> up<00:01:36.020> with<00:01:36.290> this<00:01:36.380> graphic

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
know we came up with this graphic

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.440 
know we came up with this graphic
concept<00:01:37.159> of<00:01:37.250> these<00:01:37.369> bad<00:01:37.640> kids<00:01:37.909> like<00:01:38.299> you're
