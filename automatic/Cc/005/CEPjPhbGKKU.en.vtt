00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
probably how it got identified and

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.070 
probably how it got identified and
initially<00:01:30.040> when<00:01:30.970> I<00:01:31.000> listen<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.479> my<00:01:31.630> seniors

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
they're not extremely ecstatic about the

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.160 
they're not extremely ecstatic about the
fact<00:01:33.940> that<00:01:34.030> that's<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.570> way<00:01:34.720> it's<00:01:34.870> referred

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
fact that that's the way it's referred

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.050 
fact that that's the way it's referred
to<00:01:35.200> but<00:01:35.980> now<00:01:36.130> it's<00:01:36.280> down<00:01:36.430> in<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.640> dictionary
