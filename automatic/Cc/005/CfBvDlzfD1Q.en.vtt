cocktail today and talk a little bit

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.990

about<00:00:15.389> styles<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.320> cocktails<00:00:16.820> so<00:00:17.820> when<00:00:17.910> you're

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
about styles of cocktails so when you're

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.480 
about styles of cocktails so when you're
thinking<00:00:18.029> about<00:00:18.300> cocktails<00:00:18.869> there's<00:00:19.500> two

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
thinking about cocktails there's two

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.480 
thinking about cocktails there's two
different<00:00:20.880> families<00:00:21.300> essentially<00:00:22.460> they<00:00:23.460> can

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
different families essentially they can

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.980 
different families essentially they can
be<00:00:23.699> broken<00:00:23.850> down<00:00:24.029> into<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.570> million<00:00:24.869> different

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
be broken down into a million different

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.320 
be broken down into a million different
categories<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:25.830> at<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> base<00:00:26.310> there<00:00:26.849> there's

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
categories but at the base there there's

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.630 
categories but at the base there there's
just<00:00:27.390> two<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.410> you've<00:00:28.560> got<00:00:28.740> aromatics<00:00:29.340> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
just two so you've got aromatics and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.569 
just two so you've got aromatics and
then<00:00:29.910> you've<00:00:30.000> got<00:00:30.119> sours<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:31.710> basic<00:00:32.099> aromatic

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
then you've got sours the basic aromatic

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.940 
then you've got sours the basic aromatic
is<00:00:32.790> gonna<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.149> an<00:00:33.360> old-fashioned<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.620> an

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
is gonna be an old-fashioned so an

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.450 
is gonna be an old-fashioned so an
aromatic<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.489> essentially<00:00:36.059> sugar<00:00:37.460> bitters

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
aromatic is essentially sugar bitters

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.139 
aromatic is essentially sugar bitters
and<00:00:38.760> then<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> base<00:00:40.079> spirit<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.860> combined<00:00:41.730> in

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
and then a base spirit and combined in

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.810 
and then a base spirit and combined in
any<00:00:42.600> different<00:00:42.930> array<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.040> spirits<00:00:44.489> different

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
any different array of spirits different

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.610 
any different array of spirits different
bitters<00:00:45.059> different<00:00:45.480> sweeteners<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.379> arrive

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
bitters different sweeteners you arrive

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.770 
bitters different sweeteners you arrive
at<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> different<00:00:47.100> cocktail<00:00:47.280> every<00:00:47.579> time<00:00:47.780> so

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
at a different cocktail every time so

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.110 
at a different cocktail every time so
and<00:00:49.320> then<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> sours<00:00:49.980> are<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> be<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
and then the sours are going to be a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.650 
and then the sours are going to be a
base<00:00:51.420> spirit<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.770> citrus<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.149> sweet

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
base spirit with a citrus and a sweet

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.600 
base spirit with a citrus and a sweet
your<00:00:54.780> component<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.739> essentially<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
your component so essentially the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.700 
your component so essentially the
difference<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.809> there's<00:00:58.140> no<00:00:58.260> bitters<00:00:58.530> in

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
difference is you there's no bitters in

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.610 
difference is you there's no bitters in
a<00:00:58.770> sour<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.309> there's<00:00:59.579> no<00:01:00.140> citrus<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.440> an

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
a sour and there's no citrus in an

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.070 
a sour and there's no citrus in an
aromatic<00:01:01.969> so<00:01:03.500> for<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.710> Manhattan<00:01:06.080> very

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
aromatic so for the Manhattan very

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.950 
aromatic so for the Manhattan very

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
simple drink got your mixing glass you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.300 
simple drink got your mixing glass you
can<00:01:10.049> use<00:01:10.110> anything<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.189> can

stir something in at home and then

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.499 
stir something in at home and then
you're<00:01:13.830> gonna<00:01:13.920> use<00:01:14.220> bitters<00:01:14.939> for<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
you're gonna use bitters for the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.480 
you're gonna use bitters for the
Manhattan<00:01:15.659> Angostura<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.100> classic

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
Manhattan Angostura is the classic

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.760 
Manhattan Angostura is the classic
bitters<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.060> choice<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> couple

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
bitters of choice so just a couple

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.700 
bitters of choice so just a couple
dashes<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.290> I<00:01:22.290> think<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.590> was

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
dashes of that and I think that was

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.810 
dashes of that and I think that was
about<00:01:22.799> three<00:01:23.070> or<00:01:23.189> four<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.670> basically

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
about three or four and you basically

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.120 
about three or four and you basically
just<00:01:24.060> want<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.540> make<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> little<00:01:25.130> coating

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
on the bottom of the glass and then you

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.780 
on the bottom of the glass and then you
want<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.430> take<00:01:29.610> your<00:01:31.070> your<00:01:32.070> sweetener

- one ounce of vermouth so our one ounce
of<00:01:51.600> vermouth<00:01:53.450> different<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:55.439> could<00:01:55.619> use<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
of vermouth different you could use a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.810 
of vermouth different you could use a
different<00:01:55.979> sweetener<00:01:56.430> wouldn't<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.729> in

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
different sweetener wouldn't be in

different sweetener wouldn't be in
Manhattan<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.750> would<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> different

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
Manhattan but it would be a different

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.230 
Manhattan but it would be a different
aromatic<00:01:58.829> drink<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.460> could<00:01:59.610> use<00:01:59.880> if<00:02:00.149> you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
