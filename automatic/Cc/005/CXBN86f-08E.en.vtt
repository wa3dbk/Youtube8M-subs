00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello everyone , you probably ask what 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.090
 this is and i will call this game which 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.730
 called horse dim collected here I know 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.639
 all of them can be said so 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.490
 Stages 1 did not construct anything 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.449
 actually we have by no i do n't know 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.100
 how would i call any would call 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:27.570
 yellow 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.539
 yellow engine fly ate good play because 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.009
 that it is likely for the whole some 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.930
 title so i'm not sure how it is 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.440
 call but let's try again 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.940
 sang 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:43.829
 well yes here we have probably not 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.289
 oh my goodness well here we don't know how 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.280
 interesting can be a few pants you can 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:55.739
 how few it turns out so here 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.850
 and I understood it like combining skills I 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.910
 on how do they work there so well 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.040
 something incomprehensible so handing it in I don't 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.460
 I know what it is and it is 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:14.840
 and move sudo make him 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:19.909
 well, why not why 01 tags 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:24.150
 oh my god all folders dunk how funny 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:27.230
 so oh my god magic unicorn only about 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.760
 God, everyone drinks their laser 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.890
 can we found a type not only not 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.390
 able to really like you 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.300
 123 What do you think about this switch? 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.000
 so vodka lesson caught so they are different 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.900
 butchers want to understand with a stick like here 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.390
 no oh you oh you understand not a word 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:55.390
 I went to the laser that's what I understand the gameplay 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.930
 inaccuracies in the battlefield come on lider 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.980
 sedimentation of bipod and soot and thirst lasers and 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.670
 how good are you with me 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.670
 my 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.170
 so maybe you can change yourself 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.790
 because yes it seems like you got lost 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.569
 120 kilos just I'm clearly stupid 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:22.390
 absolutely so jump on those on and 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:24.340
 try it so here after a pas le pire 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.209
 several it turns out that you need 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.120
 need to re-create need to re-create 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.800
 Perhaps I will create all the skills that 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.440
 I just want it to be 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:41.620
 No, I don't want to change the armour 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.209
 so that means everything is fine 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.320
 final drags look for us turned out 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.470
 so if this is 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.640
 and assume that this is to combine colors 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.790
 get this if it 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.120
 and i like this food here this thing 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.640
 Warburg soldiers drawing on the new baton 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.970
 I do not think you do not need to stick 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.390
 we don't need to try water here why 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.570
 with her magnussen baton turns 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.880
 scripter yes it's a bad come out and hooves 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.660
 skill and if so 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.960
 so now cheats are interesting let's 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.210
 try playing criminal 500 meters 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.960
 probably will appear but it seems to me 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.270
 funny if 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:37.650
 and what is it that these are not eggs to everyone 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:43.900
 to understand, okay okay Opa opa 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.980
 okay well since both come on tractor 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.760
 ball nickname 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:53.710
 balls so not half fire-breathing 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:59.490
 understood in not breathing Japan cheaters 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:05.460
 well come from me no no they ran away 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:07.130
 such shield to shield 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.520
 cheat 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.690
 same taxi 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:17.280
 everything is fine so laser laserliner 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:23.320
 laser you kochnev tractors 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:26.380
 let's not act long 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.240
 so here now is gothic fans 4 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.599
 it even save me 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.599
 maybe 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.340
 I'm not sure, but I hope for thanks a 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:38.390
 she use against me 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.040
 4g 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.040
 Looks like a queue 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.350
 somewhere not 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.890
 no no no no no no no no no you 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.410
 let them die of a triple diminish 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.990
 put up your face on protection 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.970
 shai loggers 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.900
 ask and why is the name she 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:09.040
 Looks so yellow I do n't know 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.760
 she has a gear 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.280
 drawn on board 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.990
 so perhaps my my choice is not something 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.390
 chonin is more or less clear to us 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:22.190
 glass is not a title 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:23.930
