 station 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.090

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.090
 10 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.109
 automation never comes alone 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.999
 check the working relationships upside down 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.609
 5 in this factory produces electronic circuits stayed in this it seems that the 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:23.759
 maluf 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.619
 I see reason entity aimed not to hinder product quality 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.999
 but with great news 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.030
 I did effective work there 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.140
 then left by the machines for the employees 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.140
 is in the most creative tasks 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.580
 if necessary 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.880
 it messes up it bothers if it focuses only on the power outlet 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.140
 but here in this factory workers' employees have much more freedom 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.270
 than it would have anywhere else 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.120
 and if for example there is no boss 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.100
 not really 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.230
 it becomes a mess 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.430
 not to see the mess because if you really are 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.590
 is to respect the professional 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.590
 he will know how to occupy space 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.970
 was not an easy or fast process 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.270
 It took 13 years for everyone to adapt their new system 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.140
 no one has specific function are multifunctional employees all over the world 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.590
 understands everything 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.540
 close to doing everything 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.000
 is especially severe crisis affecting the network system 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.040
 in February 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.330
 company 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.400
 the representation against jaqueline 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.860
 pv has no official and parallel writer how to find out the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.920
 importance 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 everton sena the attacker 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.920
 this Tuesday 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.220
 meetings like this are common 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.660
 can be called at any time 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.790
 by any employee when a problem arises. 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.780
 No need to wait for management decisions 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.360
 between the ordinary official 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.480
 and the CEO there are only two senior positions 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.480
 at least half of a joint venture 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.719
 the day working and decisions can be made 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.709
 change something 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.969
 serra seia has a better gift view 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.609
 more capable 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.359
 no problems 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.549
 she also said that she could try to be more encouraging 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.529
 spots for the company advantage per day of delay 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.529
 productivity increased by 15% 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.229
 action is accurate of what is happening 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.329
 Do you know what is one 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.319
 and how not 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.749
 it was as if avoiding recurrence 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.839
 I realize that the staff is more involved more committed 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.119
 Who's losing is out? 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:46.229
