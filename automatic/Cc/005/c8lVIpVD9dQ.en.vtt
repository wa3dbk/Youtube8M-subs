projects you might have to do I started

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.830 
projects you might have to do I started
off<00:00:36.860> with<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.920> little<00:00:38.129> one<00:00:38.430> which<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.270> made<00:00:39.480> all

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
off with a little one which I made all

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.220 
off with a little one which I made all
stainless<00:00:40.350> steel<00:00:41.300> I've<00:00:42.300> put<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> few

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
stainless steel I've put that a few

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.779 
stainless steel I've put that a few
times<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.770> there<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.250> YouTube<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.379> then<00:00:46.789> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
times on there on YouTube and then the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.850 
times on there on YouTube and then the
baby<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:49.079> awesome<00:00:50.480> second<00:00:51.620> rocket<00:00:52.620> stove

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
baby the awesome second rocket stove

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.209 
baby the awesome second rocket stove
that<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.129> made<00:00:53.309> there<00:00:53.610> which<00:00:54.180> i<00:00:54.329> think<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:55.219> is

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that I made there which i think is is

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.819 
that I made there which i think is is
the<00:00:56.370> best<00:00:56.579> I've<00:00:56.730> done<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.120> far<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.620> works

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the best I've done so far it's it works

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.819 
the best I've done so far it's it works
great<00:00:59.239> and<00:01:00.239> then<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.989> be<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
great and then this is going to be the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.200 
great and then this is going to be the
next<00:01:02.039> one<00:01:03.260> okay<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:05.040> kind<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.519> gives<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.880> an

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
next one okay so kind of gives you an

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.200 
next one okay so kind of gives you an
idea<00:01:06.479> I've<00:01:07.229> put<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.680> mug<00:01:07.890> against<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.549> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
idea I've put that mug against it to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.120 
idea I've put that mug against it to
give<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.479> an<00:01:09.720> idea<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.610> scale<00:01:12.920> so<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:13.950> can

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
give you an idea of the scale so you can

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.370 
give you an idea of the scale so you can
see<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:16.040> doctor<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.310> actually<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.259> can

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
see a doctor that actually so you can

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.399 
see a doctor that actually so you can
see<00:01:19.530> how<00:01:19.680> small<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.040> one<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.540> they<00:01:21.540> all<00:01:21.720> these

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
see how small that one is they all these

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.490 
see how small that one is they all these
both<00:01:22.799> work<00:01:23.040> great<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.170> anyway

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
both work great and as you see in anyway

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.899 
both work great and as you see in anyway
but<00:01:26.060> but<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.090> think<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.570> one<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> be

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
but but I think this one is going to be

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.289 
but but I think this one is going to be
the<00:01:29.909> daddy

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the daddy

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.100 
the daddy
this<00:01:31.229> was<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:34.100> boiler<00:01:35.100> or<00:01:35.130> something<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.729> think

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
this was a boiler or something I think

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.760 
this was a boiler or something I think
water<00:01:37.110> heater<00:01:37.500> thing<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:39.290> I'm<00:01:40.290> taking<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
water heater thing and I'm taking the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.310 
water heater thing and I'm taking the
element<00:01:41.100> out<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.369> bottom<00:01:41.869> I'm<00:01:42.869> taking

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
element out of the bottom I'm taking

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.580 
element out of the bottom I'm taking
this<00:01:43.439> tap<00:01:43.740> off<00:01:43.979> here<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.170> side<00:01:46.380> this

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
this tap off here it's on the side this

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.740 
this tap off here it's on the side this
is<00:01:46.649> where<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.100> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.509> tube

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
is where it's going to have the tube

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.249 
is where it's going to have the tube
similar<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:49.950> here<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:51.390> also<00:01:51.540> got<00:01:51.960> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
similar to this one here it's also got a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.100 
similar to this one here it's also got a
switch<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:54.420> I'm<00:01:54.540> going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.689> try<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:54.960> utilize

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
switch and I'm going to try and utilize

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.969 
switch and I'm going to try and utilize
that<00:01:55.590> switch<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:57.060> make<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.689> fan<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.619> will

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that switch to make a fan so this will

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.080 
that switch to make a fan so this will
be<00:01:59.390> hopefully<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.570> fan<00:02:00.930> assisted<00:02:01.850> rocket<00:02:02.850> stove

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
be hopefully a fan assisted rocket stove

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.459 
be hopefully a fan assisted rocket stove
at<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.600> flick<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.990> switch<00:02:06.020> fingers<00:02:07.020> crossed

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
at the flick of a switch fingers crossed

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.210 
at the flick of a switch fingers crossed
and<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.520> high<00:02:08.670> today

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
and because of the high today

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.699 
and because of the high today
it's<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.940> really<00:02:12.150> nice<00:02:12.270> stable<00:02:12.690> platform<00:02:12.870> it's

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
it's so really nice stable platform it's

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.830 
it's so really nice stable platform it's
going<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.069> nice<00:02:14.390> high<00:02:15.390> job<00:02:16.220> big<00:02:17.220> job<00:02:17.840> long

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
going to be a nice high job big job long

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.160 
going to be a nice high job big job long
flow<00:02:19.110> tube<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.380> top<00:02:22.560> here<00:02:22.800> so

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
flow tube in the in the top here so

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.990 
flow tube in the in the top here so
you'll<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.590> should<00:02:25.800> get<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> lot<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.370> draw<00:02:26.670> on

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
you'll you should get a lot of draw on

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.350 
you'll you should get a lot of draw on
that<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:29.150> coupled<00:02:30.150> with<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.630> other<00:02:31.260> little

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
that and coupled with the other little

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.750 
that and coupled with the other little
quirks<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.690> designs<00:02:34.349> I've<00:02:34.560> got<00:02:34.739> in<00:02:35.190> mind<00:02:35.580> to

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
quirks and designs I've got in mind to

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.930 
quirks and designs I've got in mind to
add<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.480> think<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.680> should<00:02:37.890> be<00:02:37.940> quite

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
add to this I think it should be quite

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.460 
add to this I think it should be quite
something<00:02:39.420> with<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.569> bit<00:02:39.720> alone<00:02:40.940> or<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.630> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
something with a bit alone or the the
