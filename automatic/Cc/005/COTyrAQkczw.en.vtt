00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
it but I got some in the system already

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.020

here<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.450> are<00:00:48.570> better<00:00:49.350> showing<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.160> lot<00:00:50.520> of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
here that are better showing a lot of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.369 
here that are better showing a lot of
the<00:00:50.700> other<00:00:50.850> things<00:00:51.239> haven't<00:00:51.780> came<00:00:51.930> up<00:00:52.110> yet

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the other things haven't came up yet

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.939 
the other things haven't came up yet
this<00:00:53.129> flat<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:54.170> saturated<00:00:55.170> everything<00:00:55.590> before

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
this flat I saturated everything before

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.830 
this flat I saturated everything before
I<00:00:55.980> planted<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.879> think<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.570> might<00:00:57.750> have

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
I planted and I think that might have

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.979 
I planted and I think that might have
hurt<00:00:58.050> some<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> germination<00:00:59.609> cuz<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
hurt some of the germination cuz not a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.349 
hurt some of the germination cuz not a
whole<00:01:01.320> lot<00:01:01.530> came<00:01:01.800> up<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.640> flat<00:01:02.969> I

whole lot came up but in this flat I
took<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:05.689> was<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> little<00:01:06.930> bit<00:01:07.049> easier<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
took a I was a little bit easier on the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.300 
see how that works out for me I just did
that<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.509> few<00:01:42.540> days<00:01:42.840> ago<00:01:43.579> but<00:01:44.720> this<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.780> my

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
that a few days ago but this is my

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.910 
that a few days ago but this is my
system<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.490> only<00:01:48.060> had<00:01:48.329> two<00:01:48.540> runs<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.110> decided

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
system I only had two runs and decided

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.770 
system I only had two runs and decided
that<00:01:49.979> wasn't<00:01:50.189> enough<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.060> put<00:01:51.600> two

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
that wasn't enough so I just put two

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.749 
that wasn't enough so I just put two
more<00:01:51.960> runs<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.740> afternoon<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.610> got

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
system up and running there's some baby

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.789 
system up and running there's some baby
red<00:02:00.540> leaf<00:02:02.149> up<00:02:03.149> here

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
red leaf up here

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.740 
red leaf up here
and<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.579> put<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> rockwool<00:02:06.240> cubes<00:02:06.270> and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
and I just put the rockwool cubes and

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.589 
and I just put the rockwool cubes and
put<00:02:07.049> some<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.350> those<00:02:07.439> clay<00:02:07.740> balls<00:02:08.450> just<00:02:09.450> for

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
put some of those clay balls just for

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.059 
put some of those clay balls just for
some<00:02:09.780> support<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.440> don't<00:02:10.619> know<00:02:10.860> there's

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
some support I don't know there's

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.740 
some support I don't know there's
probably<00:02:11.099> different<00:02:11.970> ways<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.239> doing<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.660> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
probably different ways of doing it and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.360 
probably different ways of doing it and
there's<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.530> couple<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:13.860> cilantro's<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:17.040> these

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
there's a couple of cilantro's and these

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
there's a couple of cilantro's and these
are<00:02:17.550> some<00:02:17.700> waste<00:02:17.849> burke<00:02:18.150> lettuce<00:02:20.269> lots<00:02:21.269> of

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
baby red leaf

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.830 
baby red leaf
these<00:02:22.590> are<00:02:22.769> icebergs<00:02:23.299> and<00:02:24.299> down<00:02:24.480> here<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.720> just

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
these are icebergs and down here I just

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.160 
these are icebergs and down here I just
put<00:02:25.019> some<00:02:25.319> tomatoes<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.750> we'll<00:02:30.930> see<00:02:31.080> how

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
put some tomatoes and so we'll see how

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.009 
put some tomatoes and so we'll see how
they<00:02:31.349> do

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
they do

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.110 
they do
but<00:02:34.019> these<00:02:34.140> Tomatoes<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.709> had<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> little<00:02:35.190> or

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
but these Tomatoes this had a little or

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.490 
but these Tomatoes this had a little or
tapper<00:02:36.420> there's<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.870> starting<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.230> show<00:02:37.380> it

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
from the bottom side decided to put them

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.750 
from the bottom side decided to put them
in<00:02:39.569> here<00:02:39.599> is<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.310> established<00:02:41.310> more<00:02:41.430> root

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
in here is the established more root

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.819 
in here is the established more root
system<00:02:42.299> I've<00:02:42.959> put<00:02:43.170> them<00:02:43.260> together<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.560> Dutch

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
system I've put them together a Dutch

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.160 
system I've put them together a Dutch
bucket<00:02:44.250> system<00:02:44.569> but<00:02:45.569> I'm<00:02:45.690> hopefully<00:02:45.959> going<00:02:46.110> to

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
bucket system but I'm hopefully going to

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.229 
bucket system but I'm hopefully going to
keep<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.470> tomatoes<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.040> some<00:02:47.700> strawberry

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
keep the tomatoes and some strawberry

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.809 
keep the tomatoes and some strawberry
plants<00:02:49.160> these<00:02:50.160> two<00:02:50.400> are<00:02:50.459> looking<00:02:50.730> really<00:02:50.849> good

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
plants these two are looking really good

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.180 
plants these two are looking really good
that<00:02:53.819> one<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.060> planted<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.650> these<00:02:55.950> two<00:02:56.130> I

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
that one I just planted and these two I

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.830 
that one I just planted and these two I
just<00:02:56.250> planted<00:02:56.640> just<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.269> couple<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.599> minutes

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
just planted just a couple of minutes

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.229 
just planted just a couple of minutes
ago<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:59.250> can<00:02:59.400> see<00:02:59.549> they<00:02:59.700> went<00:02:59.819> from<00:03:00.000> that

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
ago so you can see they went from that

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.740 
ago so you can see they went from that
to<00:03:00.380> that<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:02.299> they're<00:03:03.299> obviously<00:03:03.360> getting

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
to that so they're obviously getting

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.330 
to that so they're obviously getting
nutrients<00:03:04.379> and<00:03:04.620> they're<00:03:05.069> looking<00:03:05.310> pretty

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
nutrients and they're looking pretty

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:13.280 
nutrients and they're looking pretty
good<00:03:05.730> down<00:03:06.390> here<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.690> put<00:03:06.959> some<00:03:06.989> chives<00:03:07.379> in

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.580 

but<00:03:13.860> pretty<00:03:14.040> much<00:03:14.129> all<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.430> did<00:03:14.670> was<00:03:14.909> I<00:03:15.590> drilled

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
but pretty much all I did was I drilled

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.640 
but pretty much all I did was I drilled
a<00:03:16.650> one-inch<00:03:17.010> hole<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.610> put<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.650> three-quarter

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
a one-inch hole and put a three-quarter

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.350 
a one-inch hole and put a three-quarter
inch<00:03:19.680> Extender<00:03:20.430> until<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.849> had<00:03:21.030> laying<00:03:21.209> around

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
inch Extender until I had laying around

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.680 
inch Extender until I had laying around
threaded<00:03:22.349> it<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.620> put<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:22.980> little<00:03:23.129> Teflon<00:03:23.549> on<00:03:23.690> no

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
threaded it in put a little Teflon on no

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.539 
threaded it in put a little Teflon on no
leak<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.290> was<00:03:25.379> a<00:03:25.440> pretty<00:03:25.830> good<00:03:26.040> seal<00:03:26.340> it

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
leak so it was a pretty good seal it

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.670 
leak so it was a pretty good seal it
kind<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.760> made<00:03:26.909> its<00:03:27.060> own<00:03:27.560> threat<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.590> threat

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
kind of made its own threat a threat

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.839 
kind of made its own threat a threat
itself<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.489> as<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:29.879> tighten<00:03:30.569> bed<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.670> if<00:03:32.760> you

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
itself in as I tighten bed so if you

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.250 
itself in as I tighten bed so if you
want<00:03:33.030> something<00:03:33.330> quick<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.540> easy<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:33.989> think

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
want something quick and easy I think

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.690 
want something quick and easy I think
that's<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.530> way<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.680> do<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.099> just<00:03:35.400> drill<00:03:35.610> the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
that's the way to do it just drill the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.759 
that's the way to do it just drill the
hole<00:03:35.849> down<00:03:35.970> there<00:03:36.209> stood<00:03:36.840> up<00:03:36.989> me<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.379> can<00:03:37.590> see

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769

under the reservoir and one's acting as

a<00:04:39.780> bubbler<00:04:40.260> down<00:04:41.250> inside<00:04:43.130> so<00:04:44.130> why<00:04:44.430> do<00:04:44.490> I<00:04:44.610> need

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
a bubbler down inside so why do I need

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.330 
a bubbler down inside so why do I need
one<00:04:45.000> but<00:04:45.270> there's<00:04:45.930> two<00:04:46.169> ports<00:04:46.500> I<00:04:46.680> can<00:04:46.979> pull<00:04:47.130> out

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
one but there's two ports I can pull out

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
of it system runs for about a half hour

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.719 
of it system runs for about a half hour
to<00:04:50.280> 45<00:04:50.430> minutes<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:51.419> don't<00:04:52.200> know<00:04:52.460> why<00:04:53.460> it<00:04:53.520> takes

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
to 45 minutes I don't know why it takes

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.650 
to 45 minutes I don't know why it takes
probably<00:04:54.240> half<00:04:54.870> hour<00:04:55.080> off<00:04:55.380> then<00:04:55.680> so<00:04:56.660> every

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
probably half hour off then so every

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.310 
probably half hour off then so every
hour<00:04:57.840> I<00:04:58.349> don't<00:04:59.190> apply<00:04:59.400> rings<00:04:59.669> yo<00:04:59.820> for<00:05:00.570> funsies

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
hour I don't apply rings yo for funsies

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.500 
hour I don't apply rings yo for funsies
I<00:05:01.349> should<00:05:01.710> say<00:05:01.919> so<00:05:02.880> but<00:05:03.120> they're<00:05:03.240> in<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.360> heat

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
I should say so but they're in the heat

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.510 
I should say so but they're in the heat
of<00:05:03.539> the<00:05:03.720> day<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:04.169> don't<00:05:04.500> we<00:05:04.830> night<00:05:05.010> two<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.370> five

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.640 
of the day I don't we night two and five
I<00:05:06.000> have<00:05:06.510> it<00:05:06.630> run<00:05:06.750> a<00:05:06.780> little<00:05:06.900> bit<00:05:07.200> longer<00:05:07.410> and

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
I have it run a little bit longer and

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.490 
I have it run a little bit longer and
they're<00:05:07.770> shorter<00:05:08.099> intervals<00:05:08.520> just<00:05:09.320> keep<00:05:10.320> the

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
they're shorter intervals just keep the

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.770 
they're shorter intervals just keep the
roots<00:05:10.680> nice<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.130> wet<00:05:11.310> it's<00:05:12.150> not<00:05:12.300> really<00:05:12.539> quite

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
roots nice and wet it's not really quite

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.379 
roots nice and wet it's not really quite

an enough tea system its water a little

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.980 
an enough tea system its water a little
bit<00:05:15.479> deeper

bit deeper

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.370

but<00:05:18.630> this<00:05:19.630> should<00:05:19.780> work<00:05:19.870> out<00:05:20.020> pretty<00:05:20.110> good

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
but this should work out pretty good

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.710 
but this should work out pretty good
this<00:05:20.830> is<00:05:20.979> a<00:05:21.009> Dutch<00:05:21.190> bucket<00:05:21.520> system<00:05:21.729> table

up<00:05:35.319> through<00:05:35.530> this<00:05:35.620> table<00:05:35.860> I<00:05:36.130> made<00:05:36.310> got<00:05:37.300> these

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
up through this table I made got these

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.480 
up through this table I made got these
quarter-inch<00:05:37.930> lines<00:05:38.229> and<00:05:38.830> this<00:05:39.250> is<00:05:39.400> the

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
quarter-inch lines and this is the

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.180 
quarter-inch lines and this is the

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
manifold system those little screws you

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.680 
manifold system those little screws you
can<00:05:42.220> adjust<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:42.669> flow<00:05:42.819> or<00:05:43.120> turn<00:05:43.330> them<00:05:43.449> on<00:05:43.539> and

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
can adjust the flow or turn them on and

can adjust the flow or turn them on and
off<00:05:43.840> as<00:05:44.139> desired<00:05:45.389> they<00:05:46.389> go<00:05:46.569> out<00:05:46.720> with<00:05:46.900> these

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:47.069 
off as desired they go out with these

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:51.450 
off as desired they go out with these
these<00:05:48.069> heads<00:05:48.340> I<00:05:49.289> got<00:05:50.289> these<00:05:50.440> from<00:05:50.650> China<00:05:51.009> so<00:05:51.220> I

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
these heads I got these from China so I

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.430 
these heads I got these from China so I
mean<00:05:51.669> I'll<00:05:52.150> see<00:05:52.300> how<00:05:52.360> they<00:05:52.509> work<00:05:52.720> but<00:05:55.440> this

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
mean I'll see how they work but this

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.050 
mean I'll see how they work but this
should<00:05:56.650> work<00:05:56.740> for<00:05:56.949> just<00:05:57.130> dispensing<00:05:57.880> with
