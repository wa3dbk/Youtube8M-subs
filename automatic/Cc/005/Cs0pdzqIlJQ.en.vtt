 what's up kids here da lewis 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.370
 commenting for all taste but if 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.590
 good you will be watching a gameplay of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.450
 bottom of hunger games' that the truth is 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.920
 that has worked out pretty well for me 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.710
 about how they come to me 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.780
 normally so good today I came 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.630
 to talk about a topic and then I'll put you 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.250
 a timelapse yes with music and quite 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.340
 quick so you do not get long the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.750
 video and despite this good we go to 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.630
 grain 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.110
 you can see that the title is the art of 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.540
 decorating in minecraft I mean that to 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.230
 what I'm better at decorating 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.480
 minecraft can make gardens houses or 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.059
 underground mines and things like that 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.800
 so good today I came to talk to you 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.230
 because I know people for example 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.500
 what he likes to build but not 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.050
 It is good at art is to them 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.900
 it gives better in minecraft to you 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.510
 I want you to participate with me since 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.210
 you rarely do it and I would like it 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.770
 I know how good that theme also came out 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.009
 that I know what is best for you 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.590
 minecraft and now you will see in the fucking 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.960
 video the file that I have trying 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.149
 break a sheet shit that after 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.369
 it's good for nothing but good 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.899
 that you participate in the video putting in 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.600
 the comments what is given to you 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.690
 better in minecraft and there are people who are 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.780
 can give better build for example and 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.630
 do it phenomenally therefore as more 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.490
 do it better what you are going to do there are others 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.000
 that they do not like so obviously 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.310
 no it's not what I aspire so 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 well what are you best as trolling 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.030
 bother me I know 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.600
 get pvp all that kind of stuff that gets 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.600
 build 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.670
 create 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.160
 imagine I do not know things that can be given 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.310
 well in minecraft even if you are novice or 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.380
 and six veterans so well this is 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.980
 the topic that I leave for comments 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.890
 I hope you like it and you know 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.899
 comment and now if I'm going to put the 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.600
 timelapse I 'm going to talk a bit about 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.430
 the hg the truth is that it is quite 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.230
 well you can see that I start with few 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.900
 things now I'm going to see a chest that is 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.080
 empty but good and little by little I go 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.360
 taking chests in which I'm leaving 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.130
 being not at all but I'm killing 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.730
 people and I'm getting like this now 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.100
 kind that before putting the timelapse I'm going 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.860
 I'm going to leave it like that so you can see more 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.400
 well how do I kill it now it's going to look like 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.660
 a boy with a bib that I want him to be 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.210
 my own 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.360
 and obviously as it has no sword 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.150
 you can see that this dies escapes me 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.079
 a little bit but 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.799

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:58.200
