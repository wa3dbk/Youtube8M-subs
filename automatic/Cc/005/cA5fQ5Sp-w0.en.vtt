00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.519 
in that it has a new deeper mid-tone
range<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.910> what<00:00:23.910> what's<00:00:24.899> great<00:00:25.079> about<00:00:25.140> shadow

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
range and what what's great about shadow

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.830 
range and what what's great about shadow
ink<00:00:25.860> is<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.309> it<00:00:26.430> has<00:00:26.610> kind<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.119> subtle<00:00:27.509> wash

ink is that it has kind of a subtle wash

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.799 
ink is that it has kind of a subtle wash
effect<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.309> great<00:00:29.399> for<00:00:29.489> layering<00:00:29.880> stamp

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:30.809 
effect so it's great for layering stamp

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:32.810 
effect so it's great for layering stamp
backgrounds<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.649> things<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.610> I'm

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
backgrounds and things like that so I'm

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.479 
backgrounds and things like that so I'm
sure<00:00:33.000> we'll<00:00:33.210> see<00:00:33.239> some<00:00:33.950> awesome<00:00:34.950> things<00:00:35.100> being

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
sure we'll see some awesome things being

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.700 
sure we'll see some awesome things being
used<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.810> stamping<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.380> card-making

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
used in the stamping and card-making

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.540 
used in the stamping and card-making
community<00:00:38.430> using<00:00:39.180> these<00:00:39.390> inks<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:41.160> these<00:00:41.490> are

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
community using these inks so these are

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.510 
community using these inks so these are
new<00:00:42.060> and<00:00:42.450> then<00:00:42.630> also<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.940> have<00:00:44.940> some<00:00:45.240> new<00:00:45.750> and

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
new and then also you have some new and

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.250 
new and then also you have some new and
stamps<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.580> are<00:00:47.670> being<00:00:47.940> released<00:00:48.180> at<00:00:48.660> CH<00:00:49.050> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
stamps that are being released at CH a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.410 
stamps that are being released at CH a
and<00:00:49.500> then<00:00:49.680> they've<00:00:50.160> sent<00:00:50.490> us<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.790> frame<00:00:51.060> cuts

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and then they've sent us the frame cuts

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.850 
and then they've sent us the frame cuts
and<00:00:51.720> so<00:00:51.810> if<00:00:51.930> you're<00:00:52.079> unfamiliar<00:00:52.650> with<00:00:52.740> how

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and so if you're unfamiliar with how

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.200 
and so if you're unfamiliar with how
these<00:00:53.250> work<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.880> they<00:00:54.810> coordinate<00:00:55.620> with

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
these work and they coordinate with

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.140 
these work and they coordinate with
their<00:00:57.210> stamps<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.020> they're<00:00:58.200> meant<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.680> be<00:00:59.250> run

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
their stamps and they're meant to be run

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.610 
their stamps and they're meant to be run
through<00:01:00.360> a<00:01:00.450> die<00:01:00.600> cutting<00:01:00.870> machine<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.590> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
through a die cutting machine so that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.069 
through a die cutting machine so that
you<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.220> a<00:01:02.430> shape<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.329> then<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.750> stamp

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
you have a shape and then you can stamp

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:08.710 
you have a shape and then you can stamp
on<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.500> shape<00:01:05.450> for<00:01:06.450> example<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:08.100> cupcake

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
on that shape for example the cupcake

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.300 
on that shape for example the cupcake
the<00:01:09.720> zigzag<00:01:10.110> cupcake<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.010> i<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.280> here

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the zigzag cupcake that i have here

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.920 
the zigzag cupcake that i have here
coordinates<00:01:12.150> with<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:13.110> frame<00:01:13.650> cut<00:01:13.979> set<00:01:14.930> that

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
coordinates with this frame cut set that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.500 
coordinates with this frame cut set that
is<00:01:16.050> called<00:01:16.320> cupcake<00:01:16.860> frame<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.940> you<00:01:18.000> could<00:01:18.330> run

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
is called cupcake frame so you could run

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.880 
is called cupcake frame so you could run
those<00:01:18.690> through<00:01:18.720> your<00:01:19.049> die-cutting<00:01:19.409> machine

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
those through your die-cutting machine

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.730 
those through your die-cutting machine
and<00:01:20.220> then<00:01:20.729> layer<00:01:21.600> different<00:01:21.990> designs<00:01:22.380> and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
and then layer different designs and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.070 
and then layer different designs and
make<00:01:22.920> them<00:01:23.250> customize<00:01:24.060> them<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.390> what<00:01:24.930> you'd

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
make them customize them for what you'd

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.950 
make them customize them for what you'd
like<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:26.960> this<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.170> has<00:01:29.330> lots<00:01:30.330> of<00:01:30.479> different

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
like so this one has lots of different

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.789 
like so this one has lots of different
this<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.650> called<00:01:31.710> edge<00:01:32.070> frame<00:01:33.619> looks<00:01:34.619> like

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
this one is called edge frame looks like

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.410 
this one is called edge frame looks like
labels<00:01:35.540> some<00:01:36.540> more<00:01:36.720> label<00:01:37.200> key<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.909> arrow

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
labels some more label key and arrow

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.270 
labels some more label key and arrow
hearts<00:01:40.400> more<00:01:41.400> frames<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.650> have<00:01:43.650> a<00:01:43.680> couple<00:01:44.040> other

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
hearts more frames I have a couple other

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.690 
hearts more frames I have a couple other
examples<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:46.260> piece<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:46.920> works<00:01:47.310> with

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
examples and this piece here works with

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.440 
examples and this piece here works with
this<00:01:48.240> cling<00:01:48.630> stamp<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.290> they<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:51.240> one

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
this cling stamp that they have this one

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.390 
this cling stamp that they have this one
is<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.080> border<00:01:52.950> messages<00:01:55.400> then

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
is the border messages then

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.770 
is the border messages then
this<00:01:58.400> one<00:01:58.820> and<00:02:00.460> works<00:02:01.460> with<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.600> two

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
this one and works with the two

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.290 
this one and works with the two
different<00:02:03.080> labels<00:02:03.470> here<00:02:03.890> this<00:02:04.159> stamp<00:02:04.640> set<00:02:04.790> is

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
different labels here this stamp set is

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:13.090 
different labels here this stamp set is
called<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:06.920> little<00:02:07.400> note<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:11.230> this<00:02:12.230> works<00:02:12.560> here

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
called a little note and this works here

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.130 
called a little note and this works here
as<00:02:13.340> well<00:02:13.760> as<00:02:14.170> this<00:02:15.170> works<00:02:15.560> with<00:02:15.770> this<00:02:15.950> piece<00:02:17.140> so

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
as well as this works with this piece so

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.890 
as well as this works with this piece so
