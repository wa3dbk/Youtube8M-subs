00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.259 

yeah<00:00:04.160> the<00:00:04.880> chipper<00:00:05.150> is<00:00:05.359> a<00:00:05.390> Val<00:00:05.750> be<00:00:05.990> chipper<00:00:07.269> it

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
yeah the chipper is a Val be chipper it

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.379 
yeah the chipper is a Val be chipper it
can<00:00:08.630> take<00:00:08.840> up<00:00:09.080> to<00:00:09.230> nine<00:00:09.470> inch<00:00:09.769> material<00:00:10.389> it

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
can take up to nine inch material it

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.509 
can take up to nine inch material it
essentially<00:00:12.049> takes<00:00:12.290> one<00:00:12.740> inch<00:00:12.980> per<00:00:13.249> 10

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
essentially takes one inch per 10

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.600 
essentially takes one inch per 10
horsepower<00:00:14.349> so<00:00:15.349> that's<00:00:15.980> a<00:00:16.129> 60<00:00:16.460> horsepower

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
horsepower so that's a 60 horsepower

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.490 
horsepower so that's a 60 horsepower
tractor<00:00:17.450> if<00:00:17.570> you<00:00:17.690> put<00:00:17.900> something<00:00:18.140> in<00:00:18.350> there

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
tractor if you put something in there

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.750 
tractor if you put something in there
bigger<00:00:18.770> than<00:00:18.950> six<00:00:19.160> inches

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
bigger than six inches

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.970 
bigger than six inches
it'll<00:00:20.540> it'll<00:00:20.780> pull<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:21.140> tractor<00:00:21.380> down<00:00:21.650> quite

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
it'll it'll pull the tractor down quite

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.460 
it'll it'll pull the tractor down quite
a<00:00:22.010> lot<00:00:22.250> it<00:00:23.090> takes<00:00:23.150> a<00:00:23.420> minimum<00:00:23.870> size<00:00:24.080> of<00:00:24.380> about

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
a lot it takes a minimum size of about

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.520 
a lot it takes a minimum size of about
30<00:00:24.920> horsepower<00:00:25.310> to<00:00:25.700> pull<00:00:25.910> it<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:26.720> of<00:00:27.290> course

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.530 
30 horsepower to pull it and of course

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.200 
30 horsepower to pull it and of course
you<00:00:27.680> know<00:00:27.800> a<00:00:27.980> 90<00:00:28.400> horsepower<00:00:28.520> would<00:00:29.030> be<00:00:29.120> able

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
you know a 90 horsepower would be able

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.799 
you know a 90 horsepower would be able
to<00:00:29.390> maximize<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:30.230> machine<00:00:31.210> but<00:00:32.210> you<00:00:32.239> can<00:00:32.599> see

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
to maximize the machine but you can see

00:00:32.809 --> 00:01:05.190 
to maximize the machine but you can see
how<00:00:32.960> fast<00:00:33.350> how<00:00:34.100> fast<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.670> takes<00:00:34.700> stuff

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.200 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.490 

you<00:01:06.200> know<00:01:06.350> we<00:01:06.590> can<00:01:06.969> when<00:01:07.969> we're<00:01:08.179> and<00:01:09.079> obviously

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
you know we can when we're and obviously

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.499 
you know we can when we're and obviously
it<00:01:09.820> depending<00:01:10.820> on<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.060> kind<00:01:11.299> of<00:01:11.390> material

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
it depending on the kind of material

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.630 
it depending on the kind of material
makes<00:01:12.170> a<00:01:12.289> big<00:01:12.439> difference<00:01:12.740> on<00:01:12.829> how<00:01:12.950> fast<00:01:13.280> you

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
makes a big difference on how fast you

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.230 
makes a big difference on how fast you
chip<00:01:14.210> I<00:01:15.200> think<00:01:15.619> I<00:01:16.070> think<00:01:16.429> if<00:01:16.610> everything<00:01:17.090> is

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
chip I think I think if everything is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.690 
chip I think I think if everything is
perfect<00:01:17.780> all<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.500> material<00:01:18.979> is<00:01:19.100> perfect<00:01:19.549> and

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
perfect all the material is perfect and

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.520 
perfect all the material is perfect and
all<00:01:19.819> the<00:01:19.969> conditions<00:01:20.390> are<00:01:20.509> perfect<00:01:20.750> that

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
all the conditions are perfect that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.899 
all the conditions are perfect that
thing<00:01:21.740> is<00:01:21.860> supposed<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.250> be<00:01:22.399> able<00:01:22.490> to<00:01:22.729> do

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
thing is supposed to be able to do

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.730 
thing is supposed to be able to do
something<00:01:23.210> like<00:01:23.390> 40<00:01:23.780> cubic<00:01:24.140> yards<00:01:24.469> and<00:01:24.619> how

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
something like 40 cubic yards and how

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.069 
something like 40 cubic yards and how
about<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.789> most<00:01:25.969> we've<00:01:26.240> ever<00:01:26.360> done<00:01:26.659> with<00:01:26.869> it

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
about the most we've ever done with it

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.059 
about the most we've ever done with it
is<00:01:27.229> more<00:01:27.829> like<00:01:28.069> you<00:01:28.429> know<00:01:29.270> 15<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.959> 16<00:01:30.409> maybe<00:01:30.649> 20

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
is more like you know 15 to 16 maybe 20

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.230 
is more like you know 15 to 16 maybe 20
cubic<00:01:31.429> yards<00:01:31.789> in<00:01:31.939> an<00:01:32.030> hour<00:01:33.429> but<00:01:34.429> yeah<00:01:35.000> that's

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
cubic yards in an hour but yeah that's

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.029 
cubic yards in an hour but yeah that's
not<00:01:35.450> always<00:01:35.689> ideal<00:01:35.990> conditions<00:01:36.709> you've<00:01:36.860> got

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
not always ideal conditions you've got

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.490 
not always ideal conditions you've got
so<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.489> know<00:01:37.700> dry<00:01:38.270> out<00:01:38.509> you've<00:01:38.869> got<00:01:39.049> pieces

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
so you know dry out you've got pieces

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.429 
so you know dry out you've got pieces
that<00:01:39.829> don't<00:01:39.979> fit<00:01:40.250> in<00:01:40.489> very<00:01:40.700> well<00:01:40.849> brush<00:01:41.539> bushes

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
that don't fit in very well brush bushes

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.960 
that don't fit in very well brush bushes
and<00:01:42.619> things<00:01:42.860> like<00:01:43.009> that<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:45.549> we<00:01:46.549> don't<00:01:46.670> give<00:01:46.849> it

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
and things like that so we don't give it

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.779 
and things like that so we don't give it
that<00:01:47.119> that<00:01:47.450> fast<00:01:47.810> but<00:01:48.259> it<00:01:48.920> does<00:01:49.280> show<00:01:49.759> the

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
that that fast but it does show the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.240 
that that fast but it does show the
versatility<00:01:50.569> now<00:01:51.319> we<00:01:51.380> can<00:01:51.590> go<00:01:51.709> up<00:01:51.799> there<00:01:51.829> so<00:01:52.159> we

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
versatility now we can go up there so we

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.740 
versatility now we can go up there so we
go<00:01:52.399> up<00:01:52.429> there<00:01:52.670> in<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:52.819> woods<00:01:53.000> along<00:01:53.239> that<00:01:53.479> road

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
go up there in the woods along that road

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.139 
go up there in the woods along that road
or<00:01:54.020> whatever<00:01:54.319> we<00:01:54.649> can<00:01:54.829> we<00:01:55.250> can<00:01:55.429> trim<00:01:55.700> we<00:01:55.880> can<00:01:56.030> do

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
or whatever we can we can trim we can do

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.020 
or whatever we can we can trim we can do
a<00:01:56.179> fence<00:01:56.509> line<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.079> instead<00:01:57.709> of<00:01:57.979> just<00:01:58.159> you

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
a fence line and instead of just you

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.240 
a fence line and instead of just you
know<00:01:59.060> piling<00:01:59.750> up<00:01:59.869> stuff<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.829> letting<00:02:01.039> it<00:02:01.159> sit

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
know piling up stuff and letting it sit

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.359 
know piling up stuff and letting it sit
there<00:02:01.579> and<00:02:01.700> rot<00:02:01.909> we<00:02:02.810> can<00:02:02.959> chip<00:02:03.140> it<00:02:03.289> up<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:04.069> now

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
there and rot we can chip it up and now

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.929 
there and rot we can chip it up and now
we've<00:02:04.579> got<00:02:04.759> carbon<00:02:05.349> for<00:02:06.349> vetting<00:02:06.739> for<00:02:07.129> animals

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
we've got carbon for vetting for animals

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.240 
we've got carbon for vetting for animals
and<00:02:08.209> composting<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.079> whatever<00:02:09.289> you<00:02:09.950> get<00:02:10.130> you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
and composting and whatever you get you

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.949 
and composting and whatever you get you
get<00:02:10.369> carpet<00:02:10.789> in<00:02:10.880> a<00:02:11.150> usable<00:02:11.660> state<00:02:12.160> so<00:02:13.959> being

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
get carpet in a usable state so being

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.680 
get carpet in a usable state so being
able<00:02:15.109> to<00:02:15.459> make<00:02:16.459> big<00:02:16.670> pieces<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.120> little<00:02:17.510> pieces

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
able to make big pieces of little pieces

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.240 
able to make big pieces of little pieces
that<00:02:17.840> flow<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.600> pretty<00:02:20.600> cool<00:02:20.810> thing<00:02:21.250> and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
that flow is a pretty cool thing and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.629 
that flow is a pretty cool thing and
that<00:02:22.910> machine<00:02:23.739> it's<00:02:24.739> you<00:02:25.100> know<00:02:25.190> three<00:02:25.400> point

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:25.639 
that machine it's you know three point

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:30.240 
that machine it's you know three point
hitch<00:02:25.700> mounted<00:02:26.180> PTO<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.489> that<00:02:28.489> machine<00:02:28.670> costs

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
hitch mounted PTO and that machine costs

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.650 
hitch mounted PTO and that machine costs
I'm<00:02:31.250> trying<00:02:31.639> to<00:02:31.730> think<00:02:31.910> but<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:32.209> believe<00:02:32.480> it's

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
I'm trying to think but I believe it's

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.360 
I'm trying to think but I believe it's
about<00:02:32.750> five<00:02:33.170> thousand<00:02:33.650> dollars<00:02:34.010> it's<00:02:34.190> not

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
about five thousand dollars it's not

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.490 
about five thousand dollars it's not
