00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
tapered wheel bearing rides on this

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.999 
tapered wheel bearing rides on this
shiny<00:01:39.280> material<00:01:39.790> right<00:01:40.000> in<00:01:40.119> here<00:01:40.509> is<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:41.800> race

shiny material right in here is the race

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.960 
shiny material right in here is the race
and<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:43.390> pressed<00:01:43.720> in<00:01:43.869> there<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.820> can

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
and it's pressed in there and you can

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.910 
and it's pressed in there and you can
pop<00:01:46.119> them<00:01:46.300> out<00:01:46.360> you<00:01:46.570> just<00:01:46.810> need<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:46.990> hammer<00:01:47.619> and

pop them out you just need a hammer and

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.910 
pop them out you just need a hammer and
a<00:01:48.400> steel<00:01:48.700> drift<00:01:49.119> you<00:01:49.390> can<00:01:49.869> use<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.020> steel<00:01:50.500> drift

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
a steel drift you can use a steel drift

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.640 
a steel drift you can use a steel drift
when<00:01:51.369> you<00:01:51.540> popping<00:01:52.540> these<00:01:52.660> out<00:01:52.900> when<00:01:53.500> you're

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
when you popping these out when you're

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.470 
when you popping these out when you're
putting<00:01:53.920> them<00:01:54.070> in<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.670> have<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.970> use<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.119> brass

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
putting them in you have to use a brass

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.130 
putting them in you have to use a brass
drift<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.650> brass<00:01:56.920> drift<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.580> softer<00:01:58.300> than<00:01:58.510> the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
drift the brass drift is softer than the

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.030 
drift the brass drift is softer than the
steel<00:01:59.409> and<00:01:59.680> you<00:01:59.740> won't<00:01:59.950> damage<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:01.540> race<00:02:02.040> and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
steel and you won't damage the race and

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.240 
steel and you won't damage the race and
if<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.090> haven't<00:02:04.270> seen<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.980> bearing<00:02:05.980> and<00:02:06.130> race

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
if you haven't seen a bearing and race

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.449 
if you haven't seen a bearing and race
assembly<00:02:06.700> before<00:02:06.850> this<00:02:07.450> is<00:02:07.659> one<00:02:07.810> right<00:02:07.990> here

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
assembly before this is one right here

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.650 
assembly before this is one right here
right<00:02:09.459> here<00:02:09.489> we<00:02:09.790> have<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.000> tapered<00:02:10.420> roller

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
right here we have the tapered roller

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.810 
right here we have the tapered roller
bearing<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.290> by<00:02:11.769> that<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:11.980> mean<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:12.519> can<00:02:12.640> see

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
bearing and by that I mean you can see

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.460 
bearing and by that I mean you can see
how<00:02:12.940> it's<00:02:13.120> tapered<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:16.720> diameter<00:02:17.080> is

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
how it's tapered this diameter is

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.210 
how it's tapered this diameter is
greater<00:02:17.950> than<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.180> diameter<00:02:19.510> over<00:02:19.900> here<00:02:20.220> and

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
greater than this diameter over here and

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.050 
greater than this diameter over here and
this<00:02:21.580> right<00:02:21.790> here<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.480> race<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:23.739> can<00:02:24.060> kind

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
this right here is the race you can kind

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.910 
this right here is the race you can kind
of<00:02:25.180> see<00:02:25.330> but<00:02:25.540> this<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:25.810> also<00:02:26.049> tapered<00:02:26.590> as<00:02:26.709> well

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
of see but this is also tapered as well

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.340 
of see but this is also tapered as well
to<00:02:27.519> match<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.910> roller<00:02:28.120> bearing<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.930> is<00:02:29.140> what

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
to match the roller bearing this is what

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.990 
to match the roller bearing this is what
is<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:30.130> pressed<00:02:30.910> into<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.920> rotor<00:02:33.130> assembly<00:02:33.220> and

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
is a pressed into the rotor assembly and

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.259 
is a pressed into the rotor assembly and
then<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.900> tapered<00:02:35.650> roller<00:02:35.860> bearing<00:02:36.280> just

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
then the tapered roller bearing just

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.430 
then the tapered roller bearing just
sits<00:02:37.570> in<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:39.100> in<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:39.730> race<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.360> it<00:02:41.260> just

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
sits in the in the race and it just

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.340 
sits in the in the race and it just
spins<00:02:41.799> like<00:02:42.489> that<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.630> that's<00:02:43.840> all<00:02:44.049> that

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
spins like that and that's all that

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.720 
spins like that and that's all that
works<00:02:45.959> all<00:02:46.959> right<00:02:47.170> here's<00:02:47.860> how<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.070> come<00:02:48.610> in

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
works all right here's how you come in

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.289 
works all right here's how you come in
here<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.180> tap<00:02:49.420> out<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:50.070> inner<00:02:51.070> races<00:02:51.610> you

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
here and you tap out the inner races you

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.840 
here and you tap out the inner races you
see<00:02:52.480> right<00:02:52.750> down<00:02:52.900> in<00:02:53.110> this<00:02:53.230> area<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.950> little

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
see right down in this area a little

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.070 
see right down in this area a little
shiny<00:02:55.120> spot<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.510> at<00:02:58.510> least<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.870> back

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
shiny spot that is at least the back

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.080 
shiny spot that is at least the back
side<00:02:59.349> of<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.560> race<00:02:59.770> and<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:00.580> go<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:00.910> there

hammer so like I said you just get it
inside<00:03:36.140> there<00:03:36.410> on<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:37.550> lip<00:03:37.850> of<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.450> race<00:03:38.690> and

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
inside there on the lip of that race and

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.820 
inside there on the lip of that race and
you<00:03:39.650> just<00:03:39.800> kind<00:03:40.070> of<00:03:40.100> tap<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.460> out<00:03:41.680> you<00:03:42.680> move

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
you just kind of tap it out you move

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:53.800 
you just kind of tap it out you move
around<00:03:42.980> in<00:03:43.250> circles<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:52.540> just<00:03:53.540> move<00:03:53.690> around

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
around in circles you just move around

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.710 
around in circles you just move around
like<00:03:54.080> that<00:03:54.610> until<00:03:55.610> you<00:03:55.730> get<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:55.970> race<00:03:56.150> tapped

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
like that until you get the race tapped

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:28.290 
like that until you get the race tapped
out<00:04:22.570> okay<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:23.780> that's<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.140> I<00:04:26.110> lift<00:04:27.110> this<00:04:27.260> up

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
out okay and that's it I lift this up

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.650 
out okay and that's it I lift this up
there<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:29.420> have<00:04:29.570> it<00:04:29.720> there's<00:04:30.290> a<00:04:30.410> little<00:04:30.710> race

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
there you have it there's a little race

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.080 
there you have it there's a little race
so<00:04:32.660> you<00:04:32.720> just<00:04:32.900> set<00:04:33.080> that<00:04:33.200> out<00:04:33.350> of<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.500> way

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
so you just set that out of the way

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.060 
so you just set that out of the way
bring<00:04:35.090> your<00:04:35.180> rotor<00:04:35.390> back<00:04:35.600> turn<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:36.650> over<00:04:36.770> and

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
bring your rotor back turn it over and

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.620 
bring your rotor back turn it over and
now<00:04:37.400> we<00:04:37.460> got<00:04:37.670> to<00:04:37.790> do<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:39.800> outer<00:04:39.980> race<00:04:40.540> do<00:04:41.540> it

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
now we got to do the outer race do it

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.400 
now we got to do the outer race do it
the<00:04:41.720> same<00:04:41.870> way<00:04:43.390> stick<00:04:44.390> your<00:04:44.420> drift<00:04:45.080> in<00:04:45.230> there

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
the same way stick your drift in there

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.630 
the same way stick your drift in there
and<00:04:45.830> just<00:04:46.700> tap<00:04:46.910> it<00:04:47.060> out<00:04:48.280> just<00:04:49.280> all<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.550> way

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
and just tap it out just all the way

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.790 
and just tap it out just all the way
around<00:04:49.940> just<00:04:50.120> like<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.540> other<00:04:50.660> race<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.140> then

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
around just like the other race and then

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.280 
around just like the other race and then
you<00:04:51.890> have<00:04:52.010> it<00:04:52.160> we<00:04:52.250> got<00:04:52.400> both<00:04:52.990> inner<00:04:53.990> and<00:04:54.110> outer

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
you have it we got both inner and outer

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.670 
you have it we got both inner and outer
races<00:04:55.090> tapped<00:04:56.090> out<00:04:56.240> of<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.420> hub<00:04:56.600> so<00:04:56.840> now<00:04:57.500> we'll

bit<00:05:10.250> of<00:05:10.310> a<00:05:10.400> mistake<00:05:10.760> that<00:05:10.790> I<00:05:11.000> made<00:05:11.090> you<00:05:11.930> could

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
bit of a mistake that I made you could

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.830 
bit of a mistake that I made you could
see<00:05:12.350> in<00:05:12.500> there<00:05:12.710> those<00:05:13.100> Nick's<00:05:13.490> no<00:05:13.970> scratches

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840

see in there those Nick's no scratches
those<00:05:16.110> are<00:05:16.290> from<00:05:16.560> me<00:05:18.590> using<00:05:19.590> my<00:05:19.860> drift<00:05:20.600> to<00:05:21.600> get

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
those are from me using my drift to get

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.020 
those are from me using my drift to get
that<00:05:21.930> bearing<00:05:22.350> race<00:05:22.530> out<00:05:22.740> what<00:05:23.550> happened<00:05:23.880> was

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
that bearing race out what happened was

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.409 
that bearing race out what happened was
the<00:05:24.270> drift<00:05:24.660> was<00:05:25.350> nicking<00:05:26.780> the<00:05:27.780> inside<00:05:28.230> of<00:05:28.410> the

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
the drift was nicking the inside of the

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.170 
the drift was nicking the inside of the
journal<00:05:30.419> where<00:05:30.540> the<00:05:30.919> race<00:05:31.919> presses<00:05:32.430> in<00:05:32.610> so<00:05:33.150> I

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180

it happened to do what I did and make
those<00:06:11.190> little<00:06:11.460> divots<00:06:11.820> in<00:06:11.940> there<00:06:12.530> just<00:06:13.530> come

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
those little divots in there just come

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.590 
those little divots in there just come
in<00:06:13.860> here<00:06:14.070> with<00:06:14.220> the<00:06:14.340> file<00:06:14.610> little<00:06:15.120> half<00:06:15.300> round

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
in here with the file little half round

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.080 
in here with the file little half round
file<00:06:15.900> and<00:06:16.229> just<00:06:17.810> shave<00:06:18.810> off<00:06:19.729> just<00:06:20.729> the<00:06:20.880> high

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
file and just shave off just the high

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.550 
file and just shave off just the high
spots<00:06:21.510> you<00:06:21.690> don't<00:06:21.960> want<00:06:22.169> to<00:06:22.229> get<00:06:22.350> too<00:06:22.530> deep

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
spots you don't want to get too deep

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.380 
spots you don't want to get too deep
because<00:06:23.070> remember<00:06:23.310> the<00:06:23.580> race<00:06:23.760> has<00:06:23.970> to<00:06:24.000> press

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
because remember the race has to press

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.590 
because remember the race has to press
into<00:06:24.690> this<00:06:25.020> area<00:06:25.440> so<00:06:26.040> just<00:06:26.280> file<00:06:27.030> off<00:06:27.240> the<00:06:27.419> high

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
into this area so just file off the high

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.370 
into this area so just file off the high
spots<00:06:28.220> but<00:06:29.220> don't<00:06:29.460> dig<00:06:30.090> in<00:06:30.300> and<00:06:30.540> remove<00:06:31.200> too

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
spots but don't dig in and remove too

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.990 
spots but don't dig in and remove too
much<00:06:31.410> material<00:06:32.070> because<00:06:32.340> like<00:06:32.520> I<00:06:32.640> said<00:06:32.850> the

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
much material because like I said the

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.550 
much material because like I said the
rest<00:06:33.500> it's<00:06:34.500> a<00:06:34.590> press<00:06:34.890> fit<00:06:35.130> in<00:06:35.340> there<00:06:35.580> so<00:06:36.560> just

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
rest it's a press fit in there so just

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.350 
rest it's a press fit in there so just
enough<00:06:37.770> to<00:06:37.860> get<00:06:37.979> the<00:06:38.070> high<00:06:38.190> spots<00:06:38.460> off<00:06:38.669> don't

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
enough to get the high spots off don't

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.710 
enough to get the high spots off don't
dig<00:06:39.539> too<00:06:39.570> deep<00:06:39.900> with<00:06:40.080> the<00:06:40.229> file
