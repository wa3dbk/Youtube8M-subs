00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.609 
amazing to me why anyone would ever wear
this<00:05:23.189> thing<00:05:23.489> like<00:05:23.729> that<00:05:23.999> I<00:05:24.259> would<00:05:25.259> not<00:05:25.409> wear

this thing like that I would not wear

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:32.979 
this thing like that I would not wear
this<00:05:25.769> which<00:05:25.979> out<00:05:26.219> of<00:05:26.369> the<00:05:26.429> house<00:05:30.169> you<00:05:31.169> know<00:05:31.439> I

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:32.989 
this which out of the house you know I

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:35.929 
this which out of the house you know I
on<00:05:33.989> the<00:05:34.319> mannequin<00:05:34.709> it<00:05:35.039> looked<00:05:35.219> great<00:05:35.489> I<00:05:35.639> think

00:05:35.929 --> 00:05:35.939

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:39.259 
on the mannequin it looked great I think
it's<00:05:36.269> probably<00:05:36.539> because<00:05:37.199> it<00:05:37.469> was<00:05:37.619> like<00:05:38.269> you

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:39.269 
it's probably because it was like you

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:41.629 
it's probably because it was like you
know<00:05:39.419> maybe<00:05:40.109> had<00:05:40.379> been<00:05:40.499> hanging<00:05:40.859> there<00:05:41.009> for
