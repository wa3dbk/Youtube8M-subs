00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.250
 are quick techniques of agreement are quick technique are short surgeries not 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.950
 they are surgeries that last much longer than an hour and a half 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.599
 longer 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:10.049
 which I appreciate 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.519
 gave does not support long surgeries 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.759
 I love a lot in my legs I do not want to have varicose veins and therefore I like 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.880
 that the surgery is short, they are also comfortable for seated opera surgeons 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.360
 lacuerda seated and that for me is an advantage for me is an advantage I like 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.470
 be like operating 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.039
 I do not like standing for countless hours 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.920
 and it's a technique that uses fundamentally asti resolution techniques this 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.920
 is what I want to highlight especially her my specialty 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.630
 according to our specialty those who do ophthalmology 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.970
 we cure patients can not say much today that commune much 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.990
 specials can say this 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.450
 that is, if a patient has a problem, the eye usually 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.390
 we can solve 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.520
 it's Tuesday a 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.999
 very decisive specialty and that provokes 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.919
 or it gives you a feeling that you're really doing something useful 

00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:00.710
 agreement and that you are useful 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.330
 for me, it has very few specialties and it is tremendously 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.410
 really rewarding I say 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.170
 this is an example to cataract surgery what has to eat all the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.870
 days 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.670
 we are capable today 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.510
 d in 15 minutes with the patient awake as the major these surgeries 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.670
 remove a cataract removed patient a problem he is 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.540
 diminishing their quality of life tremendously 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.010
 put an intraocular lens and then go home 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.770
 without practically producing 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.120
 no type of discomfort or sensation 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.980
 agree that 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.980
 I think that today there are very few fisheries that can do it 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.679
 most impressive things 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.329
 that are not done in all hospitals are for example transplants no longer 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.690
 cornea but endothelium transplants 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.910
 if you see the right top image pathological natania of a cornea its 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.680
 full thickness and what they are full is the endothelium la coruña ni 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.610
 approximately five hundred microns defend having from the area in which 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.280
 the midas 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.240
 because today we are able to remove 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.160
 do not want to layer and place those of the donor without need of suture 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.520
 of agreement without need of large incisions i the patient could his 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.859
 house practically 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:10.639
 at two hours agreement 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.010
 after planting the cornea or part of your cornea 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.739
 retinal surgeries 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.249
 fame lodges a specialty that is how it came divided and you go to 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.360
 rotate those who will take specialty in the different sections usually 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:25.410
 they are horny 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.540
 retina glaucoma squint 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.189
 orbit and still hospitals do not spend lodge 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.100
 we also operate the retina we get inside the eye 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.400
 and we are able to separate tissues such as the membrane and small hands 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.730
 and if you want and that the central area of ​​the eye to this area is called macula and 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.340
 in kind of folds or mounds in the central back because we are able to 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.339
 some tweezers 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:50.649
 remove that membrane that produces metamorphosis sting comfort for the 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.059
 patient we are able to withdraw it 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.089
 I insist 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:57.909
 with tissues that measure approximately then between 10 and 20 microns 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.139
 who wants to devote to refractive surgery another of the great 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.919
 percent out of the article and span the leaf 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.359
 and those who want to make good money even if they want to make real money 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.559
 because that's one thing that strikes me that much has been done 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:17.279
 days it seems that the doctor who wants to earn money is that it is bad 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:21.379
 san benito is better the poorer and the more hours they work and how much 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.379
 less sleep good agreement because it does not have to be like that 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.469
 I like the money you have to tell you yes I like it because I'm not going to 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.909
 to admit 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:31.909
 line 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.309
 I would dedicate myself to do refractive surgery 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:38.690
 Today we are capable of without even guttering blades 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.060
 as in these cases is the laser beam that is visa and is capable of making points 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.330
 skinny corneal simply with millions and minibuses lift the surface of the 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.740
 eye ips mold it to remove from the glasses to people from near by far the 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.430
 astigmatism the presbyopia or what one wants to be handsome without glasses 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.290
 I do not know how much it pays us to wait for tonar de lizarra faso 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.650
 contact lenses what 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.419
 the sensations that produce that 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.209
 the place can produce that 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.739
 Well, I think they are things 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.159
 someone who wants to do up moloj and bet on must value why they are 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.089
 there they are taking positions because the disadvantages because also that 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:13.050
 inconveniences 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.930
 of course 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.630
 it is a non-aggressive surgery to say one that likes to fill with blood 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.070
 go out with pigs soaked in blood according to one who likes it 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.770
 the gloves arrive here and other things, well then, no no no 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.249
 that does not take permanence because it is a surgery that minimally invasive 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:32.379
 we saved lives that 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:35.469
 may represent a problem for some the agreement because it is true that 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:37.890
 we are not the superstitious ones to the super spectacular 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.640
 what do we do cardio plagia 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.070
 but we do cycle plagia vale is to say paralyzes the ciliary muscle but 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.400
 we also do plagia 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.840
 percent effectively we saved lives that's a disadvantage 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.979
 because in addition when the lees with a patient is already a complication like 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.470
 patient does not move you have it to your chip all of life saying it has left me 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.170
 blind man left me blind left me blind 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.090
 that is to say sanchez inconveniences that may pose that value 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.910
 and it is a high specialty effectively discredited 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:05.750
 discredited 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.260
 people go to wolf span 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.680
 already after the cataract as well as the cataract that that moment this 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.450
 cataract is going to take away environment and phenotypes and you're reminded by hand 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.550
 never complicate and how and define gone phenomenal and to my father phenomenal in 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.569
 oviedo phenomenal 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:19.990
 when it gets complicated 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.120
 Well, people do not have the feeling to say 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.430
 Today I'm getting into an operating room and having serious complications and 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.520
 he could even lose his eye by a simple cataract surgery 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.979
 more even they hired resident 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.360
 consultations without agreement has the medical part of the consultation that to me 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.360
 like to say feed people who like to deal with the patient 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.920
 Well, you can also 7 in that interaction 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.210
 and not being all day in the operating room that's an advantage 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.990
 the queries has some characteristics the query that you 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.879
 like for the dynamic I 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:54.180
 etc after the days brings out the very important conclusion and is that I think 

00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:55.759
 that there is a profile 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.860
 let's say for each one of the specialists is one thing that you have to 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.720
 value josé a 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.539
 with my profile as I am 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.509
 time to do I could not be a gynecologist I'm completely 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.169
 convinced can not be fatal toledo internist I can not with 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.249
 they 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:11.219
 I am a dynamic person 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:14.739
 in which I like to do many things and in a short time and change and be 

00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:18.169
 continuously thinking about different things I can not 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.659
 as much as the doctor Miguel admits but I can not with the water and I 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.569
 pill since when the why 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:29.169
 my wife 1 another another one of those inquiries ophthalmology consultations 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.159
 the consultations are independent is an advantage 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:37.239
 we need ana and in this the radiologist nor so efron and but the beautiful to the 

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:38.600
 cardiologist are not there 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.279
 because ophthalmological pathology cd 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:45.469
 agree the time is to say that you have a problem in the eye your love sunitas ask 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:49.619
 no complementary test and that gives you an independence that for me is 

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:53.649
 fundamental about electro pinas all over potassium about that of the 

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:56.849
 clinical sessions in which bulls internists agree that it seems 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:57.400
 who are 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.379
 the receiving the Nobel prize 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:02.689
 I personally, as a man, I like to pull my patient and solve the 

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:07.129
 problem solitos join anyone and then I can handle a little bit he could play him 

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:10.259
 I can flirt with the systemic management of the patient because 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:12.770
 look, this is a patient that took me 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.039
 with some spots 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:16.149
 this will sound from the mir stains 

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:17.840
 red and white 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.600
 I remember 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.090
 that all positions of a homeland of ethics so 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.100
 Excellent 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.610
 of a patient who measured with loss of vision with spots and brit and 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.310
 hemorrhages and what I had 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.649
 it was one 

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:32.649
 percent and a pancreatitis agree because it enters the diagnostic tooth 

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:35.070
 differential and diagnose you from pancreatitis 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.569
 thanks to the fundus 

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:39.830
 I remember when the patient what referred to the decrease to uefa did 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.300
 something and everything in the gut then and a little less alessia of banking litis 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.669
 we ask for thorny amylase a thousand thousand handles according 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.990
 be that you can play a little with the query
