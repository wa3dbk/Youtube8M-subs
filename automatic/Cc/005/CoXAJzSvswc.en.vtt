00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
playing on a harder difficulty but where

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.220 
playing on a harder difficulty but where
you're<00:03:47.970> gonna<00:03:48.090> have<00:03:48.270> to<00:03:48.390> do<00:03:48.540> is<00:03:48.750> towards<00:03:49.080> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
you're gonna have to do is towards the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.080 
you're gonna have to do is towards the
end<00:03:49.350> of<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.530> level<00:03:49.740> when<00:03:50.250> Leon's<00:03:50.670> trying<00:03:51.030> to

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
end of the level when Leon's trying to

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.240 
end of the level when Leon's trying to
hold<00:03:51.270> you<00:03:51.360> back<00:03:51.510> with<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.750> sniper<00:03:52.070> you'll<00:03:53.070> be

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
hold you back with a sniper you'll be

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.130 
hold you back with a sniper you'll be
right<00:03:53.400> here<00:03:53.640> so<00:03:54.450> you<00:03:54.510> have<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.840> take<00:03:54.990> the

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
right here so you have to take the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.290 
right here so you have to take the
ladder<00:03:55.350> up<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.830> get<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.190> them<00:03:56.370> instead<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.120> you

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
ladder up to get to them instead of you

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.860 
ladder up to get to them instead of you
on<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:57.630> we're<00:03:57.930> just<00:03:58.110> gonna<00:03:58.340> take<00:03:59.660> the<00:04:00.660> path

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
on that we're just gonna take the path

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.890 
on that we're just gonna take the path
to<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.170> right<00:04:01.790> so<00:04:02.790> this<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.090> what<00:04:03.210> I<00:04:03.240> did<00:04:03.540> this

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
to the right so this is what I did this

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.900 
to the right so this is what I did this
is<00:04:03.960> on<00:04:04.230> casual<00:04:04.740> so<00:04:05.070> I<00:04:05.100> could<00:04:05.310> just<00:04:05.460> run<00:04:05.670> through

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
is on casual so I could just run through

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.760 
is on casual so I could just run through
it<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.840> if<00:04:06.930> that's<00:04:07.080> what<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.410> want<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.620> do

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
it and if that's what you want to do

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.260 
it and if that's what you want to do
that's<00:04:07.890> fine<00:04:08.160> like<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.520> said<00:04:08.700> I<00:04:08.730> imagine<00:04:09.150> it

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
that's fine like I said I imagine it

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.790 
that's fine like I said I imagine it
would<00:04:09.330> be<00:04:09.390> pretty<00:04:09.510> hard<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:09.990> do<00:04:10.200> on<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.530> harder

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
would be pretty hard to do on the harder

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.700 
would be pretty hard to do on the harder
difficulties<00:04:11.840> so<00:04:12.840> I'm<00:04:12.960> just<00:04:13.050> gonna<00:04:13.170> run<00:04:13.440> past

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
difficulties so I'm just gonna run past

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.610 
difficulties so I'm just gonna run past
all<00:04:14.040> these<00:04:14.430> guys<00:04:14.670> all<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.360> zombies<00:04:15.780> and

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
you'll see the ladder right there on my
