Butler<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.460> still<00:01:38.939> think<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.240> team<00:01:39.659> armed

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159

McDermott<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.310> still<00:01:41.670> think<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:41.909> team<00:01:42.270> is

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
McDermott I still think that team is

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.539 
McDermott I still think that team is
better<00:01:42.780> than<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.439> Cleveland<00:01:43.829> Cavaliers<00:01:43.979> so

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
better than the Cleveland Cavaliers so

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.420 
better than the Cleveland Cavaliers so
they're<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:45.000> strapped<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.750> cash

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
they're going to be strapped for cash

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.469 
they're going to be strapped for cash
with<00:01:48.659> three<00:01:48.899> max<00:01:49.140> deals<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.149> they<00:01:51.149> still

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
with three max deals and they still

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.179 
with three max deals and they still
won't<00:01:51.630> become<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.170> best<00:01:52.409> team<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.950> east
