with it but just sitting there looks man
it<00:02:24.840> looks<00:02:24.990> great<00:02:25.400> but<00:02:26.420> let's<00:02:27.420> move<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.870> the

it looks great but let's move to the
side<00:02:28.200> here<00:02:29.870> take<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.900> look<00:02:31.230> at<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.770> figure

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
side here take a look at the figure

side here take a look at the figure

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
himself starting at the top he's got a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.870 
himself starting at the top he's got a
closeable<00:02:37.500> helmet<00:02:37.860> his<00:02:38.820> head<00:02:39.060> does<00:02:39.300> turn<00:02:40.880> he's

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
closeable helmet his head does turn he's

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.910 
closeable helmet his head does turn he's
got<00:02:42.090> these<00:02:42.300> little<00:02:42.660> shoulder<00:02:43.320> flaps<00:02:43.620> and

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
got these little shoulder flaps and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.000 
got these little shoulder flaps and
underneath<00:02:44.250> his<00:02:44.520> arm<00:02:45.170> goes<00:02:46.170> forward<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:46.800> back

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
underneath his arm goes forward and back

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.440 
underneath his arm goes forward and back
up<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.550> down<00:02:48.620> bicep<00:02:49.620> swivel<00:02:50.270> he's<00:02:51.270> got<00:02:51.420> a

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
up and down bicep swivel he's got a

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.570 
up and down bicep swivel he's got a
little<00:02:51.660> bit<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.960> an<00:02:52.080> elbow<00:02:52.230> not<00:02:52.950> much<00:02:53.190> I

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
little bit of an elbow not much I

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.330 
little bit of an elbow not much I
suppose<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.510> could<00:02:54.750> cut<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.230> away<00:02:55.380> give<00:02:56.250> him

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
suppose you could cut that away give him

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.180 
suppose you could cut that away give him
more<00:02:56.490> motion<00:02:56.850> if<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.060> wanted<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:58.680> fish<00:02:58.950> do

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
more motion if you wanted to the fish do

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.610 
more motion if you wanted to the fish do
rotate<00:02:59.700> around<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.510> that's<00:03:01.170> because<00:03:01.470> they

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
rotate around and that's because they

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.910 
rotate around and that's because they
are<00:03:01.770> swappable<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:03.210> he<00:03:03.330> comes<00:03:03.540> with<00:03:03.920> two

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
are swappable so he comes with two

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.190 
are swappable so he comes with two
normal<00:03:05.880> fists<00:03:06.240> one<00:03:06.390> for<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.630> left<00:03:06.810> one<00:03:06.900> for

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
normal fists one for the left one for

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.850 
normal fists one for the left one for
the<00:03:07.290> right<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:08.460> I<00:03:08.700> mean<00:03:08.820> they're<00:03:08.970> okay<00:03:09.740> to<00:03:10.740> be

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
the right and I mean they're okay to be

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.830 
the right and I mean they're okay to be
completely<00:03:11.280> honest<00:03:11.790> they<00:03:12.090> don't<00:03:12.540> look<00:03:12.660> that

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
completely honest they don't look that

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.390 
completely honest they don't look that
good<00:03:14.900> got<00:03:15.900> an<00:03:16.020> open<00:03:16.290> hand<00:03:16.500> for<00:03:16.710> his<00:03:16.800> left

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
good got an open hand for his left

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.700 
good got an open hand for his left
he's<00:03:17.670> got<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.820> gun<00:03:18.030> hand<00:03:18.330> for<00:03:18.510> his<00:03:18.600> right<00:03:18.870> now

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
he's got a gun hand for his right now

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.920 
he's got a gun hand for his right now
the<00:03:19.770> funny<00:03:19.950> thing<00:03:20.130> about<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.520> the<00:03:21.390> hands

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
the funny thing about this the hands

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.340 
the funny thing about this the hands
this<00:03:22.860> one<00:03:23.040> actually<00:03:23.190> holds<00:03:23.610> his<00:03:23.700> blaster

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
this one actually holds his blaster

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.480 
this one actually holds his blaster
really<00:03:25.350> well<00:03:27.080> this<00:03:28.080> one<00:03:28.380> doesn't<00:03:29.130> hold<00:03:29.340> it

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
really well this one doesn't hold it

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.980 
really well this one doesn't hold it
very<00:03:29.640> well<00:03:29.790> at<00:03:29.880> all<00:03:29.970> but<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.480> think<00:03:30.810> that's

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
very well at all but I think that's

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.210 
very well at all but I think that's
because<00:03:31.230> you're<00:03:31.530> actually<00:03:31.650> supposed<00:03:32.070> to

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
because you're actually supposed to

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.010 
because you're actually supposed to
build<00:03:32.520> the<00:03:32.760> hand<00:03:33.000> around<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.660> it's<00:03:33.840> got<00:03:33.990> a

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
build the hand around it it's got a

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.830 
build the hand around it it's got a
trigger<00:03:34.320> finger<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:35.670> would<00:03:35.790> fit<00:03:36.000> perfectly<00:03:36.600> in

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
trigger finger it would fit perfectly in

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.150 
trigger finger it would fit perfectly in
there<00:03:37.020> if<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.320> would<00:03:37.470> have<00:03:37.560> been<00:03:37.620> assembled

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
there if it would have been assembled

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.480 
there if it would have been assembled
that<00:03:38.280> way<00:03:38.460> so<00:03:39.560> it's<00:03:40.560> probably<00:03:40.800> my<00:03:40.950> fault<00:03:41.220> I

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
that way so it's probably my fault I

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.660 
that way so it's probably my fault I
have<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.850> go<00:03:41.970> in<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.270> redo<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.840> but<00:03:43.290> uh<00:03:43.670> yeah

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
have to go in and redo it but uh yeah

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.710 
have to go in and redo it but uh yeah
you<00:03:44.760> get<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:44.970> idea<00:03:45.210> anyway<00:03:45.450> um<00:03:46.700> hips<00:03:47.720> forward

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
you get the idea anyway um hips forward

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.220 
you get the idea anyway um hips forward
and<00:03:48.840> back<00:03:49.400> side<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.610> side<00:03:52.430> knee<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:54.600> then<00:03:54.960> on

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
and back side to side knee and then on

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.470 
and back side to side knee and then on
the<00:03:55.380> feet<00:03:55.710> this<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.520> part<00:03:56.730> of<00:03:56.760> transformation

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
the feet this is part of transformation

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.260 
the feet this is part of transformation
but<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.840> heel<00:03:58.520> articulates<00:03:59.520> and<00:03:59.820> then<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:00.120> do

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
but the heel articulates and then so do

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
but the heel articulates and then so do
the<00:04:00.420> toes<00:04:01.190> sitting<00:04:02.190> kind<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.870> changes<00:04:03.870> feet<00:04:04.110> to

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
the toes sitting kind of changes feet to

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.810 
the toes sitting kind of changes feet to
be<00:04:04.410> large<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:05.040> support<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.460> weight<00:04:05.610> of<00:04:05.640> the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
be large to support the weight of the

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.620 
be large to support the weight of the
mecca<00:04:06.060> when<00:04:06.840> it's<00:04:06.960> in<00:04:07.110> full<00:04:08.450> Mecca<00:04:09.450> mode

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
mecca when it's in full Mecca mode

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.080 
mecca when it's in full Mecca mode
whoops<00:04:12.630> this<00:04:12.900> part<00:04:13.200> came<00:04:13.410> off<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.910> that's

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
whoops this part came off and that's

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.880 
whoops this part came off and that's
what<00:04:15.270> happens<00:04:15.600> folks<00:04:15.840> there<00:04:16.410> we<00:04:16.530> go

okay so
that's<00:04:20.349> the<00:04:20.739> basic<00:04:21.250> motorcycle<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:22.180> figure

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.070 
that's the basic motorcycle and figure
I'm<00:04:24.160> gonna<00:04:24.340> brave<00:04:24.699> the<00:04:24.970> transformation<00:04:25.840> for

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
I'm gonna brave the transformation for

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.309 
I'm gonna brave the transformation for
