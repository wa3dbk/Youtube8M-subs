again this is a tool that inflicts pain

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.009 
again this is a tool that inflicts pain
and<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.000> greatest<00:02:22.360> tool<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.900> be

remember that the dogs most muscular

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.770 
remember that the dogs most muscular
part<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.130> them<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:42.549> their<00:02:42.730> back<00:02:42.910> shoulders<00:02:43.480> in
