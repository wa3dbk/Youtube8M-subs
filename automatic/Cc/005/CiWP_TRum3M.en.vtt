00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.220 
the draw at MIT and we nice enough you
down<00:00:20.490> telly<00:00:20.789> pad<00:00:21.029> down<00:00:21.179> and<00:00:21.329> tell<00:00:21.449> me<00:00:21.480> they've

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230

I<00:00:25.019> just<00:00:25.199> thought<00:00:25.380> cover<00:00:25.769> three<00:00:26.159> easy<00:00:26.369> steps<00:00:26.400> a

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
I just thought cover three easy steps a

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.880 
I just thought cover three easy steps a
most<00:00:27.720> people<00:00:27.989> shall<00:00:28.140> be<00:00:28.199> my<00:00:28.289> problem<00:00:28.589> if<00:00:28.800> you

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
most people shall be my problem if you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.679 
most people shall be my problem if you
could<00:00:29.069> do<00:00:29.159> 10<00:00:29.339> acrylic<00:00:29.759> book<00:00:29.999> make<00:00:30.269> father<00:00:30.539> be

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
could do 10 acrylic book make father be

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.950 
could do 10 acrylic book make father be
easier<00:00:31.050> urea<00:00:31.710> markers<00:00:32.220> and<00:00:32.340> eggs<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.960> yeah

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
easier urea markers and eggs and yeah

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.500 
easier urea markers and eggs and yeah
just<00:00:34.170> three<00:00:34.410> easy<00:00:34.440> steps<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:35.519> that<00:00:35.670> ceramic

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
just three easy steps in that ceramic

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.610 
just three easy steps in that ceramic
levski<00:00:37.760> this<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.910> step<00:00:39.120> one<00:00:39.359> you'll<00:00:40.050> need<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
levski this is step one you'll need a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.650 
levski this is step one you'll need a
pentile<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:42.050> 860<00:00:43.050> app<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.829> market<00:00:43.859> uh<00:00:44.600> this<00:00:45.600> is

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
pentile and 860 app in market uh this is

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.079 
pentile and 860 app in market uh this is
we're<00:00:45.929> gonna<00:00:46.019> start<00:00:46.320> off<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.739> legs<00:00:47.089> it's

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
we're gonna start off with the legs it's

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.540 
we're gonna start off with the legs it's
easier<00:00:48.449> that<00:00:48.480> way<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.800> think<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> film

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
easier that way and I think in the film

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.520 
easier that way and I think in the film
it<00:00:50.789> was<00:00:50.910> mostly<00:00:51.239> combination<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.140> LEGO

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
it was mostly combination of like LEGO

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.489 
it was mostly combination of like LEGO
pieces<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.249> cg<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:54.629> yeah<00:00:54.749> just<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.140> top<00:00:55.320> of

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:55.499 
pieces and cg but yeah just on top of

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:57.770 
pieces and cg but yeah just on top of
the<00:00:55.559> legs<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.129> quite<00:00:56.309> square<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.600> it's

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the legs it so it's quite square so it's

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.329 
the legs it so it's quite square so it's
kind<00:00:58.019> of<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.649> know<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.890> kind<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.160> easy

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
kind of like you know it's kind of easy

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.430 
kind of like you know it's kind of easy
to<00:00:59.579> do<00:00:59.699> really<00:00:59.940> are<00:01:00.179> a<00:01:00.480> lot<00:01:00.749> of<00:01:00.780> ways<00:01:00.989> because

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
to do really are a lot of ways because

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.579 
to do really are a lot of ways because

I think they are the reflective sort of
simple<00:02:02.340> zone<00:02:02.550> right<00:02:02.850> now<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:04.380> then<00:02:04.770> with<00:02:04.920> it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
simple zone right now and then with it

that time did it arms it's going to make

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.240 
that time did it arms it's going to make
a<00:02:11.550> little<00:02:11.850> bit<00:02:11.970> reading<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:13.380> want<00:02:13.590> and

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
a little bit reading if you want and

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.820 
a little bit reading if you want and
then<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:15.000> arms<00:02:15.270> are<00:02:15.450> really<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.840> simple<00:02:16.440> sort

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
then the arms are really a simple sort

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.430 
then the arms are really a simple sort

there's the body we've done the first
two<00:02:30.690> steps<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.590> legs<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.070> body<00:02:32.280> and

two steps the the legs in the body and

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.000 
two steps the the legs in the body and
every<00:02:33.240> guy<00:02:33.330> on<00:02:33.360> step<00:02:33.810> three<00:02:33.840> which<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.800> hat

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
every guy on step three which is the hat

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.979 
every guy on step three which is the hat
and<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.700> lot<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.090> people<00:02:36.300> might<00:02:36.540> think<00:02:36.600> that

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
and a lot of people might think that

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.660 
and a lot of people might think that
whether<00:02:37.350> they've<00:02:37.590> been<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.800> logo<00:02:38.069> penis<00:02:38.550> and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
whether they've been a logo penis and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.550 
whether they've been a logo penis and
then<00:02:38.730> obviously<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.720> can't<00:02:39.930> even<00:02:40.200> joke<00:02:40.320> in<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
then obviously it can't even joke in the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.780 
then obviously it can't even joke in the
movie<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:40.890> they're<00:02:41.040> all<00:02:41.160> kind<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.489> saying

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
movie that they're all kind of saying

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.670 
movie that they're all kind of saying
but<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.780> know<00:02:42.900> it's<00:02:43.020> kind<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.350> it's<00:02:43.530> got

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
but you know it's kind of it's got

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.320

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
rounded distinctive had annoyed so you

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.210 
rounded distinctive had annoyed so you
can't<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.750> just<00:02:45.780> do<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.200> line<00:02:46.380> pad<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.130> then

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
can't it just do the line pad and then

there's<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.040> head<00:03:10.489> now<00:03:11.489> we're<00:03:11.640> on<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.820> last

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
there's the head now we're on the last

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.449 
there's the head now we're on the last
step<00:03:12.239> this<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.660> fourth<00:03:12.900> step<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:14.130> can<00:03:14.160> put

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
step this is the fourth step you can put

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.509 
step this is the fourth step you can put
away<00:03:14.549> year<00:03:14.880> na<00:03:15.540> 80<00:03:15.870> 60<00:03:16.470> more<00:03:16.890> campers<00:03:17.370> will

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
away year na 80 60 more campers will

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.610 
away year na 80 60 more campers will
need<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.120> call<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:19.079> could<00:03:19.260> just<00:03:19.380> use<00:03:19.590> a

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
need it and call it you could just use a

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.370 
need it and call it you could just use a
bad<00:03:19.860> borrow<00:03:20.130> if<00:03:20.459> need<00:03:20.670> be<00:03:20.700> or<00:03:20.930> read<00:03:21.930> files<00:03:22.230> I

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
bad borrow if need be or read files I

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.870 
bad borrow if need be or read files I
think<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.769> for<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.040> red<00:03:23.310> felt<00:03:23.579> because<00:03:23.730> it

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
think of it for the red felt because it

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.550 
think of it for the red felt because it
might<00:03:24.030> be<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.269> bit<00:03:24.420> more<00:03:24.600> us<00:03:24.780> or<00:03:24.959> are<00:03:25.110> cutting

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
might be a bit more us or are cutting

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.740 
might be a bit more us or are cutting
yeah<00:03:26.070> but<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.340> just<00:03:26.489> got<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.700> do<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.540> piece<00:03:27.720> of

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
yeah but you just got to do the piece of

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.050 
yeah but you just got to do the piece of
resistance<00:03:27.900> as<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.590> last<00:03:28.769> part<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.910> it's

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
resistance as the last part and so it's

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.270 
resistance as the last part and so it's
just<00:03:30.239> making<00:03:30.450> sort<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.810> 3ds<00:03:31.290> or<00:03:31.500> behind<00:03:31.829> in<00:03:32.100> my
