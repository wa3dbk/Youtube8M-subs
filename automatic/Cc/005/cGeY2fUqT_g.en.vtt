using<00:00:31.500> legacy<00:00:32.040> mode

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
using legacy mode

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.030 
using legacy mode
I<00:00:32.430> don't<00:00:32.880> usually<00:00:33.030> PK<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:33.989> if<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.770> something

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
I don't usually PK but if it's something

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.180 
I don't usually PK but if it's something
as<00:00:35.430> simple<00:00:35.790> as<00:00:36.180> all<00:00:36.510> combat<00:00:37.079> system<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.040> know

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
as simple as all combat system you know

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.069 
as simple as all combat system you know
I<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.610> do<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.570> if<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.809> are<00:00:39.840> using

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
I can do that so if you are using

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.380 
I can do that so if you are using
two-handed<00:00:40.710> weapons<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.430> actually<00:00:42.090> feels

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
two-handed weapons it actually feels

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.229 
two-handed weapons it actually feels
like<00:00:42.690> old<00:00:42.960> combat<00:00:43.440> system<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.100> also<00:00:44.879> combine

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
like old combat system and also combine

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.330 
like old combat system and also combine
that<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:45.510> vengeance<00:00:46.200> which<00:00:46.680> people<00:00:47.160> never

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
that with vengeance which people never

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.580 
that with vengeance which people never
used<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.850> evolution<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.390> combat<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.989> finally

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
used in evolution of combat and finally

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.920

fine

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.450 
fine
but<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.470> shared<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.619> with<00:01:22.830> two<00:01:23.040> weapons

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
but you just shared it with two weapons

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.149 
but you just shared it with two weapons
so<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.330> impossible<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:25.020> KO<00:01:25.350> anyone<00:01:25.860> unless

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
so it's impossible to KO anyone unless

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.130 
so it's impossible to KO anyone unless
you<00:01:26.340> switch<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> mall<00:01:27.240> or<00:01:27.270> something<00:01:27.450> got<00:01:27.990> an

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
you switch to a mall or something got an

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.410 
you switch to a mall or something got an
HTS<00:01:28.680> back<00:01:29.040> which<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.549> could<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.299> then

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
HTS back which you could do but then

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.609 
HTS back which you could do but then
you're<00:01:30.540> risking<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.140> three<00:01:31.409> weapons

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you're risking like three weapons

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.429 
you're risking like three weapons
already

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439

feel good and that's you can see that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.149 
feel good and that's you can see that
most<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> people<00:01:49.110> are<00:01:49.350> using<00:01:49.500> two-handed
