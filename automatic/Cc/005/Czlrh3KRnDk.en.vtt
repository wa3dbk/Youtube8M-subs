00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
be so easy to colonize Brazil and then

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.320 
be so easy to colonize Brazil and then
up<00:02:49.410> into<00:02:49.560> North<00:02:49.920> America<00:02:49.980> Africa<00:02:50.819> stuff<00:02:51.180> like

up into North America Africa stuff like

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.420 
up into North America Africa stuff like
that<00:02:51.540> that's<00:02:52.140> kind<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.709> easy<00:02:52.950> mode<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.250> do<00:02:53.400> I

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
that that's kind of easy mode I do I

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.280 
that that's kind of easy mode I do I
would<00:02:53.700> have<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.850> deal<00:02:53.970> with<00:02:54.030> Castile<00:02:54.510> but<00:02:55.110> I'm

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
would have to deal with Castile but I'm

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.199 
would have to deal with Castile but I'm
not<00:02:55.440> sure<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.800> would<00:02:55.890> be<00:02:56.010> much<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.310> problem

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
not sure that would be much of a problem

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.080 
not sure that would be much of a problem
once<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.660> start<00:02:57.870> colonizing<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:59.489> Netherlands

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090

has the protection of the HR EO be

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.550 
has the protection of the HR EO be
amazing<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.750> have<00:03:03.900> this<00:03:04.140> because<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.440> can

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
amazing to have this because I can

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.500 
amazing to have this because I can
expand<00:03:04.950> into<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.190> HRA<00:03:05.489> without<00:03:06.060> having<00:03:06.390> to

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
expand into the HRA without having to

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.330 
expand into the HRA without having to
deal<00:03:06.720> with<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.560> Emperor's<00:03:08.010> wrath

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
deal with the Emperor's wrath

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.059 
deal with the Emperor's wrath
essentially<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.690> only<00:03:10.110> real<00:03:10.560> issue<00:03:10.590> with

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
essentially the only real issue with

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.860 
essentially the only real issue with
this<00:03:11.160> location<00:03:11.459> would<00:03:11.790> be<00:03:11.940> probably<00:03:12.300> Burgundy

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
this location would be probably Burgundy

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.320 
this location would be probably Burgundy
France<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.380> England<00:03:13.500> they<00:03:14.489> are<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:15.030> big

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
France and England they are the big

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.780 
France and England they are the big
players<00:03:16.019> in<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.350> area<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.860> might<00:03:17.459> prove

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
players in this area and might prove

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.479 
players in this area and might prove
difficult<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:19.190> option<00:03:20.190> number<00:03:20.280> two<00:03:21.019> has<00:03:22.489> okay

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
difficult and option number two has okay

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.040 
difficult and option number two has okay
so<00:03:23.550> option<00:03:23.760> number<00:03:23.880> two<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.360> actually<00:03:24.600> in<00:03:24.959> a

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
so option number two is actually in a

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.039 
so option number two is actually in a
great<00:03:25.319> location<00:03:25.680> for<00:03:26.480> protection<00:03:27.480> we<00:03:27.900> have

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
great location for protection we have

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.690 
great location for protection we have

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.370 
this huge Peninsula down here that
basically<00:03:30.000> is<00:03:30.360> backed<00:03:30.570> up<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.840> nothing<00:03:31.140> we<00:03:31.260> do

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
basically is backed up to nothing we do

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.720 
basically is backed up to nothing we do
have<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.530> couple<00:03:31.709> islands<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.310> deal<00:03:32.459> with<00:03:32.610> in

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
have a couple islands to deal with in

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.130 
have a couple islands to deal with in
the<00:03:32.790> future<00:03:32.820> but<00:03:33.209> that's<00:03:33.299> that's<00:03:33.630> down<00:03:33.989> the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
the future but that's that's down the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.039 
the future but that's that's down the
road<00:03:34.350> Nataly<00:03:35.100> fine<00:03:35.600> but<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.690> great<00:03:36.870> thing

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
road Nataly fine but the great thing

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.420 
road Nataly fine but the great thing
about<00:03:37.110> this<00:03:37.350> location<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.040> we<00:03:38.280> are

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
about this location is that we are

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.580 
about this location is that we are
Western<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.150> everybody<00:03:39.959> around<00:03:40.170> us<00:03:40.350> is

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
Western and everybody around us is

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.810 
Western and everybody around us is
either<00:03:41.010> Ottoman<00:03:41.670> or<00:03:42.200> Eastern<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:44.340> this<00:03:44.670> would

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
either Ottoman or Eastern so this would

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.220 
either Ottoman or Eastern so this would
be<00:03:44.940> kind<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.239> an<00:03:45.360> interesting<00:03:45.540> start<00:03:45.989> because

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
be kind of an interesting start because

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.960 
be kind of an interesting start because
we'd<00:03:46.380> have<00:03:46.560> an<00:03:46.709> advantage<00:03:46.829> even<00:03:47.549> though<00:03:47.850> the

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
we'd have an advantage even though the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.520 
we'd have an advantage even though the
Ottomans<00:03:48.360> are<00:03:48.570> still<00:03:48.870> pretty<00:03:49.079> big<00:03:49.350> and

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
Ottomans are still pretty big and

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.060 
Ottomans are still pretty big and
powerful

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
powerful

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.190 
powerful
so<00:03:50.310> we'd<00:03:50.730> still<00:03:51.000> have<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.209> contest<00:03:51.630> with<00:03:51.840> huge

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
so we'd still have to contest with huge

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.130 
so we'd still have to contest with huge
Ottoman<00:03:52.620> menace<00:03:52.890> but<00:03:53.730> would<00:03:54.480> be<00:03:54.630> Western<00:03:55.019> as

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
Ottoman menace but would be Western as

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.400 
Ottoman menace but would be Western as
well<00:03:55.320> so<00:03:55.799> we're<00:03:55.920> not<00:03:56.010> as<00:03:56.220> at<00:03:56.519> risk<00:03:56.850> as<00:03:57.410> Serbia

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
well so we're not as at risk as Serbia

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.849 
well so we're not as at risk as Serbia
or<00:03:58.709> valais<00:03:59.370> Kia<00:03:59.609> or<00:03:59.900> Bosnia<00:04:00.900> are<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.739> the

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
or valais Kia or Bosnia are to the

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.770 
or valais Kia or Bosnia are to the
Ottomans<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:02.910> it'd<00:04:03.120> be<00:04:03.209> kind<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.420> interesting

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
Ottomans so it'd be kind of interesting

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.319 
Ottomans so it'd be kind of interesting
as<00:04:03.900> well<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.230> like<00:04:05.220> I<00:04:05.340> said<00:04:05.400> it's<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.880> very<00:04:06.090> very

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
as well I like I said it's a very very

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.140 
as well I like I said it's a very very
interesting<00:04:06.780> location<00:04:07.470> over<00:04:07.650> here<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.519> expand

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
interesting location over here to expand

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.300 
interesting location over here to expand
outward<00:04:09.540> into<00:04:09.690> colonize<00:04:10.230> we'd<00:04:10.440> have<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.890> make

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
outward into colonize we'd have to make

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.940 
outward into colonize we'd have to make
our<00:04:11.489> way<00:04:11.579> along<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.239> northern<00:04:12.720> African<00:04:13.709> coast

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
our way along the northern African coast

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.539 
our way along the northern African coast
and<00:04:14.900> then<00:04:15.900> get<00:04:16.109> out<00:04:16.200> this<00:04:16.350> way<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:17.340> think

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
and then get out this way so I think

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.920 
and then get out this way so I think
that<00:04:17.789> would<00:04:17.880> be<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.970> great<00:04:18.269> little<00:04:18.419> challenge

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
that would be a great little challenge

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.259 
that would be a great little challenge
actually<00:04:19.140> but<00:04:19.739> it's<00:04:20.039> not<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.340> me<00:04:20.459> it's<00:04:21.060> up<00:04:21.150> to

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
actually but it's not to me it's up to

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.969 
actually but it's not to me it's up to
you<00:04:21.359> guys<00:04:21.510> I<00:04:21.810> have<00:04:22.289> three<00:04:22.530> great<00:04:22.740> choices

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
you guys I have three great choices

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.180 
you guys I have three great choices
again<00:04:23.460> Lisbon<00:04:24.450> Athens<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.470> Holland<00:04:25.950> are<00:04:26.039> the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
again Lisbon Athens and Holland are the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.710 
again Lisbon Athens and Holland are the
three<00:04:26.460> capitals<00:04:26.880> you<00:04:26.940> can<00:04:27.090> choose<00:04:27.270> from<00:04:27.450> and

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
three capitals you can choose from and

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.990 
three capitals you can choose from and
that's<00:04:28.650> about<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:28.919> I'm<00:04:29.190> gonna<00:04:29.400> decide<00:04:29.729> the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
that's about it I'm gonna decide the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.839 
that's about it I'm gonna decide the
rest<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.479> these<00:04:30.810> Sol<00:04:31.080> ideas<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:31.979> all<00:04:32.640> that

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
rest of these Sol ideas and all that

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.250 
rest of these Sol ideas and all that
good<00:04:33.060> stuff<00:04:33.120> in<00:04:33.450> here<00:04:33.479> to<00:04:33.750> make<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:33.960> points

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
good stuff in here to make the points

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.330 
good stuff in here to make the points
count<00:04:34.430> one<00:04:35.430> thing<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:35.610> forgot<00:04:35.729> to<00:04:35.909> mention

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
count one thing I forgot to mention

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.970 
count one thing I forgot to mention
actually<00:04:36.610> was<00:04:37.210> why<00:04:37.690> these<00:04:38.199> countries<00:04:38.440> are<00:04:38.860> the

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
actually was why these countries are the

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.370 
actually was why these countries are the
way<00:04:39.070> they<00:04:39.190> are<00:04:39.310> so<00:04:39.880> Lisbon<00:04:40.720> if<00:04:40.960> we<00:04:41.110> take<00:04:41.199> a<00:04:41.260> look

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
way they are so Lisbon if we take a look

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.790 
way they are so Lisbon if we take a look
here<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:43.080> wanted<00:04:44.080> to<00:04:44.169> make<00:04:44.290> sure<00:04:44.440> that<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:44.590> had

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
here I wanted to make sure that I had

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.920 
here I wanted to make sure that I had
roughly<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.490> hundred<00:04:45.940> points<00:04:46.300> dedicated<00:04:46.780> to

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
roughly a hundred points dedicated to

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.620 
roughly a hundred points dedicated to
geography<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:48.340> I<00:04:48.729> have<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.060> hundred<00:04:49.270> points

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
geography so I have a hundred points

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.560 
geography so I have a hundred points
dedicated<00:04:50.020> to<00:04:50.139> just<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.650> provinces<00:04:51.570> that

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
dedicated to just the provinces that

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.560 
dedicated to just the provinces that
that's<00:04:53.080> that's<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:53.919> so<00:04:54.250> that's<00:04:55.000> why<00:04:55.210> this<00:04:55.300> one

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
that's that's it so that's why this one

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.430 
that's that's it so that's why this one
is<00:04:55.600> kind<00:04:56.229> of<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.530> full<00:04:57.040> length<00:04:57.280> of<00:04:58.440> Iberia

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
is kind of the full length of Iberia

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.890 
is kind of the full length of Iberia
here<00:04:59.860> whereas<00:05:00.610> if<00:05:01.360> we<00:05:01.419> take<00:05:01.600> a<00:05:01.660> look<00:05:01.810> at

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
here whereas if we take a look at

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.830 
here whereas if we take a look at
Holland's<00:05:02.550> these<00:05:03.550> provinces<00:05:03.970> are<00:05:04.240> extremely

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
Holland's these provinces are extremely

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.810 
Holland's these provinces are extremely
wealthy<00:05:05.020> over<00:05:05.229> here<00:05:05.500> so<00:05:06.070> I<00:05:06.100> couldn't<00:05:06.699> really

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
wealthy over here so I couldn't really

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.570 
wealthy over here so I couldn't really
take<00:05:07.090> much<00:05:07.330> in<00:05:07.540> fact<00:05:07.750> taking<00:05:08.380> yeah<00:05:09.310> taking

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
take much in fact taking yeah taking

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.450 
take much in fact taking yeah taking
either<00:05:09.880> one<00:05:10.150> of<00:05:10.180> these<00:05:11.130> push<00:05:12.130> it<00:05:12.250> over<00:05:12.430> a

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
either one of these push it over a

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.460 
either one of these push it over a
hundred<00:05:12.520> so<00:05:13.030> my<00:05:13.630> country's<00:05:13.930> gonna<00:05:14.050> be<00:05:14.169> small

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
hundred so my country's gonna be small

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.830 
hundred so my country's gonna be small
over<00:05:14.620> here<00:05:14.800> but<00:05:15.790> we<00:05:16.240> had<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.419> protection<00:05:16.810> of

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
over here but we had the protection of

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.290 
over here but we had the protection of
the<00:05:16.960> HRE<00:05:17.380> which<00:05:17.680> is<00:05:17.860> just<00:05:18.490> like<00:05:18.850> I<00:05:18.970> said<00:05:19.180> before

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
the HRE which is just like I said before

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.200 
the HRE which is just like I said before
it's<00:05:19.630> amazing<00:05:20.229> it<00:05:20.650> really<00:05:20.680> is<00:05:21.220> and<00:05:21.490> of<00:05:22.180> course

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
it's amazing it really is and of course

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.110 
it's amazing it really is and of course
for<00:05:22.720> this<00:05:22.870> location<00:05:23.350> in<00:05:23.500> here<00:05:23.830> we<00:05:24.130> are<00:05:24.160> we<00:05:25.000> only

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
for this location in here we are we only

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.540 
for this location in here we are we only
have<00:05:25.270> 36<00:05:25.690> points<00:05:26.080> dedicated<00:05:26.830> but<00:05:26.979> the<00:05:27.190> reason

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
have 36 points dedicated but the reason

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.969 
have 36 points dedicated but the reason
why<00:05:27.669> it's<00:05:27.820> so<00:05:27.970> little<00:05:28.180> is<00:05:28.389> because<00:05:28.720> these<00:05:29.590> are

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
why it's so little is because these are

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:31.710 
why it's so little is because these are
all<00:05:30.130> eastern<00:05:30.550> provinces<00:05:31.090> they're<00:05:31.479> still

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
all eastern provinces they're still

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.690 
all eastern provinces they're still
pretty<00:05:31.840> good<00:05:32.110> but<00:05:32.410> they're<00:05:33.070> Eastern<00:05:33.460> Promises

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
pretty good but they're Eastern Promises

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.689 
pretty good but they're Eastern Promises
so<00:05:34.150> I<00:05:34.180> could<00:05:34.539> really<00:05:34.780> just<00:05:35.320> expand<00:05:35.979> all<00:05:36.280> over

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
so I could really just expand all over

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.060 
so I could really just expand all over
the<00:05:36.789> place<00:05:36.940> over<00:05:37.120> here<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:37.650> not<00:05:38.650> really<00:05:38.919> hit<00:05:39.010> a

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
the place over here and not really hit a

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.830 
the place over here and not really hit a
hundred<00:05:39.520> but<00:05:40.060> that<00:05:40.180> wouldn't<00:05:40.360> be<00:05:40.419> the<00:05:40.539> fun<00:05:40.720> of

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
hundred but that wouldn't be the fun of

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.200 
hundred but that wouldn't be the fun of
it<00:05:40.900> I<00:05:41.050> mean<00:05:41.169> I<00:05:41.200> want<00:05:41.590> a<00:05:41.770> challenge<00:05:42.460> over<00:05:42.639> here<00:05:43.030> I
