00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.480
 very good to all people I am a machine 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.350
 this is the third chapter of addons a 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.350
 great world to discover 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.039
 in this new chapter we will focus 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.470
 in the category of add ons action bars 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.789
 these addons allow us to change the 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.429
 distribution of our bars 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.410
 action within the game the add-on by 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.109
 excellence in this category is called 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.029
 start from 4 that also appears in the 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.220
 put 10 among the 100 plus addons 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.930
 downloaded in the course dotcom 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.330
 in this video we will learn to configure 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.940
 and use bartender 4 to get the 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.070
 maximum performance 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.110
 but first of all let's clarify the concept 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.280
 of this video that are the fates of the 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.280
 barÃ§a action category 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.040
 the addons of the action bars category 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.570
 they are addons that allow us to change the 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.210
 location of our action bars 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.400
 as well as the bags tab and the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.220
 Bar talents tab options 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.450
 missions characters and so on 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.009
 with these addons we can change 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.500
 totally our action bars 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.729
 change your scale your rotation or even 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.950
 the number of tabs of a bar 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.540
 concrete as I said before the add-on 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.729
 par excellence in this category of 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.560
 addons is the bartender 4 so in 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.810
 this video we will learn to handle it with 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.729
 full fluency if this is the first video 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.289
 you see in this series I advise you 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.030
 keep an eye on the other videos for 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.690
 Learn how to install and download our 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.690
 a2 preferred 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
 when we install they start from 4 and 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.360
 let's enter the game we will find that 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.680
 all our bars are 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.840
 scattered through the center of the 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.820
 screen but do not panic 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.220
 we will open the addon options 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.220
 typing in the chat bar go 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.340
 below and to do it all more 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.370
 easy to disable we have all the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.840
 action bars except bar 1 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.210
 done this we will learn to use 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.920
 each and every one of the options that we 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.940
 bring this addon for each of the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.800
 bars 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.600
 in the general section of bars 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.400
 We found some options that already 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.890
 we found in the general options 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.570
 of the game for example perform two 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.120
 actions when the keys are preferred 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.100
 and not when you stop pressing in addition 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.940
 we found new options how to use 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.890
 breeze vehicle interface 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.690
 when we access the options of a 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.060
 of the 10 bars opens this new 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.070
 category of options we can find 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.560
 four different tabs options 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.740
 general visibility settings 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.750
 of status and positioning in options 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.460
 general we find in the first place the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.370
 option to enable or disable the 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.230
 bar below in the style of 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.350
 bar layout we can change your 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.290
 transparency the scale 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.470
 the spacing between the skills the 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.610
 number of buttons that bar we can 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.220
 zoom in on the skills 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.540
 we can change the number of rows of the 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.310
 bar making the vertical or horizontal 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.090
 and we can add growth 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.890
 vertical up or down 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.590
 besides a horizontal growth of 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.940
 left or right 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.850
 finally the appearance of the buttons 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.950
 we found two interesting options 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.660
 hide the text of the macro so that 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.209
 we have some button that plays a 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.850
 macro and hide the access key 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.070
 rapid 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.410
 The next section is the section of 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.150
 visibility here we can find 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.010
 options to hide our bar in 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.590
 different times or even make it 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.690
 fade for a while if we click 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.310
 in fade our bar we can 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.080
 make that in our bar you are 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.090
 in a minor transparency when not 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.100
 we have a course about it and that 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.970
 increase its opacity when the cursor does 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.970
 that is on her 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.000
 we can also configure the visibility 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.160
 of the bar so that at certain times 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.870
 is hidden for example when 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.640
 we use a vehicle when we are in 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.319
 combat when we have a pet 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.690
 active when we do not have a pet 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.610
 active or even hide the bar when 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.120
 we are in a state or in a way 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.120
 determined 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.360
 tab configuration state 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.730
 we will find some options 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.320
 specific to the warrior simply 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.030
 what the bar does is change the 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.889
 skills page when changing a 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.259
 been to another 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.120
 finally on the positioning tab 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:33.860
 What we can do is change the 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.180
 location of the bar one more way 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.580
 accurate 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.199
 once all this is known my advice to the 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.180
 time to form your own interface 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.520
 bars is that you go enabling each 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.300
 bar one by one and go configuring 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.300
 little by little 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.480
 remember that in order to move your 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.610
 barriers you will need to unlock the 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.960
 also from the add-on itself you have a 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.960
 option to give you the keys 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.389
 Well, everyone, it's easy 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.370

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.020
