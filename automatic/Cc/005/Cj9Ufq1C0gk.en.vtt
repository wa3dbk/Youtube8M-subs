00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.529

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.890

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.230
 half-way since we had 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.520
 halfway through we're going to take the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.410
 seeds 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.410
 and I show you what is next 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.570
 let's take out all the seeds if not 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.420
 they are used to grab it now 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.059
 yes, spicy people can wear gloves 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.720

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.460
 remove we are going to remove them all and already 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.010
 let's go fill with cream cheese the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.170
 two parts and we will wrap you with 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.660
 bacon here I have the refractory where 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.240
 we are going to put it and also I have the 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.940
 350 degree preheated oven 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.680
 fahrenheit good since breaking it and 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.540
 they cleaned it up like I said we're going to 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.090
 put cream cheese my sister is using 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.590
 a knife but they can use with what 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.290
 you better fit a spoon 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.530
 as well 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:29.240
 and here we have the rest 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:32.500
 they left 16 halves or 8 kilos 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.970
 and since the cream cheese is over 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.970
 has bad is rolling 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.229
 and it is very easy and goshawk they do not have 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.940
 we're going to put this hot 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.770
 baked 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.550
 and here we're going to put it in the oven what 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.270
 let's leave 15 to 20 minutes at 350 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.740
 degrees 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.500
 until you see that you are already with 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.230
 people the bacon and we take it out as 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.890
 you can see how they stayed the time that 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.560
 are going to do depends also on your 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.110
 tray is where they will put it as 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.300
 this one is thick because it needs a little more 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.880
 time because it has to warm up ok but 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.819
 if golden with about 20 minutes has 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.840
 but this more or less we left 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:20.560
 30 minutes or so 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.720
 and that's how the 350 left or can go up 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.120
 400 as you want good and here 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.640
 in here we are for you to throw a 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.220
 little to get them to lower a plate and 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.950
 so do not eat all that grace that is 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.709
 see and well it's all I hope so 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.160
