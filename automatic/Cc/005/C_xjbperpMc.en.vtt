almost<00:01:26.100> maintenance-free<00:01:27.140> adjusting<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
almost maintenance-free adjusting it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.109 
almost maintenance-free adjusting it
once<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.680> setup<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.159> first<00:01:29.189> time<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.820> about

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
once it's setup the first time is about

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.679 
once it's setup the first time is about
a<00:01:30.150> 1<00:01:30.390> minute<00:01:30.659> process<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:32.310> battery<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:33.000> good

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
a 1 minute process the battery is good

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.219 
a 1 minute process the battery is good
for<00:01:33.900> 50,000<00:01:34.710> shifts<00:01:35.070> per<00:01:35.100> charge<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:37.020> they

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
for 50,000 shifts per charge so they
