me in trouble with the bio light camp
stove<00:00:17.810> people<00:00:19.030> but<00:00:20.030> I<00:00:20.270> do<00:00:20.330> it<00:00:20.630> so<00:00:20.810> that<00:00:20.960> you

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
that anytime I get a wood stove I like

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.840 
that anytime I get a wood stove I like
to<00:00:28.970> try<00:00:29.150> to<00:00:29.210> use<00:00:29.480> other<00:00:30.280> burning<00:00:31.280> sources

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
to try to use other burning sources

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.169 
to try to use other burning sources
inside<00:00:32.239> other<00:00:32.599> than<00:00:32.870> wood<00:00:33.579> my<00:00:34.579> favorite<00:00:35.059> is

00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:35.179 
inside other than wood my favorite is

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:38.139 
inside other than wood my favorite is
using<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.629> transy<00:00:36.109> a<00:00:36.140> mini<00:00:36.440> burner<00:00:36.710> I<00:00:37.010> use<00:00:37.879> this

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
using a transy a mini burner I use this

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.819 
using a transy a mini burner I use this
and<00:00:38.359> just<00:00:38.629> about<00:00:38.839> every<00:00:39.170> wood<00:00:39.379> stone<00:00:39.620> I've

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
and just about every wood stone I've

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.180 
and just about every wood stone I've
gotten<00:00:40.249> except<00:00:40.940> this<00:00:41.089> one<00:00:41.329> unfortunately<00:00:42.190> it

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
gotten except this one unfortunately it

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.430 
gotten except this one unfortunately it
just<00:00:43.489> doesn't<00:00:43.820> fit<00:00:44.059> inside<00:00:44.239> it's<00:00:44.749> just<00:00:44.839> a<00:00:45.109> wee

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
just doesn't fit inside it's just a wee

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.259 
just doesn't fit inside it's just a wee
bit<00:00:45.620> too<00:00:45.679> big<00:00:46.839> the<00:00:47.839> bio<00:00:48.050> light<00:00:48.320> people<00:00:48.530> say

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
bit too big the bio light people say

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.819 
bit too big the bio light people say
that<00:00:50.269> you're<00:00:50.420> not<00:00:50.539> supposed<00:00:50.690> to<00:00:50.929> use<00:00:51.170> liquid

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
that you're not supposed to use liquid

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.020 
that you're not supposed to use liquid
fuels<00:00:52.159> in<00:00:52.429> this<00:00:52.579> thing

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
fuels in this thing

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.970 
fuels in this thing
I<00:00:53.059> guess<00:00:53.480> because<00:00:53.629> if<00:00:54.109> you're<00:00:54.319> really<00:00:54.499> sloppy

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
I guess because if you're really sloppy

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.610 
I guess because if you're really sloppy
it<00:00:55.190> can<00:00:55.339> get<00:00:55.460> into<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:55.819> electronics<00:00:56.480> but<00:00:57.469> I'd

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
it can get into the electronics but I'd

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.290 
it can get into the electronics but I'd
like<00:00:57.829> to<00:00:58.010> be<00:00:58.129> able<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:58.370> use<00:00:58.609> the<00:00:58.789> wood<00:00:58.999> stove

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
like to be able to use the wood stove

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.169 
like to be able to use the wood stove
without<00:01:00.050> wood<00:01:00.649> in<00:01:01.399> case<00:01:01.699> I'm<00:01:01.850> in<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:01.999> situation

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
without wood in case I'm in a situation

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.370 
without wood in case I'm in a situation
where<00:01:03.280> you<00:01:04.280> get<00:01:04.400> into<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.640> campsite<00:01:05.030> late<00:01:05.510> it's

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
where you get into a campsite late it's

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.400 
where you get into a campsite late it's
been<00:01:06.620> raining<00:01:06.860> whatever<00:01:07.840> or<00:01:08.840> even<00:01:09.170> in<00:01:09.290> this

case<00:01:09.680> being<00:01:10.580> able<00:01:10.760> to<00:01:10.910> use<00:01:11.120> this<00:01:11.300> indoors<00:01:11.750> to

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
case being able to use this indoors to

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.800 
case being able to use this indoors to
generate<00:01:12.740> electricity<00:01:13.480> so<00:01:14.480> what<00:01:14.600> I'm<00:01:14.690> going

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
generate electricity so what I'm going

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.440 
generate electricity so what I'm going
to<00:01:14.900> do<00:01:15.020> today<00:01:15.170> is<00:01:15.730> I'm<00:01:16.730> going<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:16.910> use<00:01:16.970> a<00:01:17.090> small

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
to do today is I'm going to use a small

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.950 
to do today is I'm going to use a small
can<00:01:17.720> of<00:01:17.750> sterno<00:01:18.670> inside<00:01:19.670> this<00:01:19.910> and<00:01:20.150> see<00:01:20.780> just

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
can of sterno inside this and see just

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.630 
can of sterno inside this and see just
what<00:01:21.050> I<00:01:21.200> can<00:01:21.320> do<00:01:21.590> with<00:01:21.770> that<00:01:21.950> if<00:01:22.280> I<00:01:22.460> can

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
what I can do with that if I can

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.270 
what I can do with that if I can
generate<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:24.050> electricity<00:01:24.650> out<00:01:24.920> of<00:01:25.040> this

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
generate the electricity out of this

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.000 
generate the electricity out of this
thing<00:01:26.140> this<00:01:27.140> is<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:27.650> 2.6<00:01:28.490> ounce<00:01:29.330> 47<00:01:30.230> gram<00:01:30.500> can

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
thing this is the 2.6 ounce 47 gram can

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.410 
thing this is the 2.6 ounce 47 gram can
that's<00:01:31.880> supposed<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.300> last<00:01:32.450> about<00:01:32.690> 45<00:01:33.200> minutes

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
that's supposed to last about 45 minutes

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.740 
that's supposed to last about 45 minutes
so<00:01:35.420> that<00:01:35.780> should<00:01:36.230> be<00:01:36.260> handy<00:01:36.680> another<00:01:36.890> thing<00:01:37.160> is

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
so that should be handy another thing is

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.480 
so that should be handy another thing is
if<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:38.930> just<00:01:39.140> put<00:01:39.320> this<00:01:39.470> in<00:01:39.530> it's<00:01:39.830> way<00:01:40.010> too<00:01:40.070> low

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
if I just put this in it's way too low

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.810 
if I just put this in it's way too low
so<00:01:40.910> I<00:01:41.750> wanted<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.050> do<00:01:42.200> is<00:01:42.350> put<00:01:42.620> a<00:01:42.800> cat<00:01:43.550> food

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
so I wanted to do is put a cat food

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.560 
so I wanted to do is put a cat food
cannon<00:01:44.360> first<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:45.860> raise<00:01:46.040> it<00:01:46.370> up<00:01:46.550> raise<00:01:46.880> the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
cannon first to raise it up raise the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.510 
cannon first to raise it up raise the
can<00:01:47.960> up<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.590> flame<00:01:48.830> is<00:01:49.010> closer<00:01:49.310> to

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
can up so that the flame is closer to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.170 
can up so that the flame is closer to
the<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.890> electric<00:01:52.370> probe<00:01:52.610> in<00:01:52.790> here<00:01:52.970> can<00:01:53.150> you

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
the the electric probe in here can you

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.160 
the the electric probe in here can you
see<00:01:53.270> that<00:01:53.540> this<00:01:53.720> length<00:01:53.990> yeah<00:01:54.830> right<00:01:55.220> here

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
see that this length yeah right here

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.620 
see that this length yeah right here
what<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.200> have<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.440> do<00:01:57.590> first<00:01:57.830> is<00:01:58.220> take<00:01:58.630> the

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
what I have to do first is take the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.840 
what I have to do first is take the
generator<00:02:00.140> part<00:02:00.470> off

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.180 

put<00:02:03.480> my<00:02:03.800> lifting<00:02:04.800> can<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.250> there<00:02:06.260> then<00:02:07.260> put<00:02:08.040> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
put my lifting can in there then put the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.790 
put my lifting can in there then put the
sternal<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.119> because<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:10.110> probe<00:02:10.380> gets<00:02:10.590> in

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
sternal can in because the probe gets in

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.290 
sternal can in because the probe gets in
the<00:02:10.890> way<00:02:11.720> put<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.870> down<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.110> there<00:02:14.300> with

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
the way put that down in there with

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.440 
the way put that down in there with
generator<00:02:15.840> back<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:19.760> lower<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.030> leg<00:02:21.240> into

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
generator back on lower the leg into

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.190 
generator back on lower the leg into
place<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.990> holds<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:23.010> generator<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:27.690> over

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
place that holds the generator this over

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.800 
place that holds the generator this over
so<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.770> can<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.070> under<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.610> probe<00:02:29.940> let's

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
so that the can is under the probe let's

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.660 
so that the can is under the probe let's
see<00:02:30.990> if<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:31.380> like<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.830> with<00:02:32.070> my<00:02:32.280> blast

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
see if I can like this with my blast

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:40.460 
see if I can like this with my blast
match<00:02:33.060> I'm<00:02:33.300> not<00:02:33.330> sure<00:02:39.050> might<00:02:40.050> be<00:02:40.230> just<00:02:40.410> a

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
match I'm not sure might be just a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.760 
match I'm not sure might be just a
little<00:02:40.530> bit<00:02:40.740> too<00:02:41.400> far<00:02:41.670> away<00:02:42.890> yeah<00:02:45.530> use<00:02:46.530> my

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
little bit too far away yeah use my

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:55.729 
little bit too far away yeah use my
torch<00:02:48.980> okay<00:02:50.010> that's<00:02:50.430> lit<00:02:54.320> now<00:02:55.320> we'll<00:02:55.530> just

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
torch okay that's lit now we'll just

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.130 
torch okay that's lit now we'll just
wait<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.010> see<00:02:56.220> how<00:02:56.520> long<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.910> takes<00:02:57.150> for<00:02:58.050> the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
wait and see how long it takes for the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.850 
wait and see how long it takes for the
power<00:02:58.320> light<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.739> come<00:02:58.890> on<00:02:58.950> oh<00:02:59.340> I<00:03:00.150> need<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.480> fan

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
power light to come on oh I need the fan

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.009 
power light to come on oh I need the fan
guess<00:03:01.860> that's<00:03:02.100> on<00:03:03.110> turn<00:03:04.110> on<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.410> fan<00:03:06.019> it's

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
guess that's on turn on the fan it's

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.960 
guess that's on turn on the fan it's
making<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.470> flames<00:03:07.739> go<00:03:08.040> around<00:03:08.310> in<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.519> circle

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
making the flames go around in a circle

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.290 
making the flames go around in a circle
hopefully<00:03:09.900> it'll<00:03:10.050> still<00:03:10.290> touch<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.680> probe

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
hopefully it'll still touch the probe

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.360 
hopefully it'll still touch the probe
but<00:03:12.300> we're<00:03:12.480> now<00:03:12.570> at<00:03:12.720> 22<00:03:13.019> seconds<00:03:13.590> let's<00:03:14.220> see

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
but we're now at 22 seconds let's see

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.550 
but we're now at 22 seconds let's see
how<00:03:14.489> long<00:03:14.640> it<00:03:14.820> takes<00:03:15.060> for<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.630> light<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.380> come

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
how long it takes for the light to come

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.920 
how long it takes for the light to come
on<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.130> then<00:03:17.250> I'll<00:03:17.400> try<00:03:18.000> plugging<00:03:18.269> some<00:03:18.660> stuff

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
on and then I'll try plugging some stuff

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:42.600 
on and then I'll try plugging some stuff
in

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.090 

okay<00:03:43.180> we're<00:03:43.360> at<00:03:43.450> about<00:03:43.690> three<00:03:44.110> minutes<00:03:44.320> it

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
okay we're at about three minutes it

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
okay we're at about three minutes it
went<00:03:45.430> off<00:03:45.700> for<00:03:46.060> some<00:03:46.270> reason<00:03:46.660> I<00:03:47.910> don't<00:03:48.910> know<00:03:49.030> if

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
went off for some reason I don't know if

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.520 
went off for some reason I don't know if
my<00:03:49.270> battery's<00:03:49.690> dying<00:03:49.930> or<00:03:50.170> if<00:03:50.230> there's<00:03:50.410> an

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
my battery's dying or if there's an

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.940 
my battery's dying or if there's an
automatic<00:03:51.070> shutoff<00:03:52.200> on<00:03:53.200> this<00:03:53.470> if<00:03:53.620> it's<00:03:53.770> not

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
automatic shutoff on this if it's not

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.410 
automatic shutoff on this if it's not
getting<00:03:54.160> hot<00:03:54.370> enough<00:03:54.430> apparently

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
getting hot enough apparently

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.630 
getting hot enough apparently
like<00:03:56.140> I<00:03:56.230> said<00:03:56.350> we're<00:03:56.590> three<00:03:56.890> minutes<00:03:57.190> into

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
like I said we're three minutes into

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.680 
like I said we're three minutes into
this

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
this

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.310 
this
I<00:03:59.940> guess<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.060> stirrer<00:04:01.300> knows<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.840> flame<00:04:02.080> from

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
I guess the stirrer knows the flame from

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.680 
I guess the stirrer knows the flame from
the<00:04:02.410> sterno<00:04:02.680> is<00:04:02.800> going<00:04:03.040> around<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.490> round<00:04:03.690> but

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
the sterno is going around and round but

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.330 
the sterno is going around and round but
it<00:04:04.780> must<00:04:04.960> not<00:04:05.020> be<00:04:05.260> hitting<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.650> probe<00:04:05.920> quite

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
it must not be hitting the probe quite

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.830 
it must not be hitting the probe quite
right<00:04:06.670> and<00:04:08.310> after<00:04:09.310> three<00:04:09.760> minutes<00:04:10.060> this<00:04:10.390> shut

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
right and after three minutes this shut

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.960 
right and after three minutes this shut
off<00:04:11.110> on<00:04:11.380> its<00:04:11.560> own<00:04:13.530> hmm<00:04:14.590> let<00:04:15.400> me<00:04:15.490> let<00:04:15.640> this<00:04:15.760> go

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
off on its own hmm let me let this go

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:30.950 
off on its own hmm let me let this go
for<00:04:16.000> a<00:04:16.180> little<00:04:16.359> longer<00:04:16.570> and<00:04:16.690> see<00:04:16.810> what<00:04:17.109> happens

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.159 

okay<00:04:31.960> here<00:04:32.259> we<00:04:32.379> are<00:04:32.410> on<00:04:32.849> 545<00:04:33.849> and<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.780> motors

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
okay here we are on 545 and the motors

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.999 
okay here we are on 545 and the motors
turned<00:04:35.470> off<00:04:35.620> again<00:04:36.039> the<00:04:36.639> fan<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:37.979> have<00:04:38.979> a

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
turned off again the fan I have a

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.550 
turned off again the fan I have a
feeling<00:04:39.490> that's<00:04:39.639> just<00:04:40.060> this<00:04:40.599> can<00:04:40.900> just<00:04:41.199> isn't

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
feeling that's just this can just isn't

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.040 
feeling that's just this can just isn't
hot<00:04:41.680> enough<00:04:41.970> here's<00:04:42.970> some<00:04:43.180> video<00:04:43.360> of<00:04:43.780> what<00:04:43.960> it

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
hot enough here's some video of what it

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:52.860 
hot enough here's some video of what it
looks<00:04:44.289> like<00:04:44.849> down<00:04:45.849> in<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.509> burn<00:04:47.379> chamber<00:04:51.870> now

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
looks like down in the burn chamber now

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.990 
looks like down in the burn chamber now
you<00:04:52.930> can<00:04:53.139> see<00:04:53.349> it<00:04:53.440> doesn't<00:04:53.740> look<00:04:53.860> like<00:04:54.000> the

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
you can see it doesn't look like the

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.110 
you can see it doesn't look like the
flames<00:04:55.419> are<00:04:55.659> really<00:04:55.930> hitting<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.229> probe<00:04:57.120> so

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
flames are really hitting the probe so

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.510 
flames are really hitting the probe so
I'm<00:04:58.240> going<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:58.539> take<00:04:58.690> this<00:04:58.870> as<00:04:59.080> a<00:04:59.110> fail<00:04:59.470> maybe<00:05:00.430> I

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
I'm going to take this as a fail maybe I

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.100 
I'm going to take this as a fail maybe I
have<00:05:00.729> to<00:05:00.879> lift<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.210> can<00:05:01.479> up<00:05:01.659> a<00:05:01.750> little<00:05:01.960> bit

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
have to lift the can up a little bit

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.800 
have to lift the can up a little bit
higher<00:05:02.349> to<00:05:03.159> put<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.550> probe<00:05:03.789> right<00:05:04.180> over<00:05:04.630> top

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
higher to put the probe right over top

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.029 
higher to put the probe right over top
of<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:05.110> can<00:05:06.990> but<00:05:07.990> I<00:05:08.020> have<00:05:08.259> a<00:05:08.440> feeling<00:05:08.919> it's

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
of the can but I have a feeling it's

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.089 
of the can but I have a feeling it's
just<00:05:09.130> not<00:05:09.430> hot<00:05:09.699> enough<00:05:09.729> what<00:05:10.599> I<00:05:10.630> could<00:05:10.930> do<00:05:11.110> and

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
just not hot enough what I could do and

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.670 
just not hot enough what I could do and
this<00:05:12.250> will<00:05:12.430> really<00:05:12.729> bug<00:05:13.720> the<00:05:14.050> bio<00:05:14.380> light

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
this will really bug the bio light

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.450 
this will really bug the bio light
people<00:05:14.949> is<00:05:15.280> try<00:05:16.180> my<00:05:16.449> where<00:05:16.990> I<00:05:17.020> refill<00:05:17.650> the

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
people is try my where I refill the

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.850 
people is try my where I refill the
startled<00:05:18.909> can<00:05:19.150> with<00:05:19.449> perlite<00:05:19.990> and<00:05:20.229> use

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
startled can with perlite and use

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.550 
startled can with perlite and use
alcohol<00:05:21.430> with<00:05:21.639> that<00:05:21.880> I<00:05:22.210> seem<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:23.139> get<00:05:23.229> a<00:05:23.289> bigger

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
alcohol with that I seem to get a bigger

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.689 
alcohol with that I seem to get a bigger
a<00:05:24.509> larger<00:05:25.509> hotter<00:05:25.810> flame<00:05:26.139> that<00:05:26.530> way<00:05:26.800> maybe

a larger hotter flame that way maybe

a larger hotter flame that way maybe

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
that would be enough but just the

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:33.659 
that would be enough but just the
sternal<00:05:30.310> can<00:05:30.520> at<00:05:30.699> this<00:05:30.849> height<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:32.710> can<00:05:33.520> that

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
sternal can at this height the can that

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
I used for lifting was about an inch and

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.490 
I used for lifting was about an inch and
a<00:05:35.770> half<00:05:35.800> tall<00:05:36.370> I<00:05:37.050> thought<00:05:38.050> that<00:05:38.199> would<00:05:38.319> bring

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
a half tall I thought that would bring

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.790 
a half tall I thought that would bring
it<00:05:38.590> up<00:05:38.680> high<00:05:38.860> enough<00:05:38.889> but<00:05:39.310> apparently<00:05:39.909> not<00:05:40.120> so

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
it up high enough but apparently not so

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.279 
it up high enough but apparently not so
