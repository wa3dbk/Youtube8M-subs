exactly what we're going to do here but
see<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.430> panel<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.850> was<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.060> looking<00:00:18.420> at

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
see that panel I was just looking at

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.870 
see that panel I was just looking at
with<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> white<00:00:19.830> rectangle<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.670> that's

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
with a white rectangle on it that's

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.580 
with a white rectangle on it that's
where<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.240> battery<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.050> there's

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
where the battery is and there's

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.150 
where the battery is and there's
interaction<00:00:23.310> between<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.689> screen<00:00:25.680> with

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
interaction between this screen with

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.490 
interaction between this screen with
bubby<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.140> panel<00:00:28.140> now<00:00:28.260> if<00:00:28.349> you're

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
bubby on it and that panel now if you're

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.859 
bubby on it and that panel now if you're
doing<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.859> solo<00:00:29.160> I'm<00:00:29.490> pretty<00:00:29.730> sure<00:00:29.970> if<00:00:30.240> you

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
doing it solo I'm pretty sure if you

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.220 
doing it solo I'm pretty sure if you
just<00:00:31.140> hit<00:00:31.349> X<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.759> panel<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.600> come<00:00:34.110> over

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
just hit X on that panel and come over

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.110 
just hit X on that panel and come over
here<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.680> hit<00:00:34.829> X<00:00:35.040> they're<00:00:35.579> really<00:00:36.000> really

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
here and hit X they're really really

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.139 
here and hit X they're really really
quickly<00:00:36.450> solo<00:00:37.079> then<00:00:37.380> you'll<00:00:37.559> get<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.579> don't

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
quickly solo then you'll get it I don't

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.869 
quickly solo then you'll get it I don't
think<00:00:39.270> that's<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> way<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.920> on

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
think that's the way you do it on

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.310 
think that's the way you do it on
multiplayer<00:00:42.540> lift<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.960> you're<00:00:43.079> playing

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
to get hyper to come over and help me

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.729 
to get hyper to come over and help me
with<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.079> could<00:00:49.289> coordinate

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
with this so that we could coordinate
