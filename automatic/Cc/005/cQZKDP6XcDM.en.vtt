00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
right very simply on the record you have

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.400 
right very simply on the record you have
a<00:02:12.019> sticker<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:14.209> sticker<00:02:14.810> tells<00:02:15.200> where

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
a sticker and that sticker tells where

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.320 
a sticker and that sticker tells where
the<00:02:15.440> sound<00:02:15.800> is<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.280> lot<00:02:16.670> people<00:02:16.850> ask<00:02:17.060> have<00:02:17.300> you

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
the sound is a lot people ask have you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.100 
the sound is a lot people ask have you
know<00:02:17.540> where<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.780> is

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
know where it is

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.590 
know where it is
so<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.620> put<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:19.069> spot<00:02:19.580> on<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.730> you're<00:02:20.030> right

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
so you put a spot on that you're right

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:34.830 
so you put a spot on that you're right
everything<00:02:21.200> starts<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:21.709> point<00:02:22.269> so<00:02:23.920> baby

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:54.199 

fades<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:46.070> I'm<00:02:46.160> using<00:02:46.310> two<00:02:46.549> hands

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.410 

very<00:02:54.870> good<00:02:55.049> very<00:02:55.230> good<00:02:55.760> this<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.849> a<00:02:56.879> transform

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
very good very good this is a transform

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.319 
very good very good this is a transform
of<00:02:57.540> scratch<00:02:57.859> so<00:02:58.859> you<00:02:58.920> push<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.670> record<00:02:59.819> slowly

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
of scratch so you push the record slowly

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.399 
of scratch so you push the record slowly
with<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.659> hand

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.990 

alright<00:03:04.409> floors<00:03:04.620> all<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.829> way<00:03:04.920> back<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.430> then

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
alright floors all the way back and then

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.300
