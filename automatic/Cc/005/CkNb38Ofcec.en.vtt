00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.380
 He is good 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.670
 Hello everyone is the net this time trying to polish up when I was last time frontal from now 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.890
 I think it 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.010
 Since my heart was broken by hand, 50 this time 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.400
 Prozac 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:30.550
 Car polisher electric polisher deluxe 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:37.430
 A professional of polish is also convinced with the speed adjustment function and the content is attached with the polisher of this body 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:43.310
 Such as a wrench for adjustment with the sponge one instruction manual comes with how to use it and press the trigger 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:50.620
 Raise and press 1 on the right to press the trigger, this is normal 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.620
 It is a normal rotation and pressing these 2 buttons and turning the back dial 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:00.670
 You can adjust the speed so high rotation so it has heat when turned too much 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:07.330
 When compounding please turn at low speed if possible 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.260
 And for the fine and finish of the liquid compound which is prepared separately when polishing this time 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.110
 It is a compound 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:17.120
 Specifics and Shi will continue to polish with this genuine sponge 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.480
 We will finish using this because it is a dedicated sponge for finishing 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:25.520
 And since the foundation of the painting has been passed gritty little 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:28.170
 Continue to the very first work with the specifics type of Han'neri this cloth polisher cover 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.180
 I think so let's work 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.180
 Tell me red before life 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:42.520
 Currently painted surfaces we become this way 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.520
 It can not be said that it is beautiful. 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:51.200
 In order to have views skin has become like a polished clarity 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:56.210
 Right I want to polish from the left stallion as it is 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:00.670
 After cleaning the painted surface first before polishing, the water resistant paper 1500 to 2000 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.670
 We will continue to Fortunately the surface in 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:09.970
 The standard for polishing paper is until the whole becomes white 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.720
 It is said that the place like April this year is not even because the file has not arrived on the island that I did 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.120
 It is 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:20.380
 This I think is under the process it can be seen that has become white evenly is complete 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.620
 You can make good children by scraping so that there are no tools 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:28.110
 At first it is attached to the polisher 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:33.690
 Since the use of the semi-kneaded compound in Kitsuki you put the sponge has been covered with this 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:36.980
 At first I will apply this semi-mixing compound to a part of the body 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.980
 A little 4 a 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:53.410
 I did this by only polishing with my current half sister 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:57.060
 The semi-mixing type is now over, and it is a compound that I want to continue taking a cover . 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.060
 Put the encouraging details 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:18.730
 You will receive it once the fine root is over 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.940
 Currently this is the finish of the polisher's liquid detail 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.390
 It is easy to understand if you look around here 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.390
 Moving place 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:35.500
 At the end of the session in the middle session switch to the sponge for finishing 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.500
 And we will finish the final finishing compound in the same way. 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.879
 Over over that too fell 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.410
 ï½°ï½°ï½°which was finished in the feeling entered 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:22.970
 It 's hard to understand in the image, so it's amazing to use the climate as well 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:27.920
 If you did all painting etc. by your own, it will be very beautiful in the current procedure 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.150
 Also comes with sponge floor finish sponge and a fine compound and finish compound 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.010
 If enough 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.830
 I think Astro's electric polisher was very easy to use 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.670
 It is a strong person who is not, if there is this 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.090
 Then everyone nets or enjoy 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.090
 Ha ha ha ha
