00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.319
 2 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.380
 he 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.350
 all that makes it usually 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.250
 In Paris we did a little bit 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.160
 always it's always rewarding 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.240
 because in addition we are in a region 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.970
 from France where people know us 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.220
 therefore less necessarily that proposes all 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.020
 charente comes but we play tonight 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.730
 the place which in addition is enough 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.550
 legendary mythical palace hotel layout 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.360
 of city it is hyper 1 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.360
 it's acute 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.620
 he 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.620
 m 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.100
 so cool to find each other 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.810
 on a beautiful scene like that in full 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.810
 of people in the sun than at heat 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:22.939
 self care 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.700
 it's a room that's really 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.890
 already loaded in history is super beautiful 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.320
 what's the hello not the same way if we 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.520
 plays on an outdoor stage and there on 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.530
 this scene we want to play 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.799
 something rather pieces 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.799
 more intimate 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.750
 is 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.520
 we can not 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.990
 possible 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.270
 this is his charm to play 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.270
 the afternoon or even in the early evening 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.430
 but something 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.140
 pleasant more direct perhaps with 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.340
 the public because suddenly there are the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.070
 light effects it's are a lot 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.070
 less powerful and its different 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.750
 even the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.750
 we 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.750
 6 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.070
 christine and queens it's a project 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.570
 electro pop and who in concert takes 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.410
 several forms sometimes it's these 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.850
 plastics 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.680
 there in this case will not be 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.160
 completely alone here I 'll be 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.160
 with dancers 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.250
 I do not 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.080
 especially clays 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.970
 any 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.080
 Hello 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.050
 the pana my ridiculous name of this ghost to 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.340
 particles 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.290
 these rules is really nice 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.490
 to come here to do my concert at 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.620
 the interior of the city hall 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.940
 it's a lot more intimate for me than 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.430
 to go play with someone obviously 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.290
 after I am the sum of all that 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.200
 way so so sincere thing in one case 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.640
 than in the other but there I am more I 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.640
 tell who I am 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
 Ghoga 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.880
 it's been a while since I'm 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.470
 away from home and that I'm in 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.970
 good tour it's going well 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.100
 not happy to make the scene in 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.420
 time there we are in Paris here in the 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.420
 live fnac frame 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.790
 Yes 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.790
 me 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.790
 and 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.330
 we played several times in Paris and there 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.010
 this is our last date in paris 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.600
 really we started in a whole 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.570
 small there was actually paris ago 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.340
 four years old called club and there 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.750
 had I do not know maybe a 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.650
 twenty people and there tonight we 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.820
 will play in front of thousands of people 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.650
 so he's also proud to play 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.830
 in this on this place and without 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.830
 rights 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.730
 Yes 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.509
 offset 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.509
 The test-subject 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.950
 is that 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.710
 m 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.310
 hyper fia and yeah we're not proud of 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.960
 play at home and we did it we did 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.280
 once done we come every year to 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.500
 because we often have friends who 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.300
 play know very well the festival and 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.880
 we played once three years ago in 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.960
 three years but this afternoon we had 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.570
 does a pretty bad gigs 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.570
 besides, we will do better
