bit<00:02:03.540> easier<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.079> way<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.829> what<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.130> want<00:02:05.280> to

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
bit easier this way so what you want to

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.590 
bit easier this way so what you want to
make<00:02:05.460> sure<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.729> do<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.000> when<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.240> first<00:02:06.270> grab

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
make sure to do is when you first grab

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.699 
make sure to do is when you first grab
it<00:02:06.869> grab<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.770> by<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.009> corners<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.330> pips

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
it grab it by the corners with the pips

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.190 
it grab it by the corners with the pips
all<00:02:10.709> right<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.910> what<00:02:12.209> does<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.720> slow<00:02:12.959> motion

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
all right so what does in slow motion

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.770 
all right so what does in slow motion
you're<00:02:13.560> just

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
you're just

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.180 
you're just
going<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:13.990> shake<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.380> hide<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.650> movement

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
going to shake it to hide the movement

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.360 
going to shake it to hide the movement
you're<00:02:15.790> going<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.060> take<00:02:16.240> your<00:02:16.360> index<00:02:16.540> finger

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
you're going to take your index finger

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.000 
you're going to take your index finger
touch<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.640> edge<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:19.030> this<00:02:19.150> card<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:20.010> flip

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
touch the edge of this card and flip

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.640 
touch the edge of this card and flip
both<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.550> them<00:02:21.730> over<00:02:22.080> now<00:02:23.080> when<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.319> do<00:02:23.470> this

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
both of them over now when you do this

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.320 
both of them over now when you do this
it's<00:02:24.069> good<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.430> keep<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.670> little<00:02:24.819> bend<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.209> the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
it's good to keep a little bend in the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.730 
it's good to keep a little bend in the
card<00:02:25.569> so<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:25.840> way<00:02:26.080> they<00:02:26.260> don't<00:02:26.290> come<00:02:26.620> apart

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
card so that way they don't come apart

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.160 
card so that way they don't come apart
because<00:02:27.640> if<00:02:27.819> you<00:02:28.000> um<00:02:28.240> if<00:02:28.569> you<00:02:28.630> just<00:02:28.840> hold<00:02:29.020> them

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
because if you um if you just hold them

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.080 
because if you um if you just hold them
kind<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.470> loosely<00:02:29.770> whereas<00:02:30.550> if<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.730> bend<00:02:30.970> them

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
kind of loosely whereas if you bend them

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.640 
kind of loosely whereas if you bend them
it'll<00:02:31.420> help<00:02:31.569> them<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.870> Snug<00:02:32.110> together<00:02:32.410> and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
it'll help them to Snug together and

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.630 
it'll help them to Snug together and
look<00:02:33.100> more<00:02:33.280> like<00:02:33.430> one<00:02:33.580> card<00:02:34.200> shake<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:36.160> get

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
look more like one card shake and I get

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.570 
look more like one card shake and I get
them<00:02:36.760> in<00:02:36.850> position<00:02:37.030> with<00:02:37.420> my<00:02:37.600> ring<00:02:37.989> finger

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
them in position with my ring finger

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.520 
them in position with my ring finger
shake<00:02:40.350> spin<00:02:42.510> show<00:02:43.510> them<00:02:43.750> this<00:02:43.870> card<00:02:44.110> for<00:02:44.350> just

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
shake spin show them this card for just

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.890 
shake spin show them this card for just
a<00:02:44.620> little<00:02:44.770> bit<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.300> then<00:02:46.300> spin<00:02:47.760> again<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.870> just

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
a little bit and then spin again so just

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.170 
a little bit and then spin again so just
practice<00:02:50.170> this<00:02:50.560> figure<00:02:51.400> out<00:02:51.459> how<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.730> works

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
practice this figure out how it works

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.150 
practice this figure out how it works
um<00:02:52.239> this<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:52.930> sort<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.260> go<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.470> color<00:02:53.830> change

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
um this is sort of a go to color change

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.550 
um this is sort of a go to color change
because<00:02:54.600> as<00:02:55.600> long<00:02:55.750> as<00:02:55.840> people<00:02:56.080> don't<00:02:56.230> figure

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
because as long as people don't figure

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.940 
because as long as people don't figure
out<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:58.080> polygon<00:02:59.080> is<00:02:59.200> changing<00:02:59.739> then

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
out that the polygon is changing then

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.830 
out that the polygon is changing then
they<00:03:00.160> probably<00:03:00.430> won't<00:03:00.670> figure<00:03:00.970> out<00:03:01.150> that

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
they probably won't figure out that

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.350 
they probably won't figure out that
change<00:03:02.140> at<00:03:02.350> all<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.950> it's<00:03:03.370> nice<00:03:03.519> to<00:03:03.730> do<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.269> any

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
change at all and it's nice to do it any

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.900 
change at all and it's nice to do it any
kind<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.780> Mirage<00:03:05.110> fashion<00:03:05.860> where<00:03:06.069> they<00:03:06.250> only

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
kind of a Mirage fashion where they only

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.850 
kind of a Mirage fashion where they only
see<00:03:07.360> their<00:03:07.510> card<00:03:07.780> for<00:03:07.959> just<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.260> split<00:03:08.380> second

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
see their card for just a split second

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.740 
see their card for just a split second
after<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:09.819> is<00:03:09.940> all<00:03:10.060> done<00:03:10.239> what<00:03:10.420> you're<00:03:10.540> going

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
after this is all done what you're going

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.990 
after this is all done what you're going
to<00:03:10.780> do<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.050> take<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.350> double<00:03:11.700> hold<00:03:12.700> it<00:03:12.850> like

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
to do is take the double hold it like

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.550 
to do is take the double hold it like
this<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.720> you're<00:03:13.959> going<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.140> show<00:03:14.350> them<00:03:14.530> that

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
this and you're going to show them that

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.470 
this and you're going to show them that
the<00:03:14.769> top<00:03:14.980> card<00:03:15.310> isn't<00:03:16.269> their<00:03:16.569> card<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:18.480> put
