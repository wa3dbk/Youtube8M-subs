00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.390
 so people welcome to this 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.180
 video clearly shows you which one 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.460
 Sports you can theoretical one 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.619
 core without it brings disadvantages 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.429
 with the weight training if you are so far up 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.050
 we'll go to the stage now 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.720
 or if you are ambitious 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.170
 have fun with this video and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.140
 my school became 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.300
 about the boat his tip yes and indeed how 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.900
 already announced I will yes the 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.120
 Produce other videos so far 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.420
 yes, because we just do not have the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.739
 possibility is created permanently 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.260
 how to do that regularly and 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.360
 That's why I have to do more, of course 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.070
 before plan and in this video I have 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.320
 already announced I would like to talk about 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.710
 synergetic sports are the same 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.470
 Sports is the martial arts 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.080
 connect very well be that 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.460
 opportunities they now have 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.180
 we naturally from the thing 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.610
 consider 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.650
 depending on which goals you personally 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.019
 on the way wants to have 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.770
 Of course it makes sense the more you do 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.850
 you want to achieve strength is you 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.320
 less can by naturally 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.080
 Focus on other athletes 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.619
 that means all that overflow exciting 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.770
 Of course it will be harder to take 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.810
 massive the stronger you naturally in the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.780
 Strength training that means then you have to 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.159
 very small very small costa in which 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.600
 goal you want to have on the 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.359
 ambitions want that 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.539
 Whole nature run or that yes me 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.570
 tell me he is happy variant 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:42.340
 where, of course, the potential 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.530
 inexhaustible depending on the running and 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.560
 Sport is he such a story that is 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.859
 Of course, in the factor when you do that 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.049
 very very regular and operates 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.460
 Marathon moderate or half marathon running 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.429
 I would consider that very counterproductive 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.020
 then just go there 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.799
 getting the glycogen stores complete 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.299
 be emptied 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.249
 and you just can not be potential 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.060
 can exhaust because simply the 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:08.550
 just the stress 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.350
 Muscles the natural 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.070
 also from the kind of load we have 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.900
 power was sent to ropal 18 area and he 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.930
 his running sport depending on how long 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.870
 you move in which intensity 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.599
 to reach 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.019
 Of course you can rather so top area 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.299
 So that's the factor he over so 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.920
 the glycogen storage goes at one 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.730
 powerful this first of the investment goals 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.610
 So all that is over intensive 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.959
 intensive burden goes out 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.349
 for example, the emptying of the creative 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.290
 phosphate spokesman and that is why loud 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.390
 he sports so I say counterproductive 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.700
 sport if you complete that, of course 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.790
 made with the powerful for example 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.290
 Dismantling of naturally testing memory 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.329
 of course to the fat reserves too 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.489
 then get caught that if ever 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:01.959
 after training with operations after the 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:04.650
 So Haiti was really hit short 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.659
 load peaks three to four minutes 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.629
 short interval training 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.989
 that definitely makes sense then good 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.920
 other sports but now 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.810
 synergetic with weight training 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.790
 It's something like that , for example 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.670
 typical as kleenex so all that 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.150
 over-the- ground exercise exercises goes into 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.450
 that with your own body yes I say 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.040
 Otherwise , organizing is for me 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.400
 choleric element exercises that is 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.049
 all that is on the barren what 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.160
 Of course at the same time means over 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.220
 your own body weight 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.410
 Of course that is very good 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.590
 You can do that synergistically 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.530
 with the powerful connect with 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.120
 swim old regenerative exercise would 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.880
 I also tend to look at it like that 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.170
 martial arts 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.660
 Running this really just as a supplement 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.460
 that can be done by you, for example 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.000
 like Mars or of course after that 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.000
 Weight training easy rules 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.720
 Regenerative swimming makes it that way 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.370
 means you make 200 rheinbahn and 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.140
 otherwise, of course, must be weight training if 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.670
 the goals hate the stage is always 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.330
 so on, following that is, the 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.130
 nutrition must be optimized so far 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.570
 Of course, the training must be either in 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.060
 form of speed training or if you are 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.420
 just at the beginning is about 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.460
 basic exercises and whole-body training 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.910
 otherwise I have so far the athletes 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.960
 So called gymnastics exercises. Football 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.600
 The facility may be disappointed 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.000
 but of course this is a sport where the 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.220
 injury is tablecloth and 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.910
 just about the burden of the knee 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.010
 is the feet 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.260
 Of course, the legs are of course one 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.900
 very factors over and over again 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.730
 difficult everything about the run 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.810
 studying and that just counts football 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.390
 of course, of course, this is the 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.160
 really the earth area always with 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.500
 almost though, of course, rather over 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.080
 but as a sprint goes by that 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.870
 the duration of the game is 90 minutes in the 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.090
 rule yes then I would 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.100
 already achieve in this area 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.050
 I liked it again 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.120
 case michael scheeren comment 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.860
 which athletes do you still operate next to? 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.030
 What are your experiences? 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.190
 also just what does you good which 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.930
 sports or exercises now sometimes 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.940
 regardless of the sport there is 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.800
 of course, the beach sports themselves 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.680
 I have developed about martial arts 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.500
 call it cross functional 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.840
 of course, quite another 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.820
 Target form you have with it very good 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.970
 experience likes write it in the 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.970
