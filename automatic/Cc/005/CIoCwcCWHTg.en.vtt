00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.140
 hi hello I am a Christian vignali e 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.889
 we are today in the company of glenda 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.080
 left-handed female graduate student 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.650
 in criminology sciences at 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.390
 the university of the eagle he did 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.900
 a degree thesis from which he published 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.970
 a very interesting book on 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.519
 gender violence and in particular 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.250
 of women's violence towards 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.279
 men hello great tell us a little about the 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.469
 your book 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.629
 what inspired you to write with 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:43.530
 statistics then you published the thesis 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.199
 in fact it is born in a casual way in 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.449
 my interest was originally a study 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.449
 of men's violence against women 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:54.870
 only later after reading 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.089
 some international studies in which yes 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.979
 registers domestic violence trips in 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.559
 greater percentage of women on 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.010
 men I decided to change perspective 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.000
 Libya 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.130
 I then did a survey 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.170
 I put it online because one is missing 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.980
 any bibliography in italy 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.160
 official study on the subject 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.690
 and I waited to have the answers one 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.830
 Once the answers have been given to me 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.920
 I realize that indeed it is possible 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.750
 say that man can be a victim of 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.750
 violence by a woman both in 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.260
 economic economic psychological terms 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.240
 physical and sexual like 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.730
 had with regards to violence 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.400
 physics 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.110
 unlike what is thought to present 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.010
 features revealed practically 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.140
 Never were the kicks and punches slaps in 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.500
 some cases are also used 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.670
 weapons with knives or shepherd while for 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.560
 regarding psychological violence 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.509
 this 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.200
 further up, however, it leaves no traces 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:05.490
 the humiliation of blackmail mediation 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.110
 especially when there are rooms and 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.090
 especially in the separation phase e 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.739
 divorce this psychological violence yes 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.200
 they transform the so-called soft 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.360
 judicial what it consists of 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.940
 exactly even with economic implications 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.340
 in this way in judgment the world of 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.470
 judiciary is basically a 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.090
 bombing for ready as well as the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.340
 defines vincenzo spallone that the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.709
 president of the parents gel separated from the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.080
 children or use in a manner 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.239
 instrumental complaints and lawsuits 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.980
 if you can create real damage 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.019
 psychological and economic because 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.310
 obviously the judicial route includes 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.260
 also of the costs on the partner and it is not 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.880
 this is proved by the super advice 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.730
 of the judiciary that tells us in 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.599
 substance for one hundred complaints and lawsuits 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.160
 they are almost fast food and 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.150
 they end with the application with a 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.680
 place to proceed 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.910
 most of us don't 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.980
 concern persecutory acts 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.900
 family abuse of 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.790
 consequently we cannot say that the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.410
 fish complaint is an act of 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.480
 violence but when use becomes 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.300
 the consequences that are instrumental 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.500
 they get are between mother because a man 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.110
 who is accused of harassing 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.390
 your children anyway whatever 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.640
 rest of the complaint his dignity of 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.190
 father man comes out completely 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.700
 destroyed a've told us that we are the 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.880
 your book 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.560
 we have also activated from the meat 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.910
 so how is it like you are there? 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.800
 made to write this book as well 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.800
 self-financed as is known 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.239
 no 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.239
 18 my book was financed 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.040
 I certainly didn't expect this 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.180
 success something publisher and who has 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.150
 discovered as written did not have us 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.319
 promote yourself as a writer 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.549
 that got me promoting no I got myself 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.569
 I made contact with the publishing house 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:02.349
 at the booksprint and I decided through them 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.689
 precisely to publish the thesis that 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:11.620
 the last question 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:11.620
 2 what do you think of the new law on 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.459
 draft law 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.740
 I delay the decree under friends 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.030
 that in reality is born more out of interest 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.259
 political because actually interested in 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.129
 really protect the woman 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.719
 first of all because it is inserted 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:35.719
 within a security package 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.949
 and it is treated, but me, a billion others 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.380
 minds and above all as the subject of 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:47.190
 social alarm when in reality it is not 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.460
 so because it represents 0 0 6 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.669
 percent 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.789
 total deaths women in Italy as like 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:58.370
 cause of death consider it one of the 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.560
 first causes but according to you this law 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.270
 could even come to violate 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.030
 the legal equality of all 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.400
 subjects before the law could 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.039
 have an instrumental use is not 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.389
 instrumental that surely 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.599
 unconstitutional surely because it goes to 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.759
 violate article 3 of the constitution 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.930
 affirms the equality of the citizens of 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.539
 before the law 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:24.560
 the moment I say that 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:27.689
 the murder of a woman who has one 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.909
 intimate relationship with your partner 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:32.549
 deserves a higher penalty than 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:35.129
 that of respect to the murder of a 

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:38.159
 man from his partner or one 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:39.989
 woman killed by a violet stranger su 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.839
 I am committing a legal principle 

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:45.239
 by marcelo then the last question 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:47.729
 regards the Lazio which is not what 

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:50.639
 think of the outgoing tourism that comes 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.829
 commonly referred to as I kill crises 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.729
 I think that any form of thinking that 

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:58.409
 reaches an extremism she was wrong 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.989
 as well as the machismo so these 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.939
 mini smo express because it leads to losing 

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:05.599
 a certain objectivity in total i 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:05.599
 problems 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.069
 focus on not wanting anymore 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:13.099
 feel too much partisanship then 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:16.940
 according to unfortunately children zagaria is that 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:20.449
 if feminism is good as long as you do 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:23.330
 claims the equality to withdraw into so many 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:26.560
 in cash life environments do not 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.240
 reaches affective parity 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.860
 but when it becomes wanting to affirm the 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.800
 supremacy of one sex respect 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.870
 then the other was lost as well 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.590
 which was the fundamental objective of the 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.740
 terrorism 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:42.980
 you who think you are a girl too 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.920
 beautiful girl and we wanted that then there is 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:48.740
 what do you want to say to your peers? 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.730
 for the future what many should do 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.680
 boys 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.560
 many girls point do not do models 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.600
 instead you wanted to do what life is like 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.620
 wanted to write a book is wanted to do 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.840
 something 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.210
 let's say that 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.590
 many young people are not a thing what you want 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.590
 tell them to your peers 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.020
 then in reality I could not 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.180
 writing about my victim in life is 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.900
 become a criminologist of ours races 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.440
 strange spending in this 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:18.050
 is what I advise is not to believe 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.759
 always the most obvious truth of 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.680
 find the desire above all to put 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:26.300
 in discussion I question 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:29.720
 then I discuss everything we say 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:33.020
 even more ambitious than life to many 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.270
 young at the same time go wrong 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.160
 possibility there is a difficult farmer 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:41.229
 to have ambitions however not 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.229
 stop dreaming and greet someone 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.900
 we thank you brenta ciao
