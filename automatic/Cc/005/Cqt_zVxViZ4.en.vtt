straightaway<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.659> guessing<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.049> as

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
straightaway so I'm guessing that as

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.660 
straightaway so I'm guessing that as
long<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.380> your<00:01:55.560> wireless<00:01:55.829> connection<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.430> set

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
long as your wireless connection is set

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.810 
long as your wireless connection is set
correctly<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.689> should<00:01:57.719> work<00:01:58.110> straight<00:01:58.500> away

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
correctly it should work straight away

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.270 
correctly it should work straight away
if<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.210> move<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> faders<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.350> your<00:02:01.500> touch<00:02:01.770> OSC

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
if you move the faders on your touch OSC

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.940 
if you move the faders on your touch OSC
up<00:02:02.369> hopefully<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:03.719> any<00:02:03.899> look<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.740> see

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
up hopefully with any look you can see

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.869 
up hopefully with any look you can see
the<00:02:05.070> faders<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.790> ls9<00:02:06.329> moving<00:02:07.160> -<00:02:08.160> good<00:02:08.759> luck

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
the faders on the ls9 moving - good luck

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.590 
the faders on the ls9 moving - good luck
with<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.060> guys<00:02:09.360> I'll<00:02:09.899> see<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.229> next<00:02:10.289> time
