previously the last few years they had a
Facebook<00:00:17.730> group<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.779> would<00:00:18.900> link<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> set

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
Facebook group that would link to a set

the<00:00:28.050> high<00:00:28.170> school<00:00:28.470> obviously<00:00:29.429> eventually

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the high school obviously eventually

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.720 
the high school obviously eventually
people<00:00:30.960> had<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> big<00:00:31.320> problem<00:00:31.560> with<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.859> which

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
people had a big problem with that which

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.590 
people had a big problem with that which
will<00:00:32.880> give<00:00:32.910> them<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.300> different<00:00:33.390> reasons

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
will give them to the different reasons

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.600 
will give them to the different reasons
for<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.620> now<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.860> Facebook<00:00:35.460> group

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
for that and so now the Facebook group

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.220 
for that and so now the Facebook group
no<00:00:35.790> longer<00:00:35.820> links<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> voting<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.020> can

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
no longer links to the voting you can

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.740 
no longer links to the voting you can
find<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> voting<00:00:38.100> online<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:39.090> now<00:00:39.300> they<00:00:39.570> have

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
find the voting online but now they have

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.270 
find the voting online but now they have
no<00:00:39.989> idea<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.469> who<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.649> administering<00:00:40.920> it

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
no idea of who is administering it

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.680 
no idea of who is administering it
because<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.640> group<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.090> Facebook<00:00:42.540> isn't

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
because the group on Facebook isn't

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.569 
because the group on Facebook isn't
doing<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:43.950> gone<00:00:44.070> kind<00:00:44.399> of

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
doing it and so it's gone kind of

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.100 
doing it and so it's gone kind of
anonymous<00:00:45.210> actually<00:00:45.629> which<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.899> sort<00:00:46.050> of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
anonymous actually which is sort of

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.950 
anonymous actually which is sort of
weird<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.030> imagine<00:00:48.030> you're<00:00:48.360> not<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.629> fan<00:00:48.930> of
