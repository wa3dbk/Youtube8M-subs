we'll<00:02:13.640> see<00:02:13.849> about<00:02:14.060> as<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.390> rat<00:02:14.630> is<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.290> do

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
we'll see about as a rat is that I do

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.500 
we'll see about as a rat is that I do
believe<00:02:15.800> he<00:02:16.040> plays<00:02:16.310> very<00:02:16.520> much<00:02:16.760> like<00:02:16.940> Lavezzi

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
believe he plays very much like Lavezzi

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.960 
believe he plays very much like Lavezzi
from<00:02:18.050> Napoli<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.680> five<00:02:18.890> stars<00:02:19.190> killer<00:02:19.430> but<00:02:19.730> he

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
from Napoli the five stars killer but he

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.479 
from Napoli the five stars killer but he
is<00:02:20.060> much<00:02:20.300> more<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.599> a<00:02:20.930> cheaper<00:02:21.410> option<00:02:21.620> at<00:02:22.280> nine

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
is much more of a cheaper option at nine

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.580 
is much more of a cheaper option at nine
hundred<00:02:22.849> coins<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.420> last<00:02:23.660> because<00:02:23.989> just<00:02:24.530> the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
hundred coins and last because just the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.229 
hundred coins and last because just the
way<00:02:24.680> he<00:02:24.830> moves<00:02:24.860> he's<00:02:25.340> got<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.610> pace<00:02:25.849> and<00:02:26.120> he's

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
way he moves he's got the pace and he's

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.180 
way he moves he's got the pace and he's
got<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.480> dribbling<00:02:26.810> as<00:02:26.930> well<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.170> think<00:02:27.290> it's<00:02:28.130> a

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
got the dribbling as well I think it's a

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.760 
got the dribbling as well I think it's a
rat<00:02:28.400> is<00:02:28.610> 89<00:02:29.090> pace<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.690> 87<00:02:30.260> dribbling<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.709> i

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
rat is 89 pace and 87 dribbling and i

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.090 
rat is 89 pace and 87 dribbling and i
think<00:02:31.069> i<00:02:31.310> think<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.030> vets<00:02:32.239> is<00:02:32.420> like<00:02:32.620> 91<00:02:33.620> pace

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
think i think the vets is like 91 pace

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.890 
think i think the vets is like 91 pace
and<00:02:34.400> 87<00:02:35.090> dribbling<00:02:35.390> or<00:02:35.480> something<00:02:35.720> like<00:02:35.840> that

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
and 87 dribbling or something like that

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.320 
and 87 dribbling or something like that
so<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.800> very<00:02:36.980> similar<00:02:37.370> with<00:02:37.610> others<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.150> rat

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
so the very similar with others the rat

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.390 
so the very similar with others the rat
is<00:02:38.569> only<00:02:38.930> four<00:02:39.530> star<00:02:39.709> skill<00:02:39.950> moves<00:02:40.130> but<00:02:40.250> what<00:02:40.370> I

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
is only four star skill moves but what I

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.830 
is only four star skill moves but what I
do<00:02:40.489> like<00:02:40.730> about<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.180> right<00:02:41.360> is<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.599> fact<00:02:41.780> that

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
do like about the right is the fact that

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.350 
do like about the right is the fact that
he<00:02:42.050> can<00:02:42.319> smash<00:02:43.310> him<00:02:43.489> in<00:02:43.640> from<00:02:43.850> rings<00:02:44.060> why<00:02:44.330> I

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
he can smash him in from rings why I

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.820 
he can smash him in from rings why I
think<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.600> clip<00:02:44.900> be<00:02:45.019> here<00:02:45.170> he<00:02:45.230> just<00:02:45.260> spins<00:02:45.680> at

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
think this clip be here he just spins at

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.009 
think this clip be here he just spins at
how<00:02:45.920> return<00:02:46.360> smashes<00:02:47.360> into<00:02:47.480> something<00:02:47.959> quite

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
how return smashes into something quite

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.680 
how return smashes into something quite
a<00:02:48.110> really<00:02:48.440> nice<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.860> we're<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.970> easy<00:02:50.269> player

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
a really nice and we're the easy player

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.900 
a really nice and we're the easy player
