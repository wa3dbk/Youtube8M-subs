to appear that there are no ways to stop
this<00:01:58.159> could<00:01:58.460> click<00:01:58.850> on<00:01:59.030> this<00:01:59.330> you<00:02:00.050> can't<00:02:00.290> stop

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
this could click on this you can't stop

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.140 
this could click on this you can't stop
it<00:02:00.860> but<00:02:01.070> here's<00:02:01.370> a<00:02:01.430> little<00:02:01.640> trick<00:02:01.970> that<00:02:02.000> I

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
it but here's a little trick that I

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.300 
it but here's a little trick that I
found<00:02:02.479> that<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.930> can<00:02:03.080> launch<00:02:03.320> s<00:02:03.620> voice<00:02:03.950> again

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
found that you can launch s voice again

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.820 
found that you can launch s voice again
and<00:02:05.080> you'll<00:02:06.080> get<00:02:06.229> this<00:02:06.409> error<00:02:06.740> message

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
and you'll get this error message

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.060 
and you'll get this error message
however<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:08.540> saves<00:02:09.049> the<00:02:09.320> memo<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:09.950> are

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
however it saves the memo that you are

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.890 
however it saves the memo that you are
recording<00:02:10.459> so<00:02:10.729> it's<00:02:10.880> kind<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.299> way<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.510> stop

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
recording so it's kind of a way to stop

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.530 
recording so it's kind of a way to stop
it<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.290> here's<00:02:13.100> a<00:02:13.160> third<00:02:13.459> way<00:02:13.670> incorporating

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
it and here's a third way incorporating

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.479 
it and here's a third way incorporating
the<00:02:14.750> tips<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.170> tricks<00:02:15.290> video<00:02:15.739> that<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:15.980> did<00:02:16.280> on

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
the tips and tricks video that I did on

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:25.500 
the tips and tricks video that I did on
episode<00:02:17.030> 31<00:02:19.030> open<00:02:20.030> google<00:02:20.540> voice<00:02:20.690> search

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:33.520 

note<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.810> self<00:02:26.840> by<00:02:27.650> bookshelf<00:02:32.140> ok<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.410> can

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
note to self by bookshelf ok and you can

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.229 
note to self by bookshelf ok and you can
see<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.070> works<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.580> little<00:02:34.700> differently

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
see that it works a little differently

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.690 
see that it works a little differently
it's<00:02:35.450> using<00:02:35.900> Google<00:02:36.320> now<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.280> let's<00:02:37.489> take<00:02:37.670> a

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
it's using Google now so let's take a

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.979 
it's using Google now so let's take a
look<00:02:37.970> at<00:02:38.120> what<00:02:38.269> you<00:02:38.390> get<00:02:38.540> with<00:02:38.750> that

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
look at what you get with that

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.100 
look at what you get with that

account just email yourself you could

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.059 
account just email yourself you could
see<00:02:43.940> that<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.330> has<00:02:44.480> typed<00:02:44.780> out<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.349> words<00:02:45.740> that

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069

button<00:03:00.420> controller<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.110> believe<00:03:01.590> it's<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.830> paid

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
button controller I believe it's a paid

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.160 
button controller I believe it's a paid
app<00:03:02.250> but<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.060> could<00:03:03.180> program<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.780> do<00:03:03.930> this

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
app but you could program it to do this

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.810 
app but you could program it to do this
I've<00:03:04.410> programmed<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.430> when<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.670> do<00:03:05.790> a

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
I've programmed it so that when you do a

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.350 
I've programmed it so that when you do a
quadruple<00:03:06.480> click<00:03:07.640> it<00:03:08.640> turns<00:03:08.910> off<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.210> screen

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
quadruple click it turns off the screen

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.990 
quadruple click it turns off the screen
