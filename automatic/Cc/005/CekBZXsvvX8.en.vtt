00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.290 

the<00:00:04.560> collectivization<00:00:05.220> we<00:00:05.730> usually<00:00:06.090> have<00:00:06.269> one

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:06.300 
the collectivization we usually have one

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.990 
the collectivization we usually have one
point<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.930> contact<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.680> we<00:00:08.340> can<00:00:08.519> do<00:00:08.639> different

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
point of contact and we can do different

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.669 
point of contact and we can do different
things<00:00:09.030> with<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.480> point<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.110> contact<00:00:10.530> and

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
things with that point of contact and

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.240 
things with that point of contact and
for<00:00:11.010> now<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.160> would<00:00:11.490> like<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.700> focus<00:00:12.030> on<00:00:12.950> how<00:00:13.950> is

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
for now I would like to focus on how is

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.290 
for now I would like to focus on how is
it<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:15.269> roll<00:00:15.930> the<00:00:16.349> point<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.830> contact<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.609> you

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
it to roll the point of contact so you

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.359 
it to roll the point of contact so you
could<00:00:18.570> start<00:00:18.869> just<00:00:19.850> taking<00:00:20.850> your<00:00:21.000> foot<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
could start just taking your foot and

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.769 
could start just taking your foot and
rolling<00:00:23.369> your<00:00:23.520> foot<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:23.940> the<00:00:24.150> floor<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
rolling your foot on the floor and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.130 
rolling your foot on the floor and
exploring<00:00:25.440> how<00:00:25.910> you<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.150> roll<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.720> different

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
exploring how you can roll to different

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:40.520 
exploring how you can roll to different
surfaces<00:00:28.350> of<00:00:28.859> your<00:00:29.010> foot<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.850> floor

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.069 

and<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.250> next<00:00:41.460> thing<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:44.309> idea<00:00:44.640> of

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
and the next thing is the idea of

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.670 
and the next thing is the idea of
sliding<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.210> start<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.780> explore<00:00:49.079> how

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
sliding so you can start to explore how

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.729 
sliding so you can start to explore how
is<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.370> slide<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.660> surface<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.320> your<00:00:52.469> foot

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
is it to slide the surface of your foot

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.360 
is it to slide the surface of your foot
over<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.550> floor<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:55.019> try<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:56.100> sole

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
over the floor and you can try the sole

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.329 
over the floor and you can try the sole
of<00:00:56.519> your<00:00:56.550> foot<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.510> side<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.960> your<00:00:58.079> foot<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
of your foot the side of your foot the

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.500 
of your foot the side of your foot the
top<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.729> your<00:00:59.909> foot<00:01:00.089> to<00:01:00.960> slide<00:01:01.229> the<00:01:01.409> toes

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
top of your foot to slide the toes

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.280 
top of your foot to slide the toes
sliding<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.259> floor<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:07.680> next<00:01:07.710> thing<00:01:08.220> is

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
sliding on the floor the next thing is

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.800 
sliding on the floor the next thing is
to<00:01:10.290> pivot<00:01:10.759> pivot<00:01:11.759> at<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> point<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.570> contact

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
to pivot pivot at the point of contact

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.139 
to pivot pivot at the point of contact
which<00:01:13.229> means<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.399> have<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.789> point<00:01:15.000> of

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
which means that you have one point of

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.090 
which means that you have one point of
contact<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.840> pivot<00:01:16.700> so<00:01:17.700> how<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.179> you

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
contact and you pivot so how can you

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.389 
contact and you pivot so how can you
pivot<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:21.149> point<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.570> contact<00:01:22.250> with<00:01:23.250> your

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
pivot the point of contact with your

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.570 
pivot the point of contact with your
foot<00:01:24.350> try<00:01:25.350> different<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.009> try<00:01:26.250> out<00:01:26.399> two

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
foot try different and try out two

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.359 
foot try different and try out two
different<00:01:27.350> different<00:01:28.350> parts<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.979> your<00:01:29.159> foot

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
different different parts of your foot

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.210 
different different parts of your foot
so<00:01:30.119> maybe<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.600> pivot<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:31.979> heel<00:01:32.190> of

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
so maybe you pivot on the on the heel of

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.430 
so maybe you pivot on the on the heel of
your<00:01:32.399> foot<00:01:32.700> how<00:01:33.240> was<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.539> to<00:01:33.659> pivot<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:34.050> foot

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
your foot how was it to pivot your foot

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.279 
your foot how was it to pivot your foot
on<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.670> year<00:01:35.909> how<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.600> pivot<00:01:36.810> your<00:01:37.050> foot

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
on the ball of the foot the next thing

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.060 
on the ball of the foot the next thing
is<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.329> push<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:46.500> push<00:01:48.560> against<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> point<00:01:49.920> of

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
is to push to push against the point of

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.950 
is to push to push against the point of
contact<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:52.640> we<00:01:53.640> try<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> roll<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.630> point

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
contact so and we try to roll the point

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.920 
contact so and we try to roll the point
of<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.939> basis

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930

trick now so if you it could be their
side<00:03:10.760> so<00:03:12.850> angry<00:03:13.850> up<00:03:14.150> when<00:03:14.390> I'm<00:03:14.540> off<00:03:14.720> like<00:03:14.930> my

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
side so angry up when I'm off like my

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.700 
side so angry up when I'm off like my
leg<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:16.430> that<00:03:16.460> usually<00:03:16.760> has<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.210> place<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.660> go<00:03:18.080> so

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
leg so that usually has a place to go so

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.610 
leg so that usually has a place to go so
I'm<00:03:18.860> going<00:03:19.820> a<00:03:20.030> bit<00:03:20.180> there<00:03:20.450> use<00:03:21.050> me<00:03:21.260> I'm<00:03:21.410> not

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
I'm going a bit there use me I'm not

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.410 
I'm going a bit there use me I'm not
standing<00:03:21.890> anymore<00:03:22.310> like<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.880> because<00:03:23.240> then

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
standing anymore like that because then

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.910 
standing anymore like that because then
it's<00:03:23.570> really<00:03:23.750> difficult<00:03:24.020> for<00:03:24.320> me<00:03:24.470> they<00:03:24.680> it's

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
it's really difficult for me they it's

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:35.240 
it's really difficult for me they it's
like<00:03:25.510> then<00:03:26.510> she<00:03:26.720> just

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.730 

I'm<00:03:35.790> offering<00:03:36.090> service<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.110> I'm<00:03:37.200> there<00:03:37.470> and

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
I'm offering service and I'm there and

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.990 
I'm offering service and I'm there and
I'm<00:03:37.860> there<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.340> there<00:03:38.550> yeah<00:03:39.330> there<00:03:40.230> we<00:03:40.380> go

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
I'm there and there yeah there we go

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:57.790 
I'm there and there yeah there we go
nice<00:03:42.000> with<00:03:53.120> it

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.970 

pivoting<00:03:58.800> this<00:03:59.459> is<00:03:59.610> pivoting<00:04:00.150> also<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:01.020> little

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
pivoting this is pivoting also a little

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.650 
pivoting this is pivoting also a little
bit<00:04:02.070> more<00:04:02.280> light<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:02.730> cut<00:04:03.000> it<00:04:03.209> that<00:04:03.360> also

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
bit more light to cut it that also

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.020 
bit more light to cut it that also
exists<00:04:04.200> it's<00:04:04.440> fitting<00:04:04.890> in<00:04:05.100> so<00:04:05.550> we<00:04:05.700> don't<00:04:05.910> meet

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
exists it's fitting in so we don't meet

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.220 
exists it's fitting in so we don't meet
always<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:07.520> use<00:04:08.520> a<00:04:08.550> lot<00:04:08.820> of<00:04:08.850> weight<00:04:09.230> this

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
always to use a lot of weight this

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.690 
always to use a lot of weight this
interesting<00:04:10.770> also<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.160> have<00:04:11.310> different

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
interesting also to have different

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.000 
interesting also to have different
surfaces<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.750> pivot<00:04:12.959> on<00:04:13.230> here<00:04:13.560> for<00:04:13.739> example

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
surfaces to pivot on here for example

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.130 
surfaces to pivot on here for example
there's<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.459> phone<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:15.480> can<00:04:15.690> really<00:04:15.959> feel

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
there's the phone you can really feel

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.370 
there's the phone you can really feel
the<00:04:16.640> bone<00:04:20.269> usually<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.690> contact<00:04:22.079> we<00:04:22.230> are

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
the bone usually the contact we are

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.070 
the bone usually the contact we are
unique<00:04:22.770> we're<00:04:23.520> not<00:04:23.730> really<00:04:23.970> pushing<00:04:24.300> back

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
unique we're not really pushing back

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.620 
unique we're not really pushing back
pushing<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.710> one<00:04:25.919> part<00:04:26.220> in<00:04:26.430> one<00:04:26.610> option<00:04:27.060> so<00:04:27.600> I

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
pushing is one part in one option so I

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.600 
pushing is one part in one option so I
can<00:04:27.720> push<00:04:28.230> in<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.620> point<00:04:28.919> of<00:04:29.070> contact<00:04:29.460> and

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
can push in to the point of contact and

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.110 
can push in to the point of contact and
either<00:04:29.910> here<00:04:30.150> she<00:04:30.810> can<00:04:31.050> resist<00:04:31.290> the<00:04:31.860> bush<00:04:32.120> or

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
either here she can resist the bush or

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.630 
either here she can resist the bush or
she<00:04:33.360> can<00:04:33.600> let<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.990> end<00:04:34.290> of<00:04:34.500> it<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:34.919> we<00:04:35.430> would

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
she can let the end of it so we would

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.600 
she can let the end of it so we would
move<00:04:35.850> through<00:04:36.630> space<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.350> then<00:04:38.160> she<00:04:38.370> can<00:04:38.580> come

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
move through space and then she can come

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.650 
move through space and then she can come
and<00:04:38.880> push<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:40.169> I<00:04:40.440> can<00:04:40.880> follow<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.120> bush<00:04:42.390> or<00:04:42.630> a

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
and push and I can follow the bush or a

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.890 
and push and I can follow the bush or a
resist<00:04:43.140> approach<00:04:43.760> we<00:04:44.760> won't<00:04:44.940> start<00:04:45.300> that<00:04:45.660> it's

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
resist approach we won't start that it's

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.560 
resist approach we won't start that it's
just<00:04:46.460> working<00:04:47.460> with<00:04:47.640> that<00:04:47.790> principle<00:04:48.150> of

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
just working with that principle of

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.240 
just working with that principle of
pushing<00:04:49.169> resisting<00:04:49.979> and<00:04:51.890> surrendering<00:04:52.890> to

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
pushing resisting and surrendering to

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.670 
pushing resisting and surrendering to
the<00:04:53.280> bush<00:04:54.260> thank<00:04:55.260> you<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.500> direction<00:04:57.440> so<00:04:58.440> very

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
the bush thank you the direction so very

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.400 
the bush thank you the direction so very
simple<00:04:59.190> version<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.820> try<00:05:00.090> that<00:05:00.390> it's<00:05:00.630> it<00:05:01.020> you

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
simple version to try that it's it you

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.670 
simple version to try that it's it you
just<00:05:01.650> back<00:05:01.979> to<00:05:02.010> back<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:03.120> you<00:05:03.990> decide<00:05:04.380> about<00:05:04.530> a

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
just back to back and you decide about a

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.610 
just back to back and you decide about a
row<00:05:05.010> one<00:05:05.700> person<00:05:06.180> is<00:05:06.300> pushing<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.500> other

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
row one person is pushing and the other

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:19.190 
row one person is pushing and the other
person<00:05:08.040> is<00:05:08.130> resisting<00:05:08.820> giving<00:05:16.669> back<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:18.810> it

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
person is resisting giving back and it

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:48.090 
person is resisting giving back and it
might<00:05:23.870> change

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:06:10.830 

in<00:05:53.290> my<00:05:54.290> head

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.200 

it's<00:06:11.350> like<00:06:12.300> pushing<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:13.900> pushing

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
it's like pushing and pushing

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.820 
it's like pushing and pushing
I'm<00:06:16.210> pushing<00:06:16.540> it<00:06:16.810> to<00:06:16.930> the<00:06:16.960> floor<00:06:17.350> in<00:06:17.590> my<00:06:17.710> hand

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
I'm pushing it to the floor in my hand

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.200 
I'm pushing it to the floor in my hand
normally<00:06:20.830> we<00:06:21.010> are<00:06:21.130> making<00:06:21.370> a<00:06:21.610> lot<00:06:21.790> of<00:06:21.820> things

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
normally we are making a lot of things

00:06:22.210 --> 00:07:05.129 
normally we are making a lot of things
at<00:06:22.360> the<00:06:22.389> same<00:06:22.690> time<00:06:23.160> that's<00:06:24.160> nothing
