00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.920 
actually use this card to summon a Cylon
base<00:05:02.900> star<00:05:03.229> now<00:05:04.190> which<00:05:04.669> will<00:05:04.940> eliminate<00:05:05.570> all

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
base star now which will eliminate all

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.330 
base star now which will eliminate all
your<00:05:06.110> opponents<00:05:06.650> and<00:05:06.800> give<00:05:06.919> you<00:05:07.010> maximum

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
magnificent addition to the game so I

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.610 
magnificent addition to the game so I
think<00:05:17.090> that's<00:05:17.479> covered<00:05:18.140> all<00:05:18.229> the<00:05:18.320> points<00:05:18.590> but

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
think that's covered all the points but

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.610 
think that's covered all the points but
there<00:05:18.919> may<00:05:19.130> be<00:05:19.160> some<00:05:19.430> rules<00:05:19.669> that<00:05:19.760> I've<00:05:19.970> missed

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
there may be some rules that I've missed

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.080 
there may be some rules that I've missed
