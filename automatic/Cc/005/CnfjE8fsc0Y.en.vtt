you can see I'm up here quit ways but uh

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.780 
you can see I'm up here quit ways but uh
there's<00:00:58.019> my<00:00:58.229> general<00:00:58.860> path<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.519> I<00:00:59.580> made

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
there's my general path that I made

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.490 
there's my general path that I made
clear<00:01:00.360> and<00:01:00.479> debris<00:01:00.720> out<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.869> the<00:01:01.019> way<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.199> wind

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
clear and debris out of the way to wind

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.490 
clear and debris out of the way to wind
in<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:01.949> through<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.309> thick<00:01:02.610> scrub<00:01:03.500> that

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
in here through this thick scrub that

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.640 
in here through this thick scrub that
are<00:01:04.650> swamped<00:01:05.040> from<00:01:05.940> here<00:01:06.299> all<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.290> way<00:01:07.470> around

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
are swamped from here all the way around

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.700 
are swamped from here all the way around
to<00:01:08.220> back<00:01:08.760> there<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.570> I'm<00:01:09.630> trying<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.439> my

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
to back there now I'm trying to get my

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.679 
to back there now I'm trying to get my
way<00:01:10.890> through<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.430> very<00:01:11.700> thick<00:01:12.119> scrub<00:01:12.390> which

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
way through this very thick scrub which

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.630 
way through this very thick scrub which
is<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:13.350> i<00:01:13.380> would<00:01:13.530> call<00:01:13.680> virgin<00:01:14.250> hunting

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
is what i would call virgin hunting

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.789 
is what i would call virgin hunting
grounds<00:01:15.030> because<00:01:15.750> no<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:16.110> hunts<00:01:16.320> back<00:01:16.530> here

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
grounds because no one hunts back here

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.399 
grounds because no one hunts back here
and<00:01:16.979> there's<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> reason<00:01:17.540> even<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> deer<00:01:18.990> find

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and there's a reason even the deer find

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.780 
and there's a reason even the deer find
it<00:01:19.530> very<00:01:19.619> difficult<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.430> back<00:01:20.580> through

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
it very difficult to get back through

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.160 
it very difficult to get back through
here<00:01:20.909> because<00:01:21.180> there's<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.509> much<00:01:21.630> debris<00:01:21.960> on

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
here because there's so much debris on

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.889 
here because there's so much debris on
the<00:01:22.200> ground<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:23.490> i'm<00:01:23.609> clearing<00:01:23.939> debris<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
the ground but i'm clearing debris and

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.380 
the ground but i'm clearing debris and
making<00:01:25.140> away<00:01:25.320> from<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.649> swap<00:01:26.000> back<00:01:27.000> through

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
making away from the swap back through

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.099 
making away from the swap back through
to<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.659> other<00:01:27.689> swamp<00:01:28.310> which<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.490> behind<00:01:29.789> me

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
to the other swamp which is behind me

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.899 
to the other swamp which is behind me
quite<00:01:31.109> aways<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:32.219> one<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.460> my<00:01:32.520> tricks<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
quite aways it's one of my tricks to

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.380 
quite aways it's one of my tricks to
keeping<00:01:33.240> people<00:01:33.420> from<00:01:33.990> finding<00:01:34.380> my<00:01:35.390> stand

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
keeping people from finding my stand

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.929 
keeping people from finding my stand
area<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.899> in<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.499> very<00:01:37.710> thick<00:01:38.159> scrub<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.729> come

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
area is in this very thick scrub I come

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.260 
area is in this very thick scrub I come
through<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.450> wind<00:01:40.020> through<00:01:40.469> in<00:01:40.820> a<00:01:41.820> barely

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
through I wind through in a barely

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.679 
through I wind through in a barely
visible<00:01:42.299> path<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.469> find<00:01:44.119> okay<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.600> at

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
visible path that I can find okay and at

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.209 
visible path that I can find okay and at
some<00:01:45.749> point<00:01:46.109> I<00:01:46.200> keep<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.560> straight<00:01:46.859> towards

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
some point I keep it straight towards

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.700 
some point I keep it straight towards
large<00:01:47.520> landmarks<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.509> big<00:01:48.810> tree<00:01:49.079> so

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
large landmarks like a big tree so

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.289 
large landmarks like a big tree so
people<00:01:49.890> see<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.549> see<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.880> open

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
people see that and I see this open

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.510 
people see that and I see this open
space<00:01:51.509> towards<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.590> what<00:01:53.249> they<00:01:53.399> don't

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
space towards that what they don't

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.209 
space towards that what they don't
realize<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.240> I've<00:01:54.390> branched<00:01:55.170> off<00:01:55.649> into<00:01:55.950> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
realize is that I've branched off into a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.359 
realize is that I've branched off into a
different<00:01:56.579> direction<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.179> left<00:01:58.109> this

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
different direction and left this

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.620 
different direction and left this
continuing<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.579> then<00:01:59.670> branching<00:02:00.119> into<00:02:00.299> two

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
continuing and then branching into two

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.739 
continuing and then branching into two
main<00:02:01.399> directions<00:02:02.399> out<00:02:02.639> that<00:02:02.880> way<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.509> seems

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:03.749 
main directions out that way so it seems

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:05.179 
main directions out that way so it seems
like<00:02:03.929> the<00:02:04.109> trail<00:02:04.530> supposed<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.889> go<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.039> way

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
like the trail supposed to go that way

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.210 
like the trail supposed to go that way
but<00:02:05.840> behind<00:02:06.840> them<00:02:07.049> without<00:02:07.409> them<00:02:07.740> being<00:02:07.859> able

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
but behind them without them being able

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.090 
but behind them without them being able
to<00:02:08.280> see<00:02:08.490> it<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.940> branches<00:02:09.330> back<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.720> way<00:02:10.100> into

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
to see it it branches back this way into

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.030 
to see it it branches back this way into
a<00:02:11.130> barely<00:02:11.730> visible<00:02:11.760> trail<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:13.410> leads<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.860> my

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
a barely visible trail that leads to my

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.180 
a barely visible trail that leads to my
stand<00:02:14.990> well<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.230> doubt<00:02:16.440> anyone's<00:02:17.010> going<00:02:17.130> to

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
stand well I doubt anyone's going to

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.860 
stand well I doubt anyone's going to
come<00:02:17.370> out<00:02:17.400> here<00:02:17.520> but<00:02:17.880> if<00:02:18.150> they<00:02:18.330> do<00:02:18.390> find<00:02:18.510> my

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
come out here but if they do find my

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.870 
come out here but if they do find my
main<00:02:19.080> trail<00:02:20.540> perhaps<00:02:21.540> they<00:02:21.720> won't<00:02:21.840> find<00:02:22.880> my

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
main trail perhaps they won't find my

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.309 
main trail perhaps they won't find my
stand<00:02:24.209> because<00:02:24.390> they'll<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:24.900> follow<00:02:25.080> this

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
stand because they'll just follow this

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.200 
stand because they'll just follow this
main<00:02:25.530> trail<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.130> figure<00:02:26.460> out<00:02:26.490> that<00:02:26.790> it's<00:02:26.940> a

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
main trail and figure out that it's a

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.840 
main trail and figure out that it's a
tough<00:02:27.870> going<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:28.590> not

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
tough going it's not

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.700 
tough going it's not
worth<00:02:28.970> going<00:02:29.210> in<00:02:29.390> there<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:30.290> if<00:02:30.410> they<00:02:30.530> did

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
worth going in there and if they did

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.680 
worth going in there and if they did
find<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:31.100> trail<00:02:31.370> it's<00:02:31.730> even<00:02:31.910> harder<00:02:32.360> so

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
find this trail it's even harder so

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.200 
find this trail it's even harder so
they're<00:02:33.470> not<00:02:33.560> going<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.800> bother<00:02:34.210> they're

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
they're not going to bother they're

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.370 
they're not going to bother they're
going<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.390> figure<00:02:35.630> out<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.930> this<00:02:36.020> is<00:02:36.200> too

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
going to figure out that this is too

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.290 
going to figure out that this is too
tough<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.890> doesn't<00:02:37.640> really<00:02:37.760> lead<00:02:37.970> anywhere

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
tough and doesn't really lead anywhere

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.210 
tough and doesn't really lead anywhere
and<00:02:38.570> they're<00:02:39.320> going<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.500> assume<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:40.070> same

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
and they're going to assume the same

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.160 
and they're going to assume the same
about<00:02:40.400> so<00:02:40.670> glad<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:40.940> changed<00:02:41.240> plans<00:02:41.570> by<00:02:41.840> coming

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
about so glad I changed plans by coming

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.330 
about so glad I changed plans by coming
away<00:02:42.350> from<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.590> swamp<00:02:42.860> in<00:02:42.980> this<00:02:43.100> different

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
away from the swamp in this different

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.300 
away from the swamp in this different
direction<00:02:43.730> because<00:02:44.240> by<00:02:44.600> doing<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.320> came

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
direction because by doing that I came

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.600 
direction because by doing that I came
across<00:02:46.870> an<00:02:47.870> open<00:02:48.560> area<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.160> looks<00:02:49.370> like<00:02:49.550> a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
across an open area that looks like a

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.750 
across an open area that looks like a
travel<00:02:50.300> trail<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.990> sure<00:02:51.920> enough<00:02:51.950> if<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.550> follow

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
travel trail and sure enough if I follow

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.260 
travel trail and sure enough if I follow
it<00:02:53.530> we<00:02:54.530> have<00:02:54.710> dropping<00:02:55.160> very<00:02:55.370> here<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:58.270> it

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
it we have dropping very here and it

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.360 
it we have dropping very here and it
seems<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.750> have<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.930> trail<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:00.740> goes<00:03:00.800> down<00:03:01.160> to

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
seems to have a trail that goes down to

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.000 
seems to have a trail that goes down to
that<00:03:01.550> swamp<00:03:01.850> in<00:03:02.030> this<00:03:02.180> direction<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:03.010> it's

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
that swamp in this direction and it's

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.830 
that swamp in this direction and it's
open<00:03:04.280> enough<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.880> go<00:03:05.030> in<00:03:05.150> this<00:03:05.240> direction<00:03:05.300> too

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
open enough to go in this direction too

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.180 
open enough to go in this direction too
so<00:03:06.680> this<00:03:06.890> is<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.010> good<00:03:07.100> find<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:08.950> area<00:03:09.950> right

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
so this is a good find this area right

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.400 
so this is a good find this area right
here<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:12.500> an<00:03:12.680> area<00:03:12.950> that<00:03:13.010> I'm<00:03:13.250> going<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:14.380> put<00:03:15.380> a

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
here is an area that I'm going to put a

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.790 
here is an area that I'm going to put a
stand<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:16.450> now<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.510> want<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.110> continue<00:03:18.380> my

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
stand and now I want to continue my

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.200 
stand and now I want to continue my
route<00:03:19.340> out<00:03:19.820> in<00:03:20.440> several<00:03:21.440> directions<00:03:22.210> to

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
route out in several directions to

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.670 
route out in several directions to
follow<00:03:23.240> this<00:03:23.570> deer<00:03:23.810> trail<00:03:23.840> first<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.560> then

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
follow this deer trail first and then

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.830 
follow this deer trail first and then
I'll<00:03:24.800> probably<00:03:24.950> create<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.430> more<00:03:26.330> open<00:03:26.630> route

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
I'll probably create a more open route

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.530 
I'll probably create a more open route
out<00:03:27.020> this<00:03:27.230> way<00:03:27.410> I've<00:03:28.220> got<00:03:28.430> my<00:03:28.610> route<00:03:28.850> down<00:03:29.330> this

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
out this way I've got my route down this

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.020 
out this way I've got my route down this
way<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:29.780> out<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.410> swamp<00:03:30.850> so<00:03:31.850> this<00:03:32.000> is

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
way and out to the swamp so this is

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.440 
way and out to the swamp so this is
turning<00:03:32.360> out<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.570> be<00:03:32.690> a<00:03:32.780> good<00:03:33.290> find<00:03:34.210> this<00:03:35.210> is<00:03:35.420> a

it's going to be really nice spot to set
up<00:03:37.910> a<00:03:38.000> stand<00:03:38.210> it's<00:03:39.020> open<00:03:39.850> got<00:03:40.850> changing<00:03:41.330> trans

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
up a stand it's open got changing trans
