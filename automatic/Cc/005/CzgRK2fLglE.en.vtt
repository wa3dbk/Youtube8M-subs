00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
the same thing and then we get into our

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.010 
the same thing and then we get into our
strength<00:01:31.130> phase<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:31.850> our<00:01:32.119> power<00:01:32.360> phase<00:01:32.750> where

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
strength phase and our power phase where

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.230 
strength phase and our power phase where
we<00:01:33.110> add<00:01:33.319> more<00:01:33.710> sets<00:01:34.190> but<00:01:34.460> take<00:01:34.700> away<00:01:34.729> some<00:01:35.210> of

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
we add more sets but take away some of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.910 
we add more sets but take away some of
the<00:01:35.330> reps<00:01:35.600> this<00:01:36.080> way<00:01:36.229> we<00:01:36.440> can<00:01:36.470> start<00:01:36.710> loading

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
the reps this way we can start loading

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.260 
the reps this way we can start loading
the<00:01:37.130> bar<00:01:37.340> with<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.550> little<00:01:37.759> bit<00:01:37.909> more<00:01:38.090> weight

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
the bar with a little bit more weight

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.600 
the bar with a little bit more weight
but<00:01:38.840> obviously<00:01:39.049> depending<00:01:39.770> on<00:01:39.920> what<00:01:40.310> season

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
but obviously depending on what season

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.770 
but obviously depending on what season
that<00:01:41.420> each<00:01:41.600> individual<00:01:42.140> is<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:44.390> we<00:01:44.509> go<00:01:44.630> with

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
that each individual is it so we go with

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.719 
that each individual is it so we go with
the<00:01:44.869> second<00:01:45.259> set<00:01:45.440> right<00:01:45.590> now<00:01:45.770> let's<00:01:46.340> go<00:01:46.459> five
