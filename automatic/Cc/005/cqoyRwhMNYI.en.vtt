benchmark<00:00:06.450> tests<00:00:06.750> on<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.529> sony<00:00:07.799> xperia<00:00:08.280> z2

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
benchmark tests on the sony xperia z2

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.580 
benchmark tests on the sony xperia z2
which<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.450> now<00:00:09.630> running<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.019> official

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
which is now running the official

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.140 
which is now running the official
android<00:00:11.660> 5.0<00:00:12.660> point2<00:00:13.559> up<00:00:13.679> there<00:00:13.969> so<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
android 5.0 point2 up there so the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.060 
android 5.0 point2 up there so the
reason<00:00:15.299> i'm<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.049> perform<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.529> test<00:00:16.800> is

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
reason i'm going to perform this test is

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.849 
reason i'm going to perform this test is
just<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.490> see<00:00:17.730> if<00:00:17.970> there's<00:00:18.270> an<00:00:18.359> overall

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
just to see if there's an overall

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.040 
just to see if there's an overall
improvement<00:00:20.060> regarding<00:00:21.060> performance<00:00:21.210> with

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
improvement regarding performance with

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.120 
improvement regarding performance with
the<00:00:22.230> new<00:00:22.380> Android<00:00:23.010> 502<00:00:23.750> up<00:00:24.750> there<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:28.130> the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the new Android 502 up there so the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.710 
the new Android 502 up there so the
application<00:00:29.609> i'll<00:00:29.699> be<00:00:29.820> using<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.269> antutu

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
application i'll be using is antutu

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.569 
application i'll be using is antutu
benchmark<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.830> i'm<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:31.949> going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> start<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
benchmark so i'm just going to start the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:02:29.870 
benchmark so i'm just going to start the
test<00:00:32.820> real<00:00:33.030> quick
