pretty clear about WWE dropping the ball
with<00:00:07.290> them<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.649> constantly<00:00:08.130> trying<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.610> bury

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880

them during the end of their run
I<00:00:10.530> always<00:00:11.250> remember<00:00:11.790> people<00:00:11.910> saying<00:00:12.090> they

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
they were better workers where does

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.960 
they were better workers where does

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.810 
be dealt with I think he ate seafood and
it<00:04:20.200> played<00:04:20.470> wreaked<00:04:20.890> havoc<00:04:20.980> with<00:04:21.400> his<00:04:21.430> heart

so<00:04:22.360> that's<00:04:22.510> where<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:22.780> heart<00:04:22.960> issues<00:04:23.380> that<00:04:23.560> he

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
so that's where the heart issues that he

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.680 
so that's where the heart issues that he
had<00:04:23.770> came<00:04:24.040> from<00:04:24.070> that's<00:04:24.460> why<00:04:24.640> he<00:04:25.270> had<00:04:25.419> to<00:04:25.450> stop

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
wrestling for a while

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.739 
wrestling for a while
brought<00:04:27.099> in<00:04:27.219> crush<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.819> became<00:04:28.150> smash<00:04:28.509> and

00:04:28.739 --> 00:04:28.749 
brought in crush it became smash and

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:30.450 
brought in crush it became smash and
crush<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.289> axe<00:04:29.830> would<00:04:30.039> be<00:04:30.159> out<00:04:30.310> there

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
crush and axe would be out there

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.100 
crush and axe would be out there
managing<00:04:30.939> them<00:04:31.090> sometimes<00:04:31.599> they<00:04:31.900> would<00:04:32.020> do

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
managing them sometimes they would do

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.469 
managing them sometimes they would do
the<00:04:32.199> old<00:04:32.319> switcheroo<00:04:33.270> because<00:04:34.270> you<00:04:34.389> know

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
the old switcheroo because you know

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.230 
the old switcheroo because you know
crush<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:35.050> axe<00:04:35.259> look<00:04:35.529> so<00:04:35.710> much<00:04:35.830> alike<00:04:36.120> even<00:04:37.120> in

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
crush and axe look so much alike even in

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.679 
crush and axe look so much alike even in
height

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:37.689 
height

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.559 
height
I<00:04:37.719> think<00:04:38.249> crush<00:04:39.249> probably<00:04:39.610> had<00:04:39.729> a<00:04:39.759> good<00:04:40.029> three

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
I think crush probably had a good three

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:44.070 
I think crush probably had a good three
or<00:04:40.599> four<00:04:40.749> inches<00:04:41.169> at<00:04:41.349> least<00:04:41.379> on<00:04:41.830> axe<00:04:43.080> but

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
or four inches at least on axe but

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.019 
or four inches at least on axe but
that's<00:04:44.259> why<00:04:44.409> axe<00:04:44.650> had<00:04:44.919> to<00:04:45.159> step<00:04:45.699> out<00:04:45.819> of<00:04:45.879> the

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:46.029 
that's why axe had to step out of the

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:47.459 
that's why axe had to step out of the
ring<00:04:46.180> for<00:04:46.360> a<00:04:46.419> while<00:04:46.629> and<00:04:46.840> they<00:04:46.930> brought<00:04:47.139> crush

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:47.469 
ring for a while and they brought crush

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:49.860 
ring for a while and they brought crush
in<00:04:47.680> but<00:04:48.550> around<00:04:48.759> that<00:04:48.879> time<00:04:48.999> you<00:04:49.449> know<00:04:49.569> one<00:04:49.719> day

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
in but around that time you know one day

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.510 
in but around that time you know one day
when<00:04:50.110> they<00:04:50.199> lost<00:04:50.409> the<00:04:50.590> tag<00:04:50.800> belt<00:04:51.069> to<00:04:51.249> the<00:04:51.340> Hart
