on<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.940> creamier<00:01:46.510> side<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.500> what<00:01:47.619> I'm

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
on like the creamier side so what I'm

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.859 
on like the creamier side so what I'm
gonna<00:01:47.799> do<00:01:48.100> is<00:01:48.369> I<00:01:48.610> will<00:01:49.060> just<00:01:49.119> take<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:49.510> little

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
gonna do is I will just take a little

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.010 
gonna do is I will just take a little
bit<00:01:50.110> on<00:01:50.260> at<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.920> brush<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:51.940> then<00:01:52.240> I'm<00:01:52.659> going

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
bit on at the brush and then I'm going

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.480 
bit on at the brush and then I'm going
to<00:01:53.049> start<00:01:53.560> from<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.520> bottom<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.360> my<00:01:55.390> eyebrows

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
to start from the bottom of my eyebrows

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.030 
to start from the bottom of my eyebrows
and<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:58.780> I'm<00:01:58.930> just<00:01:59.049> gonna<00:01:59.170> bring<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.619> line

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
and then I'm just gonna bring that line

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.219 
and then I'm just gonna bring that line
outwards<00:02:03.040> and<00:02:03.880> then<00:02:04.030> once<00:02:04.299> I<00:02:04.450> have<00:02:04.510> that<00:02:04.780> line

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
outwards and then once I have that line

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.070 
outwards and then once I have that line
I<00:02:05.530> like<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.280> do<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.670> same<00:02:06.909> thing<00:02:07.390> up<00:02:07.630> top

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.979 

I'm<00:02:13.080> going<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.440> start<00:02:13.769> from<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.549> tip<00:02:15.390> here<00:02:15.810> and

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
I'm going to start from the tip here and

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:24.050 
I'm going to start from the tip here and
then<00:02:16.290> go<00:02:16.489> go<00:02:17.489> all<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.150> way<00:02:18.269> out<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.810> end<00:02:23.060> so

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
then go go all the way out to the end so

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.240 
then go go all the way out to the end so
once<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.390> have<00:02:24.659> that<00:02:24.930> then<00:02:25.140> I'm<00:02:25.530> going<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.769> go<00:02:25.920> do

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
once I have that then I'm going to go do

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.940 
once I have that then I'm going to go do
a<00:02:26.280> detail<00:02:26.940> like<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.750> just<00:02:27.989> start<00:02:28.409> from<00:02:28.650> where

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
a detail like to just start from where

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.670 
a detail like to just start from where
the<00:02:29.159> line<00:02:29.400> ended<00:02:29.879> and<00:02:30.120> then<00:02:30.530> pull<00:02:31.530> it

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the line ended and then pull it

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:43.400 
the line ended and then pull it
downwards

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.310 

and<00:02:43.920> then<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.730> pull<00:02:44.970> my<00:02:45.000> brows<00:02:45.390> as<00:02:45.870> far

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
and then I like to pull my brows as far

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.940 
and then I like to pull my brows as far
as<00:02:46.620> like<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.190> end<00:02:47.460> of<00:02:47.790> my<00:02:48.540> eyes<00:02:48.900> would<00:02:49.350> be<00:02:49.560> like

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
as like the end of my eyes would be like

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.060 
as like the end of my eyes would be like
the<00:02:50.160> tail<00:02:50.370> right<00:02:51.360> here<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:52.440> whatever<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.830> left

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
the tail right here so whatever is left

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.370 
the tail right here so whatever is left
on<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.310> brush<00:02:53.460> I<00:02:53.670> just<00:02:53.700> go<00:02:53.970> ahead<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.510> filled

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
on the brush I just go ahead and filled

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:06.730 
on the brush I just go ahead and filled
it<00:02:55.530> in

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.890 

if<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:07.370> feel<00:03:07.550> like<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:07.820> need<00:03:08.030> more<00:03:08.060> product

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
if you feel like you need more product

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.100 
if you feel like you need more product
on<00:03:09.020> the<00:03:09.200> brush<00:03:09.490> go<00:03:10.490> ahead<00:03:10.520> and<00:03:11.060> do<00:03:11.210> so<00:03:11.480> this<00:03:11.990> is

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
on the brush go ahead and do so this is

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.530 
on the brush go ahead and do so this is
the<00:03:12.200> point<00:03:12.440> where<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.590> take<00:03:12.920> my<00:03:12.980> spoolie<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.940> I

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
the point where I take my spoolie and I

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:26.600 
the point where I take my spoolie and I
just<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.950> know<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.220> uses<00:03:16.670> as<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.360> blending<00:03:17.990> tool

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:38.610 

you

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.890 

they<00:03:39.620> apply<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.069> very<00:03:40.489> natural-looking<00:03:41.209> so<00:03:41.840> you

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
they apply a very natural-looking so you

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.869 
they apply a very natural-looking so you
could<00:03:42.200> build<00:03:42.379> from<00:03:42.769> having<00:03:43.249> you<00:03:43.400> know<00:03:43.549> if<00:03:43.790> you

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
could build from having you know if you

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.239 
could build from having you know if you
like<00:03:44.090> bold<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:45.139> know<00:03:45.260> strong<00:03:45.650> looking<00:03:46.040> brows

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:46.249 
like bold you know strong looking brows

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:47.830 
like bold you know strong looking brows
you<00:03:46.459> can<00:03:46.519> do<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:46.969> with<00:03:47.150> this<00:03:47.329> and<00:03:47.569> then<00:03:47.719> you

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
you can do that with this and then you

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.149 
you can do that with this and then you
can<00:03:47.959> also<00:03:48.139> have<00:03:48.469> something<00:03:48.709> very

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
can also have something very

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.399 
can also have something very
natural-looking<00:03:49.760> I<00:03:50.090> find<00:03:50.359> myself<00:03:50.540> really

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
natural-looking I find myself really

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.940 
natural-looking I find myself really
using<00:03:52.040> this<00:03:52.159> a<00:03:52.370> lot<00:03:52.639> because<00:03:52.999> it's<00:03:53.840> not<00:03:54.439> a<00:03:54.680> paid

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
using this a lot because it's not a paid

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.280 
using this a lot because it's not a paid
to<00:03:55.219> work<00:03:55.459> with<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.150> doesn't<00:03:56.540> dry<00:03:56.659> as<00:03:56.930> fast

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290

and<00:04:17.630> it<00:04:17.840> still<00:04:17.959> looks<00:04:18.320> exactly<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.919> same<00:04:19.070> in

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
and it still looks exactly the same in

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.640 
and it still looks exactly the same in
the<00:04:19.849> demo<00:04:20.060> application<00:04:20.269> I<00:04:20.900> actually<00:04:21.079> applied
