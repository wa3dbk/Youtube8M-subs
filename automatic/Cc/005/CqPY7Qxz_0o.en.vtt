if<00:00:16.440> there's<00:00:16.680> one<00:00:16.830> stereotypical<00:00:17.640> thing<00:00:17.820> about

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
if there's one stereotypical thing about

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.960 
if there's one stereotypical thing about
man<00:00:18.240> it's<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:19.320> don't<00:00:19.529> like<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.400> use

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
man it's that we don't like to use

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.790 
man it's that we don't like to use
instruction<00:00:21.810> manuals<00:00:22.289> whether<00:00:22.529> it's

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
instruction manuals whether it's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.550 
instruction manuals whether it's
installing<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.789> fridge<00:00:24.060> or<00:00:24.439> downloading<00:00:25.439> a

installing a fridge or downloading a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.099 
installing a fridge or downloading a
computer<00:00:25.980> program<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.760> no<00:00:27.210> manuals<00:00:27.720> needed

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
computer program then no manuals needed

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.200 
computer program then no manuals needed
and<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.590> actually<00:00:28.769> learned<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.550> skill<00:00:30.000> when

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and we actually learned that skill when

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.400 
and we actually learned that skill when
we<00:00:30.359> were<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.630> childhood

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
we were in childhood

how to work this toy yeah Wow how come

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.510 
how to work this toy yeah Wow how come
because<00:00:39.420> when<00:00:39.750> you're<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> kid<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.800> don't<00:00:41.160> need

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
because when you're a kid you don't need

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and if you got a wrong number so that's

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.420 
and if you got a wrong number so that's
one<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> reasons<00:01:37.770> why<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.070> love<00:01:38.250> this

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
three in one race and learned from VTech

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.460 
three in one race and learned from VTech
is<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.729> don't<00:01:42.000> really<00:01:42.270> need<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.750> read<00:01:43.320> an

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
is that you don't really need to read an

is that you don't really need to read an
instruction<00:01:43.619> manual

find that one even competitive enough
for<00:02:12.120> me<00:02:12.500> daddy<00:02:13.500> can't<00:02:13.860> always<00:02:14.099> get<00:02:14.430> 1st<00:02:14.730> place

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
for me daddy can't always get 1st place
