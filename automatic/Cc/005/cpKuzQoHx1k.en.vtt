obviously<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> little<00:00:59.489> worm<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.469> found

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
obviously this a little worm and I found

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
obviously this a little worm and I found
the<00:01:01.800> easiest<00:01:01.920> way<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:03.379> do<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:05.129> by<00:01:06.119> just

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the easiest way to do this is by just

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.960 
the easiest way to do this is by just
going<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:07.680> top<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.890> ground<00:01:10.970> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
going on the very top of the ground that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.370 
going on the very top of the ground that
way<00:01:12.119> you're<00:01:12.270> constantly<00:01:12.750> covered<00:01:14.150> by<00:01:15.380> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
way you're constantly covered by the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.660 
way you're constantly covered by the
sand<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.979> dirt<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.220> everything<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:20.549> then

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
sand and dirt and everything and then

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.080 
sand and dirt and everything and then
you<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:21.229> eat<00:01:22.229> whatever<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.040> that's<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.970> the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
choice between size or speed so let's

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.740 
choice between size or speed so let's
say<00:02:26.050> I'd<00:02:26.290> rather<00:02:26.530> take<00:02:27.959> speed<00:02:30.030> now<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.060> feel

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
say I'd rather take speed now I feel

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.820 
say I'd rather take speed now I feel
easier<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.290> get<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.590> hell<00:02:33.069> cockers<00:02:37.830> sometimes

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
easier to get the hell cockers sometimes

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.520 
easier to get the hell cockers sometimes
speed<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:40.540> would<00:02:40.720> have<00:02:40.810> been<00:02:40.930> more<00:02:41.110> important

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
speed it would have been more important

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.290 
speed it would have been more important
than<00:02:41.709> size<00:02:41.980> yeah<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.580> know<00:02:42.760> that's<00:02:42.910> what<00:02:43.120> she

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300
