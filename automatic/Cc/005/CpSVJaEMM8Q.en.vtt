00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:24.669
you're put to the test.

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:25.689
- True or False. -

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.390
The speed limit is set based on

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.470
the worst possible road conditions.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.470
FALSE.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.180
The speed limit is based on ideal road conditions.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.220
In poor conditions, slow down and drive

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.850
according to weather and road conditions.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.890
- True or False. -

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.610
Daytime running lights are better

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.330
than headlights in winter weather.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.330
FALSE.

If your vehicle skids, cruise control

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.250
will cause it to continue to speed up,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.870
reducing your ability to control the vehicle.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.870

overpasses and shaded areas on the highway.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.800
FALSE.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.800
These areas may be more slippery as

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.030
they can freeze faster and stay icy longer.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.340

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.000

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.070
to help maintain control of your vehicle.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.900
- True or False. -

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.140
In the event of a skid,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.140
don't brake. Steer in

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.760
the direction you want to go.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.470
pedal and don't over-steer. Your vehicle

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:19.620
will go where you are looking.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.620
- True or False. -

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.680

on your vehicle and know how

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.030
it reacts on snow and ice.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.580
Test complete. If you had ANY

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.950
