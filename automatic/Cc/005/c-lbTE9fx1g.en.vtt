00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.740 
different structures are formed will
require<00:02:03.460> looking<00:02:03.880> at<00:02:04.000> more<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.330> them<00:02:04.510> and

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
require looking at more of them and

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.359 
require looking at more of them and
there<00:02:05.200> will<00:02:05.350> be<00:02:05.409> more<00:02:05.680> to<00:02:05.799> look<00:02:05.950> at<00:02:06.130> as

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
there will be more to look at as

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.460 
there will be more to look at as
sunspots<00:02:07.030> are<00:02:07.180> expected<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:07.840> increase<00:02:08.110> in<00:02:08.379> the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
sunspots are expected to increase in the

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.009 
sunspots are expected to increase in the
next<00:02:08.709> few<00:02:08.860> years<00:02:08.950> with<00:02:09.399> solar<00:02:09.640> maximum<00:02:10.269> this

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
next few years with solar maximum this

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.009 
next few years with solar maximum this
may<00:02:11.230> mean<00:02:11.470> more<00:02:11.709> solar<00:02:12.069> storms<00:02:12.700> but<00:02:13.540> for<00:02:13.779> solar

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
may mean more solar storms but for solar

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.570 
may mean more solar storms but for solar
scientists<00:02:14.769> it's<00:02:14.950> good<00:02:15.310> news

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
scientists it's good news

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.870 
scientists it's good news
yeah<00:02:16.030> yeah<00:02:16.300> we<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:16.630> activity<00:02:17.170> if<00:02:17.380> you're<00:02:17.560> up

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
yeah yeah we like activity if you're up

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.190 
yeah yeah we like activity if you're up
if<00:02:18.880> that's<00:02:19.330> what<00:02:19.480> makes<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.810> Sun<00:02:20.020> so

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
if that's what makes the Sun so

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.810 
if that's what makes the Sun so
fascinating<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.070> weren't<00:02:21.520> for<00:02:21.760> the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
fascinating I it weren't for the

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.580 
fascinating I it weren't for the
magnetic<00:02:22.240> field<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.900> sunspot<00:02:23.380> that

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
magnetic field and the sunspot that

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.260 
magnetic field and the sunspot that
makes<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:24.730> would<00:02:25.120> be<00:02:25.240> kind<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.600> boring<00:02:25.780> star
