00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.729 
I've been guilty of this multiple times
and<00:00:41.430> what<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.940> realize<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.899> when<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:43.710> have

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and what I realize is that when we have

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.760 
and what I realize is that when we have
too<00:00:44.190> many<00:00:44.309> things<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.969> our<00:00:45.510> closet<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:46.200> lot<00:00:46.649> of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
too many things in our closet a lot of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.619 
too many things in our closet a lot of
the<00:00:46.860> times<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.460> few<00:00:47.700> things<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.270> don't

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the times the few things that we don't

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.810 
the times the few things that we don't
wear<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.320> don't<00:00:49.500> really<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.610> love

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
wear that we don't really like or love

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.819 
wear that we don't really like or love
it<00:00:51.390> clutters<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.079> things<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.590> do

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
it clutters up the things that we do

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.920 
it clutters up the things that we do
love<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.489> sometimes<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.120> don't<00:00:54.300> get<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> see

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
love and sometimes we don't get to see

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.510 
love and sometimes we don't get to see
the<00:00:55.050> things<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.379> love<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.829> then<00:00:56.309> it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the things that we love and then it

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000 
the things that we love and then it
makes<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.210> appear<00:00:57.539> as<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.410> nothing<00:00:58.649> to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
makes it appear as if we have nothing to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.119 
makes it appear as if we have nothing to
wear<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.149> simple<00:01:00.480> solution<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.170> fixing

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
wear so the simple solution in fixing

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.380 
wear so the simple solution in fixing
that<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.670> purge

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
