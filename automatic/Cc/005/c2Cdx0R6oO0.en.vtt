to play guitar hero guitar hero depends
upon<00:01:05.920> visual<00:01:06.840> stimulus<00:01:07.840> you<00:01:07.930> see<00:01:08.110> like<00:01:08.289> notes

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
upon visual stimulus you see like notes

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.169 
upon visual stimulus you see like notes
running<00:01:09.190> down<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.429> screen<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:09.910> if<00:01:10.030> you're

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.179 
running down the screen and if you're

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:12.389 
running down the screen and if you're
blind<00:01:10.420> because<00:01:10.810> you<00:01:10.929> can't<00:01:11.140> see<00:01:11.470> anything<00:01:11.979> so

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
blind because you can't see anything so

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.060 
blind because you can't see anything so
we<00:01:12.910> had<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.119> idea<00:01:13.330> of<00:01:13.450> like<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:13.750> know

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
we had the idea of like you know

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.440 
we had the idea of like you know
transforming<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.220> visual<00:01:15.729> stimulus<00:01:16.119> into

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
transforming a visual stimulus into

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.590 
transforming a visual stimulus into
haptic<00:01:16.810> feedback<00:01:16.840> so<00:01:17.679> we<00:01:17.710> thought<00:01:17.920> about

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
haptic feedback so we thought about

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.029 
haptic feedback so we thought about
creating<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.960> glove<00:01:20.229> with<00:01:20.409> little<00:01:20.649> face<00:01:20.890> your

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
creating a glove with little face your

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.680 
creating a glove with little face your
engines<00:01:21.369> like<00:01:21.550> patrons<00:01:22.119> you<00:01:22.210> can<00:01:22.360> find<00:01:22.569> in

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
engines like patrons you can find in

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.760 
engines like patrons you can find in
cell<00:01:22.899> phones<00:01:23.140> but<00:01:23.259> these<00:01:23.380> are<00:01:23.500> kind<00:01:23.649> of<00:01:23.679> like

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
cell phones but these are kind of like

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.499 
cell phones but these are kind of like
industrial<00:01:24.130> base<00:01:24.520> your<00:01:24.670> engines<00:01:25.000> they<00:01:25.390> have<00:01:25.479> a

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
industrial base your engines they have a

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.090 
industrial base your engines they have a

to<00:01:54.850> go<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.060> games<00:01:55.390> from<00:01:55.570> scratch

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.810 

you<00:02:03.590> know<00:02:03.680> it's<00:02:03.980> interesting<00:02:04.100> because<00:02:04.550> it

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
you know it's interesting because it

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.640 
you know it's interesting because it
really<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.360> is<00:02:05.570> really<00:02:05.960> difficult<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.500> play

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
really it is really difficult to play

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.950 
really it is really difficult to play
this<00:02:06.800> your<00:02:07.760> fingers<00:02:08.090> start<00:02:08.420> vibrating<00:02:08.539> a

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
this your fingers start vibrating a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.600 
this your fingers start vibrating a
little<00:02:09.170> bit<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:09.619> then<00:02:09.800> immediately

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
little bit and then immediately

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.220 
little bit and then immediately
afterwards<00:02:11.390> you've<00:02:11.540> got<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.780> hit<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.960> button

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
afterwards you've got to hit the button

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.170 
afterwards you've got to hit the button
and<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:13.250> think<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.520> is<00:02:13.610> one<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.790> those<00:02:13.940> things

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
and I think it is one of those things

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.880 
and I think it is one of those things
that<00:02:14.360> people<00:02:14.960> who<00:02:15.020> are<00:02:15.200> blind<00:02:15.380> if<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.650> are

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
that people who are blind if you are

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.260 
that people who are blind if you are
visually<00:02:16.280> impaired<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.700> probably<00:02:16.970> have<00:02:17.150> an

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
visually impaired to probably have an

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.500 
visually impaired to probably have an
easier<00:02:17.630> time<00:02:17.720> with<00:02:18.140> just<00:02:19.130> because<00:02:19.490> they're<00:02:20.150> so

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
easier time with just because they're so

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.780 
easier time with just because they're so
used<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:21.020> using<00:02:21.620> their<00:02:21.920> sense<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.280> touch<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.670> do

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
used to using their sense of touch to do

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.430 
used to using their sense of touch to do
things<00:02:23.000> very<00:02:23.680> going<00:02:24.680> at<00:02:24.770> one<00:02:25.240> now<00:02:26.240> I<00:02:26.270> let's<00:02:27.260> say

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
things very going at one now I let's say

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.080 
things very going at one now I let's say
you<00:02:27.500> know<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:27.800> wanted<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.610> actually<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:29.060> know

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
you know I wanted to actually you know

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.170 
you know I wanted to actually you know

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
play a blind hero essentially for myself

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.460 
play a blind hero essentially for myself
I<00:02:32.209> mean<00:02:32.300> you're<00:02:32.480> kind<00:02:32.630> of<00:02:32.660> working<00:02:32.959> on<00:02:33.050> ways<00:02:33.440> to

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
I mean you're kind of working on ways to

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.370 
I mean you're kind of working on ways to
get<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.459> out<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.730> public<00:02:34.880> we<00:02:35.690> wish<00:02:35.900> the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
get it out to the public we wish the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.500 
get it out to the public we wish the
only<00:02:36.530> problems<00:02:36.830> like<00:02:36.980> these<00:02:37.820> gloves<00:02:38.180> we<00:02:38.390> have

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
only problems like these gloves we have

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.180 
only problems like these gloves we have
two<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:38.989> cuss<00:02:39.170> 1500<00:02:39.680> Allah<00:02:39.800> sees<00:02:39.980> to

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
two and the cuss 1500 Allah sees to

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.130 
two and the cuss 1500 Allah sees to
develop<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.820> yeah<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:41.300> would<00:02:41.420> really<00:02:41.720> it<00:02:41.959> would

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
develop and yeah I would really it would

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.420 
develop and yeah I would really it would
be<00:02:42.230> really<00:02:42.410> nice<00:02:42.590> if<00:02:42.650> we<00:02:42.920> could<00:02:42.950> find<00:02:43.250> a

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
be really nice if we could find a

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.970 
be really nice if we could find a
producer<00:02:43.820> or<00:02:43.850> something<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.270> bit<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.980> be

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
producer or something that bit that be

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.410 
producer or something that bit that be
able<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.280> create<00:02:46.459> something<00:02:46.489> or<00:02:46.820> maybe<00:02:47.000> we<00:02:47.270> can

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
able to create something or maybe we can

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.510 
able to create something or maybe we can
actually<00:02:47.600> because<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.560> glove<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.160> kind<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.430> a

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
actually because a glove is kind of a

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.060 
actually because a glove is kind of a
hard<00:02:49.700> solution<00:02:50.209> we<00:02:50.630> would<00:02:50.780> ideally<00:02:51.739> would

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
hard solution we would ideally would

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.440 
hard solution we would ideally would
want<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.370> have<00:02:52.459> a<00:02:52.520> solution<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:52.940> works<00:02:53.239> with

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
want to have a solution that works with

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.840 
want to have a solution that works with
you<00:02:53.570> witty<00:02:53.930> or<00:02:54.230> is<00:02:54.739> you<00:02:54.860> know<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.010> guitar<00:02:55.580> hero

so<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.150> don't<00:02:56.390> know<00:02:56.450> maybe<00:02:56.570> we<00:02:56.720> can<00:02:56.900> construct

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
so I don't know maybe we can construct

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.960 
so I don't know maybe we can construct
the<00:02:57.530> guitar<00:02:57.830> with<00:02:57.980> little<00:02:58.220> pacer<00:02:58.400> answers<00:02:58.760> in
