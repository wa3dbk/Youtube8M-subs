00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.840 
to deal with really quickly take into
consideration<00:02:05.920> that<00:02:05.950> all<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.460> artists<00:02:06.789> are

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
consideration that all the artists are

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.330 
consideration that all the artists are
performing<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:07.539> sand<00:02:07.869> in<00:02:08.229> water<00:02:08.500> on<00:02:08.860> horses

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
performing and sand in water on horses

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.070 
performing and sand in water on horses
so<00:02:09.759> it's<00:02:09.940> not<00:02:10.090> just<00:02:10.149> like<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.479> normal<00:02:10.720> caution

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
so it's not just like a normal caution

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.290 
so it's not just like a normal caution
that<00:02:11.320> would<00:02:11.620> be<00:02:11.769> on<00:02:12.040> let's<00:02:12.790> say<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:12.940> theater

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
that would be on let's say a theater

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.240 
that would be on let's say a theater
stage<00:02:13.540> we<00:02:14.440> have<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.590> take<00:02:14.739> all<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.980> elements

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
stage we have to take all the elements

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.490 
stage we have to take all the elements
into<00:02:15.580> consideration<00:02:16.300> so<00:02:16.630> something<00:02:17.320> that<00:02:17.410> we

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
into consideration so something that we

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.140 
into consideration so something that we
wouldn't<00:02:17.769> necessarily<00:02:17.860> have<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.250> prepare<00:02:18.670> as

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
wouldn't necessarily have to prepare as

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.290 
wouldn't necessarily have to prepare as
fast<00:02:19.570> on<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.870> normal<00:02:20.350> scene<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.130> we<00:02:21.970> definitely

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
fast on a normal scene and we definitely

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.440 
fast on a normal scene and we definitely
have<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.450> take<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.870> elements<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:24.450> realize

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
have to take the elements and realize

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.880 
have to take the elements and realize
that<00:02:25.600> we<00:02:25.690> have<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.019> do<00:02:26.140> more<00:02:26.290> repairs<00:02:26.650> because

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
that we have to do more repairs because

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:48.780 
that we have to do more repairs because
of<00:02:27.220> them

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.700
