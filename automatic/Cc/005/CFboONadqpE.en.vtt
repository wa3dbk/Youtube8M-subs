forward and reverse flight it's a
coaxial<00:00:40.950> design<00:00:41.340> which<00:00:41.610> means<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.210> twin

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
coaxial design which means you have twin

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.680 
coaxial design which means you have twin
counter-rotating<00:00:43.890> main<00:00:44.430> blades<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.270> these
