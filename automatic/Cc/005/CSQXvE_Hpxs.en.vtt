 they seek to color the city 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.080
 through their designs are students 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.419
 of graphic design who through the 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.010
 graffiti ensure that they express message of 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:34.190
 Modernism in the streets of Toluca 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.050
 because the restlessness more or less part then 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.240
 how to bring some aesthetics to the 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.770
 city ​​because everyone creates their own 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.080
 characters I do not know everyone has a 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.390
 concept and then based on that we try 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.820
 how to implement those characters 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.660
 within the city and therefore for more 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.550
 six years 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.860
 they look for some places within 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.570
 the city to make their designs and they 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.129
 they support the municipal authorities 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.129
 to achieve the necessary permits 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.930
 then with the help of these paintings 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.620
 begin to capture their different forms 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.260
 of thinking when we try to keep as 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.590
 that line of a message is the same for the 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.100
 society we do is representations that 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.580
 we common 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.700
 We say we capture aesthetic look 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.090
 of our 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.039
 our style we think they 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.930
 they assure that this activity is something that 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.579
 keeps them busy and helps them 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.799
 refine your techniques to improve your 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.549
 designs and experiment with shapes and 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.860
 colors own taste and satisfaction 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.130
 up to us and apart that it's stuck 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.200
 with what we are studying these 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.789
 young university students also work 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.130
 with digital designs and some other 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.020
 techniques although they ensure 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.270
 the important thing is to express and show 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.740
 the different ways of thinking of the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.740
