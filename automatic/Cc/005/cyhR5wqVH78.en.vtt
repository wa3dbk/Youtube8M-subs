00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
pretty much have to do this because you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.729 
pretty much have to do this because you
have<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.420> get<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> top<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> struts<00:00:34.559> on

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
have to get to the top of the struts on

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.510 
have to get to the top of the struts on
the<00:00:34.829> side<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:36.320> this<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:37.950> keep

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the side and this one you can just keep

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
the side and this one you can just keep
on<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.730> didn't<00:00:39.300> bother<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.170> remove<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
on I didn't bother to remove the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.110 
on I didn't bother to remove the
electrical<00:00:42.540> motor<00:00:43.140> or<00:00:43.440> whatever<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
electrical motor or whatever on the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.600 
electrical motor or whatever on the
bottom<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.890> know<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.160> get<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.460> up

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
bottom of it so you know just get it up

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.779 
bottom of it so you know just get it up
make<00:00:48.539> sure<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.780> use<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> jack<00:00:49.289> stand<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:50.100> put

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
make sure you use a jack stand and put

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.420 
make sure you use a jack stand and put
some<00:00:50.969> newspaper<00:00:51.120> underneath<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.430> caliper

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
some newspaper underneath the caliper

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.529 
some newspaper underneath the caliper
because<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.149> using<00:00:54.420> lots<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.899> PB<00:00:55.289> to

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
because you don't be using lots of PB to

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.180 
because you don't be using lots of PB to
unbolt<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.930> some<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.260> things<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
unbolt all some of things and so the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.160 
unbolt all some of things and so the
second<00:00:59.520> step<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.940> you<00:00:59.969> want<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.600> really<00:01:00.809> just

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
second step is you want to really just

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.950 
second step is you want to really just
loosen<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.219> some<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.489> these<00:01:02.609> bolts<00:01:02.850> saw<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
loosen up some of these bolts saw the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.870 
loosen up some of these bolts saw the
ones<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.379> end<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.220> not<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
ones on that end and not the one in the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.820 
ones on that end and not the one in the
middle<00:01:06.060> not<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.900> middle<00:01:07.080> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
middle not the one in the middle I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.350 
middle not the one in the middle I
believe<00:01:08.250> they're<00:01:08.460> thirteen<00:01:08.850> millimeter

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
believe they're thirteen millimeter

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.070 
believe they're thirteen millimeter
I<00:01:09.600> forgot<00:01:10.229> from<00:01:10.470> Upshur<00:01:10.799> but<00:01:11.659> here<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.900> see

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
I forgot from Upshur but here you see

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.980 
I forgot from Upshur but here you see
I've<00:01:13.350> loosened<00:01:13.619> them<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> bit<00:01:14.299> not<00:01:15.299> all<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.869> way

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
I've loosened them a bit not all the way

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.859 
I've loosened them a bit not all the way
but<00:01:16.020> kind<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> brim<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.180> bolt<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
but kind of to the brim of the bolt and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.480 
but kind of to the brim of the bolt and
you<00:01:19.140> want<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.619> because<00:01:19.830> later<00:01:20.159> it'll

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
you want to do this because later it'll

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.390 
you want to do this because later it'll
save<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> lot<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.119> time<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.659> might<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:22.400> much

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
save you a lot of time it might be much

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
save you a lot of time it might be much
it's<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.270> much<00:01:24.479> harder<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.990> take<00:01:25.229> off

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
it's going to be much harder to take off

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.870 
it's going to be much harder to take off
once<00:01:26.360> everything<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.680> about<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.979> come<00:01:29.549> off<00:01:29.670> all

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
once everything is about to come off all

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.940 
once everything is about to come off all
the<00:01:29.970> bolts<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> bottom<00:01:30.509> next<00:01:31.350> step<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.799> you

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the bolts on the bottom next step is you

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.980 
the bolts on the bottom next step is you
want<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.130> take<00:01:32.250> off<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.640> bolt<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.960> a

want to take off this bolt here is a
position<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> caliper<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:36.200> this<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
position of the caliper and this is a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.450 
position of the caliper and this is a
left<00:01:37.650> wheel<00:01:37.799> toy

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
left wheel toy

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.880 
you just kind of have to keep on going
at<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.630> working<00:01:54.630> at<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.590> know<00:01:55.710> we

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
at it and working at it and you know we

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.160 
at it and working at it and you know we
had<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.460> use<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> braking<00:01:57.030> bar<00:01:57.210> right<00:01:57.750> there<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
had to use a braking bar right there and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.109 
had to use a braking bar right there and
there's<00:01:58.409> not<00:01:58.590> much<00:01:58.950> wiggle<00:01:59.219> room<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.579> might

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
there's not much wiggle room so might

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.289 
there's not much wiggle room so might
take<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> while<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:02.149> you<00:02:03.149> know

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
take a while to do this but you know

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.020 
take a while to do this but you know
this<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.320> course<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.680> necessary<00:02:05.189> step<00:02:05.520> so

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
this is of course a necessary step so

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.150 
this is of course a necessary step so
you<00:02:06.390> know<00:02:06.479> get<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.020> off<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.290> then<00:02:07.829> you

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
you know get that off and then you

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.360 
you know get that off and then you
should<00:02:09.119> be<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.569> clear<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:10.200> use<00:02:10.379> again<00:02:11.069> tons

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
should be in the clear we use again tons

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.750 
should be in the clear we use again tons
of<00:02:11.520> TV

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
of TV

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.170 
of TV
and<00:02:12.849> newspaper<00:02:13.540> there<00:02:14.110> for<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.500> reason<00:02:15.180> this

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and newspaper there for a reason this

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.970 
and newspaper there for a reason this
really<00:02:16.510> helps<00:02:16.840> can't<00:02:17.230> even<00:02:17.500> tell<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:17.739> how

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
really helps can't even tell you how

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.369 
really helps can't even tell you how
much<00:02:18.189> it<00:02:18.430> seeped<00:02:18.700> through<00:02:18.939> somehow

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
much it seeped through somehow

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:21.960 
much it seeped through somehow
like<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.799> bottom<00:02:21.099> of<00:02:21.189> the<00:02:21.280> strut<00:02:21.549> there<00:02:21.760> it's

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
like the bottom of the strut there it's

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.619 
like the bottom of the strut there it's
pretty<00:02:22.209> crazy<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:27.310> here<00:02:27.519> we<00:02:27.819> removed<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.599> and

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
pretty crazy so here we removed it and

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.500 
pretty crazy so here we removed it and
the<00:02:28.900> next<00:02:29.140> step<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:30.400> take<00:02:30.579> this<00:02:31.060> part<00:02:31.360> off

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
the next step is to take this part off

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.619 
the next step is to take this part off
not<00:02:31.930> sure<00:02:32.110> it's<00:02:32.709> called<00:02:32.980> actually<00:02:33.489> but<00:02:33.730> well

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
not sure it's called actually but well

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.199 
not sure it's called actually but well
we<00:02:34.810> did<00:02:35.019> my<00:02:35.349> brother<00:02:35.560> got<00:02:36.549> that<00:02:36.730> wrench<00:02:37.000> and

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
we did my brother got that wrench and

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.500 
we did my brother got that wrench and
just<00:02:37.360> put<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.409> on<00:02:38.700> there<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.760> hold<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.209> bolt

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
just put it on there to hold the bolt

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.750 
just put it on there to hold the bolt
and<00:02:40.659> I<00:02:41.290> used<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.950> believe<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.459> eight

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
and I used I believe this eight

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.289 
and I used I believe this eight
millimeter<00:02:43.480> socket<00:02:43.569> wrench<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.799> just<00:02:45.150> keep<00:02:46.150> on

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
millimeter socket wrench to just keep on

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.940 
millimeter socket wrench to just keep on
turning<00:02:46.659> it<00:02:46.750> until<00:02:46.959> they<00:02:47.470> got<00:02:47.650> loose

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
turning it until they got loose

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.430 
turning it until they got loose
basically<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.900> know<00:02:49.989> just<00:02:50.200> keep<00:02:50.319> on

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
basically and you know just keep on

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.339 
basically and you know just keep on
going<00:02:50.680> at<00:02:50.829> and<00:02:51.040> take<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.340> off<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.540> problem

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
going at and take it off and a problem

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.460 
going at and take it off and a problem
that<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.859> ran<00:02:54.099> into<00:02:54.720> was<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:56.019> when<00:02:56.200> we<00:02:56.290> took

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
that we ran into was that when we took

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.569 
that we ran into was that when we took
it<00:02:56.620> off<00:02:57.359> cutting<00:02:58.359> the<00:02:59.260> nut<00:02:59.980> off<00:03:00.099> we<00:03:00.280> couldn't

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
it off cutting the nut off we couldn't

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.050 
it off cutting the nut off we couldn't
actually<00:03:00.879> take<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.239> off<00:03:01.389> because<00:03:01.629> it<00:03:03.060> lifted

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
actually take it off because it lifted

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.330 
actually take it off because it lifted
itself<00:03:04.450> up<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:05.409> what<00:03:05.590> we<00:03:05.739> had<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.040> do<00:03:06.159> was

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
itself up so what we had to do was

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.539 
itself up so what we had to do was
actually<00:03:06.519> check<00:03:06.909> up<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.889> caliper<00:03:08.889> side

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
actually check up the caliper side

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.879 
actually check up the caliper side
basically<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.870> we<00:03:11.290> had<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.530> do<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.769> because

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
basically and we had to do it because

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.800 
basically and we had to do it because
it's<00:03:12.190> impossible<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.030> take<00:03:13.180> off<00:03:13.389> because<00:03:13.569> of

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
it's impossible to take off because of

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.839 
it's impossible to take off because of
the<00:03:13.900> angle<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.349> so<00:03:14.620> we<00:03:14.980> just<00:03:15.250> jacked<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:15.700> up

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
the angle and so we just jacked it up

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.460 
the angle and so we just jacked it up
from<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.269> bottom<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.750> caliper<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.319> then

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
from the bottom of the caliper and then

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.860 
from the bottom of the caliper and then
we<00:03:17.620> were<00:03:17.680> able<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:17.980> take<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.370> off<00:03:18.489> here<00:03:19.480> we<00:03:19.720> took

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
we were able to take it off here we took

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.050 
we were able to take it off here we took
it<00:03:20.019> off<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:21.250> then<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.459> next<00:03:21.730> thing<00:03:21.849> is

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
it off and then the next thing is

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.479 
it off and then the next thing is
basically<00:03:22.269> one<00:03:22.720> on<00:03:23.040> somehow<00:03:24.040> get<00:03:24.190> this<00:03:24.310> right

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
basically one on somehow get this right

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.930 
basically one on somehow get this right
off<00:03:24.609> we<00:03:25.030> use<00:03:25.269> tons<00:03:25.569> of<00:03:25.720> PB<00:03:26.109> a<00:03:26.430> bat<00:03:27.430> blast<00:03:27.730> on<00:03:27.910> it

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
off we use tons of PB a bat blast on it

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.550 
off we use tons of PB a bat blast on it
and<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.720> actually<00:03:28.840> seeped<00:03:29.290> through<00:03:29.379> the

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
and it actually seeped through the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.140 
and it actually seeped through the
bottom<00:03:29.980> which<00:03:30.190> was<00:03:30.340> pretty<00:03:30.579> crazy

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
bottom which was pretty crazy

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.909 
bottom which was pretty crazy
works<00:03:31.389> really<00:03:31.510> well<00:03:31.810> it's<00:03:32.169> the<00:03:32.260> only<00:03:32.410> way<00:03:32.650> we

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
works really well it's the only way we

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.379 
works really well it's the only way we
knew<00:03:33.040> how<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.220> do<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.400> was<00:03:33.639> to<00:03:33.790> ninja<00:03:34.000> kick<00:03:34.239> it

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
knew how to do it was to ninja kick it

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:35.849 
knew how to do it was to ninja kick it
that's<00:03:34.989> what<00:03:35.169> we<00:03:35.290> had<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.440> do<00:03:35.590> on<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.829> other

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
that's what we had to do on the other

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.580 
that's what we had to do on the other
side<00:03:36.220> because<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:36.819> was<00:03:37.000> not<00:03:37.720> working<00:03:38.260> any

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
side because it was not working any

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.789 
side because it was not working any
other<00:03:38.739> way<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:40.690> know<00:03:41.290> don't<00:03:41.500> do<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.739> on

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
other way and you know don't do it on

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.619 
other way and you know don't do it on
the<00:03:41.889> caliper<00:03:42.160> itself<00:03:42.340> but<00:03:42.879> you<00:03:43.329> know<00:03:43.449> the

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
the caliper itself but you know the

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.360 
the caliper itself but you know the
wheel<00:03:43.840> bearing<00:03:44.169> whatever<00:03:44.500> here<00:03:45.040> we<00:03:45.220> actually

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
wheel bearing whatever here we actually

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.869 
wheel bearing whatever here we actually

not going to be seized inside so it's

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.729 
not going to be seized inside so it's
pretty<00:04:19.150> I'd<00:04:19.419> say<00:04:19.720> necessary<00:04:20.289> if<00:04:20.470> we're<00:04:20.620> going
