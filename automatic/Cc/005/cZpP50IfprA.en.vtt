00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:44.069 
in the wild channel we introduce two

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:47.119 
in the wild channel we introduce two
extra<00:00:44.670> gain<00:00:44.850> stages<00:00:45.420> each<00:00:46.129> voiced

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
extra gain stages each voiced

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.910 
extra gain stages each voiced
differently<00:00:48.120> each<00:00:48.989> with<00:00:49.319> its<00:00:49.469> own<00:00:49.620> gain

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
differently each with its own gain

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.860 
differently each with its own gain
control<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.639> we<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.909> our<00:00:50.940> sweet<00:00:51.300> game<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
control so we have our sweet game and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.979 
control so we have our sweet game and
our<00:00:52.079> hot<00:00:52.289> game<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> between<00:00:54.420> those<00:00:54.719> two

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
our hot game so between those two

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.069 
our hot game so between those two
settings<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:56.579> hot<00:00:56.819> gain<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.389> you<00:00:57.479> roll<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.929> up

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
settings the hot gain if you roll it up

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.989 
settings the hot gain if you roll it up
more<00:00:58.319> and<00:00:58.589> back<00:00:58.799> off<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.219> sweet<00:00:59.489> gain<00:00:59.760> you're

00:00:59.989 --> 00:00:59.999 
more and back off the sweet gain you're

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:01.250 
more and back off the sweet gain you're
going<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.179> have<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.389> little<00:01:00.659> bit<00:01:00.839> more<00:01:01.049> of<00:01:01.139> an

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
going to have a little bit more of an

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.169 
going to have a little bit more of an
edge<00:01:01.409> to<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.889> tone<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.429> little<00:01:02.549> bit<00:01:02.850> more<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.089> a

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.179 
edge to the tone a little bit more of a

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:04.969 
edge to the tone a little bit more of a
hot<00:01:03.359> rod<00:01:03.569> marshall<00:01:04.049> kind<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.350> thing<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.589> on

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
hot rod marshall kind of thing going on

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.609 
hot rod marshall kind of thing going on
i<00:01:05.040> suppose<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.659> back<00:01:06.840> off<00:01:06.870> the<00:01:07.260> hot<00:01:07.409> gain

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
i suppose if you back off the hot gain

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.020 
i suppose if you back off the hot gain
and<00:01:07.799> open<00:01:08.039> up<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.159> sweet<00:01:08.460> gain<00:01:08.670> you'll<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
and open up the sweet gain you'll have a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.940 
and open up the sweet gain you'll have a
little<00:01:09.299> bit<00:01:09.450> more<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.719> a<00:01:09.899> round<00:01:10.170> kind<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.680> tone

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
little bit more of a round kind of tone

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.830 
little bit more of a round kind of tone
and<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.340> overdrive<00:01:11.909> sound<00:01:14.450> or<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.689> roll

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
and the overdrive sound or just roll

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
them all the way up and just get your

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.690 
them all the way up and just get your
windmill<00:01:18.539> out<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.079> at<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.579> that<00:01:20.579> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
windmill out and have at it that the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.859 
windmill out and have at it that the
idea<00:01:20.820> behind<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.479> little<00:01:21.780> guy<00:01:21.899> is<00:01:23.869> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
idea behind this little guy is the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.679 
idea behind this little guy is the
preamp<00:01:25.289> on<00:01:25.469> this<00:01:25.619> thing<00:01:25.969> I've<00:01:26.969> modified<00:01:27.390> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
preamp on this thing I've modified it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.920 
preamp on this thing I've modified it
for<00:01:27.719> 2010<00:01:28.649> to<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.100> even<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.149> bit<00:01:30.329> more<00:01:30.509> output

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
for 2010 to get even a bit more output

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.520 
for 2010 to get even a bit more output
from<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> preamp<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.359> the<00:01:33.359> the<00:01:34.079> preamp

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
from the preamp so it the the preamp

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.469 
from the preamp so it the the preamp
will<00:01:34.710> now<00:01:34.829> push<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.219> output<00:01:35.700> section<00:01:35.939> harder

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
will now push the output section harder

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.029 
will now push the output section harder
than<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.719> originally<00:01:36.960> did<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.679> earlier

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
than it originally did in earlier
