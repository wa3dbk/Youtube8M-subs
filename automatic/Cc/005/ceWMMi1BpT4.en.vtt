00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello here is mature rpg fans again 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.450
 with a new video and I have today 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.530
 something special she was prepared 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.290
 today there is an unboxing of 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.609
 this plot is the hp slate 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.460
 seven plus that's in since yesterday 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.240
 trade in germany and i had 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.240
 naturally taken care of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.230
 maybe that's a good idea 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.579
 its name already and it actually stands 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.500
 a direct competition with the next 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.219
 and last year and the first exil 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:44.250
 because it is almost the same hardware and 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:46.050
 So who tegra 3 1 gigabyte ram and 1 27 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.629
 p 7 inch display 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.640
 but they look but just anyway because 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.410
 So we have the box that is 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.750
 actually nothing special there 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.260
 not much to see 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:05.670
 video are symbolic because not everything 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.010
 device itself not even specifications 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.729
 I feel good then I do it 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:20.960
 just submit to absolutely young 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.960
 box that can not work here 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.860
 with the knife 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:44.189
 now something of a double hit 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:59.770
 glued here still the chance 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:02:27.910
 wonderful then we look how strong 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:28.540
 that too on the good piece that 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.810
 same want 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.310
 I'll see something else under it 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.739
 already have his guess the child 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:43.630
 I actually sings because we have two 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:48.090
 Cute boxing filled with a kommers 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.090
 go out that it is your charger 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:03:00.000
 micro usb cable a chic invite adapter 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.290
 and watch 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.580
 probably only part came and 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.310
 Drill things we need everything 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.710
 Do not look if you use the tablet too 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.710
 free the wagon 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:30.650
 So as I said is a total of seven 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:34.280
 inch with 1280 x 720 pixels has one 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.680
 front camera and a rear camera by the way 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.050
 very 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.040
 the big advantage opposite 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:48.610
 the nexus 7 because he has no camera and 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:52.070
 the with 5 megapixels on we would have the 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.630
 input for micro usb and the micro in the 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.150
 concert the next big advantage 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:02.150
 compared to 67 that has no micro 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:05.330
 sd slot coins more a switch loud 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.980
 and soft buttons and I guess 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.260
 very strong that is the speaker and 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.860
 cook water but can also 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.860
 stop it 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:27.210
 Now I have a load like 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.389
 said the work a tegra 3 in it with 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:34.270
 four nuclei counter-degree and 1.3 ghz of 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.910
 actually ram supported and the 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.139
 internal memory is 8 gigabytes in size 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.460
 of course that would be a bit 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.770
 less than the next seven that has 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:51.120
 yes to have since still available 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.120
 version 16 gb costs around 100 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:05:03.490
 and 0 60 euros the year 449 now 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.490
 available 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:14.910
 should I get a quick wlan? 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:16.530
 give I'll be back, you can 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.630
 quickly made the registration at 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:23.480
 google and also relies on api 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:35.880
 Just register the game 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:39.300
 after all, android 2.3 runs and it should 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.430
 from hp not much changed 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:46.730
 have been 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.730
 So how it is delivered by google 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:00.740
 So I do not really care too much 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:04.710
 still packed the cityscape 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:11.120
 except for a few tips how to get here 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:15.020
 you can see it's running smoothly 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.640
 Of course not super g clear 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.340
 and that would be the big disadvantage 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.630
 You have to get the updates 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:28.100
 I clicked later, too 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:30.710
 not sure if you still get here 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.660
 The device, however, is quite cheap 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.070
 I'll be on everyone's next day 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.880
 give it a try as you do it yourself 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.880
 while playing 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:44.379
 and 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.759
 lob gets off quite well even so 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:48.210
 the processing that makes a right 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.669
 good impression 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.960
 relatively stable 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:55.180
 and if you ever got it 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.490
 want to see something I do 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:01.180
 should what other tester then writes 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.560
 a comment and I will see then 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.289
 that I can somehow set that up 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:09.190
 the water that with the short hands-on 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:11.849
 and on boxing day plus and we pull 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.849
 see us in the next video
