cool fire so Cody says hey Jay even

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.859 
cool fire so Cody says hey Jay even
though<00:01:38.310> you're<00:01:38.520> cool<00:01:38.759> Fire<00:01:39.000> Dragons<00:01:39.360> level<00:01:39.569> 7

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
though you're cool Fire Dragons level 7

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.419 
though you're cool Fire Dragons level 7
and<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.110> level<00:01:40.350> 15<00:01:40.649> I<00:01:40.740> think<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.069> should<00:01:41.220> feed

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
and not level 15 I think you should feed

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:42.980 
and not level 15 I think you should feed
him<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.670> level<00:01:41.880> 15<00:01:42.149> because<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.600> train<00:01:42.840> it

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
him to level 15 because if you train it

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.839 
him to level 15 because if you train it
then<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.379> gets<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:43.890> powerful<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.459> combat

00:01:44.839 --> 00:01:44.849 
then it gets really powerful in combat

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:45.830 
then it gets really powerful in combat
but<00:01:44.940> you<00:01:45.030> probably<00:01:45.239> won't<00:01:45.360> because<00:01:45.720> you're

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
but you probably won't because you're

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.859 
but you probably won't because you're
saving<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:46.830> just<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.310> tip<00:01:47.519> alright<00:01:48.390> well<00:01:48.599> thank
