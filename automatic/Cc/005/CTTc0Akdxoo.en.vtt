00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.910
 more than an eclipse the poor pedestrians 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.980
 it's done in a year later under the reign of the first powers in the 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.230

 in the future the axor group to circulate on the roads between 7 am 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.479
 and if the victory 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:28.339
 there are 6,793 the pedestrian finally knows the recipes 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.429
 the first should be possible 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:33.519
 in the city of paris 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.160
 from then the public peak 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.919
 pierrot all here is about as many plants 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.919
 that we started wearing the hat with wide brim 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.169
 not long ago the pedestrian had serious problems to do 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.169
 graze in alaska 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:53.549
 actually explained didier specifying that m then the meeting did not have the 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.219
 right to move on the sidewalks of the city 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.219
 the long way of the cross of Christ actually seemed like two minutes 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.089
 when something new happens 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.659
 I do not like talking about him 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:11.750
 the premises despite all the problems that this poses 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.739
 the pedestrian safina market 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.239
 it's still the most popular and very popular form of exercise 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.739
 people continue to walk to work 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.349

 Mass 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.499
 the Tibetan people 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:33.039
 it's up to you to know how to market compostable march 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.529
 where is the market 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:38.399
 they will get used 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.179
 it's up to you 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.319
 the first thing to be good about is the position of the body 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.439
 as for a mini-hdmi output can be raised and for the barrier due to the 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:53.809
 breed a good peaceful position the navy this also allows you to us 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:56.059
 the member who made a serious injury 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.069
 cross the street in full direct between the cars at the stop 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.469
 cross the intersections diagonally 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.699
 walk in traffic as long as there is no sidewalk 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:12.439
 in the second case you have to walk on the left side of the roadway not 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.279
 sure in the island 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.900
 do not forget that when you circulate void you can see 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.659
 cars 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.659
 and that the drivers of why not 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.599
 so it's safe to wear something wider 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.789
 celestini on the sidewalks as far as possible cross to the 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.189
 intersections 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.189
 preferably where stop signals are installed 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:40.969
 look both ways before crossing 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.659
 the car market in the park is gone with the money make sure that 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.810
 all cars came to a standstill before continuing to cross the 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.320
 president you see a roof car obligatorily that the 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.009
 producer times 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.180
 remember that pedestrian crossings are complicated by 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.180
 regulatory barriers and to be still there 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.479
 it belongs only to you to pedestrians 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.199
 and keep you out of the way of cars 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.310

 when you know how to make a balance sheet 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:26.729
