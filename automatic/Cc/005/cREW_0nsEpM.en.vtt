they<00:00:34.560> did<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.520> was<00:00:35.760> actually<00:00:36.449> a<00:00:36.480> really

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
they did it it was actually a really

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.110 
they did it it was actually a really
good<00:00:36.780> idea<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:38.250> reason<00:00:38.579> they<00:00:38.699> did<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.030> was

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
good idea the reason they did it was

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.599 
good idea the reason they did it was
because<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:40.350> whole<00:00:40.379> purpose<00:00:40.859> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.370> shoe

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:41.609 
because the whole purpose of the shoe

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:44.209 
because the whole purpose of the shoe
was<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.120> commemorate<00:00:42.539> when<00:00:43.050> Michael<00:00:43.859> Jordan

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
won the dunk contest in 88 so they

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.910 
won the dunk contest in 88 so they
actually<00:00:47.309> released<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.179> 25<00:00:49.109> years<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.800> the
