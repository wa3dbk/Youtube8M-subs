00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
welcome to our fifth technical problem

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.330 
welcome to our fifth technical problem
how<00:00:23.890> to<00:00:23.919> easily<00:00:24.400> and<00:00:25.020> musically<00:00:26.039> planar<00:00:27.039> page

you

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.550 

when<00:00:39.930> arpeggio<00:00:40.380> is<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.460> like<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.880> scale

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
when arpeggio is just like a scale

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.920 
when arpeggio is just like a scale
except<00:00:43.560> that<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.520> distances<00:00:45.330> between<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
except that the distances between the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.590 
except that the distances between the
notes<00:00:46.350> are<00:00:46.650> bigger<00:00:47.570> right<00:00:49.940> what<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.120> does<00:00:51.360> is

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
notes are bigger right what this does is

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.670 
notes are bigger right what this does is
this<00:00:51.770> amplifies<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.400> challenges<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.680> we

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
this amplifies the challenges that we

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.820 
this amplifies the challenges that we
discovered<00:00:56.309> when<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.580> studied<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.030> scales

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
discovered when we studied the scales

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.180 
discovered when we studied the scales
but<00:00:59.660> no<00:01:00.660> need<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.019> fear<00:01:01.320> we're<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:02.040> to<00:01:02.100> meet

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
but no need to fear we're going to meet

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:11.600 
but no need to fear we're going to meet

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
gotta know is there are two main aspects

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.520 
gotta know is there are two main aspects
to<00:01:50.290> playing<00:01:50.650> this<00:01:51.070> pattern<00:01:51.580> staccato<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
to playing this pattern staccato the

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.690 
to playing this pattern staccato the
first<00:01:53.860> aspect<00:01:54.370> is<00:01:54.870> vertical<00:01:55.870> right<00:01:56.800> you've

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
first aspect is vertical right you've

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.250 
first aspect is vertical right you've
got<00:01:57.910> to<00:01:57.940> do<00:01:58.300> is<00:01:58.450> remember<00:01:58.630> what<00:01:58.990> we<00:01:59.140> already

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
got to do is remember what we already

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.320 
got to do is remember what we already
learned<00:01:59.680> before<00:01:59.890> right<00:02:00.370> is<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:01.030> each

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
learned before right is that each

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.670 
learned before right is that each
staccato<00:02:02.020> note<00:02:02.380> is<00:02:03.100> played<00:02:03.220> as<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.870> separate

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
staccato note is played as a separate

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.350 
staccato note is played as a separate
vertical<00:02:07.020> impulse<00:02:08.670> using<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.760> coordinated

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
vertical impulse using the coordinated

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.210 
vertical impulse using the coordinated
arm<00:02:11.070> hand<00:02:12.070> and<00:02:12.430> finger<00:02:13.360> motion<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.920> by<00:02:15.160> the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
arm hand and finger motion that by the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.979 
arm hand and finger motion that by the
way<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:18.730> can<00:02:18.910> adjust<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.540> get<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.750> whole

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
way you can adjust to get a whole

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.290 
way you can adjust to get a whole
variety<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.530> staccato<00:02:20.950> straight<00:02:21.340> from<00:02:21.670> long

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
variety of staccato straight from long

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:44.030 
variety of staccato straight from long
to<00:02:22.720> short<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.880> second<00:02:40.540> aspect<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:42.209> horizontal

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
to short the second aspect is horizontal

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.410 
to short the second aspect is horizontal
what<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.190> have<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.459> do<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:45.760> find<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.209> right

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
what you have to do is find the right

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.560 
what you have to do is find the right
notes<00:02:46.980> right<00:02:47.980> not<00:02:48.310> by<00:02:48.519> reaching<00:02:48.850> for<00:02:49.420> them

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
notes right not by reaching for them

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.830 
notes right not by reaching for them
with<00:02:50.410> your<00:02:50.650> fingers<00:02:51.310> but<00:02:52.209> by<00:02:52.360> moving<00:02:52.660> your

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
with your fingers but by moving your

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.030 
with your fingers but by moving your
entire<00:02:53.470> arm<00:02:53.950> in<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:55.360> direction<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:56.470> music<00:02:56.890> is

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
entire arm in the direction the music is

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.500 
entire arm in the direction the music is
going<00:02:57.280> right<00:02:58.019> so<00:02:59.019> let's<00:02:59.200> take<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.650> look<00:02:59.890> at<00:02:59.980> that

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
going right so let's take a look at that

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.910 
going right so let's take a look at that
right<00:03:01.510> we<00:03:01.810> don't<00:03:01.959> want<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.140> reach<00:03:02.290> for<00:03:02.320> thumb

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
right we don't want to reach for thumb

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.650 
right we don't want to reach for thumb
here<00:03:03.130> do<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.280> see<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.640> we<00:03:04.269> just<00:03:04.300> want<00:03:04.600> to

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
here do you see that we just want to

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.120 
here do you see that we just want to
move<00:03:04.810> our<00:03:04.989> entire<00:03:05.350> arm<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.970> form<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.870> hand<00:03:08.410> get

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
move our entire arm so form and hand get

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.729 
move our entire arm so form and hand get
our<00:03:09.280> thumb

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
our thumb

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.750 
our thumb
naturally<00:03:11.739> over<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.130> note<00:03:12.340> that's<00:03:12.519> supposed

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
naturally over the note that's supposed

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.540 
naturally over the note that's supposed
to<00:03:12.850> play<00:03:13.030> out<00:03:13.260> having<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.440> reach<00:03:14.920> right<00:03:15.310> let's
