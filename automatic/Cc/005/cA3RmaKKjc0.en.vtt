00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:11.139
 michael 125 and today we will overclock 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:13.930
 RAM and so reboot 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.470
 our computer well, you again this is not 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.470
 will see 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:28.960
 There is a reboot so I already told me 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:33.579
 windows 8 i have 1600 RAM 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.030
 gigahertz press divides to enter 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.030
 bios 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.640
 Here is our beat go tab 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.640
 advanced 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:58.860
 jumper free configuration and here we have 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:03.850
 system configuration 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:09.580
 fragen aphids well or somehow so i'm not very 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:14.289
 in English here we have here here we 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:20.289
 Here I see how you see it costs 1760 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:21.060
 but I already clocked it here 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.130
 will be 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.390
 standard stand well, as if the car will 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:32.200
 stand here you will have cars everywhere 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.659
 this will look like this 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.229
 it will look all this avtoboy 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.319
 It is worth it go to the memory clock tab 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.439
 speed 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:51.810
 so you can put how much you need 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:57.170
 how would I put it on my own 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.939
 so big right here you can 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.060
 overclock 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:07.640
 memory bus here is a manual 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:13.080
 here you can put it as you see 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.650
 on the left you can write from 200 to 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:23.310
 5 550 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:29.640
 Well, I will put 215 even when overclocking 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:32.940
 as you see the game, well, that's 2000 on 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.380
 increased it can increase it if 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.099
 want a mod and here, too, like 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.010
 overclocking 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.819
 This, too, as if the second factor but I 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.209
 post here as you see too 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:53.870
 on the left is written from 100 to 150 I will put 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.870
 100 110 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:06.920
 well, or even let it be 115 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:11.010
 Here we got 2007 gigahertz 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:16.910
 but of course it's all done on your fear 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.910
 and risk so do it carefully 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.100
 go to the exit tab click exit 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.910
 Isaev chance you have a computer shut down 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.480
 turns off and then the clavicle itself 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.579
 that's how you see it turned on more precisely 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:46.069
 do you hear 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:46.069
 here he turned on 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.660
 now he 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.310
 here 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.139
 we went windows 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:21.950
 as you can see everything has loaded well 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:26.030
 show how many gigahertz table memory i 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:31.810
 I can not it you can see you games 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.810
 there or in any applications therefore 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:44.730
 I can't show you all this 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.960
