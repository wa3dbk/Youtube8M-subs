with PCI p0 clients what we're showing

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.689 
with PCI p0 clients what we're showing
here<00:00:15.299> today<00:00:15.360> are<00:00:16.080> two<00:00:16.320> integrated<00:00:16.890> 0<00:00:17.220> clients

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
here today are two integrated 0 clients

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.450 
here today are two integrated 0 clients
where<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.199> pci<00:00:19.500> p0<00:00:19.949> clients<00:00:20.340> are

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
where the the pci p0 clients are

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.970 
where the the pci p0 clients are
embedded<00:00:20.850> right<00:00:21.330> inside<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.900> monitor<00:00:22.289> so

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
embedded right inside the monitor so

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.220 
embedded right inside the monitor so
this<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> very<00:00:23.519> convenient<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.119> very<00:00:24.930> clean

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
this is a very convenient and very clean

this is a very convenient and very clean
presentation<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:26.099> 0<00:00:26.279> clients<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.939> what<00:00:27.900> this

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
presentation for 0 clients and what this

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.380 
presentation for 0 clients and what this
demo<00:00:28.320> shows<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.099> provide<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> one<00:00:29.730> sign<00:00:30.060> with

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
demo shows is in provide a one sign with

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.810 
demo shows is in provide a one sign with
proximity<00:00:30.660> card<00:00:31.199> user<00:00:31.439> authentication<00:00:32.040> so

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
proximity card user authentication so

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.310 
proximity card user authentication so
this<00:00:33.059> allows<00:00:33.329> doctors<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.050> healthcare

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
this allows doctors in the healthcare

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.860 
this allows doctors in the healthcare
deployment<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.309> very<00:00:35.579> quickly<00:00:35.880> access<00:00:36.480> their

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
deployment to very quickly access their

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.840 
deployment to very quickly access their
virtual<00:00:37.290> machines<00:00:37.680> with<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.340> tap<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.579> their

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
virtual machines with the tap that their

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.080 
virtual machines with the tap that their
proximity<00:00:39.210> card<00:00:39.629> as<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> doctor<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.850> very

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
proximity card as a doctor I can very

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.750 
proximity card as a doctor I can very
quickly<00:00:42.180> access<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.500> desktop<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.250> within

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
quickly access my desktop in within

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.440 
quickly access my desktop in within
about<00:00:44.969> 7<00:00:45.360> seconds

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
about 7 seconds

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.520 
about 7 seconds
so<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.690> see<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.960> was<00:00:49.050> very<00:00:49.320> quick

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
so you can see that was very quick

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.369 
so you can see that was very quick
access<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.219> their<00:00:50.340> virtual<00:00:50.550> desktop<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.449> one

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
access to their virtual desktop and one

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.689 
access to their virtual desktop and one
feature<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.579> your

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
feature is that you can have your

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.250 
feature is that you can have your
desktop<00:00:54.090> follow<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.539> wherever<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.079> may<00:00:55.230> roam

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
desktop follow you wherever you may roam

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.010 
desktop follow you wherever you may roam
so<00:00:56.100> if<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:56.699> tapping<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.570> another<00:00:57.809> location

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
so if I'm tapping it in another location

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.650 
so if I'm tapping it in another location
I'll<00:00:58.890> automatically<00:00:59.550> be<00:00:59.789> logged<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.570> my

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
I'll automatically be logged out of my

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.080 
I'll automatically be logged out of my
session<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.760> reconnect<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.910> my

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
session here and reconnect it to my

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.859 
session here and reconnect it to my
session<00:01:03.329> over<00:01:04.229> at<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> second<00:01:04.769> zero<00:01:04.890> client

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
session over at the second zero client

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.340 
session over at the second zero client
and<00:01:06.979> for<00:01:07.979> very<00:01:08.159> quick<00:01:08.930> tap<00:01:09.930> out

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and for very quick tap out

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.530 
and for very quick tap out
you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.770> log<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.280> your<00:01:11.490> session<00:01:11.729> very

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
you can log out of your session very

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.070 
you can log out of your session very
fast<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.189> that

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
fast and this is you can see that

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.300 
fast and this is you can see that
immediately<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.259> doctor<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.920> logged<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.250> of

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
immediately the doctor is logged out of

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.390 
immediately the doctor is logged out of
their<00:01:17.520> session<00:01:18.560> so<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.130> many

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
their session so this is one of many

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.280 
their session so this is one of many
