00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 so people like him back to the 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.180
 100 of formosa is already the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.830
 multiplayer yes on the roof on the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.660
 cat is what it looks like and us 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.460
 have 24 seconds wait from what can 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.049
 we can already be well informed 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.060
 how come we look at best lists 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.130
 the best of his team deathmatch what 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.529
 okay i have one of the friend of the 26th 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.099
 best of the world is flashing germany who 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.410
 you are a bit 22% of the world 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.859
 but you celebrity here are here 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.850
 and then here by james seems to demand 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.820
 All of them are here in 3rd place 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.410
 No one can do that with me in 1864 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.340
 live for that I do not know three 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.510
 hours or so 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.399
 until now plays I am to fly 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.989
 I would say here we play 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.789
 this card does not match the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.050
 scientist but with the destroyer 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.280
 why the destroyer destroy that 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.640
 You can as I said and if the mirror 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.210
 then we can start 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.729
 20 seconds but it has me the 23 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.290
 best of the world in team deathmatch what 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.170
 for famous what famous spectators 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.659
 So I really got involved 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.270
 bit proud here this is my videos 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.650
 but not so bad and me 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.909
 not so bad games or yes 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.720
 okay that has nothing to do with it but 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:28.110
 I do not play so bad 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:30.560
 no matter that bad also play back 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.000
 on the team wins 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.310
 okay I'm saying, I'm here now 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.079
 with the destroyer the first occurs 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:44.520
 very convenient because of the barrier 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:48.390
 Maps as very small are dramatic 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.380
 but that I mean my way 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.380
 ok forward 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.040
 why is it going to work its why ? 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.970
 That's why you 're a barrier 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.369
 just made no sense but something 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.050
 from no sense 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:13.030
 the opponents on 4 0 I have no kill 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:15.420
 please reward every 3g i feel 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.800
 me so marginally okay again 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.400
 I know but in the end where here 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.400
 the opponents are 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.750
 that's how they once did that 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.200
 Take energy with you while you're away 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:40.960
 and also up but we stay 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.960
 always the ultrasound 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.569
 there you can say now I'm running 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.940
 not always 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:56.239
 I do not know why they get me full in 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.239
 the purely run away but his opponent 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.750
 but thanks for that , okay 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.150
 that you are now the barrier 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.700
 put up or wait for Horst comes 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.700
 someone and there very compact 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.870
 there we come from where more hidden 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.870
 yourself 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.380
 okay he just got my ass here 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.760
 saved my teammate thank you 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.090
 teammate that you saved my ass 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.500
 Has 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.120
 I can not find any on the map 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.540
 single button, I always believe so 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.540
 him over 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.890
 mohammadi why should acid here 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.660
 for me not nice I would 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.220
 not with acid on you fully in common 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.020
 done with the teammate of the others 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.090
 I believe the idea where to go 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.420
 or not matter we see one here 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.750
 beautiful earth somehow 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.090
 does not say but she is beautiful 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:12.130
 it is always a honor and it's the 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:15.120
 but can cybertron gaal merged 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.120
 stolen 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:29.340
 have you seen so, though 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:34.110
 so sorry but they have now in the 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:37.340
 weggeboxt the air was really nice 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.650
 he was really close she was okay 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.979
 why average recordings here with sms 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.790
 throw away the text 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.139
 well then I'm now on the 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.810
 floor thrown 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:52.710
 no matter cacaus handy it needs if you 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.300
 even before we must we would have one 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.979
 good question people who of you has 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.360
 Foremost home stand you know him yet 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.650
 already photos are not just a game 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.139
 and not only that, but there are, too 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.310
 this beautiful little figure 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:09.350
 Do you care if any of you 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:15.990
 such figures of the opponents 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:17.970
 that was the shit that has to create 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.580
 but it is so I have it at least 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.130
 once read somewhere that in the 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.630
 last pages performance error 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.630
 Overall, the main game 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.169
 and that's special online 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:40.850
 notice I have at least been 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:43.820
 but that is not the case, but yes 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:48.380
 weggeboxt looks good from the 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.240
 destroyed our box again 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.150
 old familiar question where hide the 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.479
 my opponent had cool rockets 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.080
 I do not know what they are doing 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.080
 are not that much off 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:10.789
 That's where you came from behind 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:14.830
 he does not ask for a chance just like that 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:19.719
 Of course, nobody is mine yet 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.719
 she is 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.510
 oh and my teammates after fucking 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.120
 on 7 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.990
 i am a lone guner i have 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:49.200
 previously said I'm not 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:51.080
 lone fighter i know for the hammer 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.080
 Handy again a little 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.080
 playmate 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:02.940
 that's a destroyer 2 level up 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:08.750
 I would not say we are bad 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.750
 were second with ten points 8 kiss 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.440
 people if you are not there that me 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.030
 a lot is possible we make a cache 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.070
 but deducting is no longer work 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:24.680
 of format from the side of the multiplayer 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.680
 to then your skin Felix purely Zschau
