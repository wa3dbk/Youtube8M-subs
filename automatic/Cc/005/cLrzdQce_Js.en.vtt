00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
you would have to i think it'll be like

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.200 
you would have to i think it'll be like
shouting<00:02:35.510> someone<00:02:35.870> four<00:02:36.050> times

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
shouting someone four times

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.600 
shouting someone four times
or<00:02:37.300> like<00:02:37.480> give<00:02:38.290> example<00:02:38.680> for<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:39.340> but<00:02:39.460> you<00:02:39.580> are

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
or like give example for it but you are

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.490 
or like give example for it but you are
yeah<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:41.620> shots<00:02:42.840> that's<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.170> unique

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
yeah like shots that's the unique

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.310 
yeah like shots that's the unique
movement<00:02:44.800> kind<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.400> do<00:02:45.490> it<00:02:45.580> all<00:02:46.050> unique<00:02:47.050> moving

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
movement kind of do it all unique moving

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.040 
movement kind of do it all unique moving
off<00:02:47.440> stage<00:02:47.770> but<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.250> guess<00:02:48.490> you<00:02:48.850> know<00:02:49.810> earlier

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
off stage but I guess you know earlier

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.870 
off stage but I guess you know earlier
we're<00:02:50.140> talking<00:02:50.410> about<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.590> hundred<00:02:51.100> reaction

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
we're talking about a hundred reaction

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.000 
we're talking about a hundred reaction
at<00:02:51.970> once<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.300> think<00:02:52.480> rules<00:02:52.750> reaction<00:02:53.230> we<00:02:53.800> nearly

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
at once I think rules reaction we nearly

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.830 
at once I think rules reaction we nearly
forward<00:02:54.340> beat<00:02:54.460> off<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.850> it's<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.240> hard<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.600> do

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
forward beat off and it's so hard to do

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.930 
forward beat off and it's so hard to do
because<00:02:56.560> you'll<00:02:56.830> expect<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.130> do<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:57.310> all

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
because you'll expect to do that all

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.360 
because you'll expect to do that all
right<00:02:58.030> let's<00:02:58.240> do<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.570> but<00:02:59.440> Charlotte<00:02:59.950> the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
right let's do that but Charlotte the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.030 
right let's do that but Charlotte the
choice<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.990> i<00:03:02.110> think<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.440> way<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.650> react<00:03:03.010> to

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
choice and i think the way to react to

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.460 
choice and i think the way to react to
that<00:03:03.220> is<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.850> realize<00:03:04.330> your<00:03:04.600> own<00:03:04.630> mistake<00:03:05.260> on

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
that is to realize your own mistake on

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.650 
that is to realize your own mistake on
your<00:03:05.680> hand<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:06.430> think<00:03:06.730> realizing<00:03:07.600> the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
your hand I think realizing the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.510 
your hand I think realizing the
on-screen<00:03:07.990> and<00:03:08.320> reality<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.800> audio<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.310> is

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
on-screen and reality the audio to is

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.400 
on-screen and reality the audio to is
harder<00:03:09.940> than<00:03:10.090> realizing<00:03:10.390> your<00:03:10.660> own<00:03:10.780> physical

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
harder than realizing your own physical

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.230 
harder than realizing your own physical
yeah<00:03:11.920> especially<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.880> mean<00:03:13.030> if<00:03:13.090> you're<00:03:13.180> not
