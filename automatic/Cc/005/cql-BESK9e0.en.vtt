checked out immediately which is like

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.110 
checked out immediately which is like
it's<00:02:54.950> all<00:02:55.100> about<00:02:55.220> awareness<00:02:55.340> what<00:02:55.910> it's<00:02:56.030> about

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
it's all about awareness what it's about

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.509 
it's all about awareness what it's about
I<00:02:56.420> really<00:02:56.810> think<00:02:56.989> that<00:02:57.200> this<00:02:57.410> gives<00:02:57.980> awareness

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
I really think that this gives awareness

I really think that this gives awareness
and<00:02:58.790> really<00:02:59.300> opens<00:02:59.780> not<00:03:00.320> only<00:03:00.470> my<00:03:00.680> eyes<00:03:00.860> but

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
and really opens not only my eyes but

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.979 
and really opens not only my eyes but
everyone<00:03:01.519> else<00:03:01.670> is<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.120> see<00:03:02.300> wow<00:03:02.540> you<00:03:02.600> know

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
everyone else is to see wow you know

everyone else is to see wow you know
that<00:03:03.200> this<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.310> is<00:03:04.760> huge<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.360> is<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.510> really<00:03:05.900> big

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
that this it is huge it is a really big

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.259 
that this it is huge it is a really big
deal<00:03:06.260> one<00:03:06.830> of<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.010> unique<00:03:07.880> things<00:03:07.940> about

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
deal one of the unique things about

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.300 
deal one of the unique things about
colon<00:03:08.690> cancer<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.200> why<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.620> feel<00:03:09.890> strongly

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
colon cancer and why I feel strongly

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.850 
colon cancer and why I feel strongly
about<00:03:10.519> early<00:03:11.060> detection<00:03:11.180> is<00:03:11.750> if<00:03:11.989> you<00:03:12.230> do<00:03:12.530> catch

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
about early detection is if you do catch

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.910 
about early detection is if you do catch
it<00:03:12.890> early<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:14.630> cure<00:03:14.900> rate<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.170> high<00:03:15.380> since

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
it early the cure rate is high since

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.059 
it early the cure rate is high since
this<00:03:16.160> is<00:03:16.370> such<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.700> curable<00:03:17.360> disease

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
this is such a curable disease

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.399 
this is such a curable disease
I<00:03:18.129> think<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.909> best<00:03:19.180> way<00:03:19.329> to<00:03:19.480> approach<00:03:19.810> this<00:03:19.870> is

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
I think the best way to approach this is

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.869 
I think the best way to approach this is
prevention<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.450> early<00:03:22.450> detection

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
prevention and early detection

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.280 
prevention and early detection

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
hard actually it is because of because

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.410 
hard actually it is because of because
of<00:03:29.049> our<00:03:29.230> government's<00:03:29.769> inaction<00:03:30.129> and<00:03:30.939> and

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
and it would be all worth it and that's

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.030 
and it would be all worth it and that's

could<00:04:30.039> be<00:04:30.159> saved<00:04:30.460> by<00:04:30.820> just<00:04:31.599> the<00:04:31.930> awareness

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
could be saved by just the awareness

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.010

that<00:04:32.470> this<00:04:33.159> whole<00:04:33.699> you<00:04:34.090> know<00:04:34.240> is<00:04:34.509> that<00:04:34.659> bring

that this whole you know is that bring

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
unique in the aspect of a philanthropy

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.760 
unique in the aspect of a philanthropy
based<00:04:48.789> event<00:04:49.360> like<00:04:49.690> this<00:04:49.870> for<00:04:50.169> sorority<00:04:50.590> so

based event like this for sorority so
we're<00:04:50.889> really<00:04:51.039> hoping<00:04:51.370> that<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:52.210> theme<00:04:52.389> and

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.149 
we're really hoping that the theme and
the<00:04:52.570> idea<00:04:52.900> catches<00:04:53.289> on<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:53.650> that<00:04:53.830> we<00:04:53.919> can<00:04:54.070> come

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
the idea catches on and that we can come

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:56.219 
the idea catches on and that we can come
back<00:04:54.280> next<00:04:54.520> year<00:04:54.639> I<00:04:54.909> think<00:04:55.330> we<00:04:55.479> should<00:04:55.509> do<00:04:56.139> it

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229

in<00:04:56.349> more<00:04:56.590> places<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:57.280> think<00:04:57.880> we<00:04:57.970> should<00:04:58.120> do<00:04:58.270> it

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
in more places I think we should do it

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.770 
in more places I think we should do it
yearly<00:04:58.659> here<00:04:59.110> in<00:04:59.229> Tucson<00:04:59.740> and<00:04:59.919> and<00:05:00.729> and<00:05:01.030> expand
