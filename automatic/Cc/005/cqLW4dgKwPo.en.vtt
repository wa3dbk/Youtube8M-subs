00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.990
 little by little with a theme is a collection of bronze pieces 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.059
 introduction to mathematics aimed at girls and boys between 4 and 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.259
 8 years old 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.259
 the protagonist of this adventure is the rabbit tell 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.819
 turned this time into a report 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:28.989
 the ultimate goal of champions is to return safely to the land to 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.249
 it must explore different planets 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.790
 in each of which is funny characters that pose 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:36.260
 unique challenges 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.920
 certainly each of these exercises 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.110
 is a powerful and entertaining vehicle to apply concepts and skills 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.350
 mathematics designed by a team of mathematical experts is the collection 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.590
 of more complex and rich mathematics of the market 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.680
 It consists of varied environments 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.370
 with funny characters and with more than 50 different activities 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.260
 In addition to the interactive exercises each CD ROM contains printable material 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
 to be used in the classroom or at home 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.730
 all the state of health 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.270
 can the uneasiness 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.350
 we believe 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.770
 musical themes in karaoke environment video clip format and a complete guide of 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.240
 use for teachers and parents in mathematics 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.190
 covers a wide range of pedagogical objectives that includes dismissals with 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.210
 turn on the concept of the number as the number of elements in a collection 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.890
 They detected irregularities in the numbering system 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.700
 -express sequences and count collection to understand the concepts of 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.390
 addition and subtraction use them to solve problematic situations 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.440
 In short, all the objectives and resources necessary for children 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.230
 develop mathematical thinking 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.100
 both the most advantaged children and those who require reinforcements and 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.830
 Special attentions will benefit with this powerful tools 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.830
