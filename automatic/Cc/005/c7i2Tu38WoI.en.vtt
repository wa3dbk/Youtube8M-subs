Madden the entire defense is not

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.460 
Madden the entire defense is not
reacting<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.730> this<00:01:05.850> juke<00:01:06.300> because<00:01:07.230> it's<00:01:07.410> not

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
reacting to this juke because it's not

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.050 
reacting to this juke because it's not
in<00:01:07.800> their<00:01:07.980> direct<00:01:08.340> vicinity<00:01:08.490> now<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
in their direct vicinity now the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.150 
in their direct vicinity now the
defensive<00:01:09.630> tackle<00:01:09.990> there<00:01:10.140> does<00:01:10.380> because<00:01:10.980> he's

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
defensive tackle there does because he's

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.470 
defensive tackle there does because he's
close<00:01:11.400> enough<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.820> kind<00:01:11.940> of<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.180> an<00:01:12.270> impact

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
close enough to kind of have an impact

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.270 
close enough to kind of have an impact
on<00:01:12.660> the<00:01:12.810> play<00:01:13.050> but<00:01:13.590> other<00:01:13.740> than<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.040> the

entire defense does not react to a juke
at<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> line<00:01:17.760> of<00:01:17.790> scrimmage<00:01:17.940> and<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.420> course

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
at the line of scrimmage and of course

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.260 
at the line of scrimmage and of course
we<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.050> a<00:01:19.080> lot<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.350> terms<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.310> madden<00:01:20.670> now

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
we see that a lot in terms of madden now

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.820 
we see that a lot in terms of madden now
obviously<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.140> an<00:01:22.230> animation<00:01:22.560> based

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
obviously this was an animation based

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.220 
obviously this was an animation based
game<00:01:23.159> we'll<00:01:23.760> talk<00:01:23.970> about<00:01:24.090> interactions<00:01:25.050> in

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
game we'll talk about interactions in

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.560 
game we'll talk about interactions in
terms<00:01:25.440> of<00:01:25.560> blocking<00:01:26.010> that<00:01:26.130> show<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.760> realistic

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
terms of blocking that show a realistic

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.810 
terms of blocking that show a realistic
presence<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.170> speed<00:01:28.830> momentum<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.640> weight

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
presence of speed momentum and weight

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.640 
presence of speed momentum and weight
get<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.510> great<00:01:30.750> example<00:01:31.020> here<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.470> John

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
get a great example here with John

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.740 
get a great example here with John
Mackey<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.130> he<00:01:32.250> comes<00:01:32.490> off<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> line<00:01:33.030> trying<00:01:33.690> to

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
Mackey as he comes off a line trying to

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.600 
Mackey as he comes off a line trying to
block<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> linebacker<00:01:34.560> kind<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.010> engages<00:01:35.490> from

block a linebacker kind of engages from

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.880 
block a linebacker kind of engages from
the<00:01:35.700> side<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.080> pushes<00:01:37.560> him<00:01:37.740> out

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the side and really just pushes him out

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.770 
the side and really just pushes him out
of<00:01:38.010> the<00:01:38.070> play<00:01:38.340> more<00:01:39.030> than<00:01:39.120> blocking<00:01:39.420> him

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
of the play more than blocking him

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.500 
of the play more than blocking him
however<00:01:40.580> when<00:01:41.580> you<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.850> cornerback<00:01:42.180> come

hand out and just kind of you know hand

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.840 
hand out and just kind of you know hand
fights<00:02:31.200> him<00:02:31.380> down<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.709> field<00:02:31.980> obviously

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
fights him down the field obviously

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.240 
fights him down the field obviously
knowing<00:02:33.450> he's<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.660> larger<00:02:34.170> man<00:02:34.380> but<00:02:34.620> lacks<00:02:35.100> the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
knowing he's a larger man but lacks the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.210 
knowing he's a larger man but lacks the
speed<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.850> maintain<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.720> block<00:02:37.170> on<00:02:37.200> him<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.130> you

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
speed to maintain a block on him and you

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.130 
speed to maintain a block on him and you
can<00:02:38.370> see<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.730> evidently<00:02:39.330> Willie<00:02:39.720> Wood<00:02:39.930> will

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
can see it evidently Willie Wood will

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.770 
can see it evidently Willie Wood will
turn<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.500> corner<00:02:40.890> eventually<00:02:41.550> but<00:02:42.209> that

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
turn the corner eventually but that

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.479 
turn the corner eventually but that
block<00:02:43.020> isn't<00:02:43.260> going<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.530> be<00:02:43.650> as<00:02:43.830> successful<00:02:44.100> as

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
block isn't going to be as successful as

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.979 
block isn't going to be as successful as
it<00:02:44.550> would<00:02:44.730> be<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:44.970> perhaps<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.600> was<00:02:45.690> maybe<00:02:45.870> a

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
it would be if perhaps that was maybe a

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.199 
it would be if perhaps that was maybe a
fullback<00:02:46.530> trying<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.340> execute<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.820> block

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209

now<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.810> other<00:02:49.020> thing<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.320> want<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.500> talk<00:02:49.680> about

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
now the other thing I want to talk about

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.280 
now the other thing I want to talk about
is<00:02:50.100> running<00:02:50.459> through<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:51.120> block<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.019> this<00:02:52.140> is

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
is running through a block and this is

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.750 
is running through a block and this is
something<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.650> again<00:02:52.980> Madden<00:02:53.640> has<00:02:53.670> a

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
something that again Madden has a

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.100 
something that again Madden has a
problem<00:02:54.120> with<00:02:54.239> in<00:02:54.390> terms<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.690> being<00:02:54.840> able<00:02:54.900> to

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
players but defender's as well and when

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.620 
players but defender's as well and when
we<00:03:02.340> see<00:03:02.489> Roger<00:03:02.700> Craig<00:03:03.060> going<00:03:03.090> through<00:03:03.480> this

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
we see Roger Craig going through this

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.140 
we see Roger Craig going through this
you're<00:03:04.380> going<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.590> see<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.280> containment<00:03:05.790> of

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
you're going to see the containment of

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.900 
you're going to see the containment of
the<00:03:06.930> block<00:03:07.230> being<00:03:07.800> lost<00:03:08.100> in<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.459> linebacker

diving attempt at tackling me and I

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.470 
diving attempt at tackling me and I
realize<00:03:17.190> there's<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.610> lot<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.760> motion<00:03:18.150> shifting

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
realize there's a lot of motion shifting

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.150 
realize there's a lot of motion shifting
there's<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.660> lot<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.810> warping<00:03:19.230> here<00:03:19.410> but<00:03:20.010> that's

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
there's a lot of warping here but that's

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.500 
there's a lot of warping here but that's
always<00:03:20.370> been<00:03:20.640> things<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:21.060> I've<00:03:21.180> been<00:03:21.299> more

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
always been things that I've been more

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.270 
always been things that I've been more
than<00:03:21.540> willing<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.959> deal<00:03:22.140> with<00:03:22.350> in<00:03:22.530> terms<00:03:23.040> of

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.310 
than willing to deal with in terms of
keeping<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.700> game<00:03:23.970> realistic<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:24.930> looking<00:03:25.200> at

they've<00:03:27.030> been<00:03:27.180> respected<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.350> when<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.709> see

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
they've been respected so when I can see

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.920 
they've been respected so when I can see
kind<00:03:29.070> of<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.280> reaching<00:03:29.790> tackle<00:03:30.239> made<00:03:30.420> here<00:03:30.750> and

what's being done here in a football

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.710 
what's being done here in a football
sense<00:03:44.040> now<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.700> course<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.209> interaction

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
sense now of course this interaction

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.650 
sense now of course this interaction
puts<00:03:46.590> me<00:03:46.769> in<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.040> pretty<00:03:47.280> good<00:03:47.430> perspective<00:03:47.730> to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
puts me in a pretty good perspective to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.080 
puts me in a pretty good perspective to
be<00:03:48.840> running<00:03:49.530> into<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.250> back<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.459> cliff<00:03:50.850> branch

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
be running into the back of cliff branch

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.900 
be running into the back of cliff branch
as<00:03:51.360> he<00:03:51.510> goes<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.900> block<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.950> other<00:03:53.160> safety<00:03:53.519> but

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
as he goes to block the other safety but

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.400 
as he goes to block the other safety but
I<00:03:53.940> have<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.269> interact<00:03:54.480> with<00:03:54.690> branch<00:03:55.019> as<00:03:55.200> well

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
I have to interact with branch as well

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.229 
I have to interact with branch as well
you<00:03:55.920> can<00:03:56.070> see<00:03:56.250> again<00:03:56.579> there's<00:03:56.910> going<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.120> be<00:03:57.150> a

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
you can see again there's going to be a

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.699 
you can see again there's going to be a
little<00:03:57.450> bit<00:03:57.600> of<00:03:57.690> shifting<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.170> warping<00:03:58.500> here

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
little bit of shifting and warping here

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.440 
little bit of shifting and warping here
but<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.280> can<00:03:59.459> accept<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.910> because<00:04:00.180> I'm

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
but I can accept that because I'm

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.660 
but I can accept that because I'm
putting<00:04:00.750> my<00:04:00.840> hand<00:04:01.170> out<00:04:01.350> on<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:02.040> back<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.250> cliff

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
putting my hand out on the back of cliff

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.300 
putting my hand out on the back of cliff
branch<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.090> I'm<00:04:03.180> steering<00:04:03.600> myself<00:04:04.230> off<00:04:04.500> him

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
branch and I'm steering myself off him

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.180 
branch and I'm steering myself off him
so<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.180> can<00:04:06.269> run<00:04:06.570> down<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.930> field<00:04:07.130> now<00:04:08.130> the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
so that I can run down the field now the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.310 
so that I can run down the field now the
last<00:04:08.640> thing<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:08.940> want<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.120> talk<00:04:09.269> about<00:04:09.329> is<00:04:09.720> some

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
last thing I want to talk about is some

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.440 
last thing I want to talk about is some
pursuit<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:10.890> head<00:04:11.070> tracking<00:04:11.400> which<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:11.910> done

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
pursuit and head tracking which is done

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.050 
pursuit and head tracking which is done
very<00:04:12.690> well<00:04:12.780> by<00:04:12.989> Carl<00:04:13.350> banks<00:04:13.609> go<00:04:14.609> back<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:14.970> take

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
very well by Carl banks go back and take

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.759 
very well by Carl banks go back and take
a<00:04:15.120> look<00:04:15.359> one<00:04:15.570> thing<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.810> don't<00:04:15.870> like<00:04:16.200> is<00:04:16.380> there

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
a look one thing I don't like is there

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.409 
a look one thing I don't like is there
really<00:04:16.950> isn't<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.370> lot<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.609> foot<00:04:17.850> planning<00:04:18.269> and

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
really isn't a lot of foot planning and

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.120 
really isn't a lot of foot planning and
this<00:04:18.840> example<00:04:19.229> you<00:04:19.380> can<00:04:19.440> see<00:04:19.530> Carl<00:04:19.919> banks

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
this example you can see Carl banks

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.130 
this example you can see Carl banks
comes<00:04:20.459> out<00:04:20.640> of<00:04:20.760> his<00:04:20.820> stance<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.510> then<00:04:22.019> he's

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
comes out of his stance and then he's

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.800 
comes out of his stance and then he's
able<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.470> pretty<00:04:22.680> seamlessly<00:04:23.280> make<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.180> pretty

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
able to pretty seamlessly make a pretty

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.350 
able to pretty seamlessly make a pretty
tight<00:04:25.110> turn<00:04:25.440> in<00:04:25.740> only<00:04:26.190> one<00:04:26.490> or<00:04:26.610> two<00:04:26.640> strides

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
tight turn in only one or two strides

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.330 
tight turn in only one or two strides
like<00:04:27.509> to<00:04:27.629> see<00:04:27.780> maybe<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.229> shorter<00:04:28.919> stride<00:04:29.280> out

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
like to see maybe a shorter stride out

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.850 
like to see maybe a shorter stride out
of<00:04:29.669> a<00:04:29.729> player<00:04:30.030> run<00:04:30.750> a<00:04:30.780> complete<00:04:30.990> circle<00:04:31.650> on<00:04:31.740> the

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
of a player run a complete circle on the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.279 
of a player run a complete circle on the
field<00:04:32.099> but<00:04:32.639> nevertheless<00:04:32.909> he's<00:04:33.870> not<00:04:34.080> going<00:04:34.259> to

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
field but nevertheless he's not going to

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.309 
field but nevertheless he's not going to
react<00:04:34.919> to<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:36.210> Juke<00:04:36.509> he's<00:04:36.930> not<00:04:37.110> going<00:04:37.289> to

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.159 
react to the Juke he's not going to
react<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:38.490> diving<00:04:39.030> tackle<00:04:39.240> attempt<00:04:39.810> he's

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
react to the diving tackle attempt he's

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.260 
react to the diving tackle attempt he's
not<00:04:40.349> going<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.530> react<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:41.129> me<00:04:41.669> running<00:04:42.120> off

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
not going to react to me running off

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.540 
not going to react to me running off
cliff<00:04:42.569> branch<00:04:42.810> he's<00:04:43.050> going<00:04:43.229> to<00:04:43.289> maintain

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
cliff branch he's going to maintain

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.399 
cliff branch he's going to maintain
pretty<00:04:44.550> good<00:04:44.789> pursuit<00:04:45.210> one<00:04:45.569> angle<00:04:46.050> down<00:04:46.259> the

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:46.409 
pretty good pursuit one angle down the

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.159 
pretty good pursuit one angle down the

time and head tracking to me is

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.040 
time and head tracking to me is
important<00:04:50.939> when<00:04:51.270> we<00:04:51.360> talk<00:04:51.389> about<00:04:51.539> looking<00:04:51.840> in

madden is blocking being held and the

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.339 
madden is blocking being held and the
reason<00:05:24.270> I'm<00:05:24.360> bringing<00:05:24.389> that<00:05:24.779> up<00:05:24.960> as<00:05:25.080> you<00:05:25.199> can

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
reason I'm bringing that up as you can

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.860 
reason I'm bringing that up as you can
see<00:05:25.560> this<00:05:26.009> is<00:05:26.189> the<00:05:26.219> 40-yard<00:05:26.789> line<00:05:26.879> if<00:05:27.389> we<00:05:27.750> go

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
see this is the 40-yard line if we go

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.890 
see this is the 40-yard line if we go
back<00:05:28.110> to<00:05:28.529> the<00:05:29.219> 20<00:05:29.639> you're<00:05:30.330> going<00:05:30.479> to<00:05:30.539> see<00:05:30.779> an

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
back to the 20 you're going to see an

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.570 
back to the 20 you're going to see an
interaction<00:05:31.529> here<00:05:31.770> that<00:05:32.039> starts<00:05:32.400> at<00:05:32.490> the

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
interaction here that starts at the

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.850 
interaction here that starts at the
beginning<00:05:32.669> of<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.029> play<00:05:33.180> and<00:05:33.539> basically<00:05:34.319> goes

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
beginning of the play and basically goes

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.339 
beginning of the play and basically goes
the<00:05:35.219> entire<00:05:35.610> duration<00:05:35.909> of<00:05:36.330> it<00:05:36.930> even<00:05:37.139> though

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
the entire duration of it even though

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.760 
the entire duration of it even though
it's<00:05:37.529> 60<00:05:38.009> yards<00:05:38.520> away<00:05:38.699> from<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.750> action<00:05:40.139> you

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
it's 60 yards away from the action you

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.189 
it's 60 yards away from the action you
see<00:05:40.949> number<00:05:41.099> 76<00:05:41.819> kind<00:05:42.120> of<00:05:42.210> gets<00:05:42.360> almost<00:05:42.870> a

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
see number 76 kind of gets almost a

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.579 
see number 76 kind of gets almost a
double<00:05:43.529> team<00:05:43.710> block<00:05:44.039> here<00:05:44.430> on<00:05:44.610> Upshaw<00:05:45.589> pushes

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:46.589 
double team block here on Upshaw pushes

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:48.769 
double team block here on Upshaw pushes
him<00:05:46.740> out<00:05:46.860> of<00:05:47.009> the<00:05:47.069> play<00:05:47.370> and<00:05:47.639> then<00:05:48.180> holds<00:05:48.629> this

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:48.779 
him out of the play and then holds this

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:51.050 
him out of the play and then holds this
block<00:05:49.169> even<00:05:49.949> though<00:05:50.039> Upshaw<00:05:50.400> has<00:05:50.430> zero<00:05:50.969> chance

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
block even though Upshaw has zero chance

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.990 
block even though Upshaw has zero chance
really<00:05:51.930> of<00:05:52.139> impacting<00:05:52.650> this<00:05:52.800> play<00:05:53.099> holds<00:05:53.879> this

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
and then of course at the end you're

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.899 
and then of course at the end you're
going<00:06:04.650> to<00:06:04.710> see<00:06:04.830> kind<00:06:05.069> of<00:06:05.159> a<00:06:05.250> little<00:06:05.430> taunting

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909

this on a run play is pretty impressive

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.439

considering in Madden we have issues

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.659 
considering in Madden we have issues
with<00:06:12.629> flux<00:06:12.990> being<00:06:13.259> held<00:06:13.439> for<00:06:13.500> seconds<00:06:14.099> so

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
with flux being held for seconds so

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:17.570 
with flux being held for seconds so
