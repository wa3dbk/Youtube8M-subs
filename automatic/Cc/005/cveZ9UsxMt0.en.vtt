00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.480 

check<00:04:44.020> out<00:04:44.169> how<00:04:44.289> neatly<00:04:44.560> this<00:04:44.860> area<00:04:45.129> is<00:04:45.250> being

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
check out how neatly this area is being

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.390
