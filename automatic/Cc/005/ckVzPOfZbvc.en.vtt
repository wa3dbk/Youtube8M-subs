in<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.170> video<00:00:25.470> we're<00:00:25.770> going<00:00:25.860> to<00:00:25.950> actually

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
in this video we're going to actually

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.150 
in this video we're going to actually
have<00:00:26.370> three<00:00:26.760> separate<00:00:27.350> clips<00:00:28.350> the<00:00:28.740> first<00:00:28.980> one

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
have three separate clips the first one

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.000 
have three separate clips the first one
is<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.280> lone<00:00:29.490> boar<00:00:30.170> where<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.290> use<00:00:31.440> thermal<00:00:31.890> to

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
is a lone boar where we use thermal to

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
is a lone boar where we use thermal to
take<00:00:32.190> them<00:00:32.370> out<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:33.660> second<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.850> be

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
take them out the second is going to be

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.540 
take them out the second is going to be
the<00:00:36.960> same<00:00:37.170> group<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.710> filmed<00:00:38.100> through<00:00:38.340> two

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the same group we filmed through two

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.570 
the same group we filmed through two
different<00:00:38.730> scopes<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:40.170> through<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> W<00:00:40.890> 1000

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
different scopes one through the W 1000

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.940 
different scopes one through the W 1000
thermal<00:00:41.910> scope<00:00:42.150> and<00:00:42.420> then<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.440> second<00:00:43.830> video

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
thermal scope and then the second video

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.299 
thermal scope and then the second video
will<00:00:44.370> be<00:00:44.660> through<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> Pulsar<00:00:46.670> n750<00:00:47.670> scope<00:00:49.309> just

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
will be through a Pulsar n750 scope just

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.229 
will be through a Pulsar n750 scope just
three<00:00:50.580> to<00:00:50.790> one<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.360> then<00:00:51.600> spire<00:00:53.000> just<00:00:54.000> turns

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
three to one and then spire just turns

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:03.110 
three to one and then spire just turns
broadside<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:59.060> are<00:01:00.060> you<00:01:00.180> ready<00:01:02.120> three

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
broadside to this are you ready three

broadside to this are you ready three
two<00:01:05.869> one<00:01:09.890> went<00:01:10.890> straight<00:01:10.979> down

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.190 

now<00:01:17.229> this<00:01:17.380> will<00:01:17.500> be<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.770> thermal<00:01:18.299> part<00:01:19.299> of<00:01:19.659> the

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
now this will be the thermal part of the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.219 
now this will be the thermal part of the
second<00:01:20.619> group<00:01:21.539> you'll<00:01:22.539> be<00:01:22.659> able<00:01:22.719> to<00:01:22.869> see<00:01:23.020> these

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
second group you'll be able to see these

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.919 
second group you'll be able to see these
hogs<00:01:23.770> they're<00:01:24.329> eating<00:01:25.329> the<00:01:25.420> seeds<00:01:25.659> off<00:01:25.899> the

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
hogs they're eating the seeds off the

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:27.539 
hogs they're eating the seeds off the
top<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.439> these<00:01:26.530> weeds<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:27.009> can't<00:01:27.250> see<00:01:27.429> it

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
top of these weeds you can't see it

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:28.859 
top of these weeds you can't see it
within<00:01:27.729> thermal<00:01:28.179> because<00:01:28.270> you're<00:01:28.479> cutting

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
within thermal because you're cutting

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.200 
within thermal because you're cutting
through<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.259> grass<00:01:29.500> when<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:30.609> when<00:01:30.969> it<00:01:31.060> gets

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
through the grass when you when it gets

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.840 
through the grass when you when it gets
to<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:32.219> digital<00:01:33.219> night<00:01:33.369> vision<00:01:33.429> you'll

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
to the digital night vision you'll

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.109 
to the digital night vision you'll
actually<00:01:34.030> be<00:01:34.240> able<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.539> see<00:01:34.719> the<00:01:34.840> grass<00:01:39.119> this

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
actually be able to see the grass this

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.319 
actually be able to see the grass this
was<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.420> high<00:01:40.990> humidity<00:01:41.200> night<00:01:41.770> so<00:01:42.189> it<00:01:42.969> was<00:01:43.030> one

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
was a high humidity night so it was one

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:44.999 
was a high humidity night so it was one
of<00:01:43.359> the<00:01:43.509> worst<00:01:43.750> conditions<00:01:44.259> for<00:01:44.799> thermal

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
of the worst conditions for thermal

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:52.589 
of the worst conditions for thermal
possible<00:01:45.549> mines<00:01:45.819> who<00:01:46.060> named<00:01:50.939> their<00:01:51.939> baby<00:01:52.119> pick

they're moving and this is where I was
saying<00:04:03.700> that<00:04:03.970> with<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.239> thermal<00:04:04.599> you<00:04:04.750> could

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
saying that with the thermal you could

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.479 
saying that with the thermal you could
see<00:04:05.019> their<00:04:05.170> heads<00:04:05.380> up<00:04:05.560> in<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.769> air<00:04:05.889> they're

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.069 
eating the seeds off the top of the
grass<00:04:08.170> there<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:09.540> thermal<00:04:10.540> just<00:04:10.720> saw<00:04:10.840> through

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
grass there the thermal just saw through

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.050 
grass there the thermal just saw through
the<00:04:11.170> grass<00:04:11.380> you<00:04:11.590> couldn't<00:04:11.859> see<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.069> grass

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060

the grass you couldn't see the grass
with<00:04:13.329> the<00:04:13.359> thermal

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
with the thermal

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.520 
with the thermal
but<00:04:16.440> again<00:04:16.650> this<00:04:17.570> pen<00:04:18.570> 750<00:04:19.199> was<00:04:19.320> quite

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530
