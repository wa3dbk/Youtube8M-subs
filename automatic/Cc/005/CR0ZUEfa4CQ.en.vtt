like a can but it can't so don't try to

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.469 
like a can but it can't so don't try to
force<00:06:27.550> it<00:06:27.729> because<00:06:27.819> you'll<00:06:28.030> end<00:06:28.210> up<00:06:28.300> breaking

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
force it because you'll end up breaking

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.809 
force it because you'll end up breaking
it<00:06:28.840> so<00:06:29.560> that's<00:06:29.740> basically<00:06:29.860> our<00:06:30.159> is<00:06:30.400> all<00:06:30.580> his

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:30.819 
it so that's basically our is all his

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:33.779 
it so that's basically our is all his
articulation<00:06:31.150> of<00:06:31.840> basic<00:06:32.770> he<00:06:33.400> doesn't<00:06:33.610> have

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
articulation of basic he doesn't have

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.420 
articulation of basic he doesn't have
any<00:06:33.940> waste<00:06:34.330> movement<00:06:34.870> at<00:06:34.990> all<00:06:35.110> the<00:06:35.949> basic

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
any waste movement at all the basic

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.209 
any waste movement at all the basic
articulation<00:06:37.210> but<00:06:38.110> I<00:06:38.139> mean<00:06:38.379> baggage<00:06:38.919> Rome

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:39.219 
articulation but I mean baggage Rome

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.939 
articulation but I mean baggage Rome
just<00:06:40.150> a<00:06:40.300> figure<00:06:40.659> it's<00:06:40.990> cool<00:06:41.319> to<00:06:41.560> have<00:06:41.620> him<00:06:41.710> on

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
just a figure it's cool to have him on

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:43.469 
just a figure it's cool to have him on
display<00:06:42.099> and<00:06:42.550> then<00:06:43.120> they<00:06:43.210> could<00:06:43.330> have<00:06:43.449> done

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 
display and then they could have done

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:45.209 
display and then they could have done
some<00:06:43.840> better<00:06:44.169> stuff<00:06:44.289> with<00:06:44.650> them<00:06:44.800> like<00:06:44.979> maybe

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:45.219 
some better stuff with them like maybe

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:47.640 
some better stuff with them like maybe
put<00:06:45.460> more<00:06:45.610> detail<00:06:46.000> on<00:06:46.030> it<00:06:46.270> like<00:06:46.690> I'm<00:06:47.110> the<00:06:47.169> paint
