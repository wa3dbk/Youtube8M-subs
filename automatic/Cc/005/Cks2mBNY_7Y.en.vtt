abilities and that's why they're called

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.190 
abilities and that's why they're called
specializations<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.239> that's<00:00:33.450> why<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.660> get

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
specializations and that's why you get

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.720 
specializations and that's why you get
them<00:00:34.320> after<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.770> reach<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.219> max<00:00:35.430> rank

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
day you pick the wet work is basically a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.619 
day you pick the wet work is basically a
stealth<00:00:41.399> armor<00:00:41.700> mod<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.450> allows<00:00:43.140> players<00:00:43.440> to

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
stealth armor mod and allows players to

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.979 
stealth armor mod and allows players to
move<00:00:45.629> quickly<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.440> silently<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:47.039> combat<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
move quickly and silently in combat and

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.500 
move quickly and silently in combat and
you<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.200> assassinate<00:00:49.850> more<00:00:50.850> players<00:00:51.180> with

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
you can assassinate more players with

you can assassinate more players with
more<00:00:51.989> speed<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.350> stuff<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:54.949> piyo<00:00:55.949> near

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
more speed and stuff like that piyo near

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.889 
more speed and stuff like that piyo near
is<00:00:57.770> basically<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.039> fast-track<00:00:59.789> armor<00:01:00.719> mod

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
is basically a fast-track armor mod

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.270 
is basically a fast-track armor mod
which<00:01:01.710> allows<00:01:02.070> Spartans<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.239> gain<00:01:03.510> more

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
which allows Spartans to gain more

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.780 
which allows Spartans to gain more
experimental<00:01:05.299> data<00:01:06.299> from<00:01:06.900> each<00:01:07.110> encounter

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
experimental data from each encounter

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.219 
experimental data from each encounter
effectively<00:01:08.790> ranking<00:01:09.180> up<00:01:09.299> quicker<00:01:09.630> during

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
effectively ranking up quicker during

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.990 
effectively ranking up quicker during
the<00:01:10.350> process<00:01:11.869> engineer<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:14.310> drop<00:01:14.580> recon

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the process engineer is the drop recon

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.320 
the process engineer is the drop recon
armor<00:01:15.240> mod<00:01:15.990> allows<00:01:16.170> users<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.100> predict<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
armor mod allows users to predict the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.510 
armor mod allows users to predict the
location<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.320> time<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.860> ordnance<00:01:20.369> drop

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
location and time of a ordnance drop

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.980 
location and time of a ordnance drop
through<00:01:21.240> an<00:01:21.420> external<00:01:22.100> sub-orbital

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
through an external sub-orbital

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.690 
through an external sub-orbital
monitoring<00:01:24.990> system<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.369> that's<00:01:26.549> basically

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
monitoring system so that's basically

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.230 
monitoring system so that's basically
means<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.330> when<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.110> an<00:01:28.200> orbital<00:01:29.240> which

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
means that when you get an orbital which

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.810 
means that when you get an orbital which
is<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.659> killstreak<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:32.070> drop<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.640> and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
is like a killstreak you drop it and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.520 
is like a killstreak you drop it and
then<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.270> can<00:01:33.479> plan<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.840> where<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.500> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
then you can plan on where it's going to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.730 
then you can plan on where it's going to
be<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.890> or<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.970> enemies<00:01:36.329> too<00:01:36.590> alright<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
be going or the enemies too alright the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.920 
be going or the enemies too alright the
next<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.189> tracker<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:39.119> tracker<00:01:39.479> is

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
next one is the tracker the tracker is

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.950 
next one is the tracker the tracker is

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
weapons in the field which I will

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.359 
weapons in the field which I will
probably<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.350> sounds<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.250> good

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
probably have on that sounds like a good

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.069 
probably have on that sounds like a good
one<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.700> me<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.509> want<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
one for me because I want to get the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.539 
one for me because I want to get the
sniper<00:01:58.320> most<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.770> time<00:01:58.979> if<00:01:59.250> they<00:01:59.399> don't

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
sniper most of the time if they don't

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.200 
sniper most of the time if they don't
have<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.759> on<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> map<00:02:00.149> regularly<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.640> we're

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
have it on the map regularly so we're

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.340 
have it on the map regularly so we're
going<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.390> go<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.600> rogue

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
going to go on a rogue

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.410 
going to go on a rogue
the<00:02:05.799> rogue<00:02:06.070> is<00:02:06.490> basically<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:09.149> single<00:02:10.149> I<00:02:10.209> think

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
the rogue is basically a single I think

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.100 
the rogue is basically a single I think
it<00:02:10.509> is<00:02:10.660> yeah<00:02:11.080> it's<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.650> stable<00:02:12.450> stab<00:02:13.450> ability

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
it is yeah it's a stable stab ability

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.160 
it is yeah it's a stable stab ability
stable<00:02:15.040> ability<00:02:15.430> okay<00:02:16.030> fail<00:02:16.420> right<00:02:16.630> I'm<00:02:16.900> sorry

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
stable ability okay fail right I'm sorry

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.070 
stable ability okay fail right I'm sorry
it<00:02:18.040> basically<00:02:18.340> helps<00:02:18.790> you're<00:02:19.120> gone<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.959> have

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
it basically helps you're gone to have

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.740 
it basically helps you're gone to have
more<00:02:20.260> accuracy<00:02:20.590> I'll<00:02:21.220> just<00:02:21.370> say<00:02:21.459> that

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
more accuracy I'll just say that
