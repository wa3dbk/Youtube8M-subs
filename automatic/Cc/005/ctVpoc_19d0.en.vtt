we're<00:02:32.560> constantly<00:02:32.860> taking<00:02:33.130> flags<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.790> taking

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
we're constantly taking flags and taking

we're constantly taking flags and taking
any<00:02:34.180> flags<00:02:34.569> get<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:34.959> 200<00:02:35.170> points<00:02:35.709> towards

your<00:02:36.040> score<00:02:36.250> streaks<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.760> yeah<00:02:37.630> i<00:02:37.989> think<00:02:38.380> it's

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
your score streaks and yeah i think it's

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.110 
your score streaks and yeah i think it's
the<00:02:38.680> best<00:02:38.800> way<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.069> play<00:02:39.250> domination<00:02:39.730> here<00:02:40.060> in

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
the best way to play domination here in

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.550 
the best way to play domination here in
black<00:02:40.300> ops<00:02:40.480> 2<00:02:40.630> i<00:02:40.750> think<00:02:41.110> it's<00:02:41.230> definitely<00:02:41.319> the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
black ops 2 i think it's definitely the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.930 
black ops 2 i think it's definitely the
most<00:02:41.650> effective<00:02:42.099> in<00:02:42.250> terms<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.519> winning<00:02:42.730> and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
most effective in terms of winning and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.580 
most effective in terms of winning and
losing<00:02:43.030> i<00:02:43.300> think<00:02:43.540> we've<00:02:43.870> actually<00:02:44.050> only<00:02:44.319> lost

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
losing i think we've actually only lost

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.979 
losing i think we've actually only lost
one<00:02:44.860> domination<00:02:45.489> match<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:45.880> far<00:02:45.910> since<00:02:46.810> that

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
one domination match so far since that

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
they were using tactical insertions and

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.309 
they were using tactical insertions and
EMP<00:02:54.069> grenades<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:54.760> EMP<00:02:55.030> systems<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.900> me<00:02:56.019> sets

EMP grenades and EMP systems and me sets

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.050 
EMP grenades and EMP systems and me sets
and<00:02:56.560> all<00:02:57.250> these<00:02:57.400> different<00:02:57.580> kind<00:02:57.819> of<00:02:57.850> things

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
and all these different kind of things

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.220 
and all these different kind of things
and<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:58.299> was<00:02:58.420> kind<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.600> difficult<00:02:58.690> i<00:02:59.019> mean<00:02:59.140> the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
and it was kind of difficult i mean the

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.660 
and it was kind of difficult i mean the
tats<00:02:59.440> going<00:02:59.650> surgeon<00:03:00.010> thing<00:03:00.160> count<00:03:00.370> threw<00:03:00.549> us

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
tats going surgeon thing count threw us

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.220 
tats going surgeon thing count threw us
off<00:03:00.850> so<00:03:01.510> we<00:03:01.569> definitely<00:03:01.690> found<00:03:01.959> that<00:03:02.200> I

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
off so we definitely found that I

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.289 
off so we definitely found that I
running<00:03:02.620> EMP<00:03:03.040> grenades<00:03:03.430> definitely<00:03:04.120> helps

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
running EMP grenades definitely helps

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.090 
running EMP grenades definitely helps
out<00:03:04.450> like<00:03:04.690> for<00:03:04.900> facing<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.290> full<00:03:05.470> party<00:03:05.830> because

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
out like for facing a full party because

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.920 
out like for facing a full party because
typically<00:03:06.880> you're<00:03:07.060> facing<00:03:07.239> a<00:03:07.390> full<00:03:07.540> party<00:03:07.810> and

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
typically you're facing a full party and

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.820 
typically you're facing a full party and
they're<00:03:08.019> going<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.230> be<00:03:08.290> trying<00:03:08.440> just<00:03:08.680> as<00:03:08.769> hard

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
they're going to be trying just as hard

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.949 
they're going to be trying just as hard
as<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.160> are<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.430> win<00:03:09.580> during<00:03:10.299> use<00:03:10.540> tactical

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
as you are to win during use tactical

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.270 
as you are to win during use tactical
insertions<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.560> if<00:03:11.620> your<00:03:11.739> team<00:03:11.920> doesn't

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
insertions and if your team doesn't

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.949 
insertions and if your team doesn't
particularly<00:03:12.730> care<00:03:12.910> for<00:03:13.120> TAC<00:03:13.450> inserts<00:03:13.810> like

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
particularly care for TAC inserts like

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.590 
particularly care for TAC inserts like
me<00:03:14.140> I<00:03:14.319> like<00:03:15.310> them<00:03:15.549> but<00:03:15.850> same<00:03:16.090> time<00:03:16.269> I<00:03:16.299> kind<00:03:16.510> of

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
me I like them but same time I kind of

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.000 
me I like them but same time I kind of
don't<00:03:16.810> i<00:03:16.959> don't<00:03:17.019> like<00:03:17.260> half<00:03:17.440> know<00:03:17.560> who<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.799> keep

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
don't i don't like half know who I keep

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.650 
don't i don't like half know who I keep
replacing<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.700> whatnot<00:03:19.060> so<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.269> found<00:03:19.510> myself

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
replacing it whatnot so I found myself

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.690 
replacing it whatnot so I found myself
by<00:03:19.989> using<00:03:20.200> EMP<00:03:20.590> grenades<00:03:20.920> instead<00:03:21.280> just<00:03:21.430> kind

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
by using EMP grenades instead just kind

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.099 
by using EMP grenades instead just kind
of<00:03:21.730> just<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:22.030> counteract<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.660> fact<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:22.959> the

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
of just I counteract the fact that the

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.780 
of just I counteract the fact that the
other<00:03:23.200> teams<00:03:23.380> using<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:23.859> tactic<00:03:24.220> insurgents

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
other teams using that tactic insurgents

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.550 
other teams using that tactic insurgents
and<00:03:24.880> kind<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.150> counters<00:03:25.570> that<00:03:25.600> and<00:03:25.959> that's

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
and kind of counters that and that's

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.020 
and kind of counters that and that's
what<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:26.709> call<00:03:26.890> duty<00:03:27.070> is<00:03:27.280> it's<00:03:27.549> one<00:03:27.640> giant

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
what I call duty is it's one giant

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.880 
what I call duty is it's one giant
balancing<00:03:28.660> act<00:03:28.840> it's<00:03:29.019> one<00:03:29.170> giant<00:03:29.410> game<00:03:29.680> where

balancing act it's one giant game where
you<00:03:30.040> can<00:03:30.220> counter<00:03:30.609> anything<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.060> other<00:03:31.120> team

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
you can counter anything the other team

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.479 
you can counter anything the other team
does<00:03:31.630> but<00:03:32.350> that's<00:03:32.769> but<00:03:32.950> that's<00:03:33.010> best<00:03:33.310> way<00:03:33.459> I

guns<00:03:57.819> a<00:03:57.940> lot<00:03:57.970> lately<00:03:58.329> and<00:03:58.510> it's<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.780> little<00:03:58.900> bit

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
guns a lot lately and it's a little bit

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.330 
guns a lot lately and it's a little bit
more<00:03:59.260> difficult<00:03:59.410> because<00:03:59.920> you<00:04:00.250> know

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
more difficult because you know

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.920 
more difficult because you know
obviously<00:04:00.579> you<00:04:00.910> move<00:04:01.150> slower<00:04:01.420> with<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.720> light

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930
