[cheers and applause]

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.166
- WELL, YOU MUST HAVE MIRRORS
AROUND THE HOUSE.

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.233
THAT MUSTN'T HAVE BEEN
A SURPRISE TO YOU.

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:43.833
BUT NOT THAT ANGLE,
LIKE THAT PERFECT, NO.

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:45.433
AND USUALLY I'M RUNNING AROUND,

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:46.766
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE,
IT'S NOT MY--

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:50.100
MY MIRROR'S NOT THAT,
YOU KNOW, GOOD.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.333
- NOT THAT FLATTERING?
- NO.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.866
- WELL, YOU LOOK THAT GOOD
ALL THE TIME.

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.833
SO AND SO YOU PUT THAT OUT
ON INSTAGRAM.

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:57.333

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.333
AND YOU'RE PICTURED THERE
WITH NICK, YOUR FIANCE.

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.000
AND YOU'LL BE--YOU WERE ENGAGED
LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.666
AND NOW
YOU'LL BE GETTING MARRIED.

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.000
AND THERE'S A RUMOR
THAT YOU'RE HAVING

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.500
THREE DIFFERENT TYPES
OF WEDDINGS.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.800
IS THAT TRUE?
- NO.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.866
BUT IT'S BEEN AWFUL,

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.333
BECAUSE SINCE
THAT NEWS CAME OUT,

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.666
ALL MY FAMILY'S SO EXCITED,

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.833
AND THEY'RE ALREADY
PLANNING OUTFITS.

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:21.166
IT'S LIKE,
"WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.000
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET US THERE?"

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.333
AND I'M LIKE,
"IT'S HORRIBLE AND DISAPPOINTING

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.000
TO HAVE TO TELL THEM
THAT THAT IS NOT TRUE."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.333
[laughter]
- YEAH.

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.100
- I HAVEN'T EVEN
PLANNED ANYTHING.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.466
- RIGHT,
BUT YOU'LL HAVE ONE WEDDING,

00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.000
AND YOU'LL STILL HAVE
TO GET YOUR FAMILY THERE.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.600
- YEAH, EVENTUALLY,
BUT THE THING IS,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.866
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO,

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.666
BECAUSE IT'S EITHER I DO
SOMETHING REALLY BIG

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.933
OR I DO SOMETHING
REALLY SMALL.

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.333
NICK AND I AND MY SON

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:46.033
AND THEN MY MOM
AND THEN MY COUSIN AND THEN--

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:48.000
I MEAN,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ANYTHING.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.333
- AND THEN ME.
- AND THEN YOU.

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:50.833
- YEAH, YEAH.

00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:52.833
WELL, I WANTED TO GET YOU--

00:01:52.833 --> 00:01:56.233
I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU
FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT.

00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:57.966
- I'M SCARED NOW.
- I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.266
YOU'RE ALWAYS COMPLAINING

00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:01.333
THAT WE DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT KIND OF COFFEE.

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.233
JUAN VALDEZ, COME ON OUT.

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:05.400
- JUAN IS HERE?
- YES, YEAH.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.500

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.833
- THAT IS A SONG
FROM THE WILD, WILD WEST.

00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:19.833
- IT'S NOT
FROM THE WILD, WILD WEST.

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:20.666
- NO?

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:21.666
- DO YOU WANT TO TASTE IT?

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:22.666
DO YOU WANT TO--

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:23.666
- HOLA.
COMO ESTAS?

00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:25.666
- JUAN--HERE.
- SI.

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:27.000
[speaking Spanish]

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
- OKAY.

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.333
- THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:35.033
- CREAM?
- NO, NO.

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:37.966
- SHE LIKES IT--
- I TAKE IT BLACK.

00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:39.333
- SEE HOW IT IS.

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:40.600
- I'M NOT GONNA BURN MY TONGUE.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.166
IS THAT THE JOKE
THAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME?

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:45.033
[laughter]

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:46.433
- I'M NOT GONNA MAKE YOU--

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:50.000
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO DRINK IT
IF YOU DON'T WANT.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.666
[laughter]

00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:52.766
DO YOU LIKE IT?

00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:54.000
IS IT GOOD?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
IT'S THE JUAN VALDEZ COFFEE
THAT YOU LIKE.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.133
IS IT GOOD?

00:02:58.133 --> 00:02:59.333
IT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:02.133
- NO!
- WHAT?

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:03.766
[laughter]

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:05.666
- WHAT IS IT?
- IT'S ANOTHER PRESENT.

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:06.666
HERE.
PUT THAT DOWN.

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:07.666
