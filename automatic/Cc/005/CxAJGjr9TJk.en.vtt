00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.940
 hi how about all thousand results 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.900
 welcome to this video of 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.599
 tom raider collectables where I'm going to 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.270
 show how to discover how to find 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.939
 the relics and treasure documents of 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.100
 this map in particular of the temple map of 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.990
 the mountain the first thing we have to 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.449
 to do is to find the map so that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.880
 it is easier for us to find these 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.680
 treasures 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.110
 to find very simple maps like 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.520
 you see here we are in the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.230
 camp 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.440
 then we have to pull here towards 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.440
 behind 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.180
 we go by day 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.430
 and now we see each other here with this 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.850
 hidden cave 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.470
 because state 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.470
 here we go here 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.080
 and we found the map 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.610
 As you can see, this is the map of the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.509
 collectibles and now it's not going to be 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.509
 much easier to find 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.540
 find the collectibles of this 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.540
 map so a rod 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.520
 11 I will go showing where they are in 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.890
 each zone and looking at the map is going to be 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.969
 It can be easier so nothing 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.969
 I leave with the guide 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:15.069
 July 25, 1982 have been several 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.069
 days since the plane crashed 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.940
 When we do not pay on the island we suffer a 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.940
 storm of wind and rain for days 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:19.379
 a silk fan could not use that much 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.379
 a villager as someone of the nobility 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.010
 yes 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.630
 a boom line used by the samurai to 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.910
 give orders to soldiers in combat 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.240
 very robust must be made of 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.240
 cypress 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.550
 all right 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.760
 ah
