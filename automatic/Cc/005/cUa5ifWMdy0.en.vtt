00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:11.309
 I used alcohol, right? 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.009
 there she gets very crazy car 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.619
 I just want to document how it works 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.619
 with high eco-sport of early morning 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.010
 like here 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.349
 all turn on because you locked the engine 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.349
 starter right 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.879
 first to second window then third 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:58.960
 Fourth time at the moment is the fourth time 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.840
 She picks it up and now she's dead, right? 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.059
 it gives not act then you try 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:11.800
 speed up 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:13.810
 she dies we go there fifth time while 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.340
 dead 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.340
 if I try to accelerate 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:30.840
 It looks like the world will end, right? 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.840
 let's go again one more time 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.729
 but this is the old car not 13 thousand 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:45.030
 kilometers that has this problem since 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.820
 new pop rock show and if you go 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.330
 so competitive who has a car of 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:55.159
 1950 did not die or die again 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.159
 was thus to leave home with high 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.810
 It has to happen she ovaia that the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.250
 sport believes 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.250
 oo o 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:26.110
 it's no use holding the wait for the car with 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.110
 the scene is again 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.460
 by what happened 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.410
 ah 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.870
 so you can not leave home 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.760
 monitored phones 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.359
 now it seems like it was cool 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.219
 that 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.120
 AA was the 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:46.730
 will break in the select school has to 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:49.450
 do not pay or want to leave 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.450
 Home how will I do it? 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.670
 there it was now 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.740
 it was on the bridge yes because it opposes the march 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:23.620
 now she'll do it as she thinks 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:23.620
 yet now it seems that signed 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.300
 all the noise of their sound came out 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.300
 smell that is horrible right? 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.630
 The car looks like it's all gone now. 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.539
 I totally do not know if I'm charred 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.380
 broken works are in trouble but 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.380
 normal 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:05:01.449
 now was to say how long after one 

00:04:55.839 --> 00:05:04.409
 I do not know what though 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.409
