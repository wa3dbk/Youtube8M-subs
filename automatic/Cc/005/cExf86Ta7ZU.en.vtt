thing<00:01:46.570> about<00:01:46.630> flank<00:01:47.020> steak<00:01:47.260> is<00:01:47.410> really<00:01:47.890> thin

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
thing about flank steak is really thin

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.070 
thing about flank steak is really thin
so<00:01:48.370> it<00:01:48.430> cooked<00:01:48.640> pretty<00:01:48.850> quickly<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.510> it's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
so it cooked pretty quickly and it's

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.600 
so it cooked pretty quickly and it's
good<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.440> give<00:01:50.590> gentle<00:01:50.920> pressure<00:01:51.160> right<00:01:51.520> in

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
good to give gentle pressure right in

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.160 
good to give gentle pressure right in
the<00:01:51.670> middle<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.120> prevent<00:01:52.480> it<00:01:52.570> from<00:01:52.600> curling<00:01:53.020> up

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
the middle to prevent it from curling up

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.500 
the middle to prevent it from curling up
looks<00:01:54.040> like<00:01:54.190> this<00:01:54.370> takes<00:01:54.610> just<00:01:55.000> about<00:01:55.090> ready

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
looks like this takes just about ready

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.110 
looks like this takes just about ready
to<00:01:55.570> flip<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:57.460> that's<00:01:57.610> what<00:01:57.730> we<00:01:57.790> have<00:01:57.910> nice

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120
