00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.630
 lesson 10 1 speedfan program 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.430
 the speedfan program provides 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.500
 ability to control temperature 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.960
 processor hard drives and other 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.910
 computer components and also change 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.779
 fan speed 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.300
 cooling 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.099
 after starting the program scans your 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.619
 the system determines the type of installed 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.610
 motherboard and the number of sensors 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.950
 temperatures 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.320
 after that a window appears on the screen 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.260
 programs containing several tabs 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.320
 on the billings tab readings 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.610
 there are several lists 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.850
 the top list shows the number 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.000
 the sensor system found below the list 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.949
 sensors are located and two more lists in 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.620
 Components are displayed in the right list. 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.960
 processor systems or hard drives and 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.390
 the current temperature of these components 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.249
 icon located to the left of these 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.800
 indicators indicates the character 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.239
 temperature changes 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.089
 for example, a down arrow means that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.880
 temperature drops up arrow says 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.820
 about increasing temperature icon 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.620
 flame does not speak about the danger range 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.360
 permissible temperatures of various 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.790
 devices you can find out in 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.000
 documentation attached to them either on 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.380
 manufacturers' sites of these components in 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.570
 the left list is a list 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.119
 system fans and speed 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.820
 each of them under the left list 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.990
 there are fields with counters 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.259
 allowing to change the speed 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.740
 each fan system in these fields 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.479
 rotational speed is indicated as a percentage 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.920
 one hundred percent corresponds to 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.530
 rated speed 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.750
 fan at the bottom of the window 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.820
 indicates the voltage values of the block 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.579
 supply so you can 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.409
 control and operating voltage 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.960
 computer tab clock 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.689
 frequency you can choose make and model 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.250
 your motherboard and change 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.520
 CPU bus speed 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.600
 at different degrees of loading 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.090
 for example when reading e-books 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.299
 when the processor is practically not loaded 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.469
 no need for his high 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.300
 program speed in such 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.510
 cases can automatically reduce 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.320
 CPU bus speed 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.570
 accordingly will decrease and 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.910
 CPU temperature on boot 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.360
 CPU above the level set in 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.700
 field and the last link below below 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.850
 CPU bus frequency automatically 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.560
 will be increased to the nominal value 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.180
 this way the program automatically 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.480
 reduces the temperature of the processor 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.050
 with system downtime or task execution 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.780
 not loading cpu on 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.970
 tab graphics window graphics 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.590
 speedfan you can see the graphics 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.840
 temperature variations of individual 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.209
 computer graphics components you 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.459
 can add checkboxes on the left 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.980
 from the name of the respective components 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.890
 which are located in the table at the bottom 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.650
 parts of the program window when minimized 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.880
 and program windows in the notification area 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.290
 placed an icon on which 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.400
 current temperature is displayed 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.980
 processor 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.380
 this way you can follow 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.480
 CPU temperature continuously without 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.800
 need to keep the program window 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.800
 speedfan on your desktop
