00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.939
 hello to everyone and so 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.380
 today we find ourselves at the point of 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.000
 videos about world of warcraft 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.670
 I'm talking to you a little bit about 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.370
 different classes on which to choose 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.799
 at the pot for different classes 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.150
 then on the alliance side 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:22.650
 already there is him bar the mans domino effect 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.810
 the and the morgen then on the side of 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.470
 order roughly the bad guys and then that 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:33.300
 Leman living the tauren the holy 3fb 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.820
 gobain finally good you know in 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.559
 laughing and so then about for the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.170
 warrior firstly me I you 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.219
 advises the alliance side the ume 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.070
 because they expertises improved 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.879
 with swords and months so that's 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.710
 super helpful 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.789
 frankly it's super useful me I 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.579
 advise you of the elbow and the alliance 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.260
 he died and listened to the blue gold touraine 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.879
 improved life or barley 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.219
 there are two different classes being the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.370
 turn it when is it 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.430
 lorqu'il is neither part improve créach 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.340
 his ranks not bad then for the not the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.560
 tooth of the alliance side still read I 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.630
 repeat myself but read ment end 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.869
 part so with the mass and often 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.369
 tasteless but surely not bad more 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.540
 he has a mind but hear these 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.540
 beautiful and then on the side of the road 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.799
 for not there in already that two 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.409
 classes are either the fires the bursts 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.310
 torreilles at the end requisite apartment 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.850
 center lights is better but 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.140
 after frankly there is no there is no 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.200
 prerequisites and take care of the photos 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.780
 then from the side of hunters or 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.520
 for the alliance it will be I think the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.229
 cliché since the fire of the enemy that 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.790
 it's clear 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.460
 there I have nothing to say because I think 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.490
 that all of us know you have not got 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.490
 wrong 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.320
 then from the troy blue gold side 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:08.039
 there a year ago to say the troll it's 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.240
 great but lucho and to say then due 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.340
 cost thief in both 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.980
 side yahia flying at the click to what is 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.600
 really stronger than the other can 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.510
 to be human since he is also like 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.060
 you diniz party get better than the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.050
 swords not and so you put an ip to 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.040
 each member 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.280
 generally it is to be ceded access 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.000
 on not much but me I you 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.100
 advise that frankly do you 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.230
 pleased at the level of the thief on the 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.960
 points a thief you do what you 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.160
 do you want to be a goblin care 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:49.260
 she makes two jumps either pride no 1 f 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.660
 of the night a child what you 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.850
 then from the clae of the priest the fires of 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.390
 his listening and priest the fire of his 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.380
 it's the best level finally it's 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.330
 very good 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.520
 nothing to say if he can recover from 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.500
 manara and all the resistant ones 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.440
 gadzarts rods can stir guests 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.350
 there are improved skills on the side 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.090
 cell prat for you 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.250
 want to make alliance at the level of 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.850
 the alliance 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.040
 I advise you the dren he is 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.950
 well he is well taught to miss him 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.600
 very well too 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.150
 after at the level of no it would be good 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.150
 it's going to be done after huge life 2 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.580
 come out but then I make death that 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.230
 are super strong and first the morgen 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.010
 exerts that it's my prefect because 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.360
 it is super 6 mrd chf 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.360
 then shaman on the gold side will be 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.490
 so clear on the shaman side is gold 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.320
 because dudes partys improved with 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.000
 the weapons of more they extended more 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.380
 dear that's what shamans and is all 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.620
 and it's great but then listened to 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:02.770
 the alliance is not many who 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:05.710
 can be at 3 is either mourning there 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.740
 has none who meows take care of 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:12.850
 our soldiers then for the mage 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:15.190
 the human is very strong I like 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.290
 a dimension style and the banks have 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.540
 almost every year but take a 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.900
 grain style is also very strong 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.940
 will hold good after 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.380
 the night is good but it is finalizing 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.530
 usually they peel hunters 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.750
 louis price can be what will do 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.169
 as you can do indeed from 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.229
 harm 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:41.539
 maj near so here you are after warlock 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:45.710
 at the bone level for a counter it's 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:48.229
 the living dead there's nothing to say that's 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.900
 that calm and then you wanted to take 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.970
 someone from the alliance in warlock 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.289

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:00.710
