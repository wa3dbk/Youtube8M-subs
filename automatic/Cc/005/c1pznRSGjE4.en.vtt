00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:10.769
 so hello to all this here + 3j 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:15.660
 11 years of release and there is such 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:21.020
 poser is like knocking rear calipers 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.609
 front and here's a fucking horse 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.730
 on the bumps it is very good to hear 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.359
 such a knock and even a little 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.460
 annoying then two ways love something 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.390
 come up with either accordingly 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.390
 louder music 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:44.300
 how do we see here we have 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:51.660
 spring chk that holds the caliper 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:54.480
 this driver can look at 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:00.970
 on a spree the nose was gone and that is, not 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.809
 I hear nothing that's what I want to offer 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:08.700
 as a solution to this problem 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:14.350
 we have such a thing is a heater 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:17.590
 corpse diameter don't know very much then you 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.190
 false measure that's what I want 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.910
 to offer 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:25.990
 that is, we fix this ring on 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:32.440
 cylinder 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:34.090
 with the help of scotch 3m like this 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.960
 diameters obtained perfect 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.520
 matches that is when we remove everything 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.600
 I 'll give it about this car is built on 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.369
 the wheel we all go down and it turns out 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.920
 there is a gap is minimal 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.080
 what we left here for this 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.820
 let's say that some was 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.820
 ventilation so that the moisture there did not cope 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.690
 now we will come to this side there already 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.690
 everything is ready and we will listen 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:28.180
 can you do everything this way 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.130
 in order to do the whole process to us 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:39.420
 need insulation itself here we have it 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:40.959
 he is not cut until the stationery knife 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.230
 scotch 3m 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.769
 Well, to run to it on its 40 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.769
 kept on
