00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 and guys a dead man is called and I'm a 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.330
 article from edge magazine where we 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.519
 they gave away a lot of things that we do not know 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.059
 from the space of the possessed 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.130
 mainly with the theme of 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.290
 exotic of the first year the court of orix 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.940
 and the dlc missions in this video has 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.710
 spotted a look at everything that we 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.420
 they commented starting with the exotic ones 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.220
 of the first year the edge article 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.810
 seems to confirm that although not all 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.250
 our favorite exotic ones have a 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.980
 improved version with more attack and 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.199
 defense in kim pekin possibly if the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.599
 They have in the future weapons like pérez 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.070
 hawthorn claws among other already 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.170
 they come almost that confirmed that no 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.700
 they would have a new version and the article 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.320
 The edge says that not all 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.540
 exotic we already know but a new 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.070
 version with the dlc output but that 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.649
 eventually return it will be added 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.660
 to the game the exotics of the first year do not 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.309
 may be increased but if they have a 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.020
 new version available and you already have 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.360
 the old one you can buy the version 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.070
 improved the second year in the tower 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.930
 true good news there are certain 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.090
 immature weapons that in this mind I do not 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.920
 they mattered that they can not be improved but 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.600
 there were others that if I was left wanting 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.210
 it's good to know that eventually 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.280
 they will add following it in fact they talk about 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.390
 the court of orix this is a kind of 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.870
 public event activated by the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.360
 players 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.490
 Orix battleship there is apparently a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.050
 kind of runes that are objects that 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.180
 we will find all over the world once 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.430
 make the expansion even you can 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.110
 rewards are few cases and jumps 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.490
 rules are rarer than others and if 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.740
 we take to the court of orixe the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.870
 battleship we will activate a public event 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.280
 the challenge will be more difficult between marc 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.890
 now the rune but the reward 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.210
 it will also be better the challenges will not be 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.250
 just defeat one hour of 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.740
 enemies as they explain are much more 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.290
 elaborated for example in these challenges 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.610
 three and zero appear and your team has 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.770
 to write down the three almost at the same 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.300
 time to overcome it if you defeat two 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.310
 and spend a few seconds without killing the 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.350
 third the other 2 will reappear from 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.700
 immediately they also mention another challenge 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.320
 where mauro appeared to simulate 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.180
 our attacks but not the expressions 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.890
 of the lackeys and to defeat it 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.990
 we will have to stop or not fall damned 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.430
 so that it explodes about him even 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.680
 mentions we have taken I seem two 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.090
 gentlemen with shields and that only 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.280
 then they lower the shields when they 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.840
 are close to each other to overcome that 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.490
 Orix cut figure appears a chest 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 a high platform and all the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.700
 players who participated in the event 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.899
 it will take a reward but the one that 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.030
 activated the event with its ruins it 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.440
 will take a better reward say that 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.600
 including the rarest moons 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.460
 active the most difficult challenges have 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.110
 enemies at the level of the networks 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.300
 but with rewards obviously a lot 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.740
 I really want to see how 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.910
 will be this event in the next the 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.340
 bonnie management next Wednesday 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.800
 will play live at the orix court 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.550
 Attentive to that then talk a little about 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.860
 the new network 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.450
 kingston or the fall of the king is undoubtedly 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.490
 some as I returned the raid 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.630
 greatest they have done is the 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.670
 culmination of the space around 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.710
 possessed all the missions and assaults 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.810
 they take us to great end that is this king 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.640
 those of pony mention that in this case 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.960
 have created the difficult mode first and 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.270
 then they have reduced it for the difficulty 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.670
 normal also say that it will not be 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.720
 only a normal and difficult way what 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.090
 which points out that there is another modality 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.920
 available in this new incursion 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.960
 following they mention the spectrum the goes 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.760
 now it will have more utilities instead of 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.350
 change something that tells us the game and 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.780
 tell us that he has no enemy allies 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.280
 for the thousandth time in addition to the option is 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.470
 change things in the world and that the 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.240
 spectrum give us more information also 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.520
 extracting spectrum will activate things in the 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.470
 map in the battleship of orix will have 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.330
 platforms that only appear when 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.860
 we take the spectrum among others 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.840
 functions that will make it more dynamic in 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.640
 the game also talks a bit about the 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.410
 slopes 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.660
 one of these will take us to the ship of the 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.340
 colony an area that is behind where 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.740
 we beat picks prime in the first 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.700
 assault on the earth will be made available 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.770
 another of the missions will take us to a 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.420
 unknown territory where then we 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.950
 they will give you a lot of enemies and 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.840
 we will have to withdraw from the battle 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.970
 at the end of the network campaign of the 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.770
 owned the npc in the tower will have us 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.290
 many missions and challenges to fulfill 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.150
 between the ark script crucible and the armorer 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.500
 they will have many missions to do and what 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.989
 best of all, they will have a reward 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.000
 pretty useful talking about the gunsmith 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.770
 they mentioned a little more about the day 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.600
 of the weapons where we make a 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.300
 request of a weapon to the armorer that we 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.530
 it will cost 2,500 gamers and the weapon will arrive 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.780
 Next Wednesday with skills 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.370
 randomly mentioned that there are five 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.680
 new legendary weapons that only 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.940
 you can get by this method then 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.130
 they talk a little about the infusion system 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.750
 to improve our equipment this 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.090
 As I told you, I have another video that 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.800
 I think to explain this system 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.870
 new light levels and my advice 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.459
