 Inters looked for from a single goal to 6 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.439
 The selfish and 8-year-old is sure to crave for procreation 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.760
 I got sick of it 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.420
 every little thing on this planet exists so headless and 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.780
 Passing on his genes 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.940
 so programmed Cynthia 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.320
 and that is why there is criticism 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.820
 but too high 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.080
 she is different 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.330
 You are like me" 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.300
 without past and future 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.310
 we live only for the moment 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.310
 that is our existence 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.989
 People do not make each other happy 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.369
 Just before coming to the world 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.959
 it is very destiny 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.139
 had to go 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.139
 to bring misery and suffering 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.269
 the first interests thought does not dive around my dad 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.299
 I saw in his heart nothing but hatred and disgust for me 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.599
 my mother died at my birth 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.779
 and there flat 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.579
 Haste Emig 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.579
 I thought he would kill me 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.549
 That's how my future died 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.549
 Hello and me too 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:02.959
 when I woke up 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.319
 the whole village 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.389
 they burned down here to wipe out their past 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:14.219
 the brand-seven traumatic experience when I see me like that 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.709
 Hmm 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.869
 we are not in our opinion 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.869
 so right 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.139
 The world is more interesting as long as it has people like you 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:33.679
 I was never for the revolution of Mars 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.009
 his field power fantasies do not interest me 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.589
 I just wanted to kill as many people as possible 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.739
 Fremont something to see 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.709
 he does not have much time left 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.169
 I have the feeling that they are the Sch 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.009
 k + s puts 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.009
 you are like the construction 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:04.559
 even worse 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:07.599
 compared with her 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.599
 I'm almost harmless 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.139
 her thoughts 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.219
 Neuss 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:21.219
 there, of course 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.340
 you have a nice place in your heart 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.009
 the beautiful place 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.270
 yeah 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.860
 a nice place 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.860
 but I do not know if your future will be eating together 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.259
 one last peitz r 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.659
 What is it 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.229
 my teacher 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.229
 even me too 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:46.999
 szo 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:50.149
 I would adorn her with the thoughts of other people Bauma 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.110
 before I die 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.830
 I want to be alone 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.830
 It's about time alone because of my world 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.460
 the Terra 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.460
 Catch Peter 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.469
 the first highlight 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.469
 I had an iPad 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:28.309
 have the right 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:33.110
 mr 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.789
 m 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.789
 Has 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.319
 allows 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.430
 nobody was there 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.819
 well 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.009
 Ulm 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.009
 and not just control your own thoughts 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.270
 the other 2 percent pull 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.300
 he himself 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.689
 because they were stronger 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:09.689
 Steam out 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:14.869
 it is not lying 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.210
 I was wondering what is the problem 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.629
 while, namely 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:32.800
 the exact reading 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.249
 I am a 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:36.409
 Name means - and have 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:39.539
 the only ones old enough to have the dead are 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:41.469
 Families 9 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:44.889
 was accepted by many people 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:48.040
 Colombia's minutes of life on the north and I will not 

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:52.589
 at the 5 ripe Erlangen 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:59.680
 have other people provoked 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.909
 that does not like to be alone 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:03.579
 the sad vaccinations
