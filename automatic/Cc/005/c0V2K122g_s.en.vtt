different<00:02:07.539> and<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:08.080> think<00:02:08.319> that<00:02:08.470> it's<00:02:09.100> clearly

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
different and I think that it's clearly

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.830 
different and I think that it's clearly
what<00:02:09.580> we<00:02:09.670> have<00:02:09.789> tried<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.000> capture<00:02:10.300> our<00:02:10.479> self

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
what we have tried to capture our self

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.590 
what we have tried to capture our self
being<00:02:11.140> still<00:02:11.740> a<00:02:11.980> small<00:02:12.190> company<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.000> heading

being still a small company and heading
to<00:02:13.750> make<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.680> most<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:15.040> every<00:02:15.160> dollar<00:02:15.490> and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
to make the most of every dollar and

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.160 
to make the most of every dollar and
surprising<00:02:16.390> people<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:16.840> know<00:02:16.900> if<00:02:16.959> you<00:02:17.020> don't

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
surprising people you know if you don't

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.660 
surprising people you know if you don't
surprise<00:02:17.350> them<00:02:17.740> you<00:02:17.830> don't<00:02:17.950> get<00:02:18.130> innocence

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
surprise them you don't get innocence

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.390 
surprise them you don't get innocence
just<00:02:19.060> plain<00:02:19.800> advertisement<00:02:20.800> dollar<00:02:20.950> then<00:02:21.280> you

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
just plain advertisement dollar then you

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.240 
just plain advertisement dollar then you
can't<00:02:21.670> engage<00:02:21.850> them<00:02:22.330> on<00:02:22.810> an<00:02:22.930> epsilon<00:02:23.380> i<00:02:23.500> found

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
can't engage them on an epsilon i found

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.980 
can't engage them on an epsilon i found
level<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.670> i<00:02:24.730> love<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.120> photo<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.600> early

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
level and i love the photo of the early

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.580 
level and i love the photo of the early
roots<00:02:26.200> in<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.250> farm<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:28.990> it's<00:02:29.380> with

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
roots in the farm and so it's with

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.160 
roots in the farm and so it's with
culture<00:02:30.430> you're<00:02:30.550> talking<00:02:30.819> about<00:02:31.170> them

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
culture you're talking about them

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.830 
culture you're talking about them
starting<00:02:33.100> out<00:02:33.190> in<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.580> farm<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.120> then<00:02:34.420> how<00:02:34.780> we

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
starting out in the farm and then how we

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.360 
starting out in the farm and then how we
have<00:02:35.230> started<00:02:35.709> out<00:02:35.800> in<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.040> many<00:02:36.160> famous

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
have started out in so many famous

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.850 
have started out in so many famous
garages<00:02:37.150> here<00:02:37.420> in<00:02:37.510> Silicon<00:02:37.900> Valley<00:02:38.140> but

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
garages here in Silicon Valley but

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.920 
garages here in Silicon Valley but
actually<00:02:39.280> were<00:02:39.430> right<00:02:39.610> now

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
actually were right now

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.809 
actually were right now
the<00:02:40.049> Stanford<00:02:40.439> campus<00:02:40.469> which<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.099> known<00:02:41.400> as

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
the Stanford campus which is known as

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.979 
the Stanford campus which is known as
the<00:02:42.060> farm<00:02:42.329> yes<00:02:43.170> absolutely<00:02:44.719> parallel<00:02:45.719> what<00:02:45.930> do

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
the farm yes absolutely parallel what do

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.030 
the farm yes absolutely parallel what do
you<00:02:46.049> think<00:02:46.290> about<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.709> idea<00:02:46.799> of<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.430> farm

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
you think about the idea of a farm

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.670 
you think about the idea of a farm
culture<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.819> nurturing<00:02:51.719> ideas<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.560> what

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
culture and and nurturing ideas and what

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.740 
culture and and nurturing ideas and what
some<00:02:52.859> of<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.069> parallels<00:02:53.519> are<00:02:53.519> there<00:02:53.909> well<00:02:54.209> you

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
some of the parallels are there well you

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.140 
some of the parallels are there well you
know<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:54.900> would<00:02:55.379> say<00:02:55.530> that's<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.189> nurturing

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
know I would say that's it the nurturing

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.780 
know I would say that's it the nurturing
idea<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:58.379> great<00:02:58.590> one<00:02:58.799> because<00:02:59.040> clearly<00:02:59.459> you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
idea is a great one because clearly you

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.729 
idea is a great one because clearly you
get<00:03:00.120> more<00:03:00.389> people<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.840> just<00:03:01.109> one<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.620> know

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
get more people in just one you know

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.319 
get more people in just one you know
it's<00:03:01.889> at<00:03:02.099> least<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.430> Switzerland<00:03:02.819> on't<00:03:03.269> have

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
it's at least in Switzerland on't have

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.959 
it's at least in Switzerland on't have
as<00:03:03.510> many<00:03:03.599> galleries<00:03:03.930> as<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.409> have<00:03:04.560> here<00:03:04.969> and

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
as many galleries as you have here and

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.509 
as many galleries as you have here and
not<00:03:06.810> as<00:03:07.049> many<00:03:07.230> farms<00:03:07.739> as<00:03:07.859> your<00:03:07.980> guard<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.340> here

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
not as many farms as your guard is here

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.369 
not as many farms as your guard is here
so<00:03:08.849> people<00:03:08.969> get<00:03:09.239> together<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.930> they're<00:03:10.049> large

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
so people get together and they're large

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.789 
so people get together and they're large
of<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.680> building<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:11.389> and<00:03:12.560> we<00:03:13.560> have<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
of the building and and we have the

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.699 
of the building and and we have the
stimulation<00:03:14.280> which<00:03:15.180> does<00:03:15.419> exist<00:03:15.720> which<00:03:16.560> is

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
stimulation which does exist which is

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.770 
stimulation which does exist which is
called<00:03:16.919> is<00:03:17.069> sort<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.430> small<00:03:17.790> incubators<00:03:18.540> which

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
called is sort of small incubators which

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.679 
called is sort of small incubators which
I<00:03:18.959> in<00:03:19.709> outside<00:03:20.549> in<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.819> countryside<00:03:21.209> because

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:21.689 
I in outside in the countryside because

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.869 
I in outside in the countryside because
basically<00:03:22.049> it's<00:03:22.859> too<00:03:23.010> expensive<00:03:23.159> was<00:03:23.700> more

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
basically it's too expensive was more

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.979 
basically it's too expensive was more
company<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.419> start<00:03:24.689> in<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.230> city<00:03:25.439> and

collaboration<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.139> emanation<00:03:28.769> of<00:03:28.859> thing

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
collaboration and emanation of thing

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.830 
collaboration and emanation of thing
that<00:03:29.489> has<00:03:29.609> actually<00:03:29.969> been<00:03:30.389> lost<00:03:30.599> for<00:03:30.719> the

that has actually been lost for the

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.690 
that has actually been lost for the
success<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.349> Silicon<00:03:31.829> Valley<00:03:32.010> because<00:03:32.310> you

success of Silicon Valley because you

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.520 
success of Silicon Valley because you

it makes a lot of sense because you have
