this is a really good idea cages and the
little<00:02:55.260> cubes<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.770> CNC<00:02:56.190> usually<00:02:56.550> cost<00:02:56.760> quite<00:02:57.030> a

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
little cubes of CNC usually cost quite a

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.020 
little cubes of CNC usually cost quite a
bit<00:02:57.770> just<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.860> make<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:59.040> cage<00:02:59.310> at<00:02:59.489> this<00:02:59.610> size<00:02:59.820> and

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
bit just to make a cage at this size and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.520 
bit just to make a cage at this size and
this<00:03:00.150> cage<00:03:00.330> is<00:03:00.510> huge<00:03:00.840> we're<00:03:01.020> actually<00:03:01.140> fixing

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
this cage is huge we're actually fixing

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.500

to<00:03:01.590> add<00:03:01.709> another<00:03:01.920> guinea<00:03:02.190> pig<00:03:02.459> here<00:03:02.910> hopefully

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
to add another guinea pig here hopefully

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.949 
to add another guinea pig here hopefully
they'll<00:03:03.660> get<00:03:03.810> along<00:03:04.580> but<00:03:05.690> trying<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.750> get<00:03:06.870> back

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
they'll get along but trying to get back

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.390 
they'll get along but trying to get back

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
far enough so you can see the size of it

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.320 
far enough so you can see the size of it
setting<00:03:08.790> on<00:03:08.880> top<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.330> dresser<00:03:09.510> right<00:03:09.720> now

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
a bit but this is how you can build a

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.840 
a bit but this is how you can build a
case<00:03:18.870> really<00:03:19.170> cheap<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:20.250> didn't<00:03:20.549> cost<00:03:20.670> me

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850
