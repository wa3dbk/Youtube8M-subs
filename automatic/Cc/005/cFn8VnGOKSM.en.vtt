00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
about going sideways and throwing the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.380 
about going sideways and throwing the
tail<00:00:55.079> out<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.920> having<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.789> bunch<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.180> fun

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
in a car does not want a horsepower but

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.950 
in a car does not want a horsepower but
