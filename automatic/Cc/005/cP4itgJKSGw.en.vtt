running actually right now is a GameCube
digital<00:01:48.380> component<00:01:49.380> cable<00:01:49.680> might<00:01:50.310> not<00:01:50.490> have

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
digital component cable might not have

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.149 
digital component cable might not have

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
recommend dropping 90 bucks for this

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.380 
recommend dropping 90 bucks for this
thing<00:02:04.079> but<00:02:04.680> anyway<00:02:05.030> that's<00:02:06.030> what<00:02:06.240> we're

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
thing but anyway that's what we're

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.940 
thing but anyway that's what we're
running<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.780> what<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.560> do<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.799> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
running is what you have to do is the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.270 
running is what you have to do is the
GameCube<00:02:08.869> cable<00:02:09.869> actually<00:02:10.489> and<00:02:11.489> go<00:02:11.700> back<00:02:12.000> here

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
GameCube cable actually and go back here

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.090 
GameCube cable actually and go back here
runs<00:02:15.460> to<00:02:16.460> 480<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:17.930> but<00:02:18.350> actually<00:02:18.530> we<00:02:18.860> have<00:02:18.980> to

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
runs to 480 so but actually we have to

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.920 
runs to 480 so but actually we have to
do<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.490> have<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.060> have<00:02:20.150> both<00:02:20.300> your<00:02:20.510> cables<00:02:20.840> so

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.060 

and<00:05:38.300> actually<00:05:38.450> it<00:05:38.630> doesn't<00:05:38.840> really<00:05:39.070> really

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
and actually it doesn't really really

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.110 
and actually it doesn't really really
really<00:05:40.370> crisp<00:05:40.700> I<00:05:41.030> mean<00:05:41.930> for<00:05:42.290> a<00:05:42.320> for<00:05:43.070> a<00:05:43.120> some

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
really crisp I mean for a for a some

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.800 
really crisp I mean for a for a some
hardware<00:05:44.420> that's<00:05:44.600> almost<00:05:44.840> 10<00:05:45.080> years<00:05:45.230> old<00:05:49.810> and

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
hardware that's almost 10 years old and

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.120 
hardware that's almost 10 years old and
it<00:05:50.930> doesn't<00:05:51.170> actually<00:05:51.230> convert<00:05:51.770> it<00:05:51.920> to<00:05:51.950> the

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
it doesn't actually convert it to the

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.770 
it doesn't actually convert it to the
whole<00:05:52.370> screen<00:05:52.880> I've<00:05:53.090> seen<00:05:53.330> there's<00:05:53.540> a<00:05:53.570> little

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
whole screen I've seen there's a little

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.990 
whole screen I've seen there's a little
space<00:05:54.020> on<00:05:54.080> the<00:05:54.410> sides<00:05:54.710> at<00:05:55.490> least<00:05:55.730> for<00:05:55.940> GameCube

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
space on the sides at least for GameCube

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.340 
space on the sides at least for GameCube
just<00:05:59.000> a<00:05:59.090> little<00:05:59.360> bit<00:05:59.510> not<00:05:59.690> too<00:05:59.720> bad<00:06:00.110> though

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
just a little bit not too bad though

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.260 
just a little bit not too bad though
yeah<00:06:00.860> you<00:06:01.130> could<00:06:01.250> probably<00:06:01.400> stretch<00:06:01.760> that<00:06:02.090> if

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
yeah you could probably stretch that if

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:13.890 
yeah you could probably stretch that if
you<00:06:02.390> wanted<00:06:02.720> to<00:06:02.930> with<00:06:03.140> your<00:06:03.320> monitor

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.210 

right<00:06:14.900> off<00:06:15.050> the<00:06:15.080> bat<00:06:15.350> on<00:06:15.560> what<00:06:15.680> I'm<00:06:15.770> looking<00:06:16.130> at

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
right off the bat on what I'm looking at

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.810 
right off the bat on what I'm looking at
is<00:06:16.400> it<00:06:17.150> is<00:06:17.390> blurry<00:06:17.750> but<00:06:18.290> the<00:06:18.560> edges<00:06:19.040> are<00:06:19.070> crisp

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
is it is blurry but the edges are crisp

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.990 
is it is blurry but the edges are crisp
and<00:06:20.810> it<00:06:21.290> is<00:06:21.440> it<00:06:22.070> does<00:06:22.310> look<00:06:22.490> really<00:06:22.670> smooth

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
and it is it does look really smooth

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.910 
and it is it does look really smooth
really<00:06:23.360> nice<00:06:23.510> so<00:06:24.050> there's<00:06:24.230> no<00:06:24.380> I'm<00:06:24.740> not

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 
really nice so there's no I'm not

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.800 
really nice so there's no I'm not
noticing<00:06:25.400> any<00:06:25.550> like<00:06:25.940> lag<00:06:26.300> or<00:06:26.600> anything

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
noticing any like lag or anything

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.980 
noticing any like lag or anything
actually<00:06:27.470> from<00:06:27.680> the<00:06:27.890> box<00:06:28.510> itself<00:06:29.510> so<00:06:29.840> you're

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
actually from the box itself so you're

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.420 
actually from the box itself so you're
not<00:06:30.140> going<00:06:30.320> to<00:06:30.380> get<00:06:30.500> delay<00:06:30.890> or<00:06:31.070> anything<00:06:31.250> like

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
not going to get delay or anything like

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.570 
not going to get delay or anything like
that

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.820 

refresh<00:06:34.580> rate<00:06:34.850> is<00:06:34.880> good<00:06:35.410> looks<00:06:36.410> very<00:06:36.650> nice

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
refresh rate is good looks very nice

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.610 
refresh rate is good looks very nice
actually<00:06:37.130> so<00:06:37.490> overall<00:06:37.760> I'd<00:06:38.030> say<00:06:38.230> to<00:06:39.230> get<00:06:39.380> this

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
actually so overall I'd say to get this

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.330 
actually so overall I'd say to get this
quality<00:06:39.950> what<00:06:40.280> you<00:06:40.700> spend<00:06:41.030> like<00:06:41.270> aa<00:06:42.340> total

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
quality what you spend like aa total

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.490 
quality what you spend like aa total
burn<00:06:43.490> itself<00:06:43.790> was<00:06:44.090> $40<00:06:44.930> $40<00:06:45.590> but<00:06:45.740> I<00:06:45.800> bet<00:06:47.500> we

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
burn itself was $40 $40 but I bet we

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.930 
burn itself was $40 $40 but I bet we
will<00:06:48.590> have<00:06:48.800> that<00:06:49.010> link<00:06:49.220> for<00:06:49.550> you<00:06:49.670> in<00:06:49.700> the

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
will have that link for you in the

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.620 
will have that link for you in the
description<00:06:50.180> also<00:06:50.650> so<00:06:52.030> yeah<00:06:53.030> it<00:06:53.180> looks<00:06:53.420> really

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630 
description also so yeah it looks really

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.750 
description also so yeah it looks really
really<00:06:53.930> good<00:06:54.080> actually<00:06:54.230> I'm<00:06:54.470> surprised<00:06:54.860> at

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
really good actually I'm surprised at

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.090 
really good actually I'm surprised at
how<00:06:56.210> nice<00:06:56.540> this<00:06:56.780> turned<00:06:57.200> out<00:06:57.470> so<00:06:59.560> well<00:07:00.560> I<00:07:00.770> guess

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.100
