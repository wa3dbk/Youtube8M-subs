00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.920 
below so again we're going to come right
into<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.300> stitch<00:02:29.810> below<00:02:34.660> okay<00:02:35.660> then<00:02:35.840> we'll

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
into this stitch below okay then we'll

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.920 
into this stitch below okay then we'll
start<00:02:36.140> our<00:02:36.260> repeat<00:02:36.709> by<00:02:36.739> knitting<00:02:36.890> one<00:02:37.459> and

below<00:02:40.879> so<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:41.900> find<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.260> it's<00:02:42.410> easiest<00:02:42.739> to

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
below so I find that it's easiest to

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.130 
below so I find that it's easiest to
just<00:02:43.040> kind<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.430> pull<00:02:43.730> on<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.660> stitch<00:02:44.870> you<00:02:45.080> can

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
just kind of pull on the stitch you can

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.069 
just kind of pull on the stitch you can
see<00:02:45.379> the<00:02:45.530> stitch<00:02:45.769> below<00:02:46.069> it<00:02:46.430> no<00:02:47.360> problem

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
see the stitch below it no problem

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.289 
see the stitch below it no problem
knit<00:02:48.829> right<00:02:48.980> into<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:49.459> repeat<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.120> knit

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299
