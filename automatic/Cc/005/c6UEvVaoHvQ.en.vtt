00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:30.369 

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:34.359 

so<00:05:31.369> we<00:05:31.969> know<00:05:32.149> that<00:05:32.180> people<00:05:32.389> follow<00:05:32.930> content<00:05:33.680> so

if you wanted to play half-life you

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.379 
if you wanted to play half-life you
bought<00:05:38.539> a<00:05:38.569> PC<00:05:38.960> so<00:05:39.919> we<00:05:40.639> know<00:05:40.999> that<00:05:41.029> customers

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
bought a PC so we know that customers

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.540 
bought a PC so we know that customers
follow<00:05:41.809> content<00:05:42.409> and<00:05:42.589> we<00:05:42.680> know<00:05:42.830> that<00:05:42.979> the<00:05:43.129> PC

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
follow content and we know that the PC

follow content and we know that the PC
gaming<00:05:44.360> has<00:05:44.809> been<00:05:45.050> regulated<00:05:45.469> to<00:05:46.430> the

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
gaming has been regulated to the

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.540 
gaming has been regulated to the
backroom<00:05:46.969> for<00:05:47.330> too<00:05:47.479> long<00:05:47.740> and<00:05:48.740> so<00:05:49.069> we<00:05:49.369> think

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
backroom for too long and so we think

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.089 
backroom for too long and so we think
the<00:05:49.729> Alpha<00:05:50.259> allows<00:05:51.259> you<00:05:51.469> to<00:05:51.559> finally<00:05:51.919> have<00:05:52.069> all

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:52.099 
the Alpha allows you to finally have all

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:54.159 
the Alpha allows you to finally have all
of<00:05:52.490> that<00:05:52.520> fun<00:05:52.939> all<00:05:53.240> of<00:05:53.360> that<00:05:53.539> content<00:05:53.960> on<00:05:54.080> the

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
of that fun all of that content on the

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:55.359 
of that fun all of that content on the
couch<00:05:54.379> next<00:05:54.680> to<00:05:54.800> your<00:05:54.949> buddy

00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:55.369 
couch next to your buddy

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:58.119 
couch next to your buddy
so<00:05:56.180> you<00:05:56.270> can<00:05:56.419> play<00:05:56.659> companion<00:05:57.529> games<00:05:57.770> not<00:05:58.099> just

00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:58.129 
so you can play companion games not just

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.779 
so you can play companion games not just
online<00:05:59.119> games<00:05:59.719> through<00:06:00.050> a<00:06:00.080> wire<00:06:00.610> down<00:06:01.610> the

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:01.789 
online games through a wire down the

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:03.519 
online games through a wire down the
road<00:06:01.969> so<00:06:02.629> we<00:06:02.779> really<00:06:03.020> think<00:06:03.050> it's<00:06:03.349> going<00:06:03.469> to

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:03.529 
road so we really think it's going to

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.290 
road so we really think it's going to
appeal<00:06:03.770> to<00:06:03.800> the<00:06:04.309> hundred<00:06:04.699> million<00:06:04.999> steam

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
appeal to the hundred million steam

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.320 
appeal to the hundred million steam
owner<00:06:05.509> Steven<00:06:06.110> toners<00:06:06.729> and<00:06:07.729> it<00:06:07.999> all<00:06:08.119> feels

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
owner Steven toners and it all feels

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.209 
owner Steven toners and it all feels
you're<00:06:08.479> really<00:06:08.659> a<00:06:08.689> PC<00:06:09.050> gamers<00:06:09.349> with

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:12.219 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.209 

so<00:06:13.219> when<00:06:13.460> valve<00:06:13.960> launches<00:06:14.960> the<00:06:15.110> steam<00:06:15.349> OS<00:06:15.499> in

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:16.219 
so when valve launches the steam OS in

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:18.189 
so when valve launches the steam OS in
fact<00:06:16.520> now<00:06:16.789> if<00:06:17.150> you<00:06:17.300> go<00:06:17.449> into<00:06:17.659> the<00:06:17.900> valve

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 
fact now if you go into the valve

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.320 
fact now if you go into the valve
website<00:06:18.650> download<00:06:18.949> the<00:06:19.219> steam<00:06:19.430> OS<00:06:19.580> it'll<00:06:20.150> run

perfectly fine it's already built in to

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.640 
perfectly fine it's already built in to
support<00:06:22.999> that<00:06:23.150> but<00:06:24.110> once<00:06:24.289> the<00:06:24.439> steam

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
support that but once the steam

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.260 
support that but once the steam
controller<00:06:24.919> launches<00:06:25.580> and<00:06:25.909> the<00:06:25.969> schema-less

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
controller launches and the schema-less

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.390 
controller launches and the schema-less
launches<00:06:26.779> will<00:06:27.229> offer<00:06:27.439> that<00:06:27.710> alongside<00:06:28.009> the

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
launches will offer that alongside the

launches will offer that alongside the
windowed<00:06:28.669> version

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.800 

we<00:06:32.010> will<00:06:32.340> probably<00:06:32.880> the<00:06:33.150> way<00:06:33.240> that<00:06:33.390> we<00:06:33.540> will<00:06:33.600> do

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
we will probably the way that we will do

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.050 
we will probably the way that we will do
it<00:06:33.930> out<00:06:34.050> of<00:06:34.140> our<00:06:34.260> factories<00:06:34.740> will<00:06:34.950> ship<00:06:35.160> the
