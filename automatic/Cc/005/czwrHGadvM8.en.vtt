00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
next step from that is to just do a

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.219 
next step from that is to just do a
really<00:02:02.670> simple<00:02:02.789> edit<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.690> you'll<00:02:03.869> bring<00:02:04.050> out

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
of sky I'm going to get a shot that just

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.340 
of sky I'm going to get a shot that just
fills<00:02:07.830> up<00:02:08.190> with<00:02:08.220> sky<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.060> get<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.810> at<00:02:09.929> minus

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
fills up with sky and get it at minus

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.370 
fills up with sky and get it at minus

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
okay so that's already seriously moody

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.290 
okay so that's already seriously moody
but<00:02:21.380> just<00:02:21.620> by<00:02:21.770> going<00:02:22.010> in<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.640> getting<00:02:22.880> the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
but just by going in and getting the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.420 
but just by going in and getting the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
and painting in some clarity you're

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.780 
and painting in some clarity you're
going<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.470> bring<00:02:30.590> up<00:02:30.739> even<00:02:31.069> more<00:02:31.190> detail<00:02:31.640> in
