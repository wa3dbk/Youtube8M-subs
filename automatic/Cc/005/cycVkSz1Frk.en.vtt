tiles are set up differently making the

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.450 
tiles are set up differently making the
levels<00:01:40.900> different<00:01:41.140> for<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:42.640> levels<00:01:42.970> Owen<00:01:43.810> and

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.550 
tell you why not because it sounds
terrible<00:02:06.310> if<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.970> gameplay<00:02:07.510> is<00:02:07.570> repetitive

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
terrible if the gameplay is repetitive

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.250 
terrible if the gameplay is repetitive
it's<00:02:09.070> boring

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.860 

I<00:02:14.319> mean<00:02:15.159> really<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.090> mean<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:18.599> sounds<00:02:19.599> like<00:02:19.810> a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
I mean really I mean it sounds like a

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.259 
I mean really I mean it sounds like a
good<00:02:20.110> i<00:02:20.170> know<00:02:21.099> it<00:02:21.280> doesn't<00:02:21.610> sound<00:02:21.819> like<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.150> good

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
good i know it doesn't sound like a good

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.339 
good i know it doesn't sound like a good
idea<00:02:22.390> just<00:02:23.319> shoot<00:02:23.620> tiles<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.870> find<00:02:25.870> stuff

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
idea just shoot tiles and find stuff

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.539 
idea just shoot tiles and find stuff
like<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:27.640> know<00:02:27.670> it

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.030 

there<00:02:32.549> are<00:02:32.700> ways<00:02:32.909> you<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.360> make<00:02:33.599> sense<00:02:34.409> sort

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
there are ways you can make sense sort

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.020 
there are ways you can make sense sort
of<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.879> life<00:02:36.120> enemies<00:02:36.569> with<00:02:36.750> objects<00:02:38.030> that

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
of to life enemies with objects that

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.710 
of to life enemies with objects that
kinda<00:02:39.540> adds<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:40.230> little<00:02:40.349> bit<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:40.980> but<00:02:41.720> it's

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
kinda adds a little bit to it but it's

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.199 
kinda adds a little bit to it but it's
really<00:02:43.049> not<00:02:43.290> necessary<00:02:43.590> your<00:02:44.430> little<00:02:44.670> w

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
really not necessary your little w

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.509 
really not necessary your little w
powerup<00:02:45.780> can<00:02:46.019> usually<00:02:46.200> take<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.920> take<00:02:47.310> on

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
powerup can usually take that take on

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.819 
powerup can usually take that take on
just<00:02:47.849> about<00:02:47.970> anything<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.659> enemies<00:02:49.019> can

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
just about anything the enemies can

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.830 
just about anything the enemies can
throw<00:02:50.190> at<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.730> it's<00:02:51.060> just<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.360> few<00:02:51.540> shots

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
next level and I'm probably going to end

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.960

now this pretty much personifies the

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.550 
now this pretty much personifies the
entire<00:05:33.230> game<00:05:33.560> this<00:05:33.830> next<00:05:34.190> part<00:05:35.140> the<00:05:36.140> same

thing over and over and over and over I

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.740 
thing over and over and over and over I
mean<00:05:42.650> who<00:05:42.860> who<00:05:43.370> would<00:05:43.550> want<00:05:43.820> to<00:05:43.910> play<00:05:44.210> this<00:05:44.450> for

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
interesting enough for me to want to

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.170

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
thing about this game I can really say

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.210 
thing about this game I can really say
is<00:06:16.949> that<00:06:17.370> those<00:06:18.330> art<00:06:18.630> screens<00:06:19.050> are<00:06:19.349> pretty

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
is that those art screens are pretty

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.950 
is that those art screens are pretty
decent<00:06:20.789> and<00:06:21.000> that<00:06:21.240> and<00:06:21.509> that<00:06:21.539> it<00:06:21.930> doesn't

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
decent and that and that it doesn't

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.830 
decent and that and that it doesn't
really<00:06:22.560> have<00:06:22.800> any<00:06:22.949> glitches<00:06:23.340> most<00:06:23.910> of<00:06:24.090> most

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 
wisdomtree games have pretty bad

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.580 
wisdomtree games have pretty bad
glitches<00:06:27.419> in<00:06:27.569> them<00:06:27.660> but<00:06:27.810> this<00:06:28.050> doesn't<00:06:30.440> so<00:06:31.440> it

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
glitches in them but this doesn't so it

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.309 
glitches in them but this doesn't so it
was<00:06:31.740> a<00:06:31.770> fairly<00:06:32.160> decently<00:06:32.970> done<00:06:33.330> rip<00:06:33.690> off<00:06:33.900> of

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 
was a fairly decently done rip off of

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:37.999 
was a fairly decently done rip off of
whatever<00:06:35.130> it<00:06:35.490> ripped<00:06:35.729> off<00:06:35.940> of<00:06:36.240> and<00:06:37.009> still

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
I'm just going to stop here but my

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:56.060 
I'm just going to stop here but my
verdict<00:06:50.400> here<00:06:50.910> is<00:06:51.330> about<00:06:52.259> it<00:06:52.500> the<00:06:53.900> D<00:06:54.900> minus<00:06:55.289> F

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
verdict here is about it the D minus F

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.560 
verdict here is about it the D minus F
range<00:06:56.820> i'd<00:06:57.150> say<00:06:57.449> f<00:06:57.710> will<00:06:58.710> not<00:06:58.949> an<00:06:59.159> FD<00:06:59.550> night<00:06:59.759> d-

range i'd say f will not an FD night d-
simply<00:07:00.960> for<00:07:01.139> the<00:07:01.229> fact<00:07:01.259> that<00:07:01.620> it<00:07:01.800> isn't

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
simply for the fact that it isn't

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.779 
simply for the fact that it isn't
glitched<00:07:02.820> out<00:07:03.060> that<00:07:03.570> it's<00:07:03.750> playable<00:07:04.789> which

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:05.789 
glitched out that it's playable which

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:07.999 
glitched out that it's playable which
tells<00:07:06.150> me<00:07:06.270> that<00:07:06.389> at<00:07:06.630> least<00:07:06.659> WisdomTree<00:07:07.560> put<00:07:07.889> in

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:08.009 
tells me that at least WisdomTree put in

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:11.899 
tells me that at least WisdomTree put in
a<00:07:08.280> half-assed<00:07:09.240> effort<00:07:09.539> on<00:07:09.930> this<00:07:10.169> but<00:07:10.580> it's<00:07:11.580> not

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:11.909 
a half-assed effort on this but it's not

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:16.249 
a half-assed effort on this but it's not
fun<00:07:12.360> it<00:07:13.229> really<00:07:13.470> isn't<00:07:14.449> you<00:07:15.449> know<00:07:15.539> don't<00:07:16.110> play

fun it really isn't you know don't play
this<00:07:16.620> game<00:07:17.270> and<00:07:19.849> that's<00:07:20.849> the<00:07:21.000> end<00:07:21.180> of<00:07:21.270> my

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
this game and that's the end of my
