00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.280
 your router case I'm going to pause 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.590
 while I opened already reminding people that 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.900
 To open this page you just have to type 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.860
 mp you got there in cm in its 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.269

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:53.090
 the snow cm as I said ip trust and 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.370
 here you will not get the same ip because 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.630
 this pv ac will be the address will pick up 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.810

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.920
 I have not added, I'm going to modify 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.580

 basic and you will dictate the door 25 565 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.810
 in case I 'm going to dictate 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.390
 This is because I do not look like who 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.800
 have skype only 80 because skype occupies 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:29.800
 This is the one you put in the 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.590
 ipê will put here in case I already 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.510
 I put it so do not put it on again 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.250
 here you will put that penalty that 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.850

 they will get this ip here they will paste here and 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:52.180
 This is it, this part here. 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:55.020
 After that you'll give a service. 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.020
 close your browser 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.400
 after that they will open the door that you 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:10.770

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:18.340

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.960
