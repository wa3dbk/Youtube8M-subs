let's make that template so let's go

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.420 
let's make that template so let's go
file<00:01:17.729> new<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.650> are<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> see<00:01:20.159> all

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
file new and you are going to see all

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.219 
file new and you are going to see all
these<00:01:20.640> settings<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> name<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.990> want<00:01:22.170> to

down to your rectangle marquee tool the
second<00:02:15.610> one<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:15.970> go<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.780> make<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.110> fixed

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
second one and go and make it a fixed

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.310 
second one and go and make it a fixed
size<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.190> let's<00:02:18.730> make<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.800> 500px<00:02:20.800> tab<00:02:21.730> 70<00:02:22.690> PX

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.860 
size and let's make it 500px tab 70 PX
center<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.460> now<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.700> have<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.270> correct

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
center so now you have the correct

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.630 
center so now you have the correct
dimensions<00:02:26.140> for<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.130> make<00:02:27.310> sure<00:02:27.340> you're

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
dimensions for it so make sure you're

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.130 
dimensions for it so make sure you're
going<00:02:27.790> black<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.330> white<00:02:28.690> right<00:02:28.960> here

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
going black to white right here

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.170 
going black to white right here
foreground<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.860> background<00:02:30.700> color<00:02:30.850> and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180

click all the way at the bottom of your
workspace<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.670> now<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:34.630> have<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> rectangle

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
workspace and now you have a rectangle

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.460 
workspace and now you have a rectangle
that's<00:02:35.950> exactly<00:02:36.340> 500<00:02:36.670> pixels<00:02:37.210> by<00:02:37.630> 70<00:02:38.050> pixels

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
that's exactly 500 pixels by 70 pixels

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.230 
that's exactly 500 pixels by 70 pixels
so<00:02:38.890> now<00:02:39.100> we<00:02:39.160> want<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.460> fill<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.910> with<00:02:40.060> that
