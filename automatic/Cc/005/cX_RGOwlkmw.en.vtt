00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.190
 forgetfulness tocations I come 3 a 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.920
 gameplay of the 0.9 zero point of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.450
 minecraft poker edition so is it 's 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:25.050
 tomaso and johan barely raised this yesterday 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.700
 this video of a gameplay 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.980
 of what will be the new the new 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.800
 minecraft poker edition update 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.950
 the 0.9 zero point where they showed no 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.870
 they showed a lot in itself but it will be 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.480
 interesting what will be the new 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.879
 Minecraft update that not here 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.079
 we are seeing on screen where it says 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.539
 version 0.9 zero point to football one 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.850
 for developers created this just for 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.489
 developers or for test is not like 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.890
 a test and well here what I noticed here 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.949
 is that it takes a long time I think it took 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.350
 like 2 minutes I do not know if it's going to be like that 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.290
 in the real one I do not believe because it's just 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.150
 the bull 1 is I think they have to 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.520
 fix something there because the truth 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.890
 how are you seeing this screen 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.100
 quote it quite 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.479
 what is this commissioning in general in the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.950
 land of the world so good people 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.940
 they were talking about bars of several 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.520
 things 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.800
 they appeared what are new caves 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.320
 blocks and some other things that we're going to 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.869
 be watching right now on screen like 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.330
 come is taking a long time I do not know if 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.780
 they cut the video because it looks right now 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.509
 this we are going to see how one pull later 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.180
 then it comes out I do not know if it's like this or not 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.420
 they cut the video maybe but right now 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.759
 let's notice that and wait for it to happen 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.460
 that's the truth if it takes a lot with some 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.010
 two minutes takes more or less 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.490
 so well let's wait for a 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.460
 that generate the world the truth looks very 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.650
 great I liked they did not show much 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.750
 I wish they showed a little more no 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.630
 they showed so much 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.810
 but hey it's something you're not going to 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.350
 see what wave this said in June in 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.390
 June will leave the 0.9 points but this 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.730
 it's already confirmed what they said in this 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.040
 gameplay so good prepare in 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.650
 June already made us wait a lot but 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.040
 good you have to wait, do not despair 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.860
 Jon please do not despair so 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.739
 well let's hold and well now 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.450
 they will see look see I do not know if they cut the 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.269
 video but then one flip then 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.970
 appeared ok and as we see here it is generated 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.720
 the world quickly as a PC brand 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.470
 this we see there some cracks there 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.630
 There are some chickens 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.850
 we see the rivers look and see how they 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.760
 generates the world the truth looks very 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.500
 cool 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.459
 to the inventory and I think it has not changed 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.980
 nothing I think that's the taiga joke 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.110
 if not bad memory I think if the grass 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.750
 it also looks like it is look there is a 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.230
 proof there they said look there is a 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.540
 new type of a new type of block 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.269
 I do not remember what his name was 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.959
 I do not remember this but good, this is the 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:22.069
 new biome to bring and let's see more 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.230
 there it is with some cracks 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.999
 there they are showing they were talking not 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.230
 I remember what they were talking about and look at the 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:29.230
 step color too 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.330
 the algae in the tall grass I think there 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.330
 is cutting the wood 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.380
 and now we're going to see the inventory in 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.840
 a survival in survival that change 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.430
 give in exchange you can already put it 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.890
 can see the armor change the 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.400
 inventory of survival orita we are going to 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.810
 show how much this cut in total in 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.150
 the last this block of wood we are going to 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.210
 see him there 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.220
 check that is there is the armor 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.700
 look at the inventory there, we can see 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.500
 the armor change looks really cool this 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.970
 now let's see where it gives you there 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.370
 is the crafter table by the way 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.040
 I do not change the kraft table they said that 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.930
 I was going to come with a PC but it's not like that 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.930
 look is is and is exactly the same I do not know 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.730
 in future versions maybe maybe what 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.810
 do as minecraft pc 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:36.510
 maybe at the 0.9 point I do not know but good 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.500
 let's see there are some chickens look 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.560
 in the river 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.980
 I'm very cool 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.070
 and let's see around here there was a bug 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.620
 we make a bug which they said no 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.480
 they saw it look there the trees are 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.150
 floating in the water can not stand a seal 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.440
 but if it said no no 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.389
 we would have the ships that are going to 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.470
 fix so well there are the 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:02.650
 floating trees and let's see let's see 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.229
 more this 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.540
 and good if you want more news about 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.610
 minecraft and I already have some images 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.699
 more they also said that they would go up 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.750
 new images so that they were at 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:19.120
 so much that how is this my baby and 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.520
 are the flowers the new flowers that 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.470
 they were not aware of the 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.710
 new update same install the 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:31.360
 flowers this I think that gioja scolded us has 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:34.270
 taken by this break that flower you 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.820
 he said do not break this I think that 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.979
 TomÃ¡s is Italian, I do not think that's why 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:43.389
 there will be so much English so perfectly 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:46.410
 because he failed him so good so good 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:50.199
 there we see the biomes the general the 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:53.110
 generation of the map or the world 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:54.720
 this look there is not like as from 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.720
 like now 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.440
 I think that I was looking for a 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.780
 cave or something like that I do not remember very well 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.270
 but when they did not show me enough 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.490
 would like them to show more maybe they add up 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.160
 another gameplay I do not believe but let's see 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:15.620
 if they go up another look there is a cave 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.620
 and let's see there there are mountains 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.110
 and good people, I hope there is 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.930
 like that's all they showed us 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.240
 showed more 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:28.240
 I would like them to show more not be a 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:32.110
 medina ready another cave be seen 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.710

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.810
 in survival the flowers 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.230
 that we saw the most the new kind of 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.230
 block 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.150
 same as the people because that is all that 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.600
 they showed did not show much look there 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:50.230
 I do not remember very well that same one 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.640

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:56.950

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:11.680
 called iron over there and good there there 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:14.310
 this gave me laugh because he takes his 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.670
 I think it was shots or the one that tried 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:20.920

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.540

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.010
 stone pickaxe 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:29.050
 ok look there, he was wrong and I think 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.860

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.889

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:38.060
