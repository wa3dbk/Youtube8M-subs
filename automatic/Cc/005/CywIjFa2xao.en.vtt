00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
iron you should be trying it with the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.470 
iron you should be trying it with the
development<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.489> any<00:00:32.669> one<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.910> our<00:00:33.090> products

development of any one of our products

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.690 
development of any one of our products
whether<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.350> an<00:00:34.440> iron<00:00:34.710> or<00:00:35.010> driver<00:00:35.309> anything

whether it be an iron or driver anything

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.549 
whether it be an iron or driver anything
like<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.969> there's<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.660> lot<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.050> input<00:00:37.200> that

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
like that there's a lot of input that

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.680 
like that there's a lot of input that
comes<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.950> from<00:00:38.219> our<00:00:38.550> our<00:00:39.239> tour<00:00:39.420> players

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
comes in from our our tour players

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.389 
comes in from our our tour players
obviously<00:00:39.989> Tigers<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.890> them<00:00:41.040> he's<00:00:41.219> been

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
obviously Tigers one of them he's been

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.119 
obviously Tigers one of them he's been
very<00:00:41.700> influential<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.870> his<00:00:43.020> own<00:00:43.230> iron<00:00:43.500> which

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
very influential with his own iron which

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.160 
very influential with his own iron which
is<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> blade<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:45.329> also<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.660> tore<00:00:45.899> other

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
is the blade we also have tore other

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.779 
is the blade we also have tore other
tour<00:00:46.410> players<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.980> very<00:00:47.190> involved<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.610> this

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
tour players and very involved with this

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.490 
tour players and very involved with this
but<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.570> also<00:00:48.690> goes<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.020> another<00:00:49.200> level

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
but then it also goes to another level

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.260 
but then it also goes to another level
where<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:50.010> take<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> amateurs<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:51.090> well

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
where we take in the amateurs as well

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.630 
where we take in the amateurs as well
because<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.530> can't<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.309> tour

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
because you know we can't just have tour

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.189 
because you know we can't just have tour
influence<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.390> say<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.750> gonna<00:00:54.870> work<00:00:55.050> for

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
influence and say it's gonna work for

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.360 
influence and say it's gonna work for
everyone<00:00:55.410> he's<00:00:55.710> got<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> work<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
everyone he's got to work with the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.069 
everyone he's got to work with the
amateur<00:00:56.730> golfer<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.600> different<00:00:57.930> types

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
amateur golfer and all different types

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.040 
amateur golfer and all different types
of<00:00:58.199> handicaps<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.780> three

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
of handicaps so we have we have three

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.070 
of handicaps so we have we have three
sets<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.829> first<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.820> blade<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.899> is

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
sets so first you have the blade that is

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.539 
sets so first you have the blade that is
probably<00:01:04.470> geared<00:01:04.710> towards<00:01:05.010> anywhere<00:01:05.309> from<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
probably geared towards anywhere from a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.149 
probably geared towards anywhere from a
scratch<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> five<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> 10<00:01:07.590> handicapper

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
scratch to a five to a 10 handicapper

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.070 
scratch to a five to a 10 handicapper
depending<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.610> where<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.479> think<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.810> really

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
depending on where you think you really

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.080 
depending on where you think you really
if<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.799> really<00:01:10.950> play<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> club<00:01:11.549> but

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
if you can really play the club but

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.270 
if you can really play the club but
essentially<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.990> designed<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.439> a0<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.010> a5

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
essentially it's designed for a0 to a5

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.190 
essentially it's designed for a0 to a5
handicapper<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.750> your<00:01:15.900> split

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
handicapper then you have your split

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.170 
handicapper then you have your split
cavity<00:01:16.590> obviously<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.580> split<00:01:17.820> cavity

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
cavity obviously it is a split cavity

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.310 
cavity obviously it is a split cavity
you<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> lot<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> weights

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
you can see that a lot of the weights

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.929 
you can see that a lot of the weights
been<00:01:19.500> pushed<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> lower<00:01:20.520> part<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> this

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
been pushed to the lower part of this

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.789 
been pushed to the lower part of this
club<00:01:21.270> again<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> lot<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.259> get<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> ball<00:01:22.650> up<00:01:22.740> in

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
club again a lot you get the ball up in

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.140 
club again a lot you get the ball up in
the<00:01:22.860> air<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.490> also<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.939> lot<00:01:24.119> of

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the air but also you have a lot of

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.700 
the air but also you have a lot of
perimeter<00:01:24.659> weighting<00:01:25.020> happening<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:25.530> this

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
perimeter weighting happening with this

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.499 
perimeter weighting happening with this
so<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> little<00:01:26.310> more<00:01:26.430> forgiving<00:01:26.970> but

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
so it's a little more forgiving but

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.819 
so it's a little more forgiving but
again<00:01:27.840> Elijah<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.350> shot<00:01:28.590> shaping

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
again Elijah that shot shaping

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.280 
again Elijah that shot shaping
capabilities<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.420> third<00:01:30.689> line<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.200> we

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
capabilities then the third line that we

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.200 
capabilities then the third line that we
have<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> more<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> full<00:01:32.520> cavity<00:01:32.729> cast

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
have is a more of a full cavity cast

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.719 
have is a more of a full cavity cast
product<00:01:33.619> that's<00:01:34.619> definitely<00:01:34.860> geared<00:01:35.250> towards

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
product that's definitely geared towards

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.990 
product that's definitely geared towards
