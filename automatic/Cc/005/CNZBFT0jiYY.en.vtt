00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.150
 And then go get some peace and quiet out there. 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.400
 I hope it 's good whenever we think 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.200
 In fact we remembered the hundreds and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.389
 more hundreds of hours we spent 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.750
 playing the symphony of the night run of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.850
 food the wise of gold quest and even 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.100
 even the latest lords of shadow 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.570
 for example it is difficult to find someone 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.760
 that you do not have a story to tell 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.890
 respect of castro vânia and it's about tek 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.050
 mensa of excellent games but not 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.099
 we can also forget the other 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.720
 side of the coin 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.239
 the games that little pleased the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.790
 players among them we can mention the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.129
 card 64 power adventure o 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.500
 legends for game boy and do not understand me 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.239
 evil this game just did not please 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.090
 fans of the series does not mean that they are 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.860
 bad games but there is a special game that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.690
 is very little remembered 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.670
 perhaps because he was not baptized with the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.430
 castro vani's name and I'm talking about 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.379
 of round and Keston that which is taken by 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.910
 most fans of the series as worse than 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.850
 this morning already made has been released 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.120
 exclusively for those marked in 1988 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.739
 by the great Conama at the time was common 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.780
 that a game released for the powerful 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.000
 borne deported to 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.369
 home video games, which resulted in 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.200
 a certain loss of quality in general 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.330
 after all the markets were well 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.970
 more powerful than the 8 bits of the season 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.490
 but that this vânia was born in 8 bits in the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.020
 old famicom disk system and konami 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.390
 decided to do the reverse of what 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.299
 generally occur and develop a 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.549
 hunting exclusively for those marked on the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.619
 the West there is a lot of confusion regarding 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.380
 Yesterday I decree because he did not receive the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.990
 It's a castle name but it's a 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.720
 egypt as castlevania despite many 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.490
 fans who prefer to mine the konami made a 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.920
 bad work in government game 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.570
 countless complaints from players both 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.520
 which turned out not being released in Japan the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.619
 inter in the game you control simon 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.880
 Belmont dressed in his clothes for 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.820
 to share 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.570
 so this is not a combat outfit is 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.700
 a suit and that's right he had just 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.829
 to marry selena out of church 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.840
 probably on the way to the field where 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.450
 would spend his honeymoon when he 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.670
 suddenly draco appears sequestra selena 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.690
 at a speed that even the light would 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.970
 with envy 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.830
 then quickly remove your 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.600
 suit 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.540
 and guess what you have underneath 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.160
 suit is not your armor and the 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.140
 Whip that I do not question 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.250
 to know where it was hidden 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.410
 but anyway 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.290
 after that and at the time the only 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.740
 question that remains to do is where's the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.810
 logic but there is your mission to rescue 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.610
 his wife from the hands of draco 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.470
 about the game graphics like me 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.330
 said arcades were previously 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.920
 much more powerful than the 8-bit 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.570
 then it means that 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.560
 graphically the game was good 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.930
 sure but of course it is not the spreads 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.520
 are ugly and disproportionate to 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.950
 animations of the characters was really 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.959
 very poorly done when Saimon is 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.450
 walking and really seems to suffer from 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.520
 some chronic intestinal discomfort 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.740
 enemies were evil also designed to 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.430
 truth is that only some sprite hall 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.650
 in the game 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.820
 the movement of soap and slow 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.550
 attacks are lenses 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.410
 anyway the game was slow overall but 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.130
 calm that there are good points in the game 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.780
 yea 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.180
 the high drop scenario remained 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.560
 and the soundtrack 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.000
 let's say it was one of the few 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.640
 features of the game that really 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.010
 liked the vast majority of fans question 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.590
 itself has a striking soundtrack and 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.480
 with this it was not at all different 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.060
 now let's look at a point you 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.739
 can really love or hate for the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.050
 rest of your life 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.510
 And yes, I 'm talking about the difficulty it is 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.010
 to be envious to have sprouted 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.989
 besides all the problems in the 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.120
 gameplay as its slowness one 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.930
 sprint too big to avoid certain 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.120
 damages 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.920
 the game offered something new and me 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.660
 Sorry if I'm wrong but I 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.120
 I 've never heard of any arcade with 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.010
 this peculiar feature when you 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.590
 and even a arcade playing cadillacs 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.780
 indoors and died in the second phase 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.940
 example you could simply place 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.900
 a new plug in the machine and continue 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.730
 where did you stop 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.080
 how many times did you want it or your 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.900
 money goes down 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.340
 now guess what you play well not sweat 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.260
 had this possibility 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.209
 The fact is that each token gives a 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.040
 credit then if you fall into a hole 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.530
 for example you can quickly 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.810
 to insert a new card to receive a 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.760
 and continue where you left off. 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.080
 The great detail in the game is that you 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.830
 he was entitled to three 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.289
 proceed 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.320
 If you died for the fourth time, it was already 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.990
 friend was game over for once 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.340
 You would have to start all over again. 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.990
 from the start 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.150
 no matter the amount of chips you 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.190
 you could buy you could only use 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.290
 three in every move china 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.510
 and do not you think it's hard to die 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.600
 quite the contrary, often with 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.940
 simple two hits and the so a one 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.010
 hole in the front you dropped already 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.420
 It was more a form of space 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.540
 and why I said that you can love 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.070
 much or postpone eternally good, there are people 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.070
 who likes challenges 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.110
 so if you are one of those fun or 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.430
 at least try to have fun 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.950
 the game has still been released to 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.260
 playstation 2 a japanese publisher 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.330
 called hamster has released a dvd with a 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.340
 emulator and Japanese rice to defeat 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.900
 cash tom but definitely nobody 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.150
 must have cared a lot about this 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.860
 great release and that's how I 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.990
 finish this sad story of a game 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.690
 that could have taken advantage of the power 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.420
 of marked but did the opposite a game 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.100
 with bad graphics and bad gameplay 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.200
 an arcade system that did not leave the 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.910
 player to spend money to play 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.250
 I hope you guys really have 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.020
 liked the video if yes leave your like 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.330

 like content too if you already 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.750
 had the opportunity to play it 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.010
 liked did not like leave in comments 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.840

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.610
 hadouken channel of fire 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.610
 Many thanks to everyone and see you in the next
