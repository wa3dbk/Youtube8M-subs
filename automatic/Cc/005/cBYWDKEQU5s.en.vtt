00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
drill a hole into this chamber here the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.840 
drill a hole into this chamber here the
back<00:01:27.060> chamber<00:01:27.950> bypass<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.130> restrictive<00:01:29.729> as

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
back chamber bypass that restrictive as

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.039 
back chamber bypass that restrictive as
hell<00:01:30.799> bushing<00:01:32.240> modulates<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.329> sound<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.900> gets

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
hell bushing modulates the sound it gets

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.710 
hell bushing modulates the sound it gets
mellow<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:35.009> better<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.759> can't<00:01:36.030> smile<00:01:36.360> at<00:01:36.570> all

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
mellow get better and can't smile at all

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.760 
mellow get better and can't smile at all
that<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.619> problem<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:39.320> how<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.530> punch

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
that but the problem is how do you punch

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.170 
that but the problem is how do you punch
a<00:01:40.890> hole<00:01:41.040> through<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.280> side<00:01:41.579> wall<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.970> can't

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
a hole through that side wall you can't

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.639 
a hole through that side wall you can't
use<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> drill<00:01:42.750> because<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> angle<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.590> too

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
use the drill because the angle is too

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.289 
use the drill because the angle is too
steep<00:01:45.049> so<00:01:46.049> what<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.380> found<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:46.950> was<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.369> stick

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
steep so what we found out was a stick

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.810 
steep so what we found out was a stick

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.789 
rod crank the amps up super high and you
can<00:01:55.409> kind<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.850> angle<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:56.939> thing<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.450> way

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
can kind of angle this thing this way

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.209 
can kind of angle this thing this way
and<00:01:59.960> punch<00:02:00.960> through<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.380> wall<00:02:01.409> there<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:01.979> a

double wall there's this thin wall a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.590 
double wall there's this thin wall a
quarter-inch<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.399> fiberglass<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> second

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
quarter-inch of fiberglass in the second

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.850 
quarter-inch of fiberglass in the second
wall<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.869> gives<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.170> into<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.560> chamber

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
wall that gives you into this chamber

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.330 
wall that gives you into this chamber
okay<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:10.920> works

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
okay that works

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.030 
okay that works
real<00:02:11.790> easy<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.390> mean<00:02:12.569> quick<00:02:12.900> real<00:02:13.319> easy<00:02:13.349> so

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
real easy I mean quick real easy so

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.970 
real easy I mean quick real easy so
question<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.459> how<00:02:14.640> much<00:02:15.110> sound<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.530> get<00:02:16.739> for
