00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 and once again wanted to explain that was not 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.719
 no misconceptions about the warranty that is 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.580
 in many places people mention and we 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.910
 we mention that we have a lifetime warranty 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.420
 on our products at least set 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.000
 car up what does it mean it means then 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.310
 that having bought our one once 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.670
 drill there is a spare spindle yet 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.640
 that then you start using it 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.219
 if suddenly you are too lazy to grease there or 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.620
 your bearings have worked out their life 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.309
 or is there an engine that has worked its life 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.660
 although I haven't done it for three years now 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.030
 came across this I think it will 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.739
 very long cheat if you have something like that 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.270
 it happened that you are at your own expense 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.870
 send started product is desirable 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.300
 attach 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.750
 a piece of paper that you need to change there 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.239
 bearings or there we are engines not 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.489
 spinning or what happened up there 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.140
 send to your seller's address 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.939
 who bought because there is 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.820
 regional dealers we have there 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.490
 where you are more comfortable and cheaper because 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.159
 they are all connected with us throw us 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.890
 for them it is not difficult 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.290
 or in extreme cases, the mail site 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.380
 profile ace and there you will be contacted 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.780
 explain how to do better 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.759
 after which all repairs for them 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.710
 no one in life will ever take you 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.650
 money while i'm alive at least i will 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.860
 follow this in general no one 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.820
 against actually here and then 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.979
 she means your name will be sent 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.200
 your product repaired for free 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.590
 but here is the shipment back and forth pay 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.810
 you 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.810
 that is, at this moment, consider and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.329
 just some simple things here 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.430
 type of lubricant yes there too much 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.460
 getting hot there might be worth smearing than 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.270
 Take this into account 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.770
 still wanted to pay attention will start 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:08.360
 last time letters some people 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.920
 send me including mean like 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.580
 correctly disassemble the spindle 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.870
 dates powerful muscular right his not 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.349
 disassemble means matter what's the matter all 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.099
 is that the bearings in our spindles and 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.849
 on the shaft and in the case they sit on the crawl 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:31.400
 there is but in some videos said 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:34.130
 Saturn well, she just does not type a Crow 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.980
 see that is for correct when 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.769
 disassembling the spindle in general bearings they 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.329
 go to emit those that we shoot then 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.459
 there is just to take it apart to see 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:47.120
 or see there clean it not 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.010
 need to do clean video about lubrication 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.900
 there is what clean what 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.950
 shed oil everything is clear that is not 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.959
 need to disassemble them disassembling spindle you 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.590
 lose your warranty because trust me 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.780
 I will see the spindle disassembled or not the case 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.280
 all about what's what's the car 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.450
 assembled now change bearings there 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.989
 for our masters 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.660
 but this is a matter of five minutes you with this on 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.250
 poking honestly say simply 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.160
 suffer because we have everything 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.319
 devices all conductors you have it 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.120
 will cause problems if you are sure 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.720
 confident of their mechanical 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.840
 experience here you understand what it is planted on 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.180
 in this teng aerobic adhesive sealant 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.090
 do you know what don dale loctite is there 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.370
 or I'm on Crow, what do you all mean ? 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.410
 it turns out actually here under 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.660
 it means under under this video probably 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.290
 I will put the dimensions of the bearings and their 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.310
 name but for such people 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.530
 simple user is not very 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.750
 I recommend to go there that people 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.389
 Sometimes I can help, but here 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.370
 believe me that after going there 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:02.120
 Slazy spindle but it's probably an hour 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.430
 work then you need to find out whether it is regular 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.829
 everything works yes that is it is a lot of time 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.080
 and in general no one really needs 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.360
 believe me 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.960
 here then if suddenly ever from 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:18.020
 will occur such spindle which 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.260
 that's already quite dead and what is easier to send 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.570
 new replacing the whole you understand that here 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.740
 these spindle they will go then go to 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.750
 work for children, that is, they will 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.730
 restored in their presentation 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.120
 no this product is working break 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.550
 here 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.140
 Our products are not what they will go to children 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.030
 that is, as if but do not try yourself 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.600
 picked us and honestly it 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:45.050
 make it easier here still wanted 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.930
 Remarochka such make blocks here 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.190
 food which are greyish 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.530
 which claimed that regular grayish 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.360
 Now more and more people buy 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.860
 these pulsed ones fused 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.070
 adjustment and doing right in 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.360
 Generally a very convenient block 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.730
 lying without need this gray one 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.540
 block if you don't need it you can 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.530
 do that on the back side 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.060
 engrave any wish 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.710
 student and send this block to us that is 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.600
 to be sure that this god is not 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.070
 will go on sale he really won't go to 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.750
 you can just sell here 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.030
 imagine someone will be some kind 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.740
 lad

 vulgarity without shit simply without 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.950
 human wish to the future master 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.050
 and can send in general if 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.270
 get to track the fate of these 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.950
