00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.120
 how about friends thank you very much for watching 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.200
 the videos today gerardo ramÃ­rez and good 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.470
 I want to talk today 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.570
 of the four-time note we have 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.119
 spoken of the note of a time the note 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.750
 of the fourth the two-time note that is 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.840
 the note of the half and on this occasion 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.700
 I want to talk about the note 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.700
 four-stroke 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.920
 Well, here is this note that 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.270
 As you will see, the clica is not called 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.210
 apply 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.530
 this the stick that you always see the 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:51.309
 true notes 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.309
 this this note if and if you see it here 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.720
 round 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.360
 and it is not illuminated what makes it 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.510
 different is that you do not have it applied and 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.170
 that tells us that it is the note of four 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.590
 four-stroke note times 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.650
 ok as you read this note good is very 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.420
 as simple and as you will see forgiveness as 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.659
 they noticed the past videos and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.299
 you will remember this is the note of 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.370
 the correct thing is exactly the note of 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.880
 two good 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.880
 this note does the same job what 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.370
 what we do is let's sustain it four 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.990
 sound times on our keyboard or 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.940
 our piano 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.010
 this is gift number four again 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.940
 I reiterate 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.990
 I will tell again I will take the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.990
 time here on my foot 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.369
 well with compass of preparation and 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.369
 we went to read the note 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.049
 or not 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.130
 how easy, very easy, I am going to play it in the 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.549
 piano 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.539
 so you can notice how this note sounds 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.539
 It is very simple 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.470
 by 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.550
 that's the four- stroke note in this 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.830
 same video I want to take advantage of for 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.290
 talk to them 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.290
 of the different ones as there are 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.340
 not these 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.670
 musicals that they give us and they provide us 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.080
 we are forgiven by the sound that 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.840
 we want in any melody that 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.180
 We want to play or create 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.000
 there must be silences the silences 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.450
 they are important because they mark the pause 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.959
 between compass and compass 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:59.730
 and they make the melody have rhythm the 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:02.280
 Silences are basic and important 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.129
 his silence is good first we will talk 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.500
 of the silence of the fourth note or the 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.159
 note of a time this silence is 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.159
 It represents 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.819
 this way it's like a 7 and you're 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.629
 hatchies like that 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.629
 zig Zag 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.150
 this is the silence of a time look 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.990
 well how is this like a 7 but with 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:33.080
 several zig zag at the bottom 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:39.370
 silence of a room or a feeling 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.370
 and I'm going to present the silences 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:50.220
 two-stroke is like a hat and 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.020
 this box will always go from above 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.210
 the line when this box is up 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.210
 of the line means that it is a 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.590
 two- time silence of the note of 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:03.360
 half 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:06.739
 down here they notice it I have the silence of 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.739
 four times 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:14.720
 the head hat 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.670
 they notice it four times 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.530
 as we go along with these 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.750
 I 'll explain them to you and I'll go 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:26.670
 to go putting these hats so that 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:28.680
 know how to read them and well, this one 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.360
 I hope this has been a lot 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.270
 utility for you 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.340
 Any doubt comes back in the video to 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.650
 that they begin to familiarize with these 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.449
 notes that I am giving you and to begin with 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.360
 to create and touch our first 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.729
 score very simply after 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.830
 we will be introducing for those who play 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.830
 pianos the key of fa but to start 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.620
 It is important that you give a review of the 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.259
 past videos so that they go taking 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.680
 a continuity and the information that 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:04.200
 they are receiving be of profit 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:07.740
 and I guarantee you that if you 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.170
 open your mind and are applied and apply 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.240
 the information I can assure you that 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.610
 they can learn to read very fast 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.160

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.070
