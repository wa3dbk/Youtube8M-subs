the tongue is definitely a key area when
we're<00:00:16.529> talking<00:00:16.890> about<00:00:17.480> the<00:00:18.480> flexing

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
works as a as an energy return function

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.400 
works as a as an energy return function
so<00:01:32.130> as<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.430> flex<00:01:32.760> forward<00:01:33.120> the<00:01:33.780> insert<00:01:34.110> ship

stiffer one or her or go down in
stiffness<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.190> really<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.850> can<00:02:09.000> really

stiffness it really you can really

feel the effects of the spring effect of
the<00:02:11.700> different<00:02:11.970> interests<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:12.450> put<00:02:12.660> on

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
the different interests that we put on

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.870 
the different interests that we put on
this<00:02:12.900> time<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:14.220> tendon<00:02:14.550> guard<00:02:14.760> is

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
this time the the tendon guard is

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.180 
this time the the tendon guard is
another<00:02:15.180> aspect<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.200> total<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:16.830> skate

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
another aspect of the total one skate

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.640 
another aspect of the total one skate
where<00:02:17.520> there's<00:02:17.760> been<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:17.970> lot<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:18.600> thought<00:02:19.320> put

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
where there's been a lot of thought put

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.430 
where there's been a lot of thought put
into<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.220> lot<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.430> internal<00:02:21.000> discussions

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
into it a lot of internal discussions

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.380 
into it a lot of internal discussions
about<00:02:22.440> exactly<00:02:22.890> what<00:02:23.610> we<00:02:23.730> wanted<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.090> deliver

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
about exactly what we wanted to deliver

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.510 
about exactly what we wanted to deliver
to<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.960> player<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.530> order<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.750> have<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> skate

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
to the player in order to have a skate

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.220 
to the player in order to have a skate
give<00:02:29.520> him<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.820> skate<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.480> allows<00:02:30.960> him<00:02:31.200> to

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
give him a skate that allows him to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.180 
give him a skate that allows him to
perform<00:02:31.890> at<00:02:32.250> his<00:02:32.430> biomechanical<00:02:33.390> best<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.190> we

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
perform at his biomechanical best and we

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.370 
perform at his biomechanical best and we
think<00:02:35.400> we've<00:02:35.550> achieved<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.450> with<00:02:36.480> total<00:02:37.260> one

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
think we've achieved that with total one

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.430 
think we've achieved that with total one
skate<00:02:37.740> we've<00:02:37.890> got<00:02:38.100> we've<00:02:38.610> dialed<00:02:38.940> in<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.540> what

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
skate we've got we've dialed in the what

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.400 
skate we've got we've dialed in the what
we<00:02:40.560> think<00:02:40.800> is<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.070> just<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.580> right<00:02:41.760> flex

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
we think is the just the right flex

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.690 
we think is the just the right flex
there's<00:02:43.410> enough<00:02:43.650> resistance<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.460> you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
there's enough resistance so that you

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.790 
there's enough resistance so that you
can<00:02:44.880> feel<00:02:45.180> there's<00:02:45.990> some<00:02:46.170> support<00:02:46.620> at<00:02:46.710> the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
can feel there's some support at the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.680 
can feel there's some support at the
back<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.160> your<00:02:47.250> foot<00:02:47.520> but<00:02:47.940> at<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.180> same<00:02:48.390> time

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
back of your foot but at the same time

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.560 
back of your foot but at the same time
it<00:02:48.930> doesn't<00:02:49.430> impair<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:51.240> range<00:02:51.420> of

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
it doesn't impair the the range of

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.230 
it doesn't impair the the range of
motion<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.470> any<00:02:52.590> way<00:02:52.740> it'll<00:02:53.310> flex<00:02:53.550> with<00:02:54.060> the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
motion in in any way it'll flex with the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.090 
motion in in any way it'll flex with the
leg<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.140> when<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.350> want<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.650> do<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.890> full
