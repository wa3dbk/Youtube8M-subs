00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.250
 hello friends today we are going to handle a 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.210
 part of you tricks so that our 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.429
 lumia 925 team in this case through 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.680
 a more fluid and much faster way 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.930
 if the first thing we have to do 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.870
 close applications as we close 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.840
 the applications in a nokia with windows 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.860
 8.1 tele or windows 8 for both is 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.450
 let's go to the back arrow here 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.790
 and there they show us the applications that 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:37.500
 they are open disabled 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.880
 you have to enable this study xx and so 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.670
 we are closing all applications 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.550
 that are staying open and that's why 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.180
 first place second 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.220
 if I 'm not a user that I have 4g what 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.590
 I can get to do is enter now that 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.120
 apart from configuration we are going to go to 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.880
 We entered the ends of 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.780
 configuration 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.630
 in configuration I can go to the part of 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.450
 re cellular and in booking I can say the 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.490
 configuration team of the xi and here 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.670
 I can tell you look still using 4 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.670
 g 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.740
 that the team stayed me or in 12 between 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.750
 yes as I want if I did you then 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.180
 only 3 I leave it there is the one that involves me 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.460
 that the problem the battery that is not 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.130
 Warm up the equipment as recommended 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.110
 in this case that is if I am a user 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.270
 average that he used only to 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.600
 chat look at mail and look at my networks 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.560
 I can leave it at 12 if 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.900
 automatically here the part of the signal 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.119
 can change but what in that 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.060
 help first there's more stability in 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.220
 the second called part helps me a lot 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.350
 plus the batteries 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.930
 and third is not enough then slave 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.120
 basically the charger and it leads to avoid 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.610
 both team heating 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.430
 that helps me in the part that the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.500
 street comment on the stability that 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.900
 let's look at the battery but for the internet 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.730
 if it became a bit slow and if I already 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.220
 I will use every google or youtube 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.320
 it's pretty slow if you can go 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.780
 doing by parties publicly I do 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.030
 when you need it and when you want 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.480
 navigate high then I can get another 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.890
 Once enter the part d 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.730
 configuration 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.319
 we go to cellular networks 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.030
 let's go to the last option that says 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.860
 configuration of the see and power 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.670
 place in this case what to leave placed 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.670
 in four axes and 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.220
 so that we do not have any kind of 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.510
 problem this is so they have it in 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.390
 account all remember to be at 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.500
 applications download it from the network what other 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.170
 if I want to do some update 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.660
 of the system will download an application 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.110
 by the store 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.630
 all download this application that is called 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.610
 consists of two that what happens 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.310
 when he entered there the scanned that are 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.620
 the system updates if she 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.989
 well 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.150
 system updates add-ons 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.090
 that requires as such to have the 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.549
 phone if there is I can find them 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.540
 games simply search and download 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:14.060
 if on that side I can handle it without 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.310
 great disadvantage and then another system 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.930
 of white remember that this team I 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.690
 I can handle several windows can 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.480
 minimize placing it too small or 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.519
 I can simply delete the one here or 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.280
 how can I replace it again 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.129
 here I keep it sharp I'm going to 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.110
 anchor at startup and automatically new 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:37.010
 extra is so let's remember the system 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.349
 either he has it or simply here what 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.690
 I can eliminate you here we can leave 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.310
 better management of my 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.080
 contacts 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.080
 from the archives of what I want 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.450
 place here 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.890
 another recommendation that team is not 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.320
 good to let you download totally 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.120
 when you let it totally download this 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.220
 class of devices the battery is 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.790
 it blocks as you can see you can not 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.740
 remove the battery and does not generate much 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.510
 a lot of conflict but the idea of â€‹â€‹not 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.640
 let it totally download or put it 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.900
 to charge either all night 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.810
 this team with three to four hours 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.940
 load more than enough 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.250
 if it happens to you that it does not start 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.220
 the team simply connect it a 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.620
 data cable 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.190
 to your computer and which of colomera 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.960
 will come back if they do not have sharp and the 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.700
 team almost immediately starts 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.670
 this is the equivalent of turning on and 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.590
 turn off but they do it in extreme cases and 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:36.720
 those are the tips and recommendations 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:39.360
 simple for windows 8.1 any 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.740
 thing any doubt not in writing or 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.740
 suggest thank you
