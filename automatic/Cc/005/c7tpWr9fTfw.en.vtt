00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
last year I was on the leadership group

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.969 
last year I was on the leadership group
and<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.479> was<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.630> main<00:01:16.500> thing<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.860> was<00:01:16.950> put

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and that was a main thing that was put

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.469 
and that was a main thing that was put
forward<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.460> us<00:01:17.520> by<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.790> coaches<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.299> that

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
forward to us by the coaches is that

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.289 
forward to us by the coaches is that
first<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.320> foremost<00:01:19.880> all<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> leadership

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
first and foremost all the leadership

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.550 
first and foremost all the leadership
group<00:01:21.390> out<00:01:21.600> there<00:01:21.780> need<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:22.049> playing<00:01:22.320> well

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
group out there need to be playing well

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.580 
group out there need to be playing well
and<00:01:22.939> most<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.150> games<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.509> think<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:25.439> boys

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
and most of the games I think the boys

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.830 
and most of the games I think the boys
stood<00:01:25.890> up<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.189> did<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.330> yeah<00:01:27.540> more<00:01:27.780> or

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
stood up and did that so yeah more or

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.560 
stood up and did that so yeah more or
less<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.250> playing<00:01:29.250> well<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.790> then<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.270> think

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
less just playing well and then I think

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.140 
less just playing well and then I think
I<00:01:30.900> probably<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.920> develop<00:01:32.340> during<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.939> year

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
I probably just develop during the year

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.850 
I probably just develop during the year
when<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.570> comes<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.960> talking<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> boys<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
when it comes to talking to the boys and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.850 
when it comes to talking to the boys and
getting<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.610> message<00:01:35.759> across<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.240> them<00:01:36.860> why

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
getting a message across to them why

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.649 
getting a message across to them why
everyone<00:01:38.159> wants<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.490> win<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> competition

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
everyone wants to win the competition

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.460 
everyone wants to win the competition
and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.750 
and
you<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.100> definitely<00:01:41.550> think<00:01:41.900> any<00:01:42.900> team<00:01:43.170> can

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
you know I definitely think any team can

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.080 
you know I definitely think any team can
say<00:01:45.620> if<00:01:46.620> everyone<00:01:46.950> buys<00:01:47.160> in<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.640> gets

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
say if everyone buys in and gets

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.940 
say if everyone buys in and gets
everything<00:01:48.330> right<00:01:48.630> any<00:01:49.200> team<00:01:49.440> can<00:01:49.620> win<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
everything right any team can win the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.190 
everything right any team can win the
Super<00:01:50.490> Rugby<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.000> Super<00:01:51.840> Rugby<00:01:52.080> competition

Super Rugby and Super Rugby competition

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.500 
Super Rugby and Super Rugby competition
so<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:53.130> definitely<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:54.000> want<00:01:54.150> to<00:01:54.210> try<00:01:54.330> one

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
so it's definitely we want to try one

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.960 
so it's definitely we want to try one
with<00:01:54.840> this
