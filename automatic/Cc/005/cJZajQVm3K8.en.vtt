very<00:01:38.880> well<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.259> say<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.220> a

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
very well and I have to say it is a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.920 
very well and I have to say it is a
little<00:01:41.520> bit<00:01:41.670> safer<00:01:41.850> than<00:01:42.060> using<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.540> knife<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
little bit safer than using a knife and

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.210 
little bit safer than using a knife and
it<00:01:43.020> was<00:01:43.320> pretty<00:01:43.680> easy

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
it was pretty easy

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.270 
it was pretty easy
so<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.820> 1995<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.840> give<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.409> thumbs<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.860> but

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
so for 1995 I give it a thumbs up but

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.520 
so for 1995 I give it a thumbs up but
one<00:01:47.549> question<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.600> ask<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.110> how

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
one question that I have to ask is how

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.039 
one question that I have to ask is how
will<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.829> blades<00:01:50.159> last<00:01:50.880> over<00:01:51.180> time<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.990> I

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
will the blades last over time that I

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
will the blades last over time that I
don't<00:01:52.500> know<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.340> want<00:01:53.460> more<00:01:53.700> information
