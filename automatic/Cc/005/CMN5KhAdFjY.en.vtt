00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:51.650 
just shows I'm doing something good you
know<00:03:50.730> because<00:03:51.000> when<00:03:51.180> they're<00:03:51.269> not<00:03:51.420> talking

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
know because when they're not talking

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.479 
know because when they're not talking
about<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.079> then<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.920> know<00:03:53.069> you're<00:03:53.280> something

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
about you then you know you're something

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.580 
about you then you know you're something
to<00:03:53.549> worry<00:03:53.790> about<00:03:53.879> so<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:54.810> just<00:03:55.049> think<00:03:55.230> that's<00:03:55.440> a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
to worry about so I just think that's a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.809 
to worry about so I just think that's a
blessing<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:56.010> God<00:03:56.280> address<00:03:56.579> was<00:03:56.730> the

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
blessing that God address was the

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.460 
blessing that God address was the
opportunity<00:03:57.269> to<00:03:57.359> play<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.690> big<00:03:57.870> stage<00:03:58.109> and

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
opportunity to play the big stage and

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.410 
opportunity to play the big stage and
give<00:03:58.680> people<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.129> opportunity<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.730> tell<00:04:00.329> me

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
give people the opportunity to tell me

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.819 
give people the opportunity to tell me
what<00:04:00.569> I'm<00:04:00.629> doing<00:04:00.690> wrong<00:04:00.930> like<00:04:01.319> I<00:04:01.410> won't<00:04:01.590> do<00:04:01.709> it

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
what I'm doing wrong like I won't do it

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.349 
what I'm doing wrong like I won't do it
right<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.340> give<00:04:02.640> me<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.760> guidance<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.269> the

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
right and give me a guidance of the

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.420 
right and give me a guidance of the
whole<00:04:03.510> course<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:04.019> think<00:04:04.410> in<00:04:04.530> terms<00:04:04.739> of<00:04:04.920> how

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
whole course I think in terms of how

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.030 
whole course I think in terms of how
he's<00:04:05.640> weathered<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.379> and<00:04:07.379> I<00:04:07.470> just<00:04:07.650> know<00:04:07.859> I

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
he's weathered it and I just know I

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.339 
he's weathered it and I just know I
think<00:04:08.370> he<00:04:09.150> just<00:04:09.269> looked<00:04:09.450> at<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.599> numbers<00:04:09.900> you

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
think he just looked at the numbers you

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.520 
think he just looked at the numbers you
know<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.500> 16<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.519> six<00:04:12.180> rebounds<00:04:12.349> he's<00:04:13.349> got

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
know I 16 and six rebounds he's got

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.020 
know I 16 and six rebounds he's got
probably<00:04:13.890> four<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.370> be<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.519> players<00:04:14.819> on<00:04:15.000> his

probably four and be a players on his

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:32.040
