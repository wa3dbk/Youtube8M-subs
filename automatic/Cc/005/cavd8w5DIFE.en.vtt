say that Alou frantic objective the
equations<00:00:08.719> just<00:00:09.719> tripped<00:00:09.929> over<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.170> equator

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
equations just tripped over the equator

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.720

how<00:00:11.639> long<00:00:13.099> stay<00:00:14.099> there<00:00:14.250> over<00:00:14.580> there<00:00:14.670> over

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
how long stay there over there over

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.330 
how long stay there over there over
there<00:00:15.859> behind<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.039> camera<00:00:17.250> right<00:00:19.070> how<00:00:20.070> long

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
there behind the camera right how long

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.670 
there behind the camera right how long
does<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.609> take<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.150> go<00:00:21.600> from<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.380> southern

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
does it take to go from the southern

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.529 
does it take to go from the southern

how long does it take how long does it

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.529 
how long does it take how long does it

take to get from the southern hemisphere

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.310

to the normal cost a northerner see how

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.979 
to the normal cost a northerner see how
longs<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.739> take<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.719> how<00:00:36.719> longs

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
longs it take to get to this how longs

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.150 
longs it take to get to this how longs
it<00:00:37.140> take<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.469> get<00:00:37.559> from<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.829> southern

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
it take to get from the southern

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.860 
it take to get from the southern
hemisphere<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> northern<00:00:39.750> hemisphere

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
hemisphere to the northern hemisphere

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.940 
hemisphere to the northern hemisphere
well<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.570> see<00:00:42.780> because<00:00:45.950> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
well like that you see because the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.460 
well like that you see because the
equator

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.880 

right<00:00:51.130> that's<00:00:51.850> good<00:00:55.500> since<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.590> equator

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
right that's good since the equator

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.330 
right that's good since the equator
that's<00:00:57.340> right<00:00:57.490> you<00:00:57.640> have<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:57.760> do<00:00:59.130> how<00:01:00.130> long

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
that's right you have to do how long

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.620 
that's right you have to do how long
does<00:01:00.430> it<00:01:00.520> take<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:00.790> get<00:01:01.090> from<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.360> southern

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
does it take to get from the southern

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.610 
does it take to get from the southern
hemisphere<00:01:01.690> to<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.230> northern<00:01:02.530> hemisphere

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
hemisphere to the northern hemisphere

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.000 
hemisphere to the northern hemisphere
well<00:01:03.520> like<00:01:04.360> this<00:01:04.570> did<00:01:05.140> it<00:01:05.230> twice<00:01:05.410> you<00:01:05.860> see

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
well like this did it twice you see

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.360 
well like this did it twice you see
because<00:01:06.130> this<00:01:06.730> is<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.390> equator<00:01:07.720> at<00:01:08.590> Nikki<00:01:09.190> toe

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
because this is the equator at Nikki toe

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.130 
because this is the equator at Nikki toe
now<00:01:09.790> we<00:01:09.850> found<00:01:10.120> a<00:01:10.240> lovely<00:01:10.420> lady<00:01:10.690> here<00:01:10.930> and

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
moment we are exactly in the first

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.920 
moment we are exactly in the first
monument<00:01:20.920> of<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.520> Equator<00:01:21.820> this<00:01:22.270> monument<00:01:22.840> is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
monument of the Equator this monument is

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.350 
monument of the Equator this monument is
a<00:01:22.990> star<00:01:23.380> of<00:01:23.530> 8<00:01:23.710> points<00:01:23.950> that's<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.760> sign<00:01:25.030> over

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
a star of 8 points that's the sign over

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.870 
a star of 8 points that's the sign over
there<00:01:25.570> on<00:01:25.690> that<00:01:25.840> cylinder<00:01:26.290> this<00:01:27.160> design<00:01:27.580> is

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
there on that cylinder this design is

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.150 
there on that cylinder this design is
representing<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.900> calendar<00:01:29.410> of<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.619> ancient

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
representing the calendar of the ancient

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.010 
representing the calendar of the ancient
cultures<00:01:30.369> here<00:01:30.850> for<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.180> reason<00:01:31.600> here<00:01:31.900> we

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.410 
wristwatch like a clock yes Wow amazing
under<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:36.490> this<00:01:36.640> is<00:01:36.759> actually<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.119> equator

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
under and this is actually the equator

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.999 
under and this is actually the equator
yes<00:01:37.900> which<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:38.729> 0000<00:01:40.530> everything<00:01:41.530> all<00:01:41.650> zeros

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
yes which is 0000 everything all zeros
