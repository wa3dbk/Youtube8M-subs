 in the bag were preferably this I read in all the books that deal with it is also possible 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.660
 no other will was naturally self-willed 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.640
 and bite on had to act against that, but a major complication when dressing 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.130
 Willem van Hanegem was that Willem looked so incredibly young 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.260
 happel who once in 58 during the world cup in sweden spent six hours in that of the 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.259
 national coach had thrown that naturally creates one change 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.730
 I know it says a lot thanks to the cards when happening 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.679
 died a 2 9 he got seriously ill he was back in the meantime 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.350
 Vienna he wanted to be steffi expression in his home country when he still wants to 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.380
 once go look up I understood emotional meeting was that 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.379
 for me happel the hand is on the leg of Willem van Hanegem 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.180
 a one for living gesture for this somewhat steep man but I think these two 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.530
 substrates succeed greats okay now and then a small look in the small 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.810
 have heartily awarded them both 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.140
 but now 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.749
 why willem van hanegem not give press conferences 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:59.100
 that is nothing less than a small bow 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.379
 But his great teacher Gravity Happel who are still fourteen words before 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.450
 he said and the rest was appointed 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.070
 van hanegem says nothing anymore 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.009
 at this time 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.009
 as is 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.390
 I'm going to take a look at the xbox now 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.190
 here the tail blade is therefore the book from the hague 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.860
 both sides the hague has the concern 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.560
 neat and tidy and the museum is again a nice piece 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.530
 delay on
