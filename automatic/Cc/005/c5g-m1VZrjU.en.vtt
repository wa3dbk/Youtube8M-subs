00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:22.739 
about hand positions and different hand

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.490 
about hand positions and different hand
techniques<00:00:23.570> so<00:00:24.570> I'm<00:00:24.660> gonna<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.989> short<00:00:25.259> video

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
techniques so I'm gonna do a short video

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
over the back and as I said you want to

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.950 
over the back and as I said you want to
try<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.100> an<00:01:20.190> airtight<00:01:20.760> seal<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.570> try<00:01:21.930> to

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
try and get an airtight seal so try to

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.660 
try and get an airtight seal so try to
make<00:01:22.170> sure<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:22.530> aren't<00:01:22.680> any<00:01:22.830> gaps<00:01:23.280> around

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
make sure there aren't any gaps around

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.969 
make sure there aren't any gaps around
here<00:01:24.470> or<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:25.950> either<00:01:27.260> find<00:01:28.260> a<00:01:28.350> way<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.530> sort

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
here or here either find a way to sort

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.570 
here or here either find a way to sort
of<00:01:29.130> plug<00:01:29.880> up<00:01:30.060> any<00:01:30.240> holes<00:01:31.159> get<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.369> airtight

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
of plug up any holes get it as airtight

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.930 
of plug up any holes get it as airtight
as<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:34.580> but<00:01:35.580> still<00:01:36.000> leaving<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:37.080> small

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
as you can but still leaving a small

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.719 
as you can but still leaving a small
chamber<00:01:38.940> of<00:01:39.270> air<00:01:39.450> inside<00:01:40.220> for<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> sound<00:01:41.549> of

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
chamber of air inside for the sound of

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:50.210 
chamber of air inside for the sound of
resonating

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.120 

so<00:01:51.220> then<00:01:51.370> you<00:01:51.460> get<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.670> warmer<00:01:52.650> sound<00:01:53.650> when<00:01:53.980> the

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
so then you get a warmer sound when the

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.450 
so then you get a warmer sound when the
hands<00:01:54.490> are<00:01:54.580> cut<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.770> more<00:01:56.950> airtight<00:01:57.310> you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
hands are cut and the more airtight you

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.600 
hands are cut and the more airtight you
can<00:01:57.640> make<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.390> bigger<00:01:59.400> contrast<00:02:00.400> you'll

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
can make it the bigger contrast you'll

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.580 
can make it the bigger contrast you'll
notice<00:02:00.880> when<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.090> open<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.960> hand<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.350> take

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
notice when you open the hand so take

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:11.150 
notice when you open the hand so take
the<00:02:02.680> sound<00:02:02.890> way<00:02:03.480> so<00:02:08.580> we're<00:02:09.580> simple<00:02:10.030> wah<00:02:10.450> wah

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
the sound way so we're simple wah wah

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.830 
the sound way so we're simple wah wah
all<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.280> do<00:02:12.430> is<00:02:12.790> there's<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.450> couple<00:02:13.570> of<00:02:13.750> ways

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
all you do is there's a couple of ways

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.260 
all you do is there's a couple of ways
you<00:02:13.900> can<00:02:14.170> do<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:15.250> can<00:02:15.460> open<00:02:15.760> your<00:02:15.820> hands<00:02:16.150> at

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
you can do it you can open your hands at

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.410 
you can do it you can open your hands at
the<00:02:16.360> bottom<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:18.280> it's<00:02:18.460> like<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> kinda<00:02:19.300> like<00:02:19.390> a

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
the bottom so it's like a kinda like a

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.850 
the bottom so it's like a kinda like a
hinge

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:38.380 

some<00:02:26.860> people<00:02:27.160> just<00:02:27.400> move<00:02:27.850> their<00:02:28.210> thumb<00:02:28.570> here

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.530 

which<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.600> effective<00:02:40.050> as<00:02:40.170> well<00:02:44.300> well<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.390> can

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
which is effective as well well you can

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.980 
which is effective as well well you can
do<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.840> way<00:02:47.210> I've<00:02:48.210> seen<00:02:48.450> people<00:02:48.750> do<00:02:48.870> this

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.010 
do it that way I've seen people do this
all<00:02:49.200> kinds<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.530> ways<00:02:49.710> like<00:02:50.630> kind<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.840> way

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
all kinds of ways like kind of that way

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.840 
all kinds of ways like kind of that way
as<00:02:52.230> well<00:02:53.600> cuz<00:02:54.600> we're<00:02:54.840> things<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:55.850> find

reason<00:03:02.430> you're<00:03:02.580> supposed<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.410> hold<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.770> harp

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
reason you're supposed to hold the harp

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.550 
reason you're supposed to hold the harp
in<00:03:05.160> your<00:03:05.310> left<00:03:05.520> hand<00:03:05.610> is<00:03:06.570> because<00:03:07.110> most<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.470> the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
in your left hand is because most of the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.780 
in your left hand is because most of the
time<00:03:08.150> you're<00:03:09.150> especially<00:03:09.990> if<00:03:10.170> you're<00:03:10.320> playing

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
time you're especially if you're playing

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.910 
time you're especially if you're playing
sort<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.820> traditional<00:03:12.390> bluesy<00:03:12.750> stuff<00:03:12.990> most<00:03:13.800> of

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
sort of traditional bluesy stuff most of

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.170 
sort of traditional bluesy stuff most of
the<00:03:13.980> time<00:03:14.160> you're<00:03:14.310> going<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.520> be<00:03:14.610> playing<00:03:14.940> at

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
the time you're going to be playing at

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.340 
the time you're going to be playing at
the<00:03:15.209> bottom<00:03:16.040> end<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.760> harp

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
the bottom end of the harp

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.720 
the bottom end of the harp
so<00:03:19.350> if<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.620> hold<00:03:19.800> it<00:03:19.830> in<00:03:19.950> your<00:03:20.040> left<00:03:20.220> hand<00:03:20.520> you

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
so if you hold it in your left hand you

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.330 
so if you hold it in your left hand you
can<00:03:20.760> get<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> good<00:03:21.390> tight<00:03:22.380> seal<00:03:22.410> around<00:03:22.950> the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
can get a good tight seal around the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.900 
can get a good tight seal around the
bottom<00:03:23.700> end<00:03:24.740> but<00:03:25.740> I<00:03:25.770> actually<00:03:26.100> hold<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.730> harp

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
bottom end but I actually hold the harp

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.580 
bottom end but I actually hold the harp
in<00:03:27.120> my<00:03:27.330> right<00:03:28.080> hand<00:03:28.350> most<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.220> time

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
in my right hand most of the time

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.140 
in my right hand most of the time
because<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.709> was<00:03:31.860> self-taught<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.550> it<00:03:32.700> felt<00:03:33.090> a

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
because I was self-taught and it felt a

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.610 
because I was self-taught and it felt a
lot<00:03:33.300> more<00:03:33.510> natural<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.770> me<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.340> do<00:03:35.880> it<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.120> way

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
lot more natural to me to do it that way

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.479 
lot more natural to me to do it that way
and<00:03:37.790> I'd<00:03:38.790> been<00:03:38.970> playing<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.330> few<00:03:39.480> years<00:03:39.810> before

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
and I'd been playing a few years before

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.800 
and I'd been playing a few years before
someone<00:03:41.489> pointed<00:03:41.970> out<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.300> you're<00:03:42.480> supposed

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
someone pointed out that you're supposed

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.050 
someone pointed out that you're supposed
to<00:03:43.080> do<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.739> this<00:03:43.860> way<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:46.459> and<00:03:47.459> now<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:47.820> feels

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
to do it this way and and now it feels

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.120 
to do it this way and and now it feels
really<00:03:48.269> ought<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.570> hold<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.050> harp<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:49.739> my<00:03:49.950> left

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
really ought to hold the harp in my left

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.150 
really ought to hold the harp in my left
hand<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:50.580> just<00:03:50.640> not<00:03:50.910> very<00:03:51.000> comfortable<00:03:51.120> so

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
hand it's just not very comfortable so

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.640 
hand it's just not very comfortable so
what<00:03:53.160> I've<00:03:53.310> always<00:03:53.519> done<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:55.380> can<00:03:55.530> do

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
what I've always done and you can do

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.930 
what I've always done and you can do
this<00:03:55.800> too<00:03:55.980> if<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.250> hold<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.580> in<00:03:56.670> your<00:03:56.700> right

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
this too if you hold it in your right

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.400 
this too if you hold it in your right
hand<00:03:57.890> when<00:03:58.890> when<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.370> want<00:03:59.550> to<00:03:59.610> cup<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.410> rather

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
hand when when you want to cup it rather

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.680 
hand when when you want to cup it rather
than<00:04:01.680> holding<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.160> harp<00:04:02.340> like<00:04:02.550> this<00:04:02.820> you<00:04:03.510> can

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
than holding the harp like this you can

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.390 
than holding the harp like this you can
just<00:04:04.310> slide<00:04:05.310> your<00:04:05.340> hand<00:04:05.700> down<00:04:07.070> and<00:04:08.070> then<00:04:08.280> you

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
just slide your hand down and then you

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:20.879 
just slide your hand down and then you
can<00:04:08.549> still<00:04:08.880> make<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.120> decent<00:04:09.510> seal

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.290 

not<00:04:21.099> quite<00:04:21.340> as<00:04:21.459> good<00:04:21.519> as<00:04:21.759> that<00:04:21.969> way<00:04:22.150> but<00:04:24.300> still

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
not quite as good as that way but still

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.469 
not quite as good as that way but still
works<00:04:26.159> so<00:04:27.159> you've<00:04:27.280> got<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.580> wah-wah<00:04:27.969> which

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
works so you've got the wah-wah which

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.379 
works so you've got the wah-wah which
you<00:04:28.689> can<00:04:28.900> emphasize<00:04:29.469> even<00:04:30.430> more<00:04:30.669> by<00:04:30.939> sort<00:04:31.300> of

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
you can emphasize even more by sort of

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.529 
you can emphasize even more by sort of
saying<00:04:32.250> like<00:04:33.250> same<00:04:33.490> wah<00:04:33.819> sound<00:04:34.180> with<00:04:34.509> your

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
saying like same wah sound with your

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:42.089 
saying like same wah sound with your
mouth<00:04:39.750> at<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:40.870> same<00:04:41.080> time<00:04:41.379> as<00:04:41.560> you<00:04:41.710> open<00:04:41.979> and

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
mouth at the same time as you open and

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:44.670 
mouth at the same time as you open and
close<00:04:42.129> your<00:04:42.430> hands<00:04:43.050> obviously<00:04:44.050> you<00:04:44.349> can<00:04:44.530> do<00:04:44.650> a

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
close your hands obviously you can do a

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:55.100 
close your hands obviously you can do a
fast<00:04:45.069> one<00:04:45.340> as<00:04:45.490> well<00:04:45.669> like<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.150> hand<00:04:46.539> for<00:04:46.719> Brad<00:04:46.930> so

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.209 

you<00:04:56.110> can't<00:04:56.349> just<00:04:56.560> open<00:04:56.650> and<00:04:56.919> close<00:04:56.949> the<00:04:57.189> hand

00:04:57.209 --> 00:04:57.219 
you can't just open and close the hand

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:59.309 
you can't just open and close the hand
so<00:04:57.520> you<00:04:57.580> can<00:04:57.699> take<00:04:57.879> it<00:04:58.029> right<00:04:58.060> off<00:04:58.419> it<00:04:59.020> doesn't

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
so you can take it right off it doesn't

00:04:59.319 --> 00:04:59.879 
so you can take it right off it doesn't
really<00:04:59.409> matter

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
really matter

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.249 
really matter
I<00:05:00.150> never<00:05:01.150> technique<00:05:01.509> that's<00:05:01.719> kind<00:05:01.900> of<00:05:01.960> cool<00:05:02.110> is

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 
I never technique that's kind of cool is

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:09.990 
I never technique that's kind of cool is
if<00:05:02.439> you<00:05:03.689> get<00:05:04.689> a<00:05:04.719> really<00:05:04.930> heavy<00:05:05.289> vibrato<00:05:05.439> gun
