doing so bad because i'm watching
through<00:02:14.810> my<00:02:14.990> video<00:02:15.410> camera<00:02:15.740> watching<00:02:16.580> i'll<00:02:16.850> be

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
through my video camera watching i'll be

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.970 
through my video camera watching i'll be
doing<00:02:17.210> better<00:02:17.480> when<00:02:18.380> trying<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.620> watch<00:02:18.800> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
doing better when trying to watch the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.950 
doing better when trying to watch the
video<00:02:19.310> camera<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:19.850> guys<00:02:20.030> can<00:02:20.210> see<00:02:20.270> but<00:02:20.750> i

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
video camera so you guys can see but i

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.550 
video camera so you guys can see but i
don't<00:02:21.710> know<00:02:21.740> let's<00:02:22.310> just<00:02:22.430> do<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.670> little<00:02:22.910> more

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
don't know let's just do a little more

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.800 
don't know let's just do a little more
maybe<00:02:24.560> i'll<00:02:24.710> get<00:02:24.800> through<00:02:24.980> one<00:02:25.250> ring<00:02:25.810> and

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
maybe i'll get through one ring and

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.740 
maybe i'll get through one ring and
there<00:02:27.650> aren't<00:02:27.830> any<00:02:28.070> ring<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:28.520> here's<00:02:28.730> one<00:02:28.910> and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
there aren't any ring so here's one and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.980 
there aren't any ring so here's one and
there<00:02:30.710> we<00:02:30.800> go<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.300> get<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.450> sense<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.930> the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
there we go so you get a sense of the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.020 
there we go so you get a sense of the
game<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.530> can<00:02:33.680> pause<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:33.920> right<00:02:34.250> there<00:02:34.310> maybe

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
game you can pause it right there maybe

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.100 
game you can pause it right there maybe
if<00:02:35.150> you're<00:02:35.240> going<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.390> hit<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.540> wall<00:02:35.780> we<00:02:35.900> pause

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
if you're going to hit a wall we pause

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.240 
if you're going to hit a wall we pause
it<00:02:36.380> get<00:02:36.890> ready<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.160> do<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> little<00:02:37.580> move<00:02:38.110> and

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
it get ready to do a little move and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.890 
it get ready to do a little move and
that's<00:02:40.250> mostly<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.730> game<00:02:40.880> my<00:02:41.720> overall

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
that's mostly the game my overall

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.790 
that's mostly the game my overall
thoughts<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.830> game<00:02:43.040> or<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.290> design

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
thoughts in the game or that the design

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.860 
thoughts in the game or that the design
could<00:02:46.070> be<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.190> little<00:02:46.400> better<00:02:46.640> maybe<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.330> more

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
could be a little better maybe a more

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.260 
could be a little better maybe a more
detailed<00:02:48.290> design<00:02:48.620> for<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:48.980> levels<00:02:49.340> but

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
detailed design for the levels but

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.630 
detailed design for the levels but
overall<00:02:50.990> I<00:02:51.170> think<00:02:51.320> it's<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.680> pretty<00:02:52.250> good<00:02:52.520> game

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
overall I think it's a pretty good game

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.730 
overall I think it's a pretty good game
the<00:02:53.060> accelerometer<00:02:53.990> is<00:02:54.200> really<00:02:55.270> steady<00:02:56.270> and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
the accelerometer is really steady and

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.530 
the accelerometer is really steady and
it's<00:02:57.740> not<00:02:57.920> laggy<00:02:58.400> at<00:02:58.490> all<00:02:58.610> which<00:02:59.090> is<00:02:59.270> a<00:02:59.300> really

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
it's not laggy at all which is a really

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.350 
it's not laggy at all which is a really
good<00:03:00.230> thing<00:03:00.440> for<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.650> game<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:01.090> down<00:03:02.090> here

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
good thing for the game and down here

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.320 
good thing for the game and down here
you<00:03:02.390> have<00:03:02.630> your<00:03:02.660> lives<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.820> you<00:03:04.820> have<00:03:05.000> your

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.949 
you have your lives and you have your
map<00:03:05.990> here<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:08.090> things<00:03:08.510> coming<00:03:08.870> up

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
map here of the of the things coming up

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.390 
map here of the of the things coming up

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
video because I know I get out of the

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.229 
video because I know I get out of the
screen<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.250> there<00:03:25.580> I<00:03:25.610> got<00:03:25.820> through<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:26.060> went

my review and tell me in the comments on
what<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:36.410> think<00:03:36.530> of<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:36.890> game<00:03:37.070> think<00:03:37.640> of<00:03:37.850> if

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
what you think of the game think of if

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.380 
what you think of the game think of if
you<00:03:38.900> think<00:03:39.110> you're<00:03:39.230> going<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.440> buy<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:39.650> or<00:03:40.390> what

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
you think you're going to buy it or what

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.690 
you think you're going to buy it or what
it's<00:03:41.510> pretty<00:03:41.720> good<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:42.130> advanced<00:03:43.130> levels<00:03:43.459> and

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
it's pretty good you advanced levels and

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.370 
it's pretty good you advanced levels and
keep<00:03:44.180> going<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:45.250> get<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.400> them<00:03:46.580> so<00:03:47.290> if<00:03:48.290> you

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
keep going and get to them so if you

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.530 
keep going and get to them so if you
like<00:03:48.530> planes<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:49.400> like<00:03:49.610> interactive

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
like planes and you like interactive

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.360 
like planes and you like interactive
games<00:03:50.780> when<00:03:51.080> you<00:03:51.170> control<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.620> accelerometer

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
games when you control the accelerometer

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.420 
games when you control the accelerometer
and<00:03:52.520> you'd<00:03:53.090> probably<00:03:53.270> like<00:03:53.450> this<00:03:53.630> game<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.430> I

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
and you'd probably like this game and I

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.040 
and you'd probably like this game and I
don't<00:03:56.030> know<00:03:56.090> just<00:03:56.209> tell<00:03:56.420> me<00:03:56.480> in<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.690> comments
