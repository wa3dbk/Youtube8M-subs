00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
another LED light from Milwaukee they're

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.850 
another LED light from Milwaukee they're
coming<00:00:19.240> out<00:00:19.330> with<00:00:19.360> some<00:00:19.660> great<00:00:19.900> lights<00:00:20.380> and

coming out with some great lights and

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.410 
coming out with some great lights and
this<00:00:21.280> is<00:00:21.400> kind<00:00:21.610> of<00:00:21.640> one<00:00:21.789> of<00:00:21.820> my<00:00:21.940> favorite

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
this is kind of one of my favorite

this is kind of one of my favorite
things<00:00:22.630> to<00:00:22.750> review<00:00:23.289> look<00:00:23.830> at<00:00:24.039> because<00:00:24.250> I<00:00:24.400> use

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
things to review look at because I use

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.210 
things to review look at because I use
them<00:00:25.210> all<00:00:25.390> the<00:00:25.420> time<00:00:25.539> underneath<00:00:26.380> cars<00:00:26.740> in

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
them all the time underneath cars in

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.130 
them all the time underneath cars in
doing<00:00:27.789> home-improvement<00:00:28.089> stuff<00:00:28.660> you<00:00:28.810> seem<00:00:29.019> to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
doing home-improvement stuff you seem to

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.919 
doing home-improvement stuff you seem to
be<00:00:29.259> underneath<00:00:29.560> cabinets<00:00:30.220> in<00:00:30.820> closets<00:00:31.660> in

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:31.929 
be underneath cabinets in closets in

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:33.300 
be underneath cabinets in closets in
areas<00:00:32.349> where<00:00:32.590> you<00:00:32.680> always<00:00:32.860> could<00:00:33.160> use<00:00:33.280> a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
areas where you always could use a

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.090 
areas where you always could use a
little<00:00:33.580> more<00:00:33.820> light<00:00:34.030> so<00:00:34.690> first<00:00:35.680> I'd<00:00:35.920> like<00:00:35.950> to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
little more light so first I'd like to

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.800 
little more light so first I'd like to
say<00:00:36.370> that<00:00:36.550> this<00:00:36.700> tool<00:00:36.970> does<00:00:37.180> not<00:00:37.210> come<00:00:37.630> with<00:00:37.780> a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
say that this tool does not come with a

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.650 
say that this tool does not come with a
battery<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.460> when<00:00:40.030> you're<00:00:40.150> looking<00:00:40.360> at<00:00:40.510> it<00:00:40.600> in

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
battery so when you're looking at it in

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.240 
battery so when you're looking at it in
the<00:00:40.720> store<00:00:40.930> make<00:00:41.170> sure<00:00:41.200> you<00:00:41.500> know<00:00:41.770> that<00:00:41.800> it

lumens second setting which is low will
run<00:01:39.700> for<00:01:39.940> 30<00:01:40.180> hours<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:40.960> that's<00:01:41.140> 150<00:01:41.860> lumens

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010

and<00:01:42.729> one<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.030> reasons<00:01:43.330> they<00:01:43.450> put<00:01:43.690> these

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
and one of the reasons they put these

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.200 
and one of the reasons they put these
two<00:01:44.110> settings<00:01:44.380> in<00:01:44.740> was<00:01:45.310> because<00:01:45.460> they<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:46.060> can

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
two settings in was because they you can

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.790 
two settings in was because they you can
get<00:01:46.360> into<00:01:46.510> a<00:01:46.540> small<00:01:46.720> area<00:01:46.870> with<00:01:47.350> this<00:01:47.530> light

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
get into a small area with this light

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.310 
get into a small area with this light
and<00:01:48.070> it<00:01:48.610> can<00:01:48.820> be<00:01:49.000> too<00:01:49.180> bright<00:01:49.450> at<00:01:49.720> 300<00:01:50.170> lumens

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
and it can be too bright at 300 lumens

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.830 
and it can be too bright at 300 lumens
so<00:01:50.680> you<00:01:50.770> can<00:01:50.950> drop<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.340> down<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.820> running<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.630> low

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
so you can drop it down to running a low

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.440 
so you can drop it down to running a low
setting<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.560> it'll<00:01:53.950> be<00:01:54.070> more<00:01:54.490> optimized<00:01:55.090> for

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
setting and it'll be more optimized for

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.390 
setting and it'll be more optimized for
daylight<00:01:55.840> that's<00:01:56.380> one<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.710> Milwaukee's<00:01:57.159> big

area they try to spread the light out so

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.380

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
degrees and rotates forward 45 years so

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.020 
degrees and rotates forward 45 years so
you<00:02:29.330> have<00:02:29.830> quite<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.860> bit<00:02:31.069> of<00:02:31.160> adjustability<00:02:31.700> in

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.900 
you have quite a bit of adjustability in
it<00:02:32.180> when<00:02:33.140> using<00:02:33.590> this<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:34.010> first<00:02:34.250> thing<00:02:34.340> you

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
it when using this the first thing you

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.240 
it when using this the first thing you

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
get these LED lights in they are bright

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.800 
get these LED lights in they are bright
when<00:02:37.459> you<00:02:37.580> look<00:02:37.760> directly<00:02:37.940> at<00:02:38.300> them<00:02:38.570> so<00:02:38.780> I

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
when you look directly at them so I

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.290 
when you look directly at them so I
wouldn't<00:02:39.140> really<00:02:39.380> look<00:02:39.709> at<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.190> light<00:02:40.400> but<00:02:41.090> on

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
wouldn't really look at the light but on

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.860 
wouldn't really look at the light but on

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.080 
being small even if I come out here a
little<00:02:47.390> bit<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.989> has<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.530> very<00:02:49.040> wide<00:02:49.340> pattern

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
it spreads everything out that's high

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.830 
it spreads everything out that's high
and<00:02:56.030> if<00:02:56.840> we<00:02:57.050> switch<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.350> low<00:02:58.600> there<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.810> a

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
and if we switch to low there is a

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.949 
and if we switch to low there is a
difference<00:03:00.440> but<00:03:01.130> when<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:01.910> look<00:03:02.090> at<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.480> you

difference but when you look at it you

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.650 
difference but when you look at it you
can<00:03:02.989> see<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:03.650> it<00:03:03.830> just<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:05.120> lights<00:03:05.390> up<00:03:05.600> the

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
can see that it just it lights up the
