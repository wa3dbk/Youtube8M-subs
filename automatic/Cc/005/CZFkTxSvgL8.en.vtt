 on the other hand 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:16.219
 4 but if we talk about Gaddafi art in 94 th on the following as the result of a malaise 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.990
 the friend away to imagine a little more time at 15:30 on pc string 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.349
 is also focused on dexter 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.839
 it should be released soon on the pc europe channel on the playstation 3 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.439
 so that very soon 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.689
 so it's mortal kombat 2 the sequel to mortal kombat so a very game 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.280
 violent and the trégor who was at the head lobée by midway 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.780
 edited by espn 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.510
 so at the time you will be creative tintin com cardboard on the terminals 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.380
 arcade 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.150
 and even if we're going to say about 16-bit consoles 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.330
 their laptop so we go 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.490
 it's a pretty violent game recommended to more than 15 years old to be over 18 years old 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.610
 in some countries 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.850
 so for the original story that can serve the sorcerer well we're going 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.110
 say the present in the first episode 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.400
 so the flora precisely speaking Jean's own mandate the cam a lot of between 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.489
 we are the evil parallel world 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.490
 scrambling of transilien canon mounts 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.210
 so that m johnson will say and this framework convention wanted by the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.920
 satellites going on organizing this sense a tournament 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.840
 for the time being 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.460
 this is with the former participants of mortal youth kombat who managed 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.810
 Tuesday to the map on a growth of 0 to 10 raises the minimum 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.760
 a couple of galls the whole thing that is at stake of the transforming asm asm 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.620
 movies 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.570
 scorpions ended on a decline of 0 18% to 10 years minimum living together 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.229
 three members of their family 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.950
 famous poor relative that their workers 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.330
 here is still hitting his enemies but I like that the wizard 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.340
 tlm 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.880
 the god of lightning 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.390
 9 6% we will say 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.290
 the trees transfer this snowy episode 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.060
 the two characters will finally see the first episode we do not see 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.280
 for any damage or three times a month 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.800
 we see it in 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.960
 we see them in an internship together 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.580
 it's a shame and samir bouchyoua microsoft and cultural 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.890
 so here you can not play with the project of the new characters or 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.730
 still like barack obama is talking about man or 7 1 but this time with a 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.909
 blade level memory 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.909
 the idea of ​​tax the memory 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.329
 no american military craft crafts it's a golden maternity 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:23.179
 come back 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:25.289
 didier the die 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:30.629
 adoptive it seems to me from the old all they will affirm the affirmative dave of 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:31.499
 Jean Germain 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:35.279
 to the girl according to the former entrepreneur who was a good thing 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:36.079
 that at the end 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.359
 you have ninard 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.959
 it's the twin sister of jean hamon 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.679
 see a little higher obscure way a little more evil 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:44.560
 from there 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.170
 the former nancy player 1-2 useless the ancestor of lukunga 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:51.580
 and it's on this same site 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.989
 gerard also in less 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.129
 m direction the island 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.269
 So here they are a little bit like 0 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.090
 it exports they have except that it's April 5th 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.599
 students 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.739
 it will be necessary that it is a game which cardboard in 1994 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.879
 and you said just now where he wants this choice is quite violent three 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.379
 percent records in some scenes so that's why it was 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.949
 recommended near 15 years in France 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.839
 see opposite 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.919
 so here is work several are sure around this game 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.649
 for example in some countries the blood 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.649
 I hope the original sales church 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.679
 it is clear that it was purely and simply disabled 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:38.809
 many are echoed taken to enable or disable in the menu 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.779
 options for making an inventory what is it's blows 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:44.509
 special to buy you like very much to evacuate them 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.129
 it's beautiful what are fights 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.339
 cut off the head of the world 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:52.339
 launches into the political vacuum 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.719
 everything that is taking shape 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:59.099
 so that's why not shock our darlings% at 18 hours 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.859
 decided in some countries we will say where the penalty is still enough 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:02.919
 important 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:08.219
 in front of a pit in front of the headquarters of the isie the people who live there what is 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:09.249
 logic 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.769
 that's true it was a little 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.599
 in addition to violent the streak blu-ray player all other games of the same 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.599
 kind 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.040
 at the graphics level 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.590
 so have to see which is a big improvement the report to the first 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.030
 episode it's true that at the time it was a good first mortal kombat 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.659
 the characters carved me I would not kill you 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:39.069
 he is disqualified 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.490
 and art to be able to just that practice 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.029
 we practiced in the most recent at the time 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:46.790
 had been improved compared to the first episode 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.330
 so the characters 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.339
 everything is detailed read in the motion capture 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.779
 which was really there to show just the list of shots exchanged 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.289
 with the different characters 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.399
 and that simply that the post 500 posts it was also created of 

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:03.650
 all parts by an engine 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.430
 think of all 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.270
 the Sunday guest characters capture them and digital illusions 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.430
 at the time in 1995 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.919
 on corner that is eaten what compete a mortal kombat 2 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.840
 at outings the young teacher sector 2 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.840
 so of my son 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.600
 Why 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.039
 to welcome all the characters in the summer 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.599
 disqualified that was it was to forget the wages took precisely so the 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.430
 characters from the movie j 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.940
 he was not frankly a terrible movie 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.740
 it is true that it was really a disaster as long as there is still time 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.900
 vandal claude and other peoples 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.379
 three actors of this film 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:36.930
 and not elsewhere 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.110
 video these factors getting wet 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.199
 he was really 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.850
 m a commercial failure 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.850
 to do as at the time 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.610
 for once you lived your opponent so% it was not a 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.659
 obligation of gross decided to slaughter them it is possible also to 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.289
 turn into a goal once we'll say to do a little frenchy 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.710
 with the latter and we will make a gift and make a few hundred Tamils 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.219
 to survive the cold 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:05.889
 froyo android 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:07.089
 it's a little wink 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.100
 it's true that it was not really happy like that 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.909
 despite a hard match 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:13.669
 the violence of certain scenes 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.240
 but hey it was rather nice 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.419
 but also students 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.529
 the two game balls spoiled pitch 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:20.650
 for those who come 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.860
 so it's lithium itunes pretty much the same ones that are not other 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.260
 that puniet makita north jake lloyd plane towards you 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.659
 he was fighting with 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:32.449
 15 baptism of the launcher 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.100
 there was also noted vote but the debate was animated to the body 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.230
 they took place this Friday to surrender except that this is a 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.110
 huge victory for the 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.439
 in april 2011 

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:47.439
 she's also making fun conceded hidden old characters 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.360
 by this hidden character the debate goes make beautiful things what 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.919
 the whole thing was going on the scorpion 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.490
 except that laddh man who privileged the film around him then 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.249
 to hold this little character 

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:02.569
 it was nice because there are a lot of historical players staying in his 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:03.090
 Thu 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.090
 for example we launched several uppercuts in a row 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:08.470
 forcing his opponent 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.310
 so we had the fact that there was a face that appeared on the side 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.150
 it was the face of a man strong of the activity mortal sound designer 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.770
 kombat 2 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.439
 the visiting team that will make the river on t2 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:24.279
 in the sleeve the wind doing manipulation and we end up 

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:27.619
 also to become commonplace 

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:32.269
 the jv st-ericsson announces an average of 600 amendments yves donguy play a 

00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:34.809
 special 

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:38.849
 it was pretty good I train in mortal kombat 3 is also percent 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:42.319
 the left has forfeited but it's still incredible 

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:45.179
 the site indicates the direction the emergencies 

00:07:45.179 --> 00:07:47.610
 the 100 greatest 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.610
 So here I hope that this little presentation of his Ferrari 

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:54.789
 it will make you want to replay to this day 

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:56.099
 one to be violent 

00:07:56.099 --> 00:08:00.490
 so it's really hard third christmas did not reproduce at home anymore 

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.029
 the same as in this game of fools 

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:05.059
 not wanted to specify psychopaths anyway 

00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:07.899
 Well, I wish you a good day on the facts of today. 

00:08:07.899 --> 00:08:08.449
 see you soon
