the way if you don't have the mental ray

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.859 
the way if you don't have the mental ray
renderer<00:01:13.700> selected<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.420> hit<00:01:15.630> f10<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
renderer selected you just hit f10 and

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.740 
renderer selected you just hit f10 and
in<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.320> common<00:01:19.740> tab<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:21.000> will<00:01:21.180> scroll<00:01:21.509> down

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
in the common tab you will scroll down

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.280 
in the common tab you will scroll down
and<00:01:22.040> in<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.340> assign<00:01:23.670> renderer<00:01:23.930> you<00:01:24.930> change

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
and in the assign renderer you change

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.899 
and in the assign renderer you change
the<00:01:25.619> production<00:01:27.110> renderer<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.680> matauri<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the production renderer to matauri so it

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.520 
the production renderer to matauri so it
already<00:01:33.119> is

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.410 

let's<00:01:37.530> make<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> render<00:01:38.250> test<00:01:38.520> again<00:01:41.270> okay<00:01:42.270> it's

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
let's make a render test again okay it's

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.300 
let's make a render test again okay it's
looking<00:01:42.510> good<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:43.340> we<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.520> see<00:01:44.790> already<00:01:45.270> a

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
looking good but we can see already a

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.530 
looking good but we can see already a
black<00:01:48.560> spot<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.830> middle<00:01:50.010> of<00:01:51.000> our<00:01:51.120> teapot

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
black spot in the middle of our teapot

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.640 
black spot in the middle of our teapot
that<00:01:51.900> is<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.380> reflection<00:01:52.650> of<00:01:53.310> our<00:01:54.650> world

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
that is the reflection of our world

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.890 
that is the reflection of our world
environment<00:01:56.600> so<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:58.230> to<00:01:58.380> cancel<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.900> you

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
environment so we to cancel this and you

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.560 
environment so we to cancel this and you
you<00:02:01.230> could<00:02:01.500> go<00:02:01.830> to<00:02:01.890> rendering<00:02:02.570> environment

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
you could go to rendering environment

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.530 
you could go to rendering environment
and<00:02:03.810> change<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.580> background<00:02:05.580> color<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.510> white

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and change the background color to white

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.490 
and change the background color to white
but<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.290> tried<00:02:08.070> it<00:02:08.100> doesn't<00:02:08.550> look<00:02:08.670> very<00:02:08.700> good<00:02:08.940> so

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
but I tried it doesn't look very good so

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.530 
but I tried it doesn't look very good so
what<00:02:10.500> I'm<00:02:10.590> going<00:02:10.740> to<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.130> go<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.880> create

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
what I'm going to do is go to the create

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.770 
what I'm going to do is go to the create
panel<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:13.080> I'm<00:02:13.530> going<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.890> create<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.780> sphere

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
panel and I'm going to create a sphere

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.060 
panel and I'm going to create a sphere
right<00:02:17.000> in<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.150> middle<00:02:18.360> just<00:02:19.070> covering

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
right in the middle just covering

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.510 
right in the middle just covering
everything<00:02:21.890> when<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.040> increase<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
everything when you increase the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.320 
everything when you increase the
segments<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:25.050> 40<00:02:26.060> go<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.680> modify<00:02:28.680> panel

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
segments to 40 go to the modify panel

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.260 
segments to 40 go to the modify panel
and<00:02:30.330> select<00:02:30.630> add<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.260> modifier<00:02:33.170> normal<00:02:35.270> open

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
and select add a modifier normal open

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.009 
and select add a modifier normal open
your<00:02:36.709> material<00:02:37.709> editor<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.160> apply<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.750> same

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
your material editor and apply the same

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.550 
your material editor and apply the same
material<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.830> our<00:02:41.580> studio<00:02:42.540> background<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.380> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
material of our studio background to the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.380 
material of our studio background to the
sphere<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.920> if<00:02:47.160> we<00:02:47.310> try<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.580> render<00:02:47.880> this<00:02:48.180> right

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
sphere so if we try to render this right

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.530 
sphere so if we try to render this right
now<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:50.340> will<00:02:50.580> be<00:02:50.790> brighter<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:53.540> black

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
now it will be brighter and the black

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.400 
now it will be brighter and the black
spot<00:02:54.930> we<00:02:55.230> will<00:02:55.350> have<00:02:55.500> done<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.930> I'm<00:02:58.140> going<00:02:58.380> to

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
spot we will have done so I'm going to

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.580 
spot we will have done so I'm going to
cancel<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.600> I'm<00:03:00.600> actually<00:03:00.840> thinking

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
cancel this and I'm actually thinking

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.830 
cancel this and I'm actually thinking
that<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.880> too<00:03:03.180> bright<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:03.840> I'm<00:03:04.170> going<00:03:04.530> to

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
that this is too bright so I'm going to

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.310 
that this is too bright so I'm going to
the<00:03:06.840> exposure<00:03:07.560> control<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:09.049> I'm<00:03:10.049> going<00:03:10.260> to

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
the exposure control and I'm going to

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.940 
the exposure control and I'm going to
increase<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.070> exposure<00:03:11.580> value<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.570> 7<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.260> try

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
increase the exposure value to 7 and try

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.630 
increase the exposure value to 7 and try
to<00:03:14.010> make<00:03:14.280> her<00:03:14.430> not<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.269> render<00:03:15.570> test<00:03:15.840> okay

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.550 

yeah<00:03:21.300> that's<00:03:21.690> fine<00:03:22.550> now<00:03:23.550> we<00:03:23.610> just<00:03:24.000> need<00:03:24.120> to

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
yeah that's fine now we just need to

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.260 
yeah that's fine now we just need to
change<00:03:25.560> some<00:03:26.330> rendering<00:03:27.330> options<00:03:28.400> so<00:03:29.400> hit<00:03:29.730> f10

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
change some rendering options so hit f10

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.990 
change some rendering options so hit f10
to<00:03:30.570> open<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.290> render<00:03:31.740> setup<00:03:31.980> or<00:03:32.250> just<00:03:32.760> click

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
to open the render setup or just click

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.380 
to open the render setup or just click
right<00:03:33.180> here<00:03:34.520> and<00:03:36.710> I'm<00:03:37.710> going<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.610> change<00:03:39.180> the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
right here and I'm going to change the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:47.030 
right here and I'm going to change the
output<00:03:39.600> size<00:03:40.820> to<00:03:41.820> full<00:03:42.660> HD<00:03:45.110> you<00:03:46.110> could<00:03:46.470> change

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
output size to full HD you could change

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.960 
output size to full HD you could change
the<00:03:48.170> time<00:03:49.170> output<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:49.980> we<00:03:50.459> have<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.670> single

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
the time output so we have a single

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.020 
the time output so we have a single
frame<00:03:51.620> which<00:03:52.620> will<00:03:52.800> render<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.370> frame<00:03:53.700> that

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
frame which will render the frame that

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.400 
frame which will render the frame that
we<00:03:54.090> selected<00:03:55.550> active<00:03:56.550> time<00:03:56.880> segment<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.870> will

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
we selected active time segment it will

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.360 
we selected active time segment it will
render<00:03:58.620> all<00:03:58.980> frames<00:03:59.520> of<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.680> active<00:04:01.680> timeline

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
render all frames of the active timeline

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.900 
render all frames of the active timeline
and<00:04:02.610> you<00:04:02.640> can<00:04:03.300> select<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.780> specific<00:04:03.900> range<00:04:04.910> so

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
and you can select a specific range so

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.500 
and you can select a specific range so
I'm<00:04:06.390> going<00:04:06.690> with<00:04:06.750> single<00:04:07.380> right<00:04:07.560> now<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:08.510> you

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
I'm going with single right now and you

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
I'm going with single right now and you
could<00:04:09.720> change<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.850> render<00:04:11.850> output<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:12.720> if<00:04:13.290> you

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
could change the render output so if you

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.030 
could change the render output so if you
want<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.770> save<00:04:14.070> your<00:04:14.280> images<00:04:14.760> or<00:04:15.030> video<00:04:16.040> right

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
want to save your images or video right

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.819 
want to save your images or video right
here<00:04:17.400> just<00:04:17.910> hit<00:04:18.329> files<00:04:18.630> I'm<00:04:18.959> not<00:04:19.470> going<00:04:19.709> to

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
here just hit files I'm not going to

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:20.569 
here just hit files I'm not going to
save<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.160> anyway

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
save it anyway

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.760 
save it anyway
and<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:21.630> can<00:04:21.900> change<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.740> view<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.570> camera<00:04:24.770> so

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
and you can change the view to camera so

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.440 
and you can change the view to camera so
it<00:04:26.220> will<00:04:26.760> render<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.800> big<00:04:28.800> camera<00:04:29.270> that<00:04:30.270> we

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
it will render the big camera that we

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.210 
it will render the big camera that we
have<00:04:30.630> on<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.900> scene<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.620> can<00:04:31.800> hit<00:04:32.010> this

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
have on the scene and you can hit this

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.550 
have on the scene and you can hit this
lock<00:04:32.520> right<00:04:32.729> here<00:04:32.790> so<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.780> always<00:04:34.050> rendered

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
lock right here so it always rendered

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.770 
lock right here so it always rendered
this<00:04:34.800> camera<00:04:35.479> so<00:04:37.640> now<00:04:38.640> I'm<00:04:38.820> going<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.120> indirect

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
this camera so now I'm going to indirect

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.920 
this camera so now I'm going to indirect
illumination<00:04:39.990> and<00:04:41.330> enable<00:04:42.330> find<00:04:42.600> or<00:04:42.750> gather

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
illumination and enable find or gather

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:50.030 
illumination and enable find or gather
and<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:45.229> actually<00:04:46.229> think<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:47.100> low<00:04:49.040> precision

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
and I actually think the low precision

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.840 
and I actually think the low precision
presets<00:04:50.610> it's<00:04:51.150> it's<00:04:51.630> better<00:04:52.220> but<00:04:53.220> I'm<00:04:53.610> going

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
presets it's it's better but I'm going

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.800 
presets it's it's better but I'm going
with<00:04:53.960> drasticals<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:55.400> not<00:04:56.400> very<00:04:57.030> patience<00:04:57.660> to

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
with drasticals and not very patience to

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.590 
with drasticals and not very patience to
waiting<00:04:58.620> it<00:04:58.710> Surrender<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.310> I'm<00:05:00.150> just<00:05:00.360> going

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
waiting it Surrender and I'm just going

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.900 
waiting it Surrender and I'm just going
to<00:05:00.750> increase<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.260> diffuse<00:05:01.620> bounces<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.490> two

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
to increase the diffuse bounces to two

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.290 
to increase the diffuse bounces to two
these<00:05:05.910> options<00:05:06.300> right<00:05:06.360> here<00:05:06.510> are<00:05:07.080> used<00:05:07.770> for

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
these options right here are used for

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.760 
these options right here are used for
tweaking<00:05:10.100> global<00:05:11.100> illumination<00:05:11.479> bottoms

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
tweaking global illumination bottoms

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.340 
tweaking global illumination bottoms
which<00:05:13.770> I'm<00:05:13.979> not<00:05:14.130> going<00:05:14.430> to<00:05:15.080> activate<00:05:16.080> right

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
which I'm not going to activate right

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.230 
which I'm not going to activate right
now<00:05:16.500> by<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.860> way<00:05:16.950> you<00:05:17.130> can<00:05:17.340> scroll<00:05:17.760> down<00:05:17.970> you

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
now by the way you can scroll down you

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.820 
now by the way you can scroll down you
will<00:05:18.270> see<00:05:19.010> the<00:05:20.010> options<00:05:20.430> of<00:05:20.580> caustics<00:05:21.210> and

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
will see the options of caustics and

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.280 
will see the options of caustics and
global<00:05:22.830> illumination<00:05:23.390> this<00:05:24.390> is<00:05:24.570> a<00:05:24.600> very

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
global illumination this is a very

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.420 
global illumination this is a very
complex<00:05:26.479> procedure<00:05:27.479> and<00:05:28.169> I<00:05:28.680> think<00:05:29.280> it

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
complex procedure and I think it

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.490 
complex procedure and I think it
deserves<00:05:29.669> a<00:05:30.060> whole<00:05:30.270> tutorial<00:05:30.570> just<00:05:31.020> for

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
deserves a whole tutorial just for

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.080 
deserves a whole tutorial just for
global<00:05:31.830> illumination

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
global illumination

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.720 
global illumination
so<00:05:33.630> I'm<00:05:33.720> not<00:05:33.870> going<00:05:34.139> to<00:05:34.260> to<00:05:34.950> activate<00:05:35.430> it<00:05:35.550> right

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
so I'm not going to to activate it right

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:42.490 
so I'm not going to to activate it right
now<00:05:38.360> that's<00:05:39.360> okay<00:05:39.660> in<00:05:39.750> this<00:05:39.870> rendering

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.580 

elimination<00:05:43.500> I'm<00:05:43.980> going<00:05:44.790> to<00:05:44.880> render<00:05:45.590> tab

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
elimination I'm going to render tab

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.780 
elimination I'm going to render tab
right<00:05:46.830> now<00:05:47.570> and<00:05:48.570> I'm<00:05:48.660> going<00:05:48.870> to<00:05:49.020> increase<00:05:49.320> the

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
right now and I'm going to increase the

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.550 
right now and I'm going to increase the
minimum<00:05:50.790> samples<00:05:51.480> to<00:05:51.630> one<00:05:51.840> and<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.200> maximum

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
minimum samples to one and the maximum

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.790 
minimum samples to one and the maximum
to<00:05:52.800> 16<00:05:53.400> and<00:05:53.580> I'm<00:05:54.540> going<00:05:54.750> to<00:05:54.870> change<00:05:55.169> the<00:05:55.380> suitor

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
to 16 and I'm going to change the suitor

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.440 
to 16 and I'm going to change the suitor
type<00:05:56.070> to<00:05:56.370> Mitchell<00:05:57.150> and<00:05:58.790> if<00:05:59.790> I<00:05:59.940> render<00:06:00.270> this

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
type to Mitchell and if I render this

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.390 
type to Mitchell and if I render this
right<00:06:00.690> now

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
right now

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.940 
right now
it<00:06:02.400> will<00:06:02.790> probably<00:06:03.330> probably<00:06:04.080> probably<00:06:04.260> be

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
it will probably probably probably be

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:11.350 
it will probably probably probably be
very<00:06:05.280> brighter<00:06:08.660> yeah<00:06:09.660> that's<00:06:10.110> because<00:06:10.350> of<00:06:10.680> the

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
very brighter yeah that's because of the

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.070 
very brighter yeah that's because of the
final<00:06:12.360> gather<00:06:14.150> so<00:06:15.150> I'm<00:06:15.240> going<00:06:15.419> to<00:06:15.510> cancel<00:06:15.750> this

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
final gather so I'm going to cancel this

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.760 
final gather so I'm going to cancel this
and<00:06:16.370> what<00:06:17.370> I'm<00:06:17.460> going<00:06:17.610> to<00:06:17.700> do<00:06:17.820> is<00:06:18.350> go<00:06:19.350> to<00:06:19.380> the

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
and what I'm going to do is go to the

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.230 
and what I'm going to do is go to the
exposure<00:06:20.370> control<00:06:20.580> again<00:06:21.090> and<00:06:22.910> oops<00:06:23.910> there

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
exposure control again and oops there

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.490 
exposure control again and oops there
and<00:06:24.450> increase<00:06:25.320> the

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.740 

expose<00:06:30.400> your<00:06:30.550> value<00:06:30.910> to<00:06:30.940> eight<00:06:32.310> and<00:06:33.750> render

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
expose your value to eight and render

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:40.910 
expose your value to eight and render
again<00:06:38.910> that's<00:06:39.910> looking<00:06:40.210> good

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
again that's looking good

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.130 
again that's looking good
another<00:06:41.920> thing<00:06:42.250> that<00:06:42.460> would<00:06:42.760> make<00:06:43.060> it<00:06:43.690> look<00:06:44.050> a

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
another thing that would make it look a

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.060 
another thing that would make it look a
little<00:06:44.290> bit<00:06:44.500> better<00:06:45.190> a<00:06:45.520> would<00:06:46.330> be<00:06:46.360> a<00:06:47.070> ambient

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
little bit better a would be a ambient

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.030 
little bit better a would be a ambient
occlusion<00:06:48.900> which<00:06:49.900> I<00:06:50.110> also<00:06:50.290> think<00:06:50.710> deserve

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
occlusion which I also think deserve

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.550 
occlusion which I also think deserve
deserves<00:06:51.790> a<00:06:51.970> whole<00:06:52.180> tutorial<00:06:52.420> just<00:06:52.930> for<00:06:53.380> it

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
deserves a whole tutorial just for it

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.140 
deserves a whole tutorial just for it
because<00:06:54.070> it<00:06:54.220> it's<00:06:54.970> not<00:06:55.150> that<00:06:55.420> is<00:06:55.660> complex<00:06:56.260> but

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150 
because it it's not that is complex but

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.630 
because it it's not that is complex but
the<00:06:58.150> concept<00:06:58.990> is<00:06:59.200> a<00:06:59.290> little<00:06:59.590> bit<00:06:59.680> hard<00:06:59.920> harder

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:00.640 
the concept is a little bit hard harder

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.350 
the concept is a little bit hard harder
to<00:07:01.050> understand<00:07:02.050> so<00:07:02.400> I'm<00:07:03.400> not<00:07:03.640> going<00:07:03.970> into<00:07:04.210> it

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
to understand so I'm not going into it

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.900 
to understand so I'm not going into it
right<00:07:04.660> now<00:07:07.530> okay<00:07:08.530> I'm<00:07:08.650> going<00:07:08.800> to<00:07:08.860> stop<00:07:09.220> and<00:07:09.670> I'm

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:09.910 
right now okay I'm going to stop and I'm

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.720 
right now okay I'm going to stop and I'm
going<00:07:10.240> to<00:07:10.720> come<00:07:10.870> back<00:07:10.900> and<00:07:11.440> it<00:07:11.590> finishes<00:07:12.520> to

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:12.730 
going to come back and it finishes to

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:18.360 
going to come back and it finishes to
render<00:07:13.920> so<00:07:14.920> the<00:07:15.640> render<00:07:15.910> finishes<00:07:16.510> I'm<00:07:17.370> pretty

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.370 
render so the render finishes I'm pretty

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.690 
render so the render finishes I'm pretty
happy<00:07:18.640> with<00:07:18.820> the<00:07:18.970> result<00:07:19.330> I<00:07:20.250> guess<00:07:21.250> that's<00:07:21.490> it

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:21.700 
happy with the result I guess that's it

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.060 
happy with the result I guess that's it
