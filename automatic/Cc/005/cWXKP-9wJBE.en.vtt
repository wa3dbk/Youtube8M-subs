for<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:00.750> episode<00:00:01.230> I'm<00:00:01.380> going<00:00:01.530> to<00:00:01.589> step<00:00:01.800> back

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
for this episode I'm going to step back

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.619 
for this episode I'm going to step back
a<00:00:02.070> little<00:00:02.250> and<00:00:02.669> make<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:02.909> video<00:00:03.120> that<00:00:03.300> really

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
a little and make a video that really

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:04.910 
a little and make a video that really
honestly<00:00:04.080> probably<00:00:04.440> should<00:00:04.589> have<00:00:04.620> been<00:00:04.770> my

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
honestly probably should have been my

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.950 
honestly probably should have been my
first<00:00:04.950> video<00:00:05.580> this<00:00:06.180> is<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.359> topic<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:06.779> I<00:00:06.899> think

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
first video this is a topic that I think

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.080 
first video this is a topic that I think
all<00:00:07.290> DJs<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:07.859> anybody<00:00:08.309> who's<00:00:08.490> involved<00:00:08.790> with

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
all DJs and anybody who's involved with

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.820 
all DJs and anybody who's involved with
sound<00:00:09.300> equipment<00:00:09.780> or<00:00:09.870> production<00:00:10.230> needs<00:00:10.620> to

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
sound equipment or production needs to

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.129 
sound equipment or production needs to
know<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.000> how<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.179> properly<00:00:12.540> set

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
know and this is how to properly set

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.839 
know and this is how to properly set
your<00:00:13.349> input<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.889> output<00:00:14.190> levels<00:00:14.610> on<00:00:14.790> your

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
your input and output levels on your

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.359 
your input and output levels on your
mixer<00:00:15.710> the<00:00:16.710> first<00:00:16.920> thing<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.190> need<00:00:17.310> to

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
mixer the first thing you need to

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.420 
mixer the first thing you need to
understand<00:00:17.970> about<00:00:18.210> DJ<00:00:18.720> equipment<00:00:18.930> and

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
understand about DJ equipment and

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.710 
understand about DJ equipment and
amplification<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.699> signal<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.480> chain

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
amplification of the signal in the chain

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.320 
amplification of the signal in the chain
is<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:23.070> need<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.340> have<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> line<00:00:24.090> level

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
is that you need to have a line level

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.470 
is that you need to have a line level
source<00:00:25.010> to<00:00:26.010> go<00:00:26.160> into<00:00:26.519> your<00:00:26.640> mixer<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.269> we

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
source to go into your mixer so that we

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.240 
source to go into your mixer so that we
can<00:00:27.720> trim<00:00:28.349> out<00:00:28.500> everything<00:00:28.949> appropriately

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
can trim out everything appropriately

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.669 
can trim out everything appropriately
and<00:00:29.730> trimming<00:00:30.210> just<00:00:30.420> means<00:00:30.660> adjusting<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
and trimming just means adjusting the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.380 
and trimming just means adjusting the
input<00:00:32.099> levels<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.669> everything<00:00:33.180> matches

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
input levels so that everything matches

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.080 
input levels so that everything matches
across<00:00:34.020> every<00:00:34.649> source<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.370> you're<00:00:35.520> using<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
across every source that you're using a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.470 
across every source that you're using a
source<00:00:36.630> could<00:00:36.780> be<00:00:36.840> anything<00:00:37.079> from<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.800> C<00:00:38.340> DJ<00:00:38.760> to

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
source could be anything from a C DJ to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.900 
source could be anything from a C DJ to
even<00:00:40.170> an<00:00:40.440> internal<00:00:41.129> noise<00:00:41.340> generator<00:00:41.760> like

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
even an internal noise generator like

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.600 
even an internal noise generator like
the<00:00:42.120> 900<00:00:42.690> has<00:00:42.870> or<00:00:43.200> something<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.340> an<00:00:44.489> eye

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the 900 has or something that an eye

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.279 
the 900 has or something that an eye
like<00:00:44.850> an<00:00:44.969> iPod<00:00:45.300> that's<00:00:45.570> plugged<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.960> anything

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
like an iPod that's plugged in anything

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.049 
like an iPod that's plugged in anything
that<00:00:46.469> goes<00:00:46.829> into<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.280> mixer<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.820> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
that goes into the mixer that is a

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.180 
that goes into the mixer that is a
source<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:49.260> need<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.469> make<00:00:49.649> sure<00:00:49.680> all<00:00:50.039> of

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
source and we need to make sure all of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.860 
source and we need to make sure all of
those<00:00:50.309> sources<00:00:50.610> are<00:00:50.850> at<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> same<00:00:51.329> level<00:00:51.390> so

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
those sources are at the same level so

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.779 
those sources are at the same level so
that<00:00:51.899> we're<00:00:52.140> mixing<00:00:52.469> everything<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.670> can

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
that we're mixing everything we can

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.439 
that we're mixing everything we can
accurately<00:00:54.059> create<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:55.079> good<00:00:55.379> sounding<00:00:55.739> mix<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
accurately create a good sounding mix a

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.819 
accurately create a good sounding mix a
problem<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.570> see<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.930> lot<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.170> DJ's<00:00:58.440> both

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
problem I see with a lot of DJ's both

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.529 
problem I see with a lot of DJ's both
live<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.399> YouTube<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.120> you'll<00:01:00.239> see

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
live and on YouTube is that you'll see

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.990 
live and on YouTube is that you'll see
their<00:01:01.289> mixer<00:01:01.770> all<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> way<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.430> into<00:01:02.670> this

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
their mixer all the way up into this

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.840 
their mixer all the way up into this
this<00:01:03.629> orange<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.290> red<00:01:04.680> section<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> mixer

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
this orange and red section on the mixer

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.730 
this orange and red section on the mixer
for<00:01:06.119> example<00:01:06.510> I've<00:01:06.630> loaded<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.990> track<00:01:07.290> into<00:01:07.590> my

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
for example I've loaded a track into my

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.740 
for example I've loaded a track into my
deck<00:01:08.040> over<00:01:08.340> here<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.790> I'm<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> show<00:01:09.720> you

what<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> lot<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.619> DJ's<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.520> I'll

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
what I see a lot of DJ's do and I'll

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.219 
what I see a lot of DJ's do and I'll
tell<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> why<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.510> wrong<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.140> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
tell you why this is wrong in just a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.810 
tell you why this is wrong in just a
second<00:01:18.590> they're<00:01:19.590> all<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.040> way<00:01:20.070> clipping<00:01:20.610> on

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
second they're all the way clipping on

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.999 
second they're all the way clipping on
their<00:01:21.030> peak<00:01:21.330> lights<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.320> mixer<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.860> even

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
their peak lights on the mixer and even

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.800 
their peak lights on the mixer and even
if<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.189> turn<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.520> down<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> little<00:01:24.000> bit<00:01:24.210> if

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
if they turn this down a little bit if

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.120 
if they turn this down a little bit if
they're<00:01:25.020> okay<00:01:25.320> over<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.740> they're<00:01:25.920> still

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
they're okay over here they're still

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.730 
they're okay over here they're still
clipping<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.670> their<00:01:26.850> Channel

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.980 

so<00:01:34.740> now<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> tell<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.400> why<00:01:35.580> that's<00:01:35.760> bad<00:01:35.990> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
so now to tell you why that's bad you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.160 
so now to tell you why that's bad you
need<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.230> understand<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.800> amplification<00:01:38.250> is

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
need to understand that amplification is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.100 
need to understand that amplification is
is<00:01:40.190> degrading<00:01:41.190> to<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.730> signal<00:01:42.090> anytime<00:01:42.960> you

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
is degrading to the signal anytime you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.680 
is degrading to the signal anytime you
amplify<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.680> signal<00:01:44.100> you're<00:01:45.090> losing<00:01:45.480> a<00:01:45.540> little

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
amplify a signal you're losing a little

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.630 
amplify a signal you're losing a little
bit<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.960> quality<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.070> want<00:01:47.370> to<00:01:47.460> always

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
bit of quality so you want to always

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.490 
bit of quality so you want to always
make<00:01:48.030> sure<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.660> are<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> negative

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
make sure that you are in the negative

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.650 
make sure that you are in the negative
section<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.250> your<00:01:50.460> DB<00:01:50.850> meters<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.480> the

section of your DB meters and the
negative<00:01:52.080> section<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:54.470> anywhere<00:01:55.470> that's<00:01:55.650> at

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
negative section is anywhere that's at

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.200 
negative section is anywhere that's at
zero<00:01:56.250> or<00:01:56.340> below<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.410> can<00:01:58.470> see<00:01:58.800> I<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.970> tune

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
zero or below so you can see I can tune

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.820 
zero or below so you can see I can tune
this<00:02:00.420> track<00:02:01.460> using<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.550> trim<00:02:02.820> pot<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:04.710> that

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
this track using the trim pot so that

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.499 
this track using the trim pot so that
it's<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.190> hovering<00:02:05.310> right<00:02:05.640> around<00:02:05.820> zero<00:02:06.030> and

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
it's just hovering right around zero and

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.449 
it's just hovering right around zero and
that'll<00:02:06.960> give<00:02:07.259> us<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.470> best<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.310> best

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
that'll give us the best the best

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.420 
that'll give us the best the best
quality<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.149> sound<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.600> we<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.869> get<00:02:10.430> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
quality of sound that we can get the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.280 
quality of sound that we can get the
same<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.760> true<00:02:11.880> with<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.120> master<00:02:12.600> so<00:02:13.080> once

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
same is true with the master so once

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.290 
same is true with the master so once
you've<00:02:13.440> trimmed<00:02:13.800> all<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.310> your<00:02:14.430> inputs<00:02:14.910> you

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
you've trimmed all of your inputs you

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.060 
you've trimmed all of your inputs you
can<00:02:15.450> go<00:02:15.570> ahead<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.870> adjust<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.410> master<00:02:16.890> so

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
can go ahead and adjust the master so

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.760 
can go ahead and adjust the master so
that<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:17.459> at<00:02:17.610> zero<00:02:17.880> as<00:02:18.000> well<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:19.590> will

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
that it's at zero as well and this will

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.990 
that it's at zero as well and this will
make<00:02:19.860> sure<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.070> your<00:02:20.280> track<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:20.580> loud<00:02:20.970> enough

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
make sure that your track is loud enough

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.090 
make sure that your track is loud enough
to<00:02:21.330> be<00:02:21.360> heard<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.840> your<00:02:22.050> mixes<00:02:22.590> sound

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
to be heard but that your mixes sound

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.140 
to be heard but that your mixes sound
really<00:02:23.459> coherent<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:26.160> as<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.550> can<00:02:26.670> see<00:02:26.730> it's

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
really coherent so as you can see it's

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.610 
really coherent so as you can see it's
not<00:02:27.300> always<00:02:27.480> true<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.170> want<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.440> have

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
not always true that you want to have

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.160 
not always true that you want to have
your<00:02:29.010> inputs<00:02:29.790> all<00:02:30.030> at<00:02:30.209> 12<00:02:30.480> o'clock<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:30.840> your

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
your inputs all at 12 o'clock and your

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.050 
your inputs all at 12 o'clock and your
master<00:02:31.560> at<00:02:31.650> 12<00:02:31.890> o'clock<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.370> consider<00:02:32.850> that

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
master at 12 o'clock and consider that

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.090 
master at 12 o'clock and consider that
good<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.450> go<00:02:33.600> as<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:34.290> see<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:34.890> at

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
good to go as you can see I have it at

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.100 
good to go as you can see I have it at
12<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.640> these<00:02:35.850> pioneers<00:02:36.270> see<00:02:36.390> DJ's<00:02:36.690> happen<00:02:37.050> to

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
12 and these pioneers see DJ's happen to

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.170 
12 and these pioneers see DJ's happen to
have<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> really<00:02:37.590> loud<00:02:37.769> output<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:38.970> means

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
have a really loud output so that means

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.580 
have a really loud output so that means
that<00:02:39.300> I'm<00:02:39.420> already<00:02:39.720> clipping<00:02:40.200> before<00:02:40.500> I've

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
that I'm already clipping before I've

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.150 
that I'm already clipping before I've
even<00:02:40.739> gotten<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.280> master<00:02:41.670> output<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.890> trim

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
even gotten to the master output to trim

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.530 
even gotten to the master output to trim
out<00:02:44.280> your<00:02:44.459> sources<00:02:44.880> properly<00:02:45.330> though<00:02:45.480> you

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
out your sources properly though you

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.940 
out your sources properly though you
need<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.780> make<00:02:46.050> sure<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.590> are<00:02:46.680> at<00:02:46.800> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
need to make sure that you are at the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.880 
need to make sure that you are at the
loudest<00:02:47.459> part<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.209> track<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:49.080> for<00:02:49.440> example

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
loudest part in the track so for example

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.530 
loudest part in the track so for example
that<00:02:50.010> intro<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.549> just<00:02:50.880> played<00:02:51.120> was<00:02:51.360> not

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
that intro that I just played was not

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.880 
that intro that I just played was not
actually<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.930> loudest<00:02:52.350> part<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.680> track

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
actually the loudest part in the track

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.789 
actually the loudest part in the track
so<00:02:53.070> if<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.310> skip<00:02:53.670> over<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.019> loudest<00:02:55.380> part<00:02:55.590> it

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
so if I skip over to the loudest part it

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.949 
so if I skip over to the loudest part it
actually<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.820> starting<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.299> clip<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.570> little

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
actually is starting to clip a little

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.509 
actually is starting to clip a little
bit<00:02:58.110> more<00:02:58.320> not<00:02:58.590> clip<00:02:58.860> excuse<00:02:59.190> me<00:02:59.310> it's<00:02:59.430> going

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
bit more not clip excuse me it's going

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.030 
bit more not clip excuse me it's going
to<00:02:59.610> amplify<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.269> little<00:03:00.450> bit<00:03:00.630> more<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.590> what

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
to amplify it a little bit more so what

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.039 
to amplify it a little bit more so what
I<00:03:02.070> need<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.400> do<00:03:02.580> for<00:03:03.060> every<00:03:03.330> track<00:03:03.600> before<00:03:03.840> I

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
I need to do for every track before I

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.620 
I need to do for every track before I
play<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.620> go<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.370> here<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:06.000> adjust<00:03:06.120> each

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
play it I go in here and I adjust each

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.810 
play it I go in here and I adjust each
one<00:03:07.019> so<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:07.860> it's<00:03:07.980> just<00:03:08.130> barely<00:03:08.370> hovering

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
one so that it's just barely hovering

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.690 
one so that it's just barely hovering
around<00:03:08.940> zero<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.739> that<00:03:10.739> way<00:03:10.980> I'll<00:03:11.250> make<00:03:11.280> sure

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
around zero and that way I'll make sure

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.130 
around zero and that way I'll make sure
that<00:03:11.880> every<00:03:12.239> single<00:03:12.420> one<00:03:12.600> of<00:03:12.690> my<00:03:12.780> tracks

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
that every single one of my tracks

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.289 
that every single one of my tracks
before<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.590> mix<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.070> into<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.310> mix<00:03:14.610> is<00:03:14.820> going<00:03:15.180> to

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
before I mix it into the mix is going to

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.019 
before I mix it into the mix is going to
be<00:03:15.360> at<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.540> right<00:03:15.660> level
