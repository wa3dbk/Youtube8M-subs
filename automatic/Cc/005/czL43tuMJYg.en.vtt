00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
for the Xbox 360 and I consider this one

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.109 
for the Xbox 360 and I consider this one
of<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.320> worst<00:00:22.800> first-person<00:00:23.640> shooters<00:00:23.910> for

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the Xbox that I've played it might be

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.269 
the Xbox that I've played it might be
the<00:00:26.369> worst<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.359> Xbox<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.279> know

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
the worst one for the Xbox I know

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.859 
the worst one for the Xbox I know
there's<00:00:29.519> some<00:00:29.730> really<00:00:30.269> bad<00:00:30.420> ones<00:00:30.449> for<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
there's some really bad ones for the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.440 
there's some really bad ones for the
consoles<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.250> Xbox<00:00:32.579> 360<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.120> think<00:00:33.329> is

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
consoles but for the Xbox 360 I think is

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.850 
consoles but for the Xbox 360 I think is
actually<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> worst<00:00:34.790> and<00:00:36.230> you<00:00:37.230> see<00:00:37.440> this

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
actually is the worst and you see this

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.240 
actually is the worst and you see this
game<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.280> really<00:00:38.820> annoying<00:00:39.059> because<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.379> when

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
game is really annoying because as when

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.760 
game is really annoying because as when
you're<00:00:41.399> sniping<00:00:42.079> well<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.230> any<00:00:43.379> weapon

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
you're sniping well with any weapon

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.770 
you're sniping well with any weapon
after<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.219> shoot<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.180> click<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
after you shoot you have to click the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.319 
after you shoot you have to click the
trigger<00:00:46.079> button<00:00:47.010> again<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.520> actually<00:00:47.850> reload

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
trigger button again to actually reload

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.900 
trigger button again to actually reload
so<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.230> see<00:00:49.410> me<00:00:49.559> shoot<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
so you see me shoot and then I have to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.540 
so you see me shoot and then I have to
reload<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:51.960> again<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.770> game<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.100> called<00:00:53.309> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550

around I think whole duty to a came
around<00:00:58.440> around<00:00:59.180> and<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.570> based<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.960> the

around around and it's based on the
Civil<00:01:01.469> War<00:01:01.520> it's<00:01:02.520> probably<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.940> only<00:01:03.090> real

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
like all they have it and there to give

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.280 
like all they have it and there to give

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
you some history and facts but that's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.940 
you some history and facts but that's
basically<00:02:16.500> how<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.840> this<00:02:18.840> game<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.319> not<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
basically how it is this game is not the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.770 
basically how it is this game is not the
worst<00:02:20.340> FPS<00:02:20.850> ever<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.390> it's<00:02:22.640> some<00:02:23.640> eye<00:02:24.060> since

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
worst FPS ever but it's some eye since

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.360 
worst FPS ever but it's some eye since
this<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.110> basically<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:26.010> compare<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
this is basically you can compare the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.820 
this is basically you can compare the
coley-cole<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.450> duty<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.560> can't<00:02:28.769> even

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
coley-cole of duty to that I can't even

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.560 
coley-cole of duty to that I can't even
talk<00:02:29.010> right<00:02:29.070> now<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.180> compare<00:02:30.480> this

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
talk right now but you can compare this

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.170 
talk right now but you can compare this
to<00:02:30.750> call<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.050> duty<00:02:31.290> -<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:32.190> much<00:02:32.820> worse<00:02:33.120> than

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
to call of duty - it's much worse than

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.060 
to call of duty - it's much worse than
cold<00:02:33.750> duty<00:02:34.080> -<00:02:34.230> considering<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.860> as<00:02:34.950> no

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
cold duty - considering it as no

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.370 
cold duty - considering it as no
multiplayer<00:02:35.610> but<00:02:36.569> considering<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.170> game

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
actually playing on normal which is not

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.310 
actually playing on normal which is not
the<00:03:22.079> easiest<00:03:22.320> difficulty<00:03:24.049> then<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.079> should<00:03:25.290> be

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
the easiest difficulty then I should be

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
the easiest difficulty then I should be
beating<00:03:25.620> on<00:03:25.680> my<00:03:25.829> teammate<00:03:26.250> on<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.910> wide<00:03:28.340> but

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
beating on my teammate on the wide but

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.390 
beating on my teammate on the wide but
since<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.940> Welo<00:03:30.239> time<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:30.780> long<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.769> you

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
since the Welo time is so long and you

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.220 
since the Welo time is so long and you
don't<00:03:32.519> die<00:03:32.790> in<00:03:32.820> one<00:03:33.120> bullet<00:03:33.359> you<00:03:33.930> can<00:03:34.109> do

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
don't die in one bullet you can do

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.110 
don't die in one bullet you can do
basically<00:03:34.560> just<00:03:34.769> run<00:03:35.100> in<00:03:35.250> there<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.760> then

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
basically just run in there and then

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.970 
basically just run in there and then
just<00:03:36.150> completely<00:03:36.780> destroy<00:03:37.370> with<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.459> sword

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.289 
then I just run in with the sword and
it's<00:03:55.079> pretty<00:03:55.260> funny<00:03:55.500> because<00:03:55.680> look<00:03:56.040> at<00:03:56.100> that

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.400 
it's pretty funny because look at that
it's<00:03:57.299> better<00:03:57.510> than<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.810> gun<00:03:57.959> in<00:03:58.079> this<00:03:58.170> game

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
it's better than the gun in this game

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
like they were trying to make it

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.030 
like they were trying to make it
realistic<00:04:08.629> but<00:04:09.230> look<00:04:09.379> at<00:04:09.470> this<00:04:09.590> it's<00:04:09.860> far

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
realistic but look at this it's far

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.790 
realistic but look at this it's far
right<00:04:10.220> here<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.959> realistic<00:04:12.410> part<00:04:12.560> did<00:04:12.709> not

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800
