00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 and 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.970
 very good all kids welcome in 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.010
 a new video demo of minecraft can 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.590
 have a mode that is a pass and 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.360
 appeared super super super hard and that of 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.029
 made in new just been and now 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.529
 for only for version 1.7 point 2 and 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.000
 that a way that the truth that never 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.770
 I hoped that to leave like us 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.050
 from up here it's not at all but 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.939
 if I do likewise start in other 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.040
 rare things weird things like that banking 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.510
 It is rounded once rounded 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.160
 rounded or not is rounded 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.290
 but if there is not made of cubes but 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.979
 that has esplanades that we can climb and 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.199
 go down the stage with more that more more 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.760
 credible let's say less than cubes and I 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.470
 it seemed super curious is not a way that 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.390
 go to use well in plan to play 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.350
 every day not like that but it's a way 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.180
 which I think is very cool for 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.830
 to experiment with mixtures in another way is not going 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.989
 to say look, I want to do less 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.369
 in a few games to minecraft but with 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.110
 this put to see it in another way and 

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:02.809
 the truth is that it is very, very, very, very 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.129
 cool if you remember I took a video of 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.590
 a game that was called seven days to 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.970
 the air and if you look at the graphics 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.829
 they are very similar because it will be sold 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.610
 the same works for squares and blocks 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.170
 what 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.930
 what does this same effect do the 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.820
 effect of putting as vertices so that 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.110
 look like more rounded and the truth 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.610
 is that he is very cool and above all cool 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.020
 in the caves look that I took some 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.420
 torches 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.780
 to put a few things a bit has been 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.270
 gone a little but see what chulada 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.649
 the caves are super cool if 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.240
 you fix some blocks that do not change 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.020
 is worth with examples the best is do not change 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.819
 the clay is still straight 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.799
 I would change it stays the same as the clay 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.439
 colored I do not know if the others and you receive 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.420
 that for example if you break a block by 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.909
 example this one here because it fits 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.369
 according to how you break it and that is creating 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.780
 because in plan round like the rest that is 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.520
 it's not that I'm going to break a block 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.170
 go back all square you see here 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.720
 we have a small piece of land 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.369
 here we can go down again we have here 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.189
 Two caves fixed that chulada the caves 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.599
 which are a pass then for the torches 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.569
 and frei also when you put the torch 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.679
 is flattened so it does not stop so it does not 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.750
 see weird for example I think it's 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.039
 twisted you put it on and it flattens out so you do not 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.989
 the torch is made and as if floating in 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.890
 Nothing out there is super cool 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.440
 guys, it seems to me an authentic 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.360
 pass the tests in this mode because it 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.430
 see more, they do not turn out to be more 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.010
 interesting things and round and here 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.299
 it's more more grace oil hey here for 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.829
 chicha kitchen looks more caves 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.120
 up more corporation like those that 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.610
 it seems like a mountain hi sr 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.040
 lord creepers unparalleled team 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.540
 pictures guys the bugs do not change and 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.280
 good to the ways for now as you see 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.080
 is a bit deserved because all the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.420
 locks I said because there are times that 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.110
 the vertices somehow become fixed 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.150
 what chulada looks is that he is super handsome 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.620
 be the vertices and a little weird happen 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.450
 things like there are times that there 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.610
 polygons that do not let you pass and things 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.870
 well but still I seem to spend 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.209
 besides that as I say the mod is 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.890
 completely new so you have to 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.329
 give him time to improve or 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.890
 be the best modes are moix that 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.840
 they come from very very old versions 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.780
 Well, as I do not know 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.340
 I love how alive and things like that 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.879
 in minecraft from the versions of 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.360
 bones from at least 4142 and 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.090
 things like that 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.410
 that's super old and more and they've gone 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.970
 improving we are going little by little and this then 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.099
 I guess he will just have yeah yeah 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.200
 success and so on, I suppose it will improve 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.150
 to make it look better with less 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.370
 triangles so that they can pull them out 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.690
 an eye and things like that and the truth 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.430
 that now I feel like I want to try 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.260
 things with dynamites you want to see the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.330
 gaps that make dynamite are going to 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.790
 go up all the way and let's see the 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.019
 gap that would make you dynamite with this 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.430
 way to pull up to arrive already 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.470
 We're going to take a while because I'm down 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.790
 too much I think but well 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.040
 we will take too long we are already there 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.140
 let's see through a tree above you're going to 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.799
 put dynamite to me right here since it 's 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.329
 cool dude how do you see the gravel there 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.700
 everything to round and katie 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.019
 inside the water if you notice you do not know 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.329
 where endorse see anything in the water 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.920
 everything is as always and in fact the 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.450
 water went and remains is still 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.600
 flat but good let's put a 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.720
 dynamite little and see what happens not 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.040
 It 's good for me a little bit about the few today 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.819
 You already know that I love to burn 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.310
 things to see lighter 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.480
 do for a lot of christmas here 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.040
 I guess the dynamite will pass as 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.810
 another when I put it flat 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.130
 evidently 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.870
 outside 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.150
 and with a little friendship and to see that 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.210
 they passed 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.080
 to see how the scenario changes 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.760
 own 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.790
 obviously change in round plan and 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.050
 two theories as kid mola the water by 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.550
 Unfortunately it is not clear how they fall 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.920
 blocks the blocks are transformed 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.139
 directly shine like that and if it came in 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.930
 Water 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.280
 it is put back tea square but 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.409
 you are cool you are very cool yes sir 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.990
 look, actually, we're going to have some madness 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:48.229
 let's see how a cave would look 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.380
 well well majano ai ai ai ai ai to put 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:55.240
 dynamite to butt 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.240
 come dynamite butt to butt 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.460
 to see how it is is that I pass 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.870
 until its opening is perfect for 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.030
 experience new things in the middle of 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.960
 true 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.930
 look at the cave that chulada I'm going to remove 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.710
 a little bit of shine already puts at night 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.600
 because it looks better because it's 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.030
 too bright it turns us on 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.490
 little lights from time to time out there and 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.010
 see what a cool dude skis is a 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.390
 seriously, it 's a pass in fact 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.100
 here I would stick a little bit of water where 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:29.960
 I would see super cool of ojén plan of not 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.390
 lie to a moat the moon I become and 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.310
 things like that so nothing guys let's move on 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.600
 to see how this mode is installed so 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.460
 so so cool for you 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.560
 you can also experience little things with 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.290
 him and you can see with games like this one that 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.050
 milicic a native look that chulada uncle 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.930
 skis and one pass is due is all 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.970
 square so it's a hoot we go through 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.200
 here below and in fact see you 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:56.720
 connects with one of the caves by which 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:58.280
 I saw before because that other guy title 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.380
 let's go back upstairs again and 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.290
 as I say let's move on to see how it 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.730
 we are so cool torches 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.730
 45 20 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.249
 also square I do not suppose it has been 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.439
 A) Yes 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:15.119
 this will be squared yes 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.229
 effectively but not so 

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:18.299
 squares like the others nevertheless 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.619
 only a small square remains on this side but 

00:06:18.299 --> 00:06:21.729
 for this one that is put is the same and today 

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:25.080
 in day that pulo uncle 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:28.300
 and last really seems to me an invention 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.650
 fed on the curious plan that is 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.770
 not for anything else but I think super 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.300
 curious then let's see how it will be 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.919
 to extract are we guys need is 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.330
 Like all others have the fort 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.039
 sill active have installed that you already know 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.779
 that you will have the description and in this 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:42.099
 case you can only have it with the version 

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:43.689
 1.7 points 2 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.309
 you will also have the description my 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:46.930
 link to the list of mods where I found 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:48.550
 that this file from here the nokia a 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.050
 module of more passes of them these happy 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.539
 accessible world we play here for pc 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.740
 guys from traoré simple and good thing 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:54.580
 that you have to have this file that 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.990
 you can also download it 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.370
 description as I said and you have it 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.870
 to put in the folder demos as 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.490
 Always for the folder so that 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.960
 you use the windows button and shrek the 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.659
 Windows 3 button to the left of the 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.149
 keyboard / control and the windows button 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:10.559
 and you are put that percentage app data 

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:13.839
 percentage to accept point minecraft 

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:15.729
 mods and then copy and that is the file 

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:17.800
 we copy it and once you enter the 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:19.479
 minecraft because I would work I give you a 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.129
 notice if you have other modes that put 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:22.719
 blocks and things like that when generating 

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:25.120
 the rounded world is going to go wrong 

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:26.169
 because the world is designed for those 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.520
 blocks and those blocks come out 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:29.319
 completely square 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.030
 so I think it's a more convenient way 

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:33.370
 for good to experience a little in 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.259
 iii and play some game of how to 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.580
 I would see mainka if it were more rounded 

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:39.250
 because we rounded up the tone and a lot 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.720
 less and little boys you know what to 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.190
 this in the description and it's like to give it 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.710
 a lie that is more with a lot of 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:48.479
 vertices more rounded than normal and we 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.479
 we watch the next video until others
