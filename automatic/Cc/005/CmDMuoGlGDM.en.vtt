and<00:02:19.840> also<00:02:20.410> there's<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.709> taper<00:02:21.099> on<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.400> roof<00:02:21.580> so

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
and also there's a taper on the roof so

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.180 
and also there's a taper on the roof so
it's<00:02:21.910> like<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.120> pitched<00:02:22.420> roof<00:02:22.660> haha<00:02:23.190> heating

underfloor heating system rather than a

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.320 
underfloor heating system rather than a
heating<00:02:36.220> system<00:02:36.250> not<00:02:36.640> stored<00:02:36.880> on<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.150> floor

that's a working area big sink big
drainer<00:04:18.419> big<00:04:19.419> fridge<00:04:19.720> I<00:04:20.049> think<00:04:20.650> I'd<00:04:20.739> like<00:04:20.889> a

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
drainer big fridge I think I'd like a

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.790 
drainer big fridge I think I'd like a
freezer<00:04:21.699> as<00:04:22.000> well<00:04:22.210> but<00:04:22.740> everything<00:04:23.740> is

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
freezer as well but everything is

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.760 
freezer as well but everything is
possible<00:04:24.810> especially<00:04:25.810> Roger<00:04:26.229> I<00:04:26.500> know<00:04:26.590> you

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
possible especially Roger I know you

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.439 
possible especially Roger I know you
were<00:04:26.919> very<00:04:27.370> impressed<00:04:27.580> by<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.880> technical

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
were very impressed by the technical

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:29.850 
were very impressed by the technical
side<00:04:28.660> of<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:28.990> with<00:04:29.169> it<00:04:29.290> yeah<00:04:29.440> on<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.650> wheels

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
side of this with it yeah on the wheels

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.159 
side of this with it yeah on the wheels
yeah<00:04:30.250> yeah<00:04:30.639> because<00:04:31.540> i<00:04:31.690> have<00:04:31.780> had<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:31.960> double

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
yeah yeah because i have had a double

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.740 
yeah yeah because i have had a double
axle<00:04:33.419> trailer<00:04:34.419> before<00:04:35.490> which<00:04:36.630> when<00:04:37.630> you

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
axle trailer before which when you

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.990 
axle trailer before which when you
reverse<00:04:38.139> it<00:04:38.199> you<00:04:38.620> could<00:04:38.949> jack<00:04:39.250> up<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.580> one<00:04:39.729> set

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
reverse it you could jack up the one set

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.120 
reverse it you could jack up the one set
of<00:04:40.150> wheels<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:41.169> make<00:04:41.350> it<00:04:41.500> easy<00:04:41.710> for<00:04:41.949> you<00:04:42.010> to

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
of wheels to make it easy for you to

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.430 
of wheels to make it easy for you to
reverse<00:04:42.460> huh<00:04:42.729> on<00:04:43.450> this<00:04:43.690> you<00:04:43.870> don't<00:04:43.990> need<00:04:44.260> to

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
reverse huh on this you don't need to

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.240 
reverse huh on this you don't need to
because<00:04:44.620> each<00:04:45.100> axle<00:04:46.030> is<00:04:47.010> virtually<00:04:48.010> can

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
because each axle is virtually can

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.940 
because each axle is virtually can
independent<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.780> other<00:04:50.110> but<00:04:50.590> they<00:04:50.800> are

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
independent to the other but they are

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.100 
independent to the other but they are
all<00:04:51.220> both<00:04:51.639> connected<00:04:52.210> so<00:04:52.419> as<00:04:52.450> if<00:04:52.840> you<00:04:52.960> were<00:04:53.050> to

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
all both connected so as if you were to

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.400 
all both connected so as if you were to
bump<00:04:53.440> it<00:04:53.740> roids<00:04:54.729> up<00:04:54.940> over<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:55.389> you<00:04:56.080> know<00:04:56.229> and

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
bump it roids up over it you know and

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.440 
bump it roids up over it you know and
transfers<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.460> weight<00:04:57.490> to<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.880> other<00:04:58.000> actual

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
transfers the weight to the other actual

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.900 
transfers the weight to the other actual
it's<00:04:58.750> very<00:04:58.870> good<00:04:59.020> so<00:04:59.650> yeah<00:04:59.919> technology<00:05:00.760> for

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
it's very good so yeah technology for

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.430 
it's very good so yeah technology for
removing<00:05:01.360> our<00:05:01.510> missile<00:05:01.810> yeah<00:05:01.900> yeah<00:05:02.139> it<00:05:02.289> is

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
removing our missile yeah yeah it is

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.760 
removing our missile yeah yeah it is
yeah<00:05:02.800> it's<00:05:03.760> never<00:05:03.970> been<00:05:04.120> easier<00:05:04.660> or<00:05:04.810> safer<00:05:05.260> to

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
yeah it's never been easier or safer to

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.100 
yeah it's never been easier or safer to
tell<00:05:05.950> a<00:05:05.979> car<00:05:06.190> along<00:05:06.510> because<00:05:07.510> you<00:05:07.660> got<00:05:07.810> sold<00:05:08.020> it

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
tell a car along because you got sold it

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.110 
tell a car along because you got sold it
always<00:05:08.350> wonderful<00:05:09.039> sell<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.520> late<00:05:09.699> yeah<00:05:10.060> as

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
always wonderful sell it late yeah as

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.850 
always wonderful sell it late yeah as
long<00:05:10.330> as<00:05:10.449> you<00:05:10.570> follow<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:10.930> rules<00:05:11.169> and<00:05:11.470> yeah

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
long as you follow the rules and yeah

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.900 
long as you follow the rules and yeah
you<00:05:11.919> don't<00:05:12.130> overload<00:05:13.120> and<00:05:13.950> you<00:05:14.950> know<00:05:15.070> speed

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
you don't overload and you know speed

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.969 
you don't overload and you know speed
and<00:05:16.270> things<00:05:16.510> like<00:05:16.690> that<00:05:16.750> yes<00:05:17.260> I<00:05:17.500> think<00:05:17.860> it's

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
and things like that yes I think it's

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.159 
and things like that yes I think it's
quite<00:05:18.100> safe<00:05:18.400> and<00:05:18.970> the<00:05:19.510> reaction<00:05:19.690> has<00:05:19.900> been

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
quite safe and the reaction has been

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.260 
quite safe and the reaction has been
very<00:05:20.530> positive<00:05:20.620> what<00:05:21.160> what<00:05:21.550> about<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:21.820> price

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
very positive what what about the price

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.969 
very positive what what about the price
of<00:05:22.450> this<00:05:22.510> maybe<00:05:22.780> we're<00:05:22.870> talking<00:05:23.169> 40,000

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
of this maybe we're talking 40,000

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.310 
of this maybe we're talking 40,000
pounds<00:05:24.340> for<00:05:24.520> a<00:05:25.030> caravan<00:05:25.419> that<00:05:25.510> is<00:05:25.720> towards<00:05:26.260> the

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
pounds for a caravan that is towards the

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.710 
pounds for a caravan that is towards the
top<00:05:26.500> end<00:05:26.680> of<00:05:26.919> of<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.789> the<00:05:27.820> caravanning<00:05:28.479> range

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
top end of of the the caravanning range

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.210 
top end of of the the caravanning range
is<00:05:28.930> that<00:05:29.080> I<00:05:29.110> think<00:05:29.349> of<00:05:29.530> that<00:05:29.650> man<00:05:29.860> for<00:05:30.070> that<00:05:30.160> I

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
is that I think of that man for that I

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.219 
is that I think of that man for that I
mean<00:05:30.760> he's<00:05:30.940> got<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.120> good<00:05:31.330> chunk<00:05:31.539> out<00:05:31.780> of<00:05:31.810> it<00:05:32.020> now

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
mean he's got a good chunk out of it now

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.710 
mean he's got a good chunk out of it now
