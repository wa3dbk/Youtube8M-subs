00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
think it was you know what I probably

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.249 
think it was you know what I probably
all<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.220> above<00:01:53.490> uh<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.509> do<00:01:54.600> think<00:01:54.990> that

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
all the above uh but I do think that

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.319 
all the above uh but I do think that
when<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.189> look<00:01:56.399> at<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.610> collection<00:01:57.180> of

are working on some of these things
together<00:03:51.570> it's<00:03:51.900> appalling<00:03:52.140> what<00:03:52.890> we<00:03:52.980> see<00:03:53.130> go

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
on and we don't here's the problem with

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.890 
on and we don't here's the problem with
this<00:03:55.260> this<00:03:56.250> leads<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.760> greater<00:03:57.240> things<00:03:57.360> down

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
this this leads to greater things down

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.720

the<00:03:58.200> road<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.770> I<00:03:58.920> think<00:03:59.160> we<00:03:59.280> look<00:03:59.430> at<00:03:59.580> this

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
the road and I think we look at this

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.120 
the road and I think we look at this
this<00:03:59.850> is<00:03:59.910> just<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.480> tip<00:04:00.690> of<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.870> iceberg

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130
