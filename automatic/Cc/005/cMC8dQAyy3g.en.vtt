00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
I guess he won't consider this accessory

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.670 
I guess he won't consider this accessory
but<00:03:07.739> it's<00:03:08.250> got<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.430> removable<00:03:09.030> codpiece<00:03:09.690> I

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.650 
but it's got a removable codpiece I
don't<00:03:11.459> know<00:03:11.519> why<00:03:11.639> the<00:03:11.700> decide<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.299> do<00:03:12.450> that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
don't know why the decide to do that

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.319 
don't know why the decide to do that
it's<00:03:13.139> kind<00:03:13.739> of<00:03:13.829> looks<00:03:13.980> retarded<00:03:14.160> because<00:03:14.459> when

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
it's kind of looks retarded because when

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.809 
it's kind of looks retarded because when
you<00:03:15.389> put<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.630> on<00:03:15.780> there<00:03:16.370> tends<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.519> like<00:03:17.609> be

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
you put it on there tends to like be

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.340 
you put it on there tends to like be
really<00:03:18.150> loose<00:03:18.389> as<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.720> can<00:03:18.840> see<00:03:18.989> here<00:03:19.139> just

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
really loose as you can see here just

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.410 
really loose as you can see here just
moves<00:03:19.620> around<00:03:19.920> really<00:03:20.340> easily<00:03:20.639> I<00:03:20.880> don't<00:03:21.359> like

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
moves around really easily I don't like

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.150 
moves around really easily I don't like
that<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.959> don't<00:03:22.200> know<00:03:22.290> why<00:03:22.380> they<00:03:22.560> decide<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:22.950> do

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
that I don't know why they decide to do

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.430 
that I don't know why they decide to do
that<00:03:23.340> but<00:03:23.549> who<00:03:23.940> cares<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.420> know<00:03:24.450> that

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
that but who cares you know that

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.470 
that but who cares you know that
probably<00:03:26.100> they<00:03:26.670> probably<00:03:26.910> did<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.239> so<00:03:27.389> you

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
probably they probably did that so you

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.629 
probably they probably did that so you
can<00:03:27.569> make<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.160> articulation<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.310> figure

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
can make the articulation of the figure

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.960 
can make the articulation of the figure
move<00:03:29.850> better<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.780> probably<00:03:31.109> preferred<00:03:31.530> that

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
move better so I probably preferred that

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.059 
move better so I probably preferred that
so<00:03:32.970> detailed<00:03:33.690> wise<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:34.380> can<00:03:34.410> see<00:03:34.680> they<00:03:34.889> did<00:03:35.040> a

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
so this is a really nice figure if you

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.800 
so this is a really nice figure if you
do<00:04:05.680> see<00:04:05.920> one<00:04:06.069> pick<00:04:06.250> them<00:04:06.370> up<00:04:06.489> I'll<00:04:07.420> give<00:04:07.599> him<00:04:07.780> a

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
do see one pick them up I'll give him a

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.720 
do see one pick them up I'll give him a
five<00:04:08.019> out<00:04:08.200> of<00:04:08.230> five<00:04:08.349> but<00:04:09.069> there<00:04:09.189> is<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.340> little

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
five out of five but there is a little

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.429 
five out of five but there is a little
problem<00:04:10.090> with<00:04:10.120> him<00:04:10.329> is<00:04:10.510> that<00:04:10.659> he<00:04:10.900> tends<00:04:11.319> to

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
problem with him is that he tends to

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.670 
problem with him is that he tends to
fall<00:04:11.709> over<00:04:11.739> real<00:04:12.189> easy<00:04:12.489> as<00:04:12.579> you<00:04:12.730> can<00:04:12.849> see<00:04:13.060> here

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
fall over real easy as you can see here

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.050 
fall over real easy as you can see here
I'm<00:04:14.680> not<00:04:14.859> sure<00:04:14.920> why<00:04:15.280> I<00:04:15.310> think<00:04:15.790> that's<00:04:15.939> just

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
I'm not sure why I think that's just

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.729 
I'm not sure why I think that's just
because<00:04:16.239> of<00:04:16.419> his<00:04:16.539> ankle<00:04:16.870> articulation<00:04:17.019> but

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
because of his ankle articulation but

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.319 
because of his ankle articulation but
you<00:04:18.310> can<00:04:18.459> give<00:04:18.609> them<00:04:18.669> to<00:04:18.729> stand<00:04:18.940> up<00:04:19.150> in<00:04:19.239> a

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
you can give them to stand up in a

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.870 
you can give them to stand up in a
pretty<00:04:19.509> decent<00:04:19.959> pose<00:04:20.139> but<00:04:21.039> pretty<00:04:21.639> cool

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
pretty decent pose but pretty cool

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.450 
pretty decent pose but pretty cool
figure<00:04:22.500> really<00:04:23.500> worth<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:23.830> so<00:04:24.009> if<00:04:24.099> you<00:04:24.160> do<00:04:24.280> see

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
figure really worth it so if you do see

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.580 
figure really worth it so if you do see
one<00:04:24.639> pick<00:04:24.849> it<00:04:24.970> up<00:04:25.090> so<00:04:25.780> that's<00:04:26.199> pretty<00:04:26.410> much<00:04:26.470> it

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
one pick it up so that's pretty much it

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:34.390 
one pick it up so that's pretty much it
in<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:28.030> next

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.460
