00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.510 
little tunnel thing which is what I'm
going<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.390> really<00:01:57.659> quickly

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
going to do really quickly

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.730 
going to do really quickly
that's<00:01:59.520> over<00:01:59.670> time<00:02:00.110> okay<00:02:01.110> I've<00:02:01.320> done<00:02:01.439> timp

until<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.610> get<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.820> right<00:02:05.939> honestly<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:07.079> put<00:02:07.259> a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
until I get it right honestly you put a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:15.550 
until I get it right honestly you put a
piston<00:02:08.629> let's<00:02:09.629> see<00:02:09.720> piston<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:12.060> reduce

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.030 

this<00:02:16.560> will<00:02:16.680> work

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
this will work

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.589 
this will work
hey<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.400> put<00:02:17.519> a<00:02:17.579> piston<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.480> then<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.379> put<00:02:19.590> a

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
hey you put a piston and then you put a

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.789 
hey you put a piston and then you put a
block<00:02:21.599> in<00:02:21.780> front<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:22.079> it<00:02:22.170> make<00:02:22.319> sure<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.769> don't

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
block in front of it make sure you don't

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.619 
block in front of it make sure you don't
use<00:02:23.129> obsidian<00:02:23.640> or<00:02:23.730> anything<00:02:23.909> heavy<00:02:24.269> because

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
use obsidian or anything heavy because

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.030 
use obsidian or anything heavy because
it<00:02:24.719> won't<00:02:24.870> push<00:02:25.049> you<00:02:25.079> can<00:02:25.319> just<00:02:25.469> use<00:02:25.799> a<00:02:25.829> piece

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
it won't push you can just use a piece

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.410 
it won't push you can just use a piece
of<00:02:26.099> wood<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.549> won't<00:02:26.700> hurt<00:02:26.849> they're<00:02:27.120> all<00:02:27.239> over

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
of wood that won't hurt they're all over

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.140 
of wood that won't hurt they're all over
the<00:02:27.480> place<00:02:27.510> opens<00:02:27.989> get<00:02:28.109> nighttime<00:02:28.439> but

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
the place opens get nighttime but

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.520 
the place opens get nighttime but
anyways<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.389> then<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.870> put<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.139> pistons

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
anyways and then you put the pistons

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.179 
anyways and then you put the pistons
facing<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:32.250> mean<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.209> put<00:02:33.389> the<00:02:34.189> repeaters

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
facing I mean you put the repeaters

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.709 
facing I mean you put the repeaters
facing<00:02:35.639> the<00:02:35.730> piston<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.180> block<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:36.599> make

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:36.719 
facing the piston in the block but make

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.009 
facing the piston in the block but make
sure<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.219> repeaters<00:02:38.219> are<00:02:38.659> actually<00:02:39.659> like

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
sure the repeaters are actually like

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.629 
sure the repeaters are actually like
this<00:02:40.290> facing<00:02:40.829> towards<00:02:41.129> the<00:02:41.189> block<00:02:41.280> because<00:02:41.459> if

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
this facing towards the block because if

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:42.800 
this facing towards the block because if
their<00:02:41.760> other<00:02:41.879> way<00:02:42.000> they<00:02:42.150> won't<00:02:42.239> work<00:02:42.480> for<00:02:42.689> some

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
their other way they won't work for some

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.690 
their other way they won't work for some
odd<00:02:42.930> reason<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.739> then<00:02:43.889> you<00:02:43.950> take<00:02:44.159> redstone

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
odd reason and then you take redstone

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.360 
odd reason and then you take redstone
you<00:02:44.819> put<00:02:44.939> it<00:02:45.030> right<00:02:45.120> here<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.650> now<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.889> do

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
you put it right here and now you do

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.849 
you put it right here and now you do
redstone<00:02:48.090> right<00:02:48.269> here<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:48.810> then<00:02:49.680> make<00:02:49.829> sure

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
redstone right here and then make sure

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.500 
redstone right here and then make sure
you<00:02:50.129> put<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.459> repeaters<00:02:50.879> facing<00:02:51.299> this<00:02:51.450> way

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
you put the repeaters facing this way

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.960 
you put the repeaters facing this way
and<00:02:51.989> then<00:02:52.769> these<00:02:52.889> repeaters<00:02:53.250> facing<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.909> way

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
and then these repeaters facing this way

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.440 
and then these repeaters facing this way
and<00:02:54.389> then<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:54.959> put<00:02:55.139> some<00:02:55.169> redstone<00:02:55.409> on<00:02:55.709> edge

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
and then you put some redstone on edge

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.179 
and then you put some redstone on edge
that<00:02:57.450> should<00:02:57.659> lead<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.959> link<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.799> your<00:02:58.889> light

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
that should lead to link to your light

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.099 
that should lead to link to your light
that<00:02:59.609> I<00:02:59.639> will<00:02:59.909> put<00:03:00.090> right<00:03:02.719> I'll<00:03:03.719> put<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:03.959> light

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
that I will put right I'll put the light

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.309 
that I will put right I'll put the light
right<00:03:04.319> here<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:04.919> to<00:03:05.040> be<00:03:05.129> weird<00:03:06.109> let's<00:03:07.109> see<00:03:07.230> we

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
right here just to be weird let's see we

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.770 
right here just to be weird let's see we
put<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.560> lights<00:03:07.739> right<00:03:07.950> here<00:03:08.599> and<00:03:09.599> then<00:03:11.780> we'll

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
put the lights right here and then we'll

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.659 
put the lights right here and then we'll
link<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.079> Redstone<00:03:13.500> around<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:16.370> then<00:03:17.370> we

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
link the Redstone around and then we

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:23.420 
link the Redstone around and then we
want<00:03:17.879> to<00:03:18.650> bring<00:03:19.650> this<00:03:19.889> out<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.760> we'll<00:03:22.370> then<00:03:23.370> we

want to bring this out so we'll then we

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.909 
want to bring this out so we'll then we
put<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.609> switch<00:03:24.419> and<00:03:25.019> then<00:03:25.199> we<00:03:25.260> hit<00:03:25.349> it<00:03:25.409> it

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
put a switch and then we hit it it

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.210 
put a switch and then we hit it it
should<00:03:26.069> light<00:03:26.250> up<00:03:26.479> and<00:03:27.479> now<00:03:27.599> that<00:03:28.189> okay<00:03:29.189> I

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
should light up and now that okay I

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.679 
should light up and now that okay I
honestly<00:03:29.579> didn't<00:03:29.879> understand<00:03:30.359> I<00:03:30.510> don't

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:38.189 
just break those put a light here like

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.240 
just break those put a light here like
here<00:03:39.229> you<00:03:40.229> know<00:03:40.349> cover<00:03:40.620> up<00:03:40.739> that<00:03:40.889> with<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.040> piece

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
here you know cover up that with a piece

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.339 
here you know cover up that with a piece
of<00:03:41.370> wood<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:41.939> I<00:03:42.299> put<00:03:42.479> another<00:03:42.569> red<00:03:42.900> dust<00:03:43.139> right

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
of wood and I put another red dust right

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.759 
of wood and I put another red dust right
here<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.459> then<00:03:44.609> there<00:03:44.759> a<00:03:45.319> foot<00:03:46.319> well<00:03:46.500> that

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
here and then there a foot well that

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.099 
here and then there a foot well that
one's<00:03:46.949> staying<00:03:47.129> on<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:48.060> little<00:03:48.269> douche<00:03:48.449> and

one's staying on you little douche and
then<00:03:49.259> that's<00:03:49.379> pretty<00:03:49.439> much<00:03:49.680> how<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:49.889> make<00:03:50.069> a

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
then that's pretty much how you make a

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.360 
then that's pretty much how you make a
the<00:03:51.239> lights<00:03:51.449> flicker<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:52.109> have<00:03:52.650> two<00:03:52.889> of<00:03:53.069> them<00:03:53.250> up

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
the lights flicker I have two of them up

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.740 
the lights flicker I have two of them up
over<00:03:53.579> there<00:03:53.729> so<00:03:53.909> it<00:03:54.030> make<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.299> like<00:03:54.389> flicker

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
over there so it make it like flicker

hang on it and then you can right-click
these<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.849> then<00:04:11.849> you'll<00:04:11.970> make<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.269> take

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
these and then you'll make it take

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.059 
these and then you'll make it take
longer<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.139> then<00:04:13.259> let<00:04:13.409> me<00:04:13.439> put<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.739> actual

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
longer and then let me put the actual

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.409 
longer and then let me put the actual
switch<00:04:14.400> inside<00:04:14.729> the<00:04:14.849> building<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.209> make<00:04:15.239> it

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
switch inside the building to make it

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.020 
switch inside the building to make it
look<00:04:15.599> decent<00:04:16.130> alright<00:04:17.130> put<00:04:17.430> there<00:04:17.639> and<00:04:17.909> then

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
look decent alright put there and then

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.409 
look decent alright put there and then
we<00:04:18.169> red<00:04:19.169> redstone<00:04:20.130> there<00:04:20.159> and<00:04:20.729> then<00:04:21.090> we<00:04:21.180> go<00:04:21.329> on

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
we red redstone there and then we go on

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.660 
we red redstone there and then we go on
the<00:04:21.509> inside<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.550> then<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.639> believe<00:04:24.050> you<00:04:25.050> want

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
the inside and then I believe you want

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.760 
the inside and then I believe you want
here<00:04:26.300> make<00:04:26.990> sure<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:27.230> put<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.530> where<00:04:27.650> the

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
here make sure you put it to where the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.070 
here make sure you put it to where the
you<00:04:28.100> have<00:04:28.250> made<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.580> redstone<00:04:28.970> at<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.870> then

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
you have made the redstone at and then

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.870 
you have made the redstone at and then
you<00:04:30.170> flip<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.530> switch<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.580> should<00:04:31.760> come

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
you flip the switch and it should come

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.260 
you flip the switch and it should come
