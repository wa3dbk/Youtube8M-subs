this is the finger style warm-ups
tutorial<00:00:14.370> part<00:00:14.549> 5<00:00:14.880> in<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.389> segment<00:00:15.660> we'll

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
tutorial part 5 in this segment we'll

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.930 
tutorial part 5 in this segment we'll
look<00:00:16.049> at<00:00:16.199> using<00:00:16.470> single<00:00:16.770> notes<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.730> do<00:00:17.910> a

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
look at using single notes to do a

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.760 
look at using single notes to do a
warm-up<00:00:18.359> thing<00:00:18.570> for<00:00:18.840> parades<00:00:19.140> both<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.590> right

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
warm-up thing for parades both the right

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.870 
warm-up thing for parades both the right
and<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.160> left<00:00:20.189> hand

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
and the left hand

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.420 
and the left hand
we'll<00:00:21.840> start<00:00:22.109> by<00:00:22.289> learning<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.769> scale<00:00:23.130> that

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
we'll start by learning a scale that

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.250 
we'll start by learning a scale that
goes<00:00:23.939> two<00:00:24.150> octaves<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.019> C<00:00:25.230> major

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
goes two octaves this is the C major

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.019 
goes two octaves this is the C major
scale<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.250> uses<00:00:26.430> two<00:00:26.699> different

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
scale and it uses two different

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.729 
scale and it uses two different
positions<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:33.050> can<00:00:34.050> see<00:00:34.170> there's<00:00:34.350> kind<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.590> an

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
positions you can see there's kind of an

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.370 
positions you can see there's kind of an
unusual<00:00:34.890> shift<00:00:35.520> there<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.940> middle<00:00:36.380> so

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
unusual shift there in the middle so

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.540 
unusual shift there in the middle so
let's<00:00:37.559> look<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:37.890> scale<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.340> then<00:00:38.430> we'll

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
let's look at this scale and then we'll

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.000 
let's look at this scale and then we'll
apply<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.820> right<00:00:39.090> hand<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:40.620> start<00:00:40.860> out

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
apply the right hand to it we start out

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.799 
apply the right hand to it we start out

just like alternate picking if you play

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.940 
just like alternate picking if you play
with<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:55.869> pick<00:01:56.110> on<00:01:56.290> acoustic<00:01:56.740> or<00:01:56.890> electric

fingers<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.850> do<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.540> good<00:02:13.780> way<00:02:13.870> to

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
fingers so to do that a good way to

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.170 
fingers so to do that a good way to
start<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.470> play<00:02:14.800> for<00:02:14.860> tacks<00:02:15.489> on<00:02:15.700> each<00:02:15.880> note

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
start is to play for tacks on each note

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.550 
start is to play for tacks on each note
that'll<00:02:16.510> give<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.780> chance<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.140> think<00:02:17.380> about

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
that'll give you a chance to think about

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.410 
that'll give you a chance to think about
the<00:02:17.650> next<00:02:17.800> note<00:02:18.070> you<00:02:18.190> have<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.430> play<00:02:18.640> but<00:02:19.269> also

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
the next note you have to play but also

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.990 
the next note you have to play but also
to<00:02:19.660> not<00:02:19.959> have<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.320> make<00:02:21.190> some<00:02:21.400> weird<00:02:21.580> changes

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
to not have to make some weird changes

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.630 
to not have to make some weird changes
between<00:02:22.360> strings<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:23.500> we<00:02:23.620> would<00:02:23.739> go<00:02:23.920> index

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
between strings so we would go index

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:47.020 
between strings so we would go index
middle<00:02:24.880> index<00:02:25.090> middle<00:02:25.510> on<00:02:26.019> each<00:02:26.440> string

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.100 

so<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.090> can<00:02:48.240> practice<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.020> could

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
so you can practice that so you could

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.750 
so you can practice that so you could
come<00:02:49.290> with<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.650> scale<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.100> then<00:02:50.280> alternate

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
come with the scale and then alternate

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.280 
come with the scale and then alternate
the<00:02:50.880> fingers<00:02:51.210> completely<00:02:51.450> going<00:02:51.930> through<00:02:52.200> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
the fingers completely going through the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.140 
the fingers completely going through the
scale

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.750 

and<00:02:59.330> you<00:03:00.140> can<00:03:00.290> repeat<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.650> very<00:03:01.040> slowly<00:03:01.280> over

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
and you can repeat that very slowly over

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.520 
and you can repeat that very slowly over
and<00:03:01.970> over<00:03:02.180> but<00:03:02.629> that<00:03:02.810> will<00:03:02.930> give<00:03:03.049> your<00:03:03.170> fingers

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
and over but that will give your fingers

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.289 
and over but that will give your fingers
a<00:03:03.560> good<00:03:03.830> feel<00:03:04.099> for<00:03:04.129> alternating<00:03:04.819> between<00:03:05.030> the

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
a good feel for alternating between the

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:11.780 
a good feel for alternating between the
strings

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.200
