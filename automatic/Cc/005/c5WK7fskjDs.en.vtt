00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
but what you'll see is almost a

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.240 
but what you'll see is almost a
boomerang<00:03:12.050> shape<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:12.650> have<00:03:12.800> that<00:03:12.980> drop

boomerang shape you have that drop
handle<00:03:13.819> here<00:03:14.030> very<00:03:14.630> similar<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.230> concept

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
handle here very similar to the concept

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.550 
handle here very similar to the concept
of<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:16.370> Gurkha<00:03:16.970> kukri<00:03:17.360> knife<00:03:17.390> but<00:03:18.140> instead<00:03:18.440> of

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
of a Gurkha kukri knife but instead of

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.840 
of a Gurkha kukri knife but instead of
putting<00:03:18.769> that<00:03:18.890> bend<00:03:19.160> in<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.430> middle<00:03:19.670> of<00:03:19.760> the

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
putting that bend in the middle of the

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.039 
putting that bend in the middle of the
blade<00:03:20.030> where<00:03:20.299> you<00:03:20.360> end<00:03:20.510> up<00:03:20.570> with<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.750> reaper

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
blade where you end up with a reaper

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:21.730 
blade where you end up with a reaper
blade

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
blade

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.110 
blade
here<00:03:21.980> you<00:03:22.070> have<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.250> conventional<00:03:22.910> weight

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
here you have a conventional weight

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.090 
here you have a conventional weight
design<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:24.050> you<00:03:24.170> have<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.590> bend<00:03:24.830> in<00:03:25.010> the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
design and you have that bend in the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.100 
design and you have that bend in the
handle<00:03:25.460> so<00:03:25.640> now<00:03:25.760> what<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:26.030> have<00:03:26.240> is<00:03:26.630> the

handle so now what you have is the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.630 
handle so now what you have is the
ability<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.500> maintain<00:03:27.740> a<00:03:27.980> straight<00:03:28.310> wrist

actually a series of three different

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.969 
actually a series of three different
knives<00:04:56.210> called<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.110> enough<00:04:57.380> series<00:04:57.770> the

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
knives called the enough series the

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.320 
knives called the enough series the
three<00:04:58.190> different<00:04:58.490> blade<00:04:58.639> profiles<00:04:59.120> available

three different blade profiles available
with<00:04:59.750> this<00:04:59.870> but<00:05:00.410> I'll<00:05:00.500> focus<00:05:00.680> on<00:05:00.979> this<00:05:01.160> one

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
with this but I'll focus on this one

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.249 
which we call our leaf shaped light it's
basically<00:05:03.979> kind<00:05:04.280> of<00:05:04.400> a<00:05:04.490> drop-point<00:05:04.759> design

you get out to a six or seven inch blade
it's<00:05:24.500> very<00:05:24.740> difficult<00:05:25.099> to<00:05:25.250> defend<00:05:25.520> anything

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
it's very difficult to defend anything

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.189 
it's very difficult to defend anything
with<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.090> blade<00:05:26.300> service<00:05:26.720> out<00:05:26.840> here<00:05:26.870> until

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
with the blade service out here until

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.170 
with the blade service out here until
you<00:05:27.349> have<00:05:27.560> enough<00:05:27.680> blade<00:05:28.190> length<00:05:28.460> to<00:05:29.000> have

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
you have enough blade length to have

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.150 
you have enough blade length to have
that<00:05:29.360> momentum<00:05:29.930> and<00:05:30.020> then<00:05:30.169> faster<00:05:30.650> chops<00:05:30.919> with

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
that momentum and then faster chops with

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.309 
that momentum and then faster chops with
so<00:05:31.849> a<00:05:31.880> lot<00:05:32.120> of<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:32.389> workhorse<00:05:32.810> stuff<00:05:33.139> is

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
so a lot of the workhorse stuff is

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:34.719 
so a lot of the workhorse stuff is
happening<00:05:33.470> right<00:05:33.860> here<00:05:34.069> so<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.430> question

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
happening right here so the question

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.909 
happening right here so the question
came<00:05:35.150> up<00:05:35.360> how<00:05:35.870> much<00:05:36.020> blade<00:05:36.289> is<00:05:36.440> just<00:05:36.470> enough

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
came up how much blade is just enough

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.339 
came up how much blade is just enough
this<00:05:37.370> is<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:37.639> answer<00:05:37.910> so<00:05:38.750> what<00:05:38.900> it<00:05:38.990> gives<00:05:39.020> you

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
this is the answer so what it gives you

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.050 
this is the answer so what it gives you
is<00:05:39.460> injection<00:05:40.460> molded<00:05:40.639> fiberglass

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
in either directions and we didn't have

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:56.920 
in either directions and we didn't have
to<00:05:55.280> hastily<00:05:55.639> she<00:05:55.940> that<00:05:56.120> for<00:05:56.300> whatever<00:05:56.419> reason

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
to hastily she that for whatever reason

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.749 
to hastily she that for whatever reason
we<00:05:56.990> could<00:05:57.110> do<00:05:57.229> that<00:05:57.440> it's<00:05:58.069> designed<00:05:58.190> to<00:05:58.460> go<00:05:58.610> in

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
we could do that it's designed to go in

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.159 
we could do that it's designed to go in
this<00:05:58.880> way<00:05:59.060> so<00:05:59.120> you<00:05:59.300> have<00:05:59.330> a<00:05:59.479> thumb<00:05:59.659> push<00:05:59.930> off

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
this way so you have a thumb push off

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.890 
this way so you have a thumb push off
here<00:06:00.500> simply<00:06:01.250> push<00:06:01.460> that<00:06:01.639> off<00:06:01.849> again<00:06:02.780> the

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
here simply push that off again the

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.870 
here simply push that off again the
throat<00:06:03.199> is<00:06:03.470> the<00:06:03.860> retention<00:06:04.310> on<00:06:04.430> the<00:06:04.550> handle

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
throat is the retention on the handle

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.540 
throat is the retention on the handle
and<00:06:05.750> again<00:06:06.590> it<00:06:06.770> has<00:06:06.919> a<00:06:06.949> grommet<00:06:07.460> in

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
and again it has a grommet in

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.390 
and again it has a grommet in
construction<00:06:08.150> g-clip<00:06:08.990> mount<00:06:09.289> and<00:06:09.560> the<00:06:09.979> g<00:06:10.130> clip

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
construction g-clip mount and the g clip

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.589 
construction g-clip mount and the g clip
you<00:06:10.520> notice<00:06:10.789> that<00:06:10.880> there's<00:06:11.060> two<00:06:11.120> sets<00:06:11.479> of

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 
you notice that there's two sets of

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:13.450 
you notice that there's two sets of
holes<00:06:11.810> here<00:06:12.169> so<00:06:12.349> you<00:06:12.650> can<00:06:12.800> set<00:06:12.949> this<00:06:13.099> up<00:06:13.250> either

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
holes here so you can set this up either

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.149 
holes here so you can set this up either
for<00:06:13.819> a<00:06:13.849> high<00:06:14.090> ride<00:06:14.360> or<00:06:14.569> low<00:06:14.750> ride<00:06:14.990> carry<00:06:15.380> and

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:16.159 
for a high ride or low ride carry and

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.220 
for a high ride or low ride carry and
again<00:06:16.430> full<00:06:16.669> angular<00:06:17.060> adjustment<00:06:17.599> with<00:06:17.750> the<00:06:17.780> g

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
again full angular adjustment with the g

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.300 
again full angular adjustment with the g
so<00:06:18.350> if<00:06:18.410> you<00:06:18.470> want<00:06:18.620> to<00:06:18.650> carry<00:06:18.830> it<00:06:18.920> inside<00:06:19.040> the

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
so if you want to carry it inside the

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.010 
so if you want to carry it inside the
waistband<00:06:19.700> or<00:06:19.850> on<00:06:19.970> the<00:06:20.060> belt<00:06:20.240> you<00:06:20.690> can<00:06:20.840> tune

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
waistband or on the belt you can tune

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.510 
waistband or on the belt you can tune
that<00:06:21.200> angle<00:06:21.560> so<00:06:21.590> it's<00:06:21.770> comfortable<00:06:22.220> to<00:06:22.280> carry

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
that angle so it's comfortable to carry

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.550 
that angle so it's comfortable to carry
but<00:06:23.150> something<00:06:23.480> like<00:06:23.570> this<00:06:23.810> for<00:06:24.140> a<00:06:24.200> bug-out
