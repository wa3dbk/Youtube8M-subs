00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 an innocent friend saw again 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:09.770
 it snowed and that's why today 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.770
 tips for taking pictures at snow 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.379
 yes it is wonderful when it snows 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.360
 especially when it comes time in berlin 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.250
 Snow has been there since the snow is relative 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.500
 fast black but we are lucky 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.970
 Today you are at Wannsee in the forest where the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.590
 snow is still a bit 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 It's not that way, though 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.779
 just take a picture of the snow 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.320
 what you should pay attention to this 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.320
 I tell you now 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.360
 the main problem when taking pictures 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.019
 snow is on the one hand, the cold me 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.340
 I have a video though 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.050
 what you do in the cold 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.149
 should note again briefly 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.100
 summarized, pay attention to a second 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.579
 Battery makes sure that you gloves 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.550
 were wearing 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.930
 and if you even have gloves where 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.340
 the fingers change for example the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.420
 I just cut away then 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.980
 Can you make the camera much better 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.750
 if you use later to the house clean 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.610
 then goes out that he respects the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.070
 cool camera slowly lets me 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.539
 no condensation forms and that they 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.589
 the lens does not change when 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.240
 you go in there because otherwise you can 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.490
 Water in the camera inside collects like that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.770
 that you summarized at the beginning now 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.950
 it goes to the actual photographing 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.410
 it is lousy hellmann sees it already 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.780
 the snow is white and what do we know 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.160
 Reflected on white and white though 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.080
 the sun is shining here right now 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.060
 it is still very bright and so on 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.679
 the camera has a problem is called which 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.399
 for example, the automatic mode of 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:33.179
 camera I would like to go here for a moment 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:37.679
 setting makes it easy now 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.509
 picture he tells me blinded 71 let's go 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.759
 back 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.560
 he even told me 63 even though she is dazzling 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.959
 Even eight he will not quite come 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.140
 clear but so around the blind 825th 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.520
 shutter speed iso 100 and I know 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.229
 my photographers experience that on 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.729
 in any case, the aperture 8 now up to date 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.380
 with this ambient lighting too 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.360
 The camera is dark but says it 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.429
 is ok because it is very very bright 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.099
 that I look at the picture then sees 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.989
 you just it's pretty dark of that 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.819
 snow is almost the mud of the in 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.380
 Berlin lying around on the streets otherwise 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.890
 and what do you do now you go out 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.989
 from the p mode into the manual 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.000
 mode and looks over the liveview like 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.030
 the picture looks optimal 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.930
 and if you can do that wonderfully 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.310
 adjust exposure as for example 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.730
 here at the eightieth closing time 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.400
 Aperture 4 or snow looks reasonably 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.110
 so we know now here in real 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.730
 It looks like there are four blinds 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.900
 difference to what the camera said 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.560
 have that is already blatant 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:45.780
 especially as a photo here and now is the 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.440
 snow really white so get out of the p 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.760
 mode or rv or else any 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.230
 automatic mode purely in the manual 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.770
 mode and watch yourself like that 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.770
 Exposure is 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.680
 the second problem is what it can do 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.080
 the white balance by that here 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.330
 really everything is white and the eye yes 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.220
 almost the perfect automatic 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.930
 it can do white balance right here 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.520
 but later on the picture relatively different 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.260
 look because the camera too and 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.400
 automatic white balance does but 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.750
 can be deceived by 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.490
 different circumstances because of that 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.660
 I recommend you take pictures in 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.460
 gräfenroda can you the white balance in 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.320
 afterwards in lightroom or photoshop 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.390
 or else in a program easy 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.400
 change or grandchild losses that 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.020
 is very very cool and im just when 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.060
 the white balance should be yellow 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.780
 to be blue you can do it all 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.750
 easy to read mixtape pays attention 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.430
 cool snowy little things like that 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.610
 What like this, I think it's great 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.350
 is a klette I want to appreciate 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.870
 yes I think it climbs so 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.420
 Bit on the finger and it has such a 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.330
 a little snow on it looks gorgeous 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.980
 from nice pure zoomed in that one 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.860
 bit nice the focke carries behind 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.700
 nice blurred background and there 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.990
 It looks super cool on the camera 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.720
 the beautiful if so snow is in the 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:11.540
 background you have such a nice 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.540
 white soft blurred background 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.720
 and one last hint of snow is suitable 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.130
 Great for people so 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.440
 example to make horny portraits 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.760
 because it is like a huge reflector 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.240
 the hottest is when the sun 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.620
 seems 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.850
 Unfortunately today we are covered 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.430
 sky so very darker if the 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.950
 Sun shines on this snow it is 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.840
 almost a huge reflector one 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.970
 gets a horny eye reflex and as 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.460
 if you are such a reflector pop up 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.900
 reflexes and the eye holds and over as 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.200
 mirror of the adam is also very very 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.400
 bright 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.440
 you have to underexposure again 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.669
 then see that we have the right 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.610
 but exposure gets there as well 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.710
 earlier look manual mode and then 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.540
 the bunny is a lot of fun for you 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.640
 always take pictures in the snow 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.780
 Thinking is not so long really 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.220
 cold I notice already on the index finger 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.960
 here is slowly getting a bit bluish 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.440
 now it will definitely be warmer or 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.940
 neither 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.040
 that was the stupid idea of ​​the 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.530
 besides I have earlier and 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.130
 touched 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.990
 No matter how liked it then goes on everyone 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.610
 If the thumb is subscribed to the top 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.320
 channel 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.440
 her victory in the same connection the last 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.720
 video and a description the links too 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.090
 facebook to instagram and so on 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.450
 horny snow photos her snow bunnies me 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.450
 go on
