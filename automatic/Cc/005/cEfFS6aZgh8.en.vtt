of<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> g<00:01:24.060> string<00:01:24.119> fourth<00:01:24.810> fret<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
of the g string fourth fret of the a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.490 
of the g string fourth fret of the a
string<00:01:26.119> I'm<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.300> to<00:01:27.360> play<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.479> five<00:01:28.470> times

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
string I'm going to play this five times

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.550 
string I'm going to play this five times
it's<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.430> one<00:01:30.090> two<00:01:30.720> three<00:01:31.170> four<00:01:31.500> five

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
it's like this one two three four five

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.660 
it's like this one two three four five
and<00:01:35.210> then<00:01:36.210> open<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.570> string<00:01:37.759> one<00:01:38.759> two<00:01:39.530> one<00:01:40.530> two

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
and then open a string one two one two

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
and then open a string one two one two
three<00:01:41.670> four<00:01:42.030> five<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.840> starts<00:01:43.140> again<00:01:43.380> from

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
three four five that starts again from

00:01:43.680 --> 00:02:00.390 
three four five that starts again from
right<00:01:43.979> here

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.990 

so<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:01.490> chords<00:02:01.760> are<00:02:01.880> basically<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.979> D<00:02:03.979> chord<00:02:04.250> at

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
so the chords are basically a D chord at

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.220 
so the chords are basically a D chord at
G<00:02:05.330> chord<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:06.620> an<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:06.950> chord
