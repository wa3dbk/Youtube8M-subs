which<00:01:37.320> represents<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.920> highest<00:01:38.100> year<00:01:38.430> of

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
which represents the highest year of

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.060 
which represents the highest year of
players<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.450> don't<00:01:39.900> think<00:01:39.990> anybody<00:01:40.710> has<00:01:40.890> is

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
players I don't think anybody has is

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.770 
players I don't think anybody has is
automatically<00:01:41.670> placed<00:01:42.030> into<00:01:42.390> diamond

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
automatically placed into diamond

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.149 
automatically placed into diamond
because<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.290> quite<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.530> few<00:01:43.619> top<00:01:43.979> tier

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
because I have quite a few top tier

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.350 
because I have quite a few top tier
players<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.579> my<00:01:44.610> friends<00:01:44.909> list<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.210> there

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
players on my friends list and there

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.990 
players on my friends list and there
they're<00:01:45.659> not<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:45.899> diamond<00:01:46.200> yet<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.189> excuse<00:01:47.850> me

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
they're not in diamond yet so excuse me

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.539 
they're not in diamond yet so excuse me
not<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.420> masters<00:01:48.840> yet<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.799> think<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.430> order

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
not in masters yet so I think in order

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.039 
not in masters yet so I think in order
to<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.820> into<00:01:50.970> masters<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.020> play

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
to get into masters you do have to play

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.170 
to get into masters you do have to play
it<00:01:52.470> out<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:52.829> you're<00:01:52.979> already<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.460> diamond<00:01:54.000> and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
it out if you're already in diamond and

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.840 
it out if you're already in diamond and
once<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.170> play<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.500> out<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.009> win<00:01:56.399> enough

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
once you play it out and you win enough

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.249 
once you play it out and you win enough
matches<00:01:57.210> i<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.509> that's<00:01:57.659> when<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.930> promotes

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
matches i think that's when it promotes

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.929 
matches i think that's when it promotes
you<00:01:58.380> two<00:01:58.469> masters<00:01:58.799> league<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.159> i<00:01:59.369> will<00:01:59.820> of

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
sure a lot of the top tier players are

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.280 
sure a lot of the top tier players are
going<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.239> be<00:03:01.330> rebinding<00:03:01.840> their<00:03:01.989> entire

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
going to be rebinding their entire

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.920 
going to be rebinding their entire
keyboard<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:04.000> mean<00:03:04.450> it's<00:03:04.600> going<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.810> take

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
keyboard and I mean it's going to take

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.000 
keyboard and I mean it's going to take
some<00:03:04.959> time<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.320> adjust<00:03:05.410> but<00:03:05.680> in<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:05.830> long<00:03:05.980> run

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
some time to adjust but in the long run

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.000 
some time to adjust but in the long run
I<00:03:06.280> think<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.610> definitely<00:03:06.790> can<00:03:07.239> help<00:03:08.010> also

or two bunkers and that was really

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.289 
or two bunkers and that was really
really<00:03:57.040> annoying<00:03:57.340> if<00:03:57.549> you<00:03:57.640> reserve<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.150> this

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
really annoying if you reserve so this

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.449 
really annoying if you reserve so this

detection<00:04:47.659> unit<00:04:48.020> in<00:04:48.169> the<00:04:48.259> game<00:04:48.469> and<00:04:48.729> so<00:04:49.729> yeah

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:49.879 
detection unit in the game and so yeah

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:51.700 
detection unit in the game and so yeah
that's<00:04:49.999> a<00:04:50.120> huge<00:04:50.360> buffer<00:04:50.689> Protoss<00:04:51.020> also

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
that's a huge buffer Protoss also

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.260 
that's a huge buffer Protoss also
another<00:04:51.919> buffer<00:04:52.189> Protoss<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.849> beat<00:04:53.060> the

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
another buffer Protoss the beat the

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.399 
another buffer Protoss the beat the
build<00:04:53.479> time<00:04:53.629> for<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:53.900> Phoenix<00:04:54.229> has<00:04:54.379> been

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
build time for the Phoenix has been

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.640 
build time for the Phoenix has been
decreased<00:04:55.099> from<00:04:55.699> 45<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.330> 35<00:04:56.870> so<00:04:57.469> now<00:04:57.590> the

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
decreased from 45 to 35 so now the

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.260 
decreased from 45 to 35 so now the
Phoenix<00:04:58.069> are<00:04:58.189> going<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.400> be<00:04:58.490> coming<00:04:58.639> out<00:04:58.819> even

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
Phoenix are going to be coming out even

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.080 
Phoenix are going to be coming out even
more<00:04:59.300> often<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.430> one<00:05:01.430> of<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.610> most<00:05:01.789> dreaded

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
more often and one of the most dreaded

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.089 
more often and one of the most dreaded
builds<00:05:02.509> if<00:05:02.659> you're<00:05:02.930> if<00:05:03.409> you're<00:05:03.560> zerg<00:05:03.830> vs

Colossus<00:05:07.159> build<00:05:07.370> so<00:05:07.969> I<00:05:08.000> think<00:05:08.120> we're<00:05:08.330> going<00:05:08.419> to

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
Colossus build so I think we're going to

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.809 
Colossus build so I think we're going to
be<00:05:08.569> seeing<00:05:08.719> that<00:05:08.870> a<00:05:08.930> lot<00:05:09.259> more<00:05:09.469> and<00:05:09.819> honestly

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
be seeing that a lot more and honestly

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.119 
be seeing that a lot more and honestly
this<00:05:11.029> could<00:05:11.300> be<00:05:11.389> a<00:05:11.419> very<00:05:11.539> very<00:05:12.020> very<00:05:12.289> deadly

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:13.129 
this could be a very very very deadly

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:15.429 
this could be a very very very deadly
change<00:05:13.550> for<00:05:14.449> protoss<00:05:14.810> with<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.169> with<00:05:15.349> the

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:15.439 
change for protoss with the with the

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.839 
change for protoss with the with the
Phoenix<00:05:15.740> I<00:05:15.830> expect<00:05:16.069> to<00:05:16.099> see<00:05:16.279> Phoenix<00:05:16.430> use<00:05:16.699> a

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
Phoenix I expect to see Phoenix use a

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.230 
Phoenix I expect to see Phoenix use a
lot<00:05:17.060> more<00:05:17.240> now<00:05:17.500> void<00:05:18.500> rays<00:05:18.710> also<00:05:19.370> deal<00:05:19.969> twenty

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
lot more now void rays also deal twenty

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.670 
lot more now void rays also deal twenty
percent<00:05:20.449> more<00:05:20.629> damage<00:05:20.930> to<00:05:21.020> massive<00:05:21.319> targets

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
percent more damage to massive targets

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.379 
percent more damage to massive targets
that's<00:05:21.889> a<00:05:22.039> nice<00:05:22.310> little<00:05:22.520> buff<00:05:22.789> but<00:05:23.060> the<00:05:23.180> flux

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
that's a nice little buff but the flux

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.909 
that's a nice little buff but the flux
vein<00:05:23.569> speed<00:05:23.839> upgrade<00:05:24.080> has<00:05:24.199> been<00:05:24.409> removed<00:05:24.710> so

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
vein speed upgrade has been removed so

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.230 
vein speed upgrade has been removed so
they're<00:05:25.370> never<00:05:25.490> they're<00:05:25.819> not<00:05:25.939> going<00:05:26.060> to<00:05:26.150> be

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
they're never they're not going to be

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.969 
they're never they're not going to be
flying<00:05:26.599> around<00:05:26.810> like<00:05:26.960> annoying<00:05:27.379> fly<00:05:27.680> so<00:05:27.889> you

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
flying around like annoying fly so you

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.800 
flying around like annoying fly so you
can't<00:05:28.189> SWAT<00:05:28.460> anymore<00:05:28.849> but<00:05:29.419> they<00:05:29.509> will<00:05:29.629> be

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
can't SWAT anymore but they will be

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.600 
can't SWAT anymore but they will be
doing<00:05:30.080> they<00:05:30.740> will<00:05:30.889> be<00:05:30.979> stinging<00:05:31.279> like<00:05:31.460> a<00:05:31.520> bee

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
doing they will be stinging like a bee

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.119 
doing they will be stinging like a bee
so<00:05:32.089> yeah<00:05:33.050> that's<00:05:33.289> a<00:05:33.439> that's<00:05:33.650> a<00:05:33.770> nice<00:05:33.889> buffer

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:34.129 
so yeah that's a that's a nice buffer

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:35.589 
so yeah that's a that's a nice buffer
Protoss<00:05:34.520> in<00:05:34.699> general<00:05:35.060> I<00:05:35.210> think<00:05:35.240> we're<00:05:35.509> going

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
Protoss in general I think we're going

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.329 
Protoss in general I think we're going
to<00:05:35.689> be<00:05:35.779> seeing<00:05:35.960> Protoss<00:05:36.439> win<00:05:36.650> rates<00:05:36.860> increase

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:37.339 
to be seeing Protoss win rates increase

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:39.700 
to be seeing Protoss win rates increase
all<00:05:37.729> over<00:05:38.089> the<00:05:38.180> board<00:05:38.389> and<00:05:38.599> so<00:05:39.349> let's<00:05:39.589> go<00:05:39.680> ahead

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
all over the board and so let's go ahead

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.920 
all over the board and so let's go ahead
and<00:05:39.830> move<00:05:39.949> on<00:05:40.069> to<00:05:40.099> Terrence<00:05:40.580> the<00:05:40.759> SUV's<00:05:41.270> now

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
and move on to Terrence the SUV's now

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.290 
and move on to Terrence the SUV's now
assume<00:05:42.529> the<00:05:42.740> same<00:05:42.979> threat<00:05:43.430> priority<00:05:43.969> as<00:05:44.120> the

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
assume the same threat priority as the

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.480 
assume the same threat priority as the
unit<00:05:44.659> they're<00:05:44.899> repairing<00:05:45.370> what<00:05:46.370> does<00:05:46.460> that

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
unit they're repairing what does that

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.899 
unit they're repairing what does that
mean<00:05:46.789> that<00:05:47.000> means<00:05:47.449> that<00:05:48.110> if<00:05:49.009> you<00:05:49.399> ever<00:05:49.639> fought

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:49.909 
mean that means that if you ever fought

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:51.369 
mean that means that if you ever fought
against<00:05:50.180> the<00:05:50.240> Thor<00:05:50.539> and<00:05:50.719> a<00:05:50.779> bunch<00:05:50.930> of<00:05:50.990> SUVs

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:51.379 
against the Thor and a bunch of SUVs

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:53.589 
against the Thor and a bunch of SUVs
were<00:05:51.589> repairing<00:05:51.979> it<00:05:52.189> I<00:05:52.370> hope<00:05:52.759> I'm<00:05:53.120> pretty<00:05:53.449> sure

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
were repairing it I hope I'm pretty sure

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:55.420 
were repairing it I hope I'm pretty sure
you<00:05:53.719> were<00:05:53.810> annoyed<00:05:54.050> at<00:05:54.289> the<00:05:54.529> fact<00:05:54.649> that<00:05:54.979> you

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
you were annoyed at the fact that you

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.219 
you were annoyed at the fact that you
couldn't<00:05:55.789> kill<00:05:55.969> the<00:05:56.060> Thor<00:05:56.270> and<00:05:56.509> your<00:05:56.899> units

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
couldn't kill the Thor and your units

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.139 
couldn't kill the Thor and your units
wouldn't<00:05:57.529> attack<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:57.889> suvs<00:05:58.339> and<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:58.879> reason

00:05:59.139 --> 00:05:59.149 
wouldn't attack the suvs and the reason

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:00.279 
wouldn't attack the suvs and the reason
for<00:05:59.180> that<00:05:59.300> is<00:05:59.509> because<00:05:59.539> the<00:05:59.839> Thor<00:06:00.080> had<00:06:00.259> a

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
for that is because the Thor had a

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:01.629 
for that is because the Thor had a
higher<00:06:00.439> threat<00:06:00.740> priority<00:06:01.159> if<00:06:01.430> you<00:06:01.520> guys

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
higher threat priority if you guys

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:02.709 
higher threat priority if you guys
played<00:06:01.789> World<00:06:01.939> of<00:06:01.969> Warcraft<00:06:02.089> so<00:06:02.389> I'm<00:06:02.449> sure<00:06:02.629> you

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:02.719 
played World of Warcraft so I'm sure you

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:04.149 
played World of Warcraft so I'm sure you
guys<00:06:02.810> know<00:06:02.870> what<00:06:03.050> I'm<00:06:03.169> saying<00:06:03.379> what<00:06:04.099> I'm

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:04.159 
guys know what I'm saying what I'm

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:06.490 
guys know what I'm saying what I'm
talking<00:06:04.520> about<00:06:04.689> but<00:06:05.689> now<00:06:05.810> the<00:06:05.870> SUV's<00:06:06.289> had<00:06:06.439> the

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
talking about but now the SUV's had the

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.350 
talking about but now the SUV's had the
same<00:06:06.649> threat<00:06:06.889> priorities<00:06:07.279> so<00:06:07.430> basically<00:06:07.969> the

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
same threat priorities so basically the

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.839 
same threat priorities so basically the
ones<00:06:08.629> in<00:06:08.839> the<00:06:08.930> front<00:06:09.339> will<00:06:10.339> always<00:06:10.729> get

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849 
ones in the front will always get

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:12.820 
ones in the front will always get
attacked<00:06:11.089> first<00:06:11.270> before<00:06:11.719> they<00:06:12.080> before<00:06:12.589> you're

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
attacked first before they before you're

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.779 
attacked first before they before you're
going<00:06:12.949> to<00:06:13.009> start<00:06:13.159> to<00:06:13.279> attack<00:06:13.370> the<00:06:13.610> torso

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
going to start to attack the torso

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.850 
going to start to attack the torso
you'll<00:06:14.509> be<00:06:14.629> able<00:06:14.750> to<00:06:14.870> start<00:06:15.050> attacking<00:06:15.289> SCV's

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
you'll be able to start attacking SCV's

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.709 
you'll be able to start attacking SCV's
at<00:06:16.159> the<00:06:16.460> same<00:06:16.639> time<00:06:16.819> as<00:06:16.969> a<00:06:17.000> Thor<00:06:17.270> rather<00:06:17.539> than

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
at the same time as a Thor rather than

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.510 
at the same time as a Thor rather than
you<00:06:17.930> know<00:06:17.960> just<00:06:18.259> attacking<00:06:18.649> the<00:06:18.860> the<00:06:19.279> unit
