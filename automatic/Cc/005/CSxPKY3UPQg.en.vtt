00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770 
right we're now going to do the graded

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.580 
right we're now going to do the graded
wash<00:00:14.010> and<00:00:14.760> in<00:00:15.150> many<00:00:15.480> respects<00:00:16.049> here's<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
wash and in many respects here's the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.920 
wash and in many respects here's the
flat<00:00:16.920> wash<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.400> did<00:00:17.610> previously<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
flat wash that we did previously and the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.230 
flat wash that we did previously and the
graded<00:00:19.320> wash<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.800> only<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.400> same<00:00:20.670> as<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> flat

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
graded wash is only the same as the flat

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.300 
graded wash is only the same as the flat
wash<00:00:21.450> at<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> top<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.110> the<00:00:22.170> sky<00:00:22.410> except<00:00:23.130> it

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
wash at the top of the sky except it

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.010 
wash at the top of the sky except it
just<00:00:23.520> gets<00:00:23.700> a<00:00:23.790> little<00:00:24.000> bit<00:00:24.180> lighter<00:00:24.540> as<00:00:24.869> it

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
just gets a little bit lighter as it

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.409 
just gets a little bit lighter as it
gets<00:00:25.200> down<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.500> or<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.130> horizon<00:00:26.730> which<00:00:27.270> is

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
gets down to or the horizon which is

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:28.970 
gets down to or the horizon which is
much<00:00:27.660> more<00:00:27.869> representative<00:00:28.079> of<00:00:28.740> what<00:00:28.950> a

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
much more representative of what a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.400 
much more representative of what a
proper<00:00:29.669> sky<00:00:29.910> looks<00:00:30.240> like<00:00:30.450> unless<00:00:31.110> there's

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
proper sky looks like unless there's

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.979 
proper sky looks like unless there's
some<00:00:31.590> severe<00:00:32.040> storm<00:00:32.460> conditions<00:00:32.810> but<00:00:33.810> let's

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
some severe storm conditions but let's

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.640 
some severe storm conditions but let's
have<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> look<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> graded<00:00:34.950> wash<00:00:36.530> just<00:00:37.530> to

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
have a look at the graded wash just to

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.350 
have a look at the graded wash just to
prove<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.980> don't<00:00:38.130> need<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.550> flat<00:00:38.940> brush<00:00:39.149> all

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
prove you don't need the flat brush all

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.389 
prove you don't need the flat brush all
the<00:00:39.480> time<00:00:39.690> here's<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.530> round<00:00:40.770> brush<00:00:41.160> number

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the time here's the round brush number

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.270 
the time here's the round brush number
12<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.090> I'm<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> use<00:00:42.920> again<00:00:43.920> I've

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
12 that I'm going to use again I've

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.300 
12 that I'm going to use again I've
mixed<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.850> lot<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.690> blue<00:00:45.900> paint<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.980> palette

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
mixed a lot of blue paint in the palette

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.080 
mixed a lot of blue paint in the palette
but<00:00:48.270> before<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> start<00:00:48.840> what<00:00:49.470> I'll<00:00:49.650> do<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.130> make

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
but before I start what I'll do is make

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.350 
but before I start what I'll do is make
a<00:00:51.270> little<00:00:51.480> border<00:00:52.020> around<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:53.000> I'll<00:00:54.000> paint

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
a little border around here I'll paint

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.110 
a little border around here I'll paint
inside<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.080> then<00:00:55.290> that<00:00:55.470> makes<00:00:55.680> sure<00:00:55.830> that

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
inside it then that makes sure that

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.790 
inside it then that makes sure that
everybody<00:00:57.120> gets<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.690> see<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.380> depending

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
everybody gets to see it and depending

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.210 
everybody gets to see it and depending
on<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.130> your<00:00:59.370> TV<00:00:59.970> system<00:01:00.780> setup<00:01:01.080> is<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
on what your TV system setup is that you

on what your TV system setup is that you
don't<00:01:02.430> get<00:01:02.580> any<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.970> picture<00:01:03.330> cut<00:01:03.540> off<00:01:03.750> now

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
I'm using a graphite pencil here and it

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.539 
I'm using a graphite pencil here and it
is<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.170> useful<00:01:07.350> little<00:01:07.770> tip<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.009> know<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.369> isn't

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
is a useful little tip I know this isn't

is a useful little tip I know this isn't
anything<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.150> skies<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:09.960> I'll

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
anything to do with skies but I'll

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.010

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.200 
edge of the board here I'm not worried
too<00:01:19.170> much<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.640> trying<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.760> draw<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> straight

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
too much about trying to draw a straight

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
me fingers down the edge of the board

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.350 
me fingers down the edge of the board
and<00:01:25.470> letting<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.010> pencil<00:01:26.550> touch<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.120> paper

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
like that and if I concentrate on

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.760 
like that and if I concentrate on
keeping<00:01:30.540> my<00:01:30.659> fingers<00:01:31.050> at<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.350> edge<00:01:31.440> of<00:01:31.680> the

keeping my fingers at the edge of the
board<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.880> see<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.570> they<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> nice

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
board you can see that they get a nice

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.460 
board you can see that they get a nice
straight<00:01:34.380> line<00:01:34.440> I'll<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.550> that<00:01:35.700> again<00:01:35.760> here

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
straight line I'll do that again here

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.260 
straight line I'll do that again here
running<00:01:37.470> my<00:01:37.680> fingers<00:01:38.100> along<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> edge<00:01:38.940> of<00:01:39.120> the

running my fingers along the edge of the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.740 
running my fingers along the edge of the
board<00:01:39.620> it's<00:01:40.620> not<00:01:40.770> ruler<00:01:41.310> straight<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.600> it's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
board it's not ruler straight but it's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.570 
board it's not ruler straight but it's
good<00:01:42.930> enough<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:43.650> we<00:01:43.920> want<00:01:46.430> and<00:01:47.430> then

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
good enough for what we want and then

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.649 
good enough for what we want and then
finally<00:01:48.120> we'll<00:01:48.840> do<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.200> same<00:01:49.440> again

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
finally we'll do the same again

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.160 
finally we'll do the same again
here<00:01:52.179> right<00:01:53.179> I'll<00:01:53.420> put<00:01:53.659> my<00:01:53.810> board<00:01:54.079> back

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
here right I'll put my board back

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.109 
here right I'll put my board back
against<00:01:54.829> those<00:01:54.979> little<00:01:55.340> marks<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:55.909> I<00:01:55.939> know

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
against those little marks so I know

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.169 
against those little marks so I know
it's<00:01:56.270> right<00:01:56.890> that<00:01:57.890> looks<00:01:58.280> right<00:01:58.549> in<00:01:58.789> front<00:01:59.030> of

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
it's right that looks right in front of

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.240 
it's right that looks right in front of
the<00:01:59.390> picture<00:02:00.200> for<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.649> in<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:00.950> middle<00:02:01.189> the

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
picture right let's carry on with the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.289 
picture right let's carry on with the
graded<00:02:03.319> wash<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:07.250> we're<00:02:07.429> starting<00:02:07.640> off<00:02:07.939> as<00:02:08.149> we

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
graded wash so we're starting off as we

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:14.259 
graded wash so we're starting off as we
did<00:02:08.479> before<00:02:08.860> with<00:02:09.860> a<00:02:10.690> brush<00:02:11.690> full<00:02:12.319> of<00:02:13.269> strong

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
did before with a brush full of strong

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.020 
did before with a brush full of strong
blue<00:02:14.780> paint<00:02:15.110> at<00:02:15.379> the<00:02:15.620> stop<00:02:15.920> at<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.580> top<00:02:16.790> that's

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
blue paint at the stop at the top that's

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.610 
blue paint at the stop at the top that's
going<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:17.299> start<00:02:17.540> running<00:02:17.750> down<00:02:17.930> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
going to start running down the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.500 
going to start running down the
difference<00:02:19.099> is<00:02:20.019> now<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:22.160> we<00:02:22.849> put<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.299> brush

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
difference is now this we put the brush

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.210 
difference is now this we put the brush
into<00:02:23.750> water<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.590> add<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.879> to<00:02:26.629> the<00:02:27.019> paint<00:02:27.530> and

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
into water and add that to the paint and

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.339 
into water and add that to the paint and
so<00:02:28.489> when<00:02:28.670> we<00:02:28.790> pick<00:02:29.000> up<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.329> paint<00:02:29.629> it's

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
so when we pick up the paint it's

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.479 
so when we pick up the paint it's
slightly<00:02:31.010> lightened<00:02:31.640> off<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:33.160> then<00:02:34.160> we<00:02:34.310> do

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
slightly lightened off and then we do

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.479 
slightly lightened off and then we do
the<00:02:34.670> same<00:02:34.910> again<00:02:35.530> pick<00:02:36.530> up<00:02:36.680> some<00:02:36.950> more<00:02:37.160> water

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
the same again pick up some more water

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.800 
the same again pick up some more water
put<00:02:38.239> it<00:02:38.390> into<00:02:38.629> the<00:02:38.750> paint<00:02:39.049> each<00:02:39.500> time<00:02:39.950> and

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
put it into the paint each time and

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.240 
put it into the paint each time and
lightness<00:02:41.810> off<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.680> can<00:02:42.829> see<00:02:43.010> that

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
lightness off and you can see that

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.430 
lightness off and you can see that
because<00:02:43.459> it's<00:02:43.760> more<00:02:43.970> watery<00:02:44.510> it's<00:02:44.959> running

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
because it's more watery it's running

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.650 
because it's more watery it's running
down<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:47.500> board<00:02:48.500> much<00:02:48.980> quicker<00:02:49.420> lighten<00:02:50.420> it

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
down the board much quicker lighten it

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.619 
down the board much quicker lighten it
off<00:02:50.840> again<00:02:51.280> it's<00:02:52.280> time<00:02:52.670> I'm<00:02:52.910> adding<00:02:53.239> more<00:02:53.480> and

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
off again it's time I'm adding more and

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.729 
off again it's time I'm adding more and
more<00:02:53.720> water<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.889> watery<00:02:55.549> paint<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:57.319> you

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
more water to the watery paint and you

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.720 
more water to the watery paint and you
can<00:02:57.920> see<00:02:58.190> how<00:02:59.709> it's<00:03:00.709> lightening<00:03:01.280> off<00:03:01.400> until

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
can see how it's lightening off until

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.680 
can see how it's lightening off until
I'm<00:03:02.000> almost<00:03:03.639> and<00:03:04.639> let's<00:03:04.880> pretend<00:03:05.239> this<00:03:05.389> is<00:03:05.569> the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
I'm almost and let's pretend this is the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.170 
I'm almost and let's pretend this is the
horizon<00:03:05.989> line<00:03:06.410> here<00:03:06.739> I'm<00:03:07.120> almost<00:03:08.120> putting

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
horizon line here I'm almost putting

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.390 
horizon line here I'm almost putting
nice<00:03:11.180> water<00:03:11.829> into<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:12.950> paint<00:03:15.040> now<00:03:16.040> there's<00:03:16.280> an

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
nice water into the paint now there's an

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.270 
nice water into the paint now there's an
interesting<00:03:16.599> phenomenon<00:03:17.599> just<00:03:17.859> arisen<00:03:18.859> here

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
interesting phenomenon just arisen here

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.089 
interesting phenomenon just arisen here
it<00:03:20.030> will<00:03:20.209> be<00:03:20.329> very<00:03:20.630> irritating<00:03:21.410> normally<00:03:21.919> and

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
it will be very irritating normally and

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.319 
it will be very irritating normally and
I'm<00:03:22.849> tempted<00:03:23.389> to<00:03:23.510> stop<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.200> do<00:03:24.829> this<00:03:25.329> graded

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
I'm tempted to stop and do this graded

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.229 
I'm tempted to stop and do this graded
wash<00:03:26.510> again<00:03:26.720> but<00:03:27.079> I'm<00:03:27.169> going<00:03:27.349> to<00:03:27.380> leave<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.859> and

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
wash again but I'm going to leave it and

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.970 
wash again but I'm going to leave it and
I<00:03:29.239> don't<00:03:30.169> know<00:03:30.230> whether<00:03:30.319> you<00:03:30.440> can<00:03:30.560> see<00:03:30.769> in<00:03:30.889> the

I don't know whether you can see in the

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.360 
middle of the paper to light areas have
suddenly<00:03:35.239> emerged<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.709> what's<00:03:36.950> happened

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
suddenly emerged and what's happened

suddenly emerged and what's happened
there<00:03:37.639> is<00:03:37.880> that<00:03:37.940> at<00:03:38.569> some<00:03:38.630> point<00:03:38.870> I've<00:03:39.590> got<00:03:39.650> a

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
there is that at some point I've got a

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.370 
there is that at some point I've got a
finger<00:03:40.459> mark<00:03:40.730> or<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.000> little<00:03:41.569> bit<00:03:41.690> of<00:03:41.780> grease<00:03:42.109> on

finger mark or a little bit of grease on
my<00:03:42.489> fingers<00:03:43.489> as<00:03:43.760> must<00:03:44.389> have<00:03:44.540> got<00:03:44.750> on<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:45.019> paper

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
my fingers as must have got on the paper

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.280 
my fingers as must have got on the paper
there<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.889> you<00:03:46.489> can<00:03:46.609> see<00:03:46.849> what<00:03:47.030> happens<00:03:47.450> now

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
there and you can see what happens now

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.129 
there and you can see what happens now
as<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:48.889> happens<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:49.519> could<00:03:49.819> well<00:03:50.150> see<00:03:50.419> that<00:03:50.660> that

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
as it happens I could well see that that

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.349 
as it happens I could well see that that
could<00:03:51.349> form<00:03:51.650> part<00:03:51.950> of<00:03:52.129> a<00:03:52.250> sky<00:03:52.549> if<00:03:52.849> it<00:03:53.239> was

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
could form part of a sky if it was

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.740 
could form part of a sky if it was
painting<00:03:53.810> this<00:03:54.019> as<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.950> proper<00:03:55.250> painting<00:03:55.790> but

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
painting this as a proper painting but

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.529 
painting this as a proper painting but
it<00:03:56.900> could<00:03:57.169> quite<00:03:57.889> easily<00:03:58.030> ruin<00:03:59.030> a<00:03:59.120> painting

00:03:59.529 --> 00:03:59.539 
it could quite easily ruin a painting

to<00:04:16.680> happen<00:04:17.070> when<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.250> was<00:04:17.400> going<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.579> do<00:04:17.729> this

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
to happen when I was going to do this

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.729 
to happen when I was going to do this
demonstration<00:04:18.239> but<00:04:19.199> I'm<00:04:19.289> going<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.530> leave

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.140 
that because I think it'll be quite
helpful<00:04:22.139> for<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.710> see<00:04:22.919> it<00:04:23.039> and<00:04:23.220> above<00:04:23.940> all

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
helpful for you to see it and above all

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.270 
helpful for you to see it and above all
you<00:04:24.330> can<00:04:24.449> see<00:04:24.630> again<00:04:24.930> how<00:04:25.259> easy<00:04:25.289> it<00:04:25.860> is<00:04:26.009> to

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
you can see again how easy it is to

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.820 
you can see again how easy it is to
produce<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.789> graded<00:04:27.240> wash<00:04:27.530> here<00:04:28.530> it's

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
produce a graded wash here it's

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.680 
produce a graded wash here it's
lightened<00:04:29.340> off<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.699> almost<00:04:29.970> nothing<00:04:30.449> at<00:04:30.570> the

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
lightened off to almost nothing at the

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.260 
lightened off to almost nothing at the
horizon<00:04:31.289> if<00:04:31.889> I<00:04:32.160> was<00:04:32.310> doing<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.759> again<00:04:33.060> I'd

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
horizon if I was doing it again I'd

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.210 
horizon if I was doing it again I'd
probably<00:04:33.570> do<00:04:33.900> that<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:34.139> little<00:04:34.470> bit<00:04:34.620> darker

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
probably do that a little bit darker

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.469 
probably do that a little bit darker
because<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:35.430> suspect<00:04:35.669> that's<00:04:36.030> going<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.300> dry

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
because I suspect that's going to dry

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.650 
because I suspect that's going to dry
quite<00:04:37.169> light<00:04:37.470> when<00:04:37.680> it's<00:04:37.830> finished<00:04:38.160> but<00:04:39.030> you

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
quite light when it's finished but you

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.140 
quite light when it's finished but you
can<00:04:39.840> see<00:04:40.110> how<00:04:40.620> easy<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:41.099> is<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.460> produce<00:04:41.639> just

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
can see how easy it is to produce just

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.330 
can see how easy it is to produce just
by<00:04:42.300> adding<00:04:42.539> water<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.199> each<00:04:43.440> brush<00:04:43.740> stroke<00:04:43.770> and

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
by adding water to each brush stroke and

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.040 
by adding water to each brush stroke and
then<00:04:44.789> coming<00:04:45.180> down<00:04:45.210> until<00:04:45.750> you're<00:04:45.900> almost

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
then coming down until you're almost

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.810 
then coming down until you're almost
putting<00:04:47.030> Neath<00:04:48.030> water<00:04:48.360> on<00:04:48.750> at<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.110> bottom<00:04:49.820> and

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
putting Neath water on at the bottom and

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.800 
putting Neath water on at the bottom and
there<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.810> graded<00:04:52.259> wash<00:04:53.000> complete<00:04:54.000> with

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
there is the graded wash complete with

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.129 
there is the graded wash complete with
the<00:04:54.990> start<00:04:55.320> of<00:04:55.650> some<00:04:55.949> nice<00:04:56.160> clouds<00:04:56.550> which<00:04:57.419> I'd

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
the start of some nice clouds which I'd

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.740 
the start of some nice clouds which I'd
like<00:04:58.349> to<00:04:58.410> say<00:04:58.770> was<00:04:58.979> deliberate<00:04:59.460> but<00:05:00.060> I<00:05:00.330> can't

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
like to say was deliberate but I can't

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.379 
like to say was deliberate but I can't
take<00:05:00.990> any<00:05:01.229> credit<00:05:01.349> for<00:05:01.740> whatsoever<00:05:02.389> right

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
take any credit for whatsoever right

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.510 
take any credit for whatsoever right
we've<00:05:03.690> now<00:05:03.870> covered<00:05:04.199> the<00:05:04.349> two<00:05:04.620> most<00:05:05.039> basic

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
we've now covered the two most basic

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.700 
we've now covered the two most basic
washes<00:05:05.880> that<00:05:06.060> you<00:05:06.180> need<00:05:06.479> to<00:05:06.840> produce<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.409> sky

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
washes that you need to produce a sky

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.490 
washes that you need to produce a sky
the<00:05:08.400> flat<00:05:08.669> wash<00:05:08.880> and<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.330> graded<00:05:09.750> wash<00:05:09.960> but

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
the flat wash and the graded wash but

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.950 
the flat wash and the graded wash but
before<00:05:10.889> we<00:05:11.039> move<00:05:11.220> on<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.729> other<00:05:12.180> skies<00:05:12.659> I

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
before we move on to other skies I

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.500 
before we move on to other skies I
wanted<00:05:13.560> to<00:05:13.740> just<00:05:13.979> show<00:05:14.250> you<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.520> comparison<00:05:15.030> of

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
wanted to just show you a comparison of

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.089 
wanted to just show you a comparison of
the<00:05:16.430> atmosphere<00:05:17.430> that<00:05:18.030> you<00:05:18.180> can<00:05:18.360> create<00:05:18.750> just

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
the atmosphere that you can create just

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.740 
the atmosphere that you can create just
by<00:05:20.099> the<00:05:20.159> way<00:05:20.340> in<00:05:20.550> which<00:05:20.789> you<00:05:20.940> put<00:05:21.120> paint<00:05:21.449> on<00:05:21.599> the

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
by the way in which you put paint on the

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.439 
by the way in which you put paint on the
paper<00:05:22.400> here's<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:23.610> flat<00:05:23.880> wash<00:05:24.090> that<00:05:24.330> we

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
paper here's the flat wash that we

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.140 
paper here's the flat wash that we
produced<00:05:25.139> earlier<00:05:25.590> and<00:05:26.039> I've<00:05:26.220> added<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:26.729> little

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
produced earlier and I've added a little

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.200 
produced earlier and I've added a little
hint<00:05:27.539> of<00:05:27.780> trees<00:05:28.590> and<00:05:29.099> a<00:05:29.250> bit<00:05:29.490> of<00:05:29.580> a<00:05:29.639> hillside<00:05:29.880> in

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
hint of trees and a bit of a hillside in

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.480 
hint of trees and a bit of a hillside in
the<00:05:30.479> background<00:05:30.960> using<00:05:31.289> a<00:05:31.530> bit<00:05:31.680> of<00:05:31.800> the<00:05:32.070> same

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
the background using a bit of the same

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.969 
the background using a bit of the same
ultramarine<00:05:33.060> blue<00:05:33.090> a<00:05:33.599> little<00:05:34.440> touch<00:05:34.620> of<00:05:34.650> light

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
ultramarine blue a little touch of light

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.879 
ultramarine blue a little touch of light
red<00:05:35.280> and<00:05:35.520> a<00:05:36.389> little<00:05:36.960> slightly<00:05:37.199> strong<00:05:37.560> a<00:05:37.590> touch

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
red and a little slightly strong a touch

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.460 
red and a little slightly strong a touch
of<00:05:38.070> raw<00:05:38.250> Sienna<00:05:38.639> but<00:05:39.150> you<00:05:39.270> can<00:05:39.419> see<00:05:39.720> how<00:05:40.050> it's<00:05:40.320> a

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
of raw Sienna but you can see how it's a

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.820 
of raw Sienna but you can see how it's a
very<00:05:40.500> dark<00:05:41.400> and<00:05:41.699> moody<00:05:42.419> atmosphere<00:05:43.320> in<00:05:43.530> fact

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
very dark and moody atmosphere in fact

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.159 
very dark and moody atmosphere in fact
it's<00:05:44.039> almost<00:05:44.190> a<00:05:44.520> nighttime<00:05:44.820> atmosphere<00:05:45.750> you

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
it's almost a nighttime atmosphere you

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.010 
it's almost a nighttime atmosphere you
can<00:05:46.320> just<00:05:46.530> imagine<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:47.190> last<00:05:47.430> rays<00:05:48.240> of<00:05:48.509> Sun<00:05:48.840> of

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
can just imagine the last rays of Sun of

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.520 
can just imagine the last rays of Sun of
disappear<00:05:49.560> be<00:05:49.770> on<00:05:49.889> behind<00:05:50.460> the<00:05:50.610> hills<00:05:50.820> and<00:05:51.530> the

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
disappear be on behind the hills and the

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.610 
disappear be on behind the hills and the
light<00:05:52.770> is<00:05:53.009> rapidly<00:05:53.490> disappearing<00:05:54.500> with<00:05:55.500> the

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
light is rapidly disappearing with the

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.490 
light is rapidly disappearing with the
graded<00:05:56.039> wash<00:05:56.250> because<00:05:57.120> this<00:05:57.810> lightens<00:05:58.320> off

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
graded wash because this lightens off

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.600 
graded wash because this lightens off
towards<00:05:58.919> the<00:05:59.009> horizon

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
towards the horizon

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.610 
towards the horizon
you've<00:06:00.030> got<00:06:00.210> very<00:06:00.539> obviously<00:06:01.020> a<00:06:01.110> daytime

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
you've got very obviously a daytime

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.149 
you've got very obviously a daytime
scene<00:06:01.979> the<00:06:02.490> same<00:06:02.759> sort<00:06:03.150> of<00:06:03.300> background<00:06:04.159> now

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
scene the same sort of background now

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.730 
scene the same sort of background now
you<00:06:05.220> can<00:06:05.669> see<00:06:05.940> the<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:06.539> touches<00:06:07.110> of<00:06:07.199> light<00:06:07.440> red

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
you can see the the touches of light red

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.560 
you can see the the touches of light red
and<00:06:07.770> ultramarine<00:06:08.460> you<00:06:08.639> certainly<00:06:09.180> see<00:06:09.419> the

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
and ultramarine you certainly see the

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.310 
and ultramarine you certainly see the
touch<00:06:09.810> of<00:06:09.990> raw

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
touch of raw

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.980 
touch of raw
Seanna<00:06:10.740> in<00:06:11.250> the<00:06:11.700> foreground<00:06:12.120> which<00:06:12.570> could<00:06:12.840> be

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
Seanna in the foreground which could be

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.230 
Seanna in the foreground which could be
fields<00:06:13.620> or<00:06:13.770> whatever<00:06:14.040> you<00:06:14.130> want<00:06:14.310> it<00:06:14.430> to<00:06:14.460> be<00:06:14.700> but

fields or whatever you want it to be but

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.480 
fields or whatever you want it to be but
you<00:06:15.360> can<00:06:15.510> see<00:06:15.780> how<00:06:16.020> to<00:06:16.080> much<00:06:16.440> brighter<00:06:16.890> more

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
you can see how to much brighter more

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.390 
you can see how to much brighter more
cheerful<00:06:18.290> daylight<00:06:19.290> atmosphere<00:06:19.950> and<00:06:20.220> perhaps

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
cheerful daylight atmosphere and perhaps

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.210 
cheerful daylight atmosphere and perhaps

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
might be an early morning song with it

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.360 
might be an early morning song with it
with<00:06:23.460> a<00:06:23.490> hint<00:06:23.760> of<00:06:23.880> mist<00:06:24.320> right<00:06:25.320> away<00:06:25.650> just<00:06:25.890> by

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
with a hint of mist right away just by

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.120 
with a hint of mist right away just by
mastering<00:06:27.000> these<00:06:27.180> two<00:06:27.540> basic<00:06:28.020> washes<00:06:28.470> and<00:06:28.650> you

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
mastering these two basic washes and you

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.770 
mastering these two basic washes and you
see<00:06:29.340> how<00:06:29.490> they're<00:06:29.790> not<00:06:29.910> difficult<00:06:30.510> to<00:06:30.600> produce

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
see how they're not difficult to produce

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.440 
see how they're not difficult to produce
how<00:06:31.560> you<00:06:31.620> create<00:06:32.130> a<00:06:32.160> tremendous<00:06:33.150> range

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
how you create a tremendous range

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.520 
how you create a tremendous range
already<00:06:34.010> in<00:06:35.010> just<00:06:35.340> two<00:06:35.670> washes<00:06:36.120> of<00:06:36.530> different

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
already in just two washes of different

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.270 
already in just two washes of different
sorts<00:06:37.830> of<00:06:37.920> sky<00:06:38.720> so<00:06:39.770> let's<00:06:40.770> go<00:06:40.950> and<00:06:41.010> have<00:06:41.070> a<00:06:41.160> look

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
sorts of sky so let's go and have a look

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.830 
sorts of sky so let's go and have a look
