00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.620
 in the hidalgo stadium the 'machine 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.509
 cementera 'comes from a tie in his 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.850
 own house to nothing more and nothing less 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.670
 that the current base America of the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.529
 Mexican team with 10 called the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.539
 mx league standings 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.670
 favoritism based team 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.130
 guillermo vázquez because blue cross is in 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.230
 the fifth box with 24 points in 14 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.180
 matches played near the second 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.790
 place that occupies saints only two points 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.149
 but quite far above the leader 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.680
 the america who has 32 units for 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.110
 find the pachuca we should look at 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.660
 box 13 with only 15 points in the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.820
 league mx to 9 of its rival of turn cross 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.890
 blue and all this thanks to only three 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.989
 wins six draws and five defeats 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.289
 for a bad team season 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.210
 directed by enrique 'ojitos' rock the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.980
 machine has brought good results from 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.809
 visitor in this tournament with three 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.210
 matches won one tied and two 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.000
 lost scoring 10 goals and receiving 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.780
 9 a pretty negative data for the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.030
 pachuca is that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.280
 something gives points to almost everyone who 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.380
 visit the tuzos they have only won one 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.049
 local game losing one and drawing 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.580
 four despite that pachuca clearly not 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.770
 is going through a good moment in the league 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.170
 of mx the recent past of these 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.000
 equipment is quite even since the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.520
 last 10 games between pachuca and cruz 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.440
 blue the Russians have three wins the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.290
 machine left four wins and they have 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.149
 registered three draws the bets not 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.130
 can be more couples in this game 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.140
 between blue cross and pachuca since it is given 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.009
 the same for a win of any of 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.920
 both with a quota of 2.55 or more 155 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.440
 and the draw at 3.20 as 220 line 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.330
 American I thought that Pachuca is not in 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.490
 a good position has weight figures 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.770
 like daniel ludeña the Colombian duvier 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.110
 riascos and the former river plate player 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.940
 fernando cavenaghi however the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.830
 chemistry of the team is far from being the 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.140
 idea the favorite to take out the three 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.030
 points is blue cross but the bet in 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.319
 this case that we will always recommend 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.420
 it's still in favor of blue cross but 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.780
 that the goal mark the bet would be to 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.270
 favor of 12 13 or 14 in favor of cruz 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.010
 blue with a share of 6 or more 500 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.630
 thank you for joining me in this little 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.490

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.590
 favorites and the best free fix of the 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.690
 industry and remember the luck not 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.950
 lends or gives you only pay for the 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.950
 be the refor or the exploit
