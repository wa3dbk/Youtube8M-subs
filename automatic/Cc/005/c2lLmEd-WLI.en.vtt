00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.339
 Last night lead Kassel comes to a new counter husband I take care of 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.310
 I then had one free for everyone on the CES from crash or crash for you 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.500
 I had left Garefrekes with me as the brand and the one too 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.159
 because I'm used for a short time 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.789
 I am not sure about my sight since winter should be the crown 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.679
 have on the 3 and then I'm more uncertain if I had seven 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.680
 Harrier while Mr. Prof holds leadership 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.300
 and the shop org anne-sophie in Fulda at RWE will go on the summit 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.780
 look at 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.700
 Today I thought up the topic what influence do the commentators have 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.360
 here on YouTube people see or generally more English language 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.590
 English-speaking room 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.180
 im on the subscribers 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.710
 I'm not really that 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.260
 I mean, there are people who definitely have more influence 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.140
 fine have more subscribers I've got the quotes only 2500 though 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.660
 and his name indicates his relationship with Krieger at over 14'000 at 4 5 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.550
 Evenings it is definitely not much but if I myself 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.140
 Researchers so determined 2500 people and I want that Lech force 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.660
 So a big thank you to over 2500 subscribers 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.390
 many of them all for themselves so at least not the longest 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.640
 and for even before 20 o'clock come 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.610
 to the influence of us YouTube commentators is in my opinion 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.240
 really very big 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.409
 as a best example, the feeling is not born a worried one 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.400
 and honestly would not have had enough for boys 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.890
 right next door to such a good opponent today 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.770
 the catfish who feels insulted all the time 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.780
 not because they have what weapons indiscriminately song you Buzz Osama Live 8 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.940
 bad plays 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.899
 for his top tips like it has brought me so much 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.619
 Plate full of more important 1 of 1 Kamaz so what about 1 goal 1 Assist only 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.060
 just over 1 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.829
 and that's not really dazzling 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.210
 meanwhile I have almost only threes of kg 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.660
 and of course it's pretty extreme Kraus 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.480
 that helped me a lot very very much, thank you very much again 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.530
 forbidden 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.540
 around it as well the first part that the commentators on one 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.490
 have influence 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.790
 Of course, I also try to influence, that is positive influence 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:10.650
 to take you 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.200
 and give you tips and tricks and if that's the best example of it 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.340
 interactive gambling 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.989
 I'll tell you something about growth from my point of view 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.219
 the best would be 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.610
 and here he would have to make the decision and I have 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.450
 soon a few new features planned 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.760
 and in that respect that's probably why I'm not sure yet how exactly that 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.610
 but it will expire that I can evaluate that or standards still 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.009
 Miles of general feedback 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.430
 It has a few things about it 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.360
 It also promotes subscribers a bit more action all creative 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.740
 is about cramping 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.309
 can help 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.599
 which, in my opinion, is much more important 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.200
 Politis also indirectly for municipalities but more for the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.759
 Seller is just about advertising 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:56.219
 as an example, for example, has stupid 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:00.349
 Jahn steps that through Dülmen knows that they hate it, I think he has 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.759
 the check of the MMX 300 so of the gaming headset which I meanwhile also 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:05.319
 So he did that 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.319
 and very detailed so from quite a long video 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.460
 and I had then also brought in move Heidelberg 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.990
 because of this hard check so I'm on it right now 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.149
 caught on 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.249
 So Jack was one I think I am really very good 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:24.059
 and then soft on booming visit attendance percent was then 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:25.600
 the final point for me 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.419
 where I said to 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.359
 that every recipe will pick 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.189
 and Zig had raised himself and was immediately convinced that is not 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:34.190
 perfect murder » 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.650
 I then did not get into what problems with chemical and painless as of 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.470
 Many Altena would be mine 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.110
 where after two hours of listening to music and listening to it 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.019
 Watching movies while gambling anyway 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.989
 to have lost 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.819
 this is not the case here at all I can hero it yourself 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.079
 that I understandably carry something infinitely long and that I'm bigger with it 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.679
 Problems apply 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.809
 nationwide snare also became a better opponent because SE 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:00.519
 Fresh money just wants me to go 90 ° under how much 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.019
 When turning around company opponents are running 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.660
 of 10 000 points 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.669
 which at that time played a role in influencing opponents 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.039
 at the product Cell Reloader want 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:12.479
 he has someone there product marketing even if they do not 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.989
 important direct advertising for the company but I'll do it again now 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.199
 in Potsdam indirect advertising for the MMX 300 such I say here the weather 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.729
 is good and I really just want to recommend it 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.210
 yet if are pretty and Reuters 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.080
 Years of lawn is as far as currently still very fast from the Gambier 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.699
 seen 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.289
 I have the Harrier with me and I have one in almost all the time 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.919
 One area is held up for July and then to 4 1 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.009
 and I can tell you that the water was already said something but stays in 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.439
 one area unless you see that the whole game is just another 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:46.979
 The area of ​​the card is mostly vacant for all who want it 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.550
 pretty close to each other 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.770
 Predator's amulet was killed 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.219
 for the pretty close range sports also lived what made it 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:55.300
 all around 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.460
 that means then that the act is at the other end 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.639
 and there you should go in the direction of the others 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.740
 That's what the other end of the card is doing 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.719
 since recently the cover appeared 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:06.370
 and I am very happy 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.380
 to league counts and the get-together with a 30 to 3 I've got it for you 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.380
 We'll like Zervos the next time 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:18.080
 Oberneuland have come to a new coming of the World Cup in Qatar 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.080
 I have my free for everyone on the map 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.199
 the Hessen the bet 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.099
 on the 11 bad luck for you 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:27.490
 one of the places 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.729
 more it goes in the direction of Krieger 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.290
 by Max von Kaboom 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.270
 are all but currently 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.099
 actually only call 2500 but and 2005 or if you really want to agree something 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:39.889
 properly mixed by the crisis 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.180
 and many thanks for that 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.920
 and thank you a lot for having a counter Lights from Year of Wall Street

 and who has to have Facebook
