you don't need any form of key in which
to<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.659> out<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.830> door<00:01:17.189> was<00:01:17.610> actually

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
to get out so if the door was actually

that in now when that lock that there is
now<00:01:21.750> dead<00:01:22.049> locked<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.100> would<00:01:23.549> actually

now dead locked so that would actually

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.390 
now dead locked so that would actually
be<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> key<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:25.020> get<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.409> all<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.189> is

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
press the red button and if I press that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.370 
press the red button and if I press that
now<00:01:28.049> click<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:29.390> releases<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.900> use<00:01:31.140> this

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
now click on releases it you use this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.289 
now click on releases it you use this
and<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.070> pull<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> door<00:01:32.640> open<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:33.180> as

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
and you can pull the door open it's as

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.270 
and you can pull the door open it's as
simple<00:01:33.420> as<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.869> okay<00:01:33.930> that's<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.829> principle

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
simple as that okay that's the principle

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.190 
simple as that okay that's the principle
when<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.640> let<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.939> go<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.450> goes<00:01:36.630> back<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
when you let that go it goes back and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.499 
when you let that go it goes back and
then<00:01:37.770> when<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> door<00:01:38.220> closes<00:01:38.729> again<00:01:39.000> that

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
then when the door closes again that

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.420 
then when the door closes again that
gets<00:01:39.750> pushed<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.229> by<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.470> keep<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.040> again

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
gets pushed in by the keep and again

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.999 
gets pushed in by the keep and again
bang<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.570> out<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.960> go<00:01:43.110> that's<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.890> as

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
bang and out you go that's it it's as

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.499 
bang and out you go that's it it's as
simple<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.729> that's<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.329> mechanism

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
simple as that so that's the mechanism

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.859 
simple as that so that's the mechanism
from<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> inside<00:01:46.530> from<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.280> outside<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:48.180> has

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
from the inside from the outside it has

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.170 
from the inside from the outside it has
a<00:01:48.899> key<00:01:49.290> cylinder<00:01:49.680> now<00:01:50.399> one<00:01:50.700> thing<00:01:50.939> she<00:01:51.149> should

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
a key cylinder now one thing she should

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.389 
a key cylinder now one thing she should
have<00:01:51.420> realized<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.770> particular<00:01:53.070> type<00:01:53.369> of

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
have realized this particular type of

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.609 
have realized this particular type of
cylinder<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.180> quite<00:01:54.420> common<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> UK<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
cylinder is quite common in the UK and

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.130 
cylinder is quite common in the UK and
you<00:01:56.070> find<00:01:56.399> those<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.640> Yale<00:01:57.030> type<00:01:57.299> locks<00:01:57.600> etc

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
you find those in Yale type locks etc

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.139 
you find those in Yale type locks etc
alright<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.710> that's<00:01:59.070> quite<00:01:59.219> common<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.670> she

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
alright so that's quite common but she

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.399 
alright so that's quite common but she
said<00:02:00.329> have<00:02:00.450> really<00:02:00.689> thought<00:02:00.869> about<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.350> a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
said have really thought about this a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.289 
said have really thought about this a
little<00:02:01.590> bit<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.009> I've<00:02:02.369> extended<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:03.000> tongue

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
little bit and I've extended this tongue

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.510 
little bit and I've extended this tongue
here<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.320> as<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:05.100> it's

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
here and have you as you can see it's

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.950 
here and have you as you can see it's
much<00:02:05.759> longer<00:02:06.030> than<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.840> would

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
much longer than that that you would

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.690 
much longer than that that you would
traditionally<00:02:07.110> find<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.429> give<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.670> some

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
traditionally find and to give you some

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.510 
traditionally find and to give you some
sort<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.149> idea<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.569> what<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.989> size<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.560> we're

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
sort of idea of what that size is we're

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.250 
sort of idea of what that size is we're
nearly<00:02:11.730> pushing<00:02:12.180> there<00:02:12.360> guys<00:02:12.599> nearly<00:02:12.930> 100

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
nearly pushing there guys nearly 100

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.650 
nearly pushing there guys nearly 100
millimetres<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.310> from<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:14.760> face<00:02:15.030> play<00:02:15.300> here

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
the UK of 44 millimeters so this plenty

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.380 
the UK of 44 millimeters so this plenty
of<00:02:22.379> scope<00:02:22.709> there<00:02:23.069> if<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.610> had<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.790> thicker<00:02:24.090> door

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
of scope there if you had a thicker door

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.000 
of scope there if you had a thicker door
for<00:02:24.629> this<00:02:24.720> particular<00:02:25.050> lot<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.530> be<00:02:25.650> fitted<00:02:25.980> to

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
for this particular lot to be fitted to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.050 
for this particular lot to be fitted to
there's<00:02:26.580> no<00:02:26.700> problem<00:02:27.120> there<00:02:27.270> at<00:02:27.360> all<00:02:29.060> you're

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
there's no problem there at all you're

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.509 
there's no problem there at all you're
also<00:02:30.239> comes<00:02:30.629> with<00:02:30.690> pixels<00:02:31.200> chosen<00:02:31.560> again<00:02:31.860> in

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
also comes with pixels chosen again in

also comes with pixels chosen again in
the<00:02:32.700> bag<00:02:32.849> here<00:02:33.180> as<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.390> can<00:02:33.540> see<00:02:33.750> they've

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
the bag here as you can see they've

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.509 
the bag here as you can see they've
really<00:02:34.379> thought<00:02:34.590> about<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.950> length<00:02:35.129> of<00:02:35.340> those

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
really thought about the length of those

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.400 
really thought about the length of those
as<00:02:35.730> well<00:02:35.879> so<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.660> know<00:02:36.750> there's<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.050> lot<00:02:37.379> of

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
as well so you know there's a lot of

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.259 
as well so you know there's a lot of
functionality<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.190> even<00:02:38.760> though<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:38.970> can

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
functionality and even though you can

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.030 
functionality and even though you can
cut<00:02:39.480> these<00:02:39.629> off<00:02:39.840> then<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.230> suit<00:02:40.440> whatever<00:02:40.739> size

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
cut these off then to suit whatever size

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.350 
cut these off then to suit whatever size
door<00:02:41.340> you've<00:02:41.519> got<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.730> know<00:02:41.849> if<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.060> can<00:02:42.209> see

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
door you've got I know if you can see

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.270 
door you've got I know if you can see
through<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.660> polythene<00:02:42.930> there<00:02:43.260> Li<00:02:43.410> but<00:02:43.620> you

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
through the polythene there Li but you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.619 
through the polythene there Li but you
know<00:02:44.400> that's<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.730> actual<00:02:45.030> fixing<00:02:45.360> screws

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
know that's the actual fixing screws

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.530 
know that's the actual fixing screws
there<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.230> comes<00:02:46.440> with<00:02:46.530> its<00:02:46.620> keep<00:02:46.980> etc<00:02:47.580> it

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
there and it comes with its keep etc it

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.210 
there and it comes with its keep etc it
comes<00:02:48.720> with<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.900> package<00:02:49.230> fixing<00:02:49.800> screws<00:02:50.069> as

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
comes with a package fixing screws as

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.280 
comes with a package fixing screws as
well<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:50.550> that's<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.180> mechanical<00:02:51.840> part<00:02:52.140> of

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
well so that's the mechanical part of

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.080 
well so that's the mechanical part of
the<00:02:52.440> lock<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.400> course<00:02:53.580> these<00:02:53.790> particular

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
the lock and of course these particular

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.670 
the lock and of course these particular
locks<00:02:54.450> now<00:02:54.629> is<00:02:54.780> important<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.260> be<00:02:55.379> aware<00:02:55.410> of

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
locks now is important to be aware of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.490 
locks now is important to be aware of
the<00:02:55.890> work<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.220> 12<00:02:56.519> volt<00:02:56.730> AC<00:02:57.000> not<00:02:57.780> DC<00:02:58.170> there<00:02:58.349> an

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
the work of 12 volt AC not DC there an

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.729 
the work of 12 volt AC not DC there an
AC<00:02:58.860> lock<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.580> um<00:03:00.300> they<00:03:00.989> quite<00:03:01.230> power-hungry

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
AC lock and um they quite power-hungry

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.009 
AC lock and um they quite power-hungry
as<00:03:02.129> well<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:03.150> know<00:03:03.269> if<00:03:03.480> you're<00:03:03.659> looking<00:03:03.780> at

as well so you know if you're looking at

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.360 
as well so you know if you're looking at
Putney's<00:03:04.409> in<00:03:04.560> as<00:03:04.709> an<00:03:04.800> access<00:03:05.159> control

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
look at a separate power supply for this

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.680 
look at a separate power supply for this
particular<00:03:10.409> type<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:10.920> lock<00:03:11.879> they<00:03:12.120> do<00:03:12.300> they<00:03:12.540> do

can as the gay club that's the gate or

the door closes like that this rolls to

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
force that in much more smoothly so

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.000

as you can see there I mean you could

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.290 
as you can see there I mean you could
either<00:04:43.830> run<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.520> cable<00:04:44.850> through<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.120> back

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
either run the cable through the back

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.300 
either run the cable through the back
there<00:04:45.540> but<00:04:45.870> there's<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.200> fixing<00:04:46.650> is<00:04:46.920> with<00:04:47.220> a

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
there but there's the fixing is with a

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.590 
there but there's the fixing is with a
hole<00:04:47.460> there<00:04:47.700> with<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:47.970> cable<00:04:48.300> would<00:04:48.420> go

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
hole there with the cable would go

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.960 
hole there with the cable would go
through<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:49.530> to<00:04:50.040> go<00:04:50.160> into<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.460> actual<00:04:50.700> lock
