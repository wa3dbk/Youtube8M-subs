00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.360
 welcome to have at home my name is 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.080
 frank today we continue doing unboxing 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.700
 views of hardware items today 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.689
 we are seeing a source of the brand 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.890
 center like talking about the erp series or 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:31.640
 home cities that is the series 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.770
 let's say the average efficiency of people is 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.219
 find a brand that is highly valued in the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.350
 market people believe that they are not articles 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.360
 of very good quality when the opposite 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.020
 they are and they are articles that can be 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.910
 find a very good price 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.250
 we can see at the top of the 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.680
 logo 2 again the decent what has 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.000
 changed 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.000
 on the side 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.500
 but the specification in the connectors 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.010
 that will not pay much attention 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.960
 now because we're going to see the wind 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.839
 and we find that it is in this 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.840
 case the nation of 600 watts 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.290
 this source although it does not have a 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:15.790
 80plus certification will deliver us 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.159
 70 percent insured from fatah e 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.680
 declares we find a king 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.399
 stable 12 moss and the first thing that 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.440
 let's open the box is a quick guide 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.440
 together with a series of specifications 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.810
 the cable for the wall and of course 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.390
 percent guarantee 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.590
 and the screws needed to practice 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.590
 our bridge add 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.570
 and now continue let's move on 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.000
 I am opening more in details now the 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.460
 source we are going to find in the part 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.810
 rear and the connector by the current 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.120
 that these two points together with a 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.830
 power instructor plus a center 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.920
 constant since this source is capable of 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.390
 work both in the us and here in 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.540
 Argentina and therefore as 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.580
 select between 220 volts and if they go 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.890
 to say that it is protected against high 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.280
 of high current voltage as well as 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.720
 low of both and with I have these 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.930
 circuits 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.130
 I feel a bad side of the young team like 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.700
 to ensure maximum inspiration 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.700
 within the components of the source and 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:37.440
 It is painted in a matt black color 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.610
 we are in the margin of the series 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.100
 of the fountain along with the gourd 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.540
 and on the other side 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.629
 and on the other side we find 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.950
 All the technical specifications of 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.170
 the fountain 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.599
 from the top we are 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.430
 with a 140-millimeter cooler of the type 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:03.610
 valve ring what will you provide 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.989
 a quieter efficiency and it's 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.480
 it works intelligently this wants 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.319
 say that when the source is with more 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.500
 Charge the funk will accelerate its speed 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.080
 in order to maintain a 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.690
 lowest temperature when exactly 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.860
 the source is under load in the 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.930
 part of front with a condom 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.299
 simply with the flat puddle together 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.480
 with two small vents we are going to 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:32.390
 go now to see what is the connectors 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.640
 in terms of connectors we 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.310
 several months all coated 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.140
 with a nylon mesh that 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.569
 unfortunately badly high density we 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.120
 allows you to see the color of the cables 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.920
 behind 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.450
 but still the cables are what 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.849
 soft enough what it tells us 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.739
 that we are using the quality cable and 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.620
 not from those Chinese cables that 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.769
 once you require the moves a 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.239
 little let's go see to remind them to 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.049
 give then are the connectors less in 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.150
 against 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:05.740
 good yes or yes and we will have the 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.960
 connector at x 24 4 pins 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.170
 to heat our plate is worth after 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.360
 we found a double connector in 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.570
 this case is one of eight and one of 6 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.570
 pins 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.570
 the next harness provides us with three 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.570
 sata connectors 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.630
 we have another harness this connectors 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.150
 molex and a flow connector and the connector 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.980
 flop and it is no longer used for the floppy 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.400
 but if it can be used to give it 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.810
 feeding some kind of sources of 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.030
 pumps for water cooling as well 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.640
 also some two types of accessories 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.180
 as LED strips or lighting for the 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.180
 yard 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.780
 we find another double connector 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:00.610
 molex 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:07.300
 another triple connector to jump 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:12.220
 one more connector that is 44 for the cpu 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:15.280
 this was my unboxing and riu from the source 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.870
 drp 600 more decent I hope you have 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.520
 liked if you want to see more videos like 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.949

 you know something can benefit the 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.979
 type of videos or that you like gaming 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.509
