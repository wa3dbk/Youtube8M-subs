00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
is a concern you can get this

is a concern you can get this

using<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.130> membrane<00:02:36.550> material<00:02:37.000> like<00:02:37.300> this<00:02:38.160> we

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
using a membrane material like this we

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.490 
using a membrane material like this we
do<00:02:39.340> recommend<00:02:39.940> going<00:02:40.270> over<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.810> top<00:02:41.020> of<00:02:41.290> this

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
do recommend going over the top of this

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.280 
do recommend going over the top of this
with<00:02:41.980> our<00:02:42.310> expanded<00:02:43.300> metal<00:02:43.450> laughs<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.110> if

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
with our expanded metal laughs and if

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.170 
with our expanded metal laughs and if
you<00:02:44.470> do<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.890> certainly<00:02:45.790> you're<00:02:45.970> going<00:02:46.120> to

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
you do that certainly you're going to

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.720 
you do that certainly you're going to
puncture<00:02:46.690> through<00:02:46.900> your<00:02:47.620> membrane<00:02:48.160> material

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
puncture through your membrane material

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.640 
puncture through your membrane material
and<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:49.150> what<00:02:49.360> we'll<00:02:49.510> do<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:49.959> we'll<00:02:50.110> take<00:02:50.319> the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
and so what we'll do is we'll take the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.790 
and so what we'll do is we'll take the
screw<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:51.580> apply<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.510> into<00:02:52.989> some<00:02:53.260> latex

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
screw and just apply it into some latex

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.800 
screw and just apply it into some latex
and<00:02:54.040> then<00:02:54.370> screw<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.850> in<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.209> as<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.600> screw

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
and then screw it in so as the screw

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.259 
and then screw it in so as the screw
goes<00:02:56.020> down<00:02:56.230> into<00:02:56.530> your<00:02:56.709> subfloor<00:02:57.100> it<00:02:57.730> in<00:02:57.910> facts

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
goes down into your subfloor it in facts

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.780 
goes down into your subfloor it in facts

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790
