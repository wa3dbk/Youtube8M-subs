00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
well at this point of the factory these

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.150 
well at this point of the factory these
two<00:01:58.550> metal<00:01:59.210> frames<00:01:59.480> are<00:01:59.810> welded<00:02:00.410> together<00:02:00.560> to

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
two metal frames are welded together to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.970 
two metal frames are welded together to
make<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.460> basis<00:02:01.850> of<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.540> bike<00:02:02.720> just<00:02:03.680> need<00:02:03.860> to

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
make the basis of the bike just need to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.220 
make the basis of the bike just need to
add<00:02:04.100> them<00:02:04.310> in<00:02:04.400> like<00:02:04.580> this<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.150> then<00:02:05.870> clamp

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
add them in like this and then clamp

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.590 
add them in like this and then clamp
them<00:02:06.440> down<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.850> I've<00:02:08.000> actually<00:02:08.149> got<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.450> easy

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
them down and I've actually got the easy

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.060 
them down and I've actually got the easy
part<00:02:08.720> because<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.320> for<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.500> buttock<00:02:09.800> machine

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
part because this for a buttock machine

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.880 
part because this for a buttock machine
behind<00:02:10.250> me<00:02:10.580> then<00:02:11.090> welds<00:02:11.480> them<00:02:11.630> together<00:02:11.810> all<00:02:12.620> I

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
behind me then welds them together all I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.650 
behind me then welds them together all I
need<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.220> do<00:02:13.340> now<00:02:13.520> is<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.910> press<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.180> start

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
need to do now is to press the start

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.570 
need to do now is to press the start
button<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.380> robotic<00:02:15.800> arm<00:02:16.010> swings<00:02:16.400> into

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
button and the robotic arm swings into

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:29.399 
button and the robotic arm swings into
motion<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.630> welding<00:02:17.990> begins

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.170 

here<00:02:30.409> frames<00:02:30.799> are<00:02:30.980> made<00:02:31.099> of<00:02:31.220> steel<00:02:31.459> which<00:02:31.909> has

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
here frames are made of steel which has

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.280 
here frames are made of steel which has
its<00:02:32.390> pros<00:02:32.629> and<00:02:32.689> cons<00:02:34.540> steel<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.780> lot<00:02:35.989> heavier

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
its pros and cons steel is a lot heavier

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.589 
its pros and cons steel is a lot heavier
than<00:02:36.650> aluminium<00:02:37.310> which<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:37.849> another<00:02:38.090> material

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
than aluminium which is another material

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.470 
than aluminium which is another material
used<00:02:38.900> for<00:02:39.049> bike<00:02:39.349> making<00:02:40.069> yet<00:02:40.610> feel<00:02:40.909> is<00:02:41.209> the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
used for bike making yet feel is the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.509 
used for bike making yet feel is the
easier<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.900> weld<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.470> repair<00:02:42.829> wherever<00:02:43.400> you

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
easier to weld and repair wherever you

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:53.160 
easier to weld and repair wherever you
are<00:02:43.549> in<00:02:43.939> the<00:02:44.120> country

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.300 

you

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.340 

now<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.370> frame<00:03:00.700> is<00:03:00.880> painted<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.840> it's<00:03:02.110> ready

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
now the frame is painted and it's ready

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.010 
now the frame is painted and it's ready
to<00:03:02.440> put<00:03:02.680> on<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:03.190> conveyor<00:03:03.520> belt<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.780> we<00:03:04.870> can

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
to put on to the conveyor belt so we can

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.060 
to put on to the conveyor belt so we can
start<00:03:06.780> ensemble<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.840> pieces<00:03:08.170> together<00:03:08.320> and

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
start ensemble the pieces together and

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.760 
start ensemble the pieces together and
we'll<00:03:09.250> find<00:03:09.490> out<00:03:09.610> what<00:03:10.090> my<00:03:10.330> design<00:03:10.990> bike<00:03:11.260> will

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
we'll find out what my design bike will

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:25.580
