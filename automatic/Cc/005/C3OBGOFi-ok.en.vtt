street<00:00:17.890> links<00:00:18.130> playsets<00:00:18.760> and<00:00:19.260> as<00:00:20.260> you<00:00:20.380> can<00:00:20.530> see

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
street links playsets and as you can see

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.500 
street links playsets and as you can see
it's<00:00:20.980> an<00:00:21.130> interesting<00:00:21.400> concept<00:00:21.880> as<00:00:22.300> it's

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
it's an interesting concept as it's

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.750 
it's an interesting concept as it's
compatible<00:00:22.900> with<00:00:23.140> Legos<00:00:23.770> that's<00:00:24.490> how<00:00:24.699> the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
compatible with Legos that's how the

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.609 
compatible with Legos that's how the
connections<00:00:25.420> work<00:00:25.660> they're<00:00:25.900> more<00:00:26.080> like<00:00:26.289> LEGO

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
connections work they're more like LEGO

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.029 
connections work they're more like LEGO
pieces<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:28.150> it's<00:00:28.300> an<00:00:28.449> interesting<00:00:29.039> connection

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
pieces so it's an interesting connection

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.939 
pieces so it's an interesting connection
with<00:00:30.460> a<00:00:30.730> city<00:00:31.300> type<00:00:31.600> diecast<00:00:32.349> playset<00:00:32.920> and

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
with a city type diecast playset and

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.990 
with a city type diecast playset and
Legos<00:00:33.550> so<00:00:33.790> let's<00:00:34.150> open<00:00:34.300> it<00:00:34.600> up<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.610> here<00:00:36.880> is

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
a few layout ideas so we'll set up this

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.139 
a few layout ideas so we'll set up this
one<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:51.370> take<00:00:51.640> a<00:00:51.670> look<00:00:51.969> at<00:00:52.120> it<00:00:52.329> now<00:00:54.149> assembling

one and take a look at it now assembling

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.029 
one and take a look at it now assembling
these<00:00:55.329> track<00:00:55.600> pieces<00:00:55.870> is<00:00:56.140> pretty<00:00:56.410> easy<00:00:56.649> we

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
these track pieces is pretty easy we

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.560 
these track pieces is pretty easy we
have<00:00:57.190> these<00:00:57.370> connectors<00:00:57.940> here<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:58.360> you<00:00:58.420> can

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
have these connectors here and you can

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.310 
have these connectors here and you can
see<00:00:58.780> they<00:00:58.930> are<00:00:59.100> Lego<00:01:00.100> ish<00:01:00.910> type<00:01:01.539> of<00:01:01.750> connectors

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
see they are Lego ish type of connectors

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.070 
see they are Lego ish type of connectors
and<00:01:02.969> then<00:01:03.969> on<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.239> track<00:01:04.509> pieces<00:01:04.750> themselves

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
and then on the track pieces themselves

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.260 
and then on the track pieces themselves
you<00:01:05.590> can<00:01:05.710> see<00:01:06.009> that<00:01:06.700> there<00:01:06.910> are<00:01:06.940> little

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
you can see that there are little

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.210 
you can see that there are little
attachments<00:01:07.990> where<00:01:08.170> you<00:01:08.259> could<00:01:08.440> put<00:01:08.619> Legos<00:01:09.039> if

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
attachments where you could put Legos if

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.010 
attachments where you could put Legos if
you<00:01:09.310> wanted<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.850> or<00:01:10.840> other<00:01:11.200> compatible<00:01:11.590> brands

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
you wanted to or other compatible brands

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.480 
you wanted to or other compatible brands
and<00:01:14.020> you<00:01:14.110> just<00:01:14.319> assemble<00:01:14.800> it<00:01:14.860> like<00:01:15.039> that<00:01:17.490> here

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
and you just assemble it like that here

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.580 
and you just assemble it like that here
is<00:01:18.640> one<00:01:18.880> sample<00:01:19.209> layout<00:01:19.660> utilizing<00:01:20.380> all<00:01:20.560> the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
is one sample layout utilizing all the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.499 
is one sample layout utilizing all the
track<00:01:20.979> pieces<00:01:21.429> and<00:01:21.640> as<00:01:21.729> you<00:01:21.849> can<00:01:21.970> see<00:01:22.030> here

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
track pieces and as you can see here

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.350 
track pieces and as you can see here
this<00:01:23.170> layout<00:01:23.590> includes<00:01:24.190> two<00:01:24.459> extra<00:01:24.940> connector

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
this layout includes two extra connector

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.880 
this layout includes two extra connector
pieces<00:01:25.569> so<00:01:25.840> I<00:01:25.869> just<00:01:26.140> attached<00:01:26.500> them<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.770> the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
pieces so I just attached them to the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:35.420 
pieces so I just attached them to the
sides<00:01:27.220> for<00:01:27.490> no<00:01:27.610> reason

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.370 

now<00:01:36.430> about<00:01:36.730> the<00:01:36.940> track<00:01:37.240> it's<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:37.930> little<00:01:38.230> bit

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
now about the track it's a little bit

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.160 
now about the track it's a little bit
flimsy<00:01:38.980> actually<00:01:39.520> these<00:01:39.670> connectors<00:01:40.270> so

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
flimsy actually these connectors so

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.080 
flimsy actually these connectors so
it'll<00:01:41.440> be<00:01:41.560> best<00:01:41.800> if<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.280> play<00:01:42.760> with<00:01:42.940> this

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
it'll be best if you play with this

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.850 
it'll be best if you play with this
stuff<00:01:43.270> on<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:43.630> hard<00:01:43.960> surface<00:01:44.260> rather<00:01:44.680> than

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
stuff on a hard surface rather than

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.610 
stuff on a hard surface rather than
carpet<00:01:45.400> as<00:01:45.520> you<00:01:46.420> may<00:01:46.570> tend<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.930> come<00:01:47.140> loose<00:01:47.380> in

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
carpet as you may tend to come loose in

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.780 
carpet as you may tend to come loose in
spots<00:01:48.040> rather<00:01:48.490> easily<00:01:50.370> but<00:01:51.370> if<00:01:51.490> you're<00:01:51.640> on<00:01:51.760> a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
spots rather easily but if you're on a

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.330 
spots rather easily but if you're on a
hard<00:01:52.090> surface<00:01:52.330> it's<00:01:52.750> not<00:01:52.960> too<00:01:53.229> bad<00:01:53.470> because

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
hard surface it's not too bad because

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.280 
hard surface it's not too bad because
they<00:01:54.640> tend<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.090> stay<00:01:55.300> together<00:01:55.479> fairly<00:01:56.140> well

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
they tend to stay together fairly well

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.990 
they tend to stay together fairly well
as<00:01:56.470> long<00:01:56.800> as<00:01:56.830> they're<00:01:57.100> not<00:01:57.130> messed<00:01:57.580> with<00:01:57.700> you

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
as long as they're not messed with you

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.850 
as long as they're not messed with you
know<00:02:03.300> it's<00:02:04.300> also<00:02:04.540> worthy<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.229> point<00:02:05.500> out<00:02:05.650> that

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
know it's also worthy to point out that

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.800 
know it's also worthy to point out that
the<00:02:06.070> track<00:02:06.340> pieces<00:02:06.820> you<00:02:06.940> can<00:02:07.090> use<00:02:07.270> either<00:02:07.540> way

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
the track pieces you can use either way

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.600 
the track pieces you can use either way
and<00:02:08.050> they<00:02:08.170> have<00:02:08.200> unique<00:02:08.770> designs<00:02:09.220> on<00:02:09.459> each

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
and they have unique designs on each

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.080 
and they have unique designs on each
side<00:02:10.320> which<00:02:11.320> is<00:02:11.500> kind<00:02:11.739> of<00:02:11.830> cool<00:02:12.040> change<00:02:12.790> things

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
side which is kind of cool change things

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.120 
side which is kind of cool change things
up<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.390> little<00:02:13.540> bit<00:02:16.140> now<00:02:17.140> since<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.709> is<00:02:17.770> just

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
up a little bit now since this is just
