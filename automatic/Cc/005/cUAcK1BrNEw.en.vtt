they've got their studs open they've got
their<00:00:20.390> exterior<00:00:20.720> sheathing<00:00:21.230> and<00:00:21.560> they<00:00:21.890> want

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
their exterior sheathing and they want

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.470 
their exterior sheathing and they want
to<00:00:22.130> know<00:00:22.250> whether<00:00:22.490> or<00:00:22.640> not<00:00:22.730> they<00:00:22.940> can<00:00:23.000> install

facing wall to help reduce the heat
coming<00:00:28.760> in<00:00:28.880> and<00:00:29.090> the<00:00:29.480> answer<00:00:29.780> is<00:00:29.930> yes<00:00:30.260> but<00:00:30.650> the

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
coming in and the answer is yes but the

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.010 
coming in and the answer is yes but the
first<00:00:31.010> thing<00:00:31.190> you<00:00:31.250> have<00:00:31.550> to<00:00:31.610> do<00:00:31.940> in<00:00:32.239> order<00:00:32.899> to

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
first thing you have to do in order to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.380 
first thing you have to do in order to
do<00:00:33.199> this<00:00:33.469> is<00:00:33.860> create<00:00:34.250> an<00:00:34.460> airspace<00:00:34.910> you<00:00:35.150> have

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
do this is create an airspace you have

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.540 
do this is create an airspace you have
to<00:00:35.570> have<00:00:35.720> an<00:00:35.840> airspace<00:00:36.350> for<00:00:37.100> a<00:00:37.130> radiant

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
to have an airspace for a radiant

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.090 
to have an airspace for a radiant
barrier<00:00:37.730> to<00:00:38.150> exist<00:00:38.630> normally<00:00:39.560> what<00:00:39.710> happens

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
barrier to exist normally what happens

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.210 
barrier to exist normally what happens
if<00:00:40.220> you<00:00:40.340> stuff<00:00:40.640> this<00:00:41.320> Bay<00:00:42.320> full<00:00:42.620> of<00:00:42.739> insulation

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
if you stuff this Bay full of insulation

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.150 
if you stuff this Bay full of insulation
the<00:00:43.940> exterior<00:00:44.360> sheathing<00:00:44.899> gets<00:00:45.260> hot<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:45.860> it

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
the exterior sheathing gets hot and it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.590 
the exterior sheathing gets hot and it
just<00:00:46.370> travels<00:00:46.880> the<00:00:47.000> heat<00:00:47.180> travels<00:00:47.510> by

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
just travels the heat travels by

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.030 
just travels the heat travels by
conduction<00:00:48.200> all<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.590> way<00:00:48.680> through<00:00:48.890> the

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
conduction all the way through the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.729 
conduction all the way through the
insulation<00:00:49.340> and<00:00:49.880> into<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.570> house<00:00:50.750> when<00:00:51.620> you

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
insulation and into the house when you

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.500 
insulation and into the house when you
create<00:00:52.130> this<00:00:52.309> airspace<00:00:52.880> and<00:00:53.120> you<00:00:53.210> put<00:00:53.390> the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
create this airspace and you put the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.540 
create this airspace and you put the
radiant<00:00:53.870> barrier<00:00:53.899> foil<00:00:54.440> right<00:00:54.710> there<00:00:54.920> what's

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
radiant barrier foil right there what's

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.220 
radiant barrier foil right there what's
going<00:00:55.730> to<00:00:55.760> happen<00:00:56.149> is<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.390> exterior<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:57.050> going

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
going to happen is the exterior is going

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.139 
going to happen is the exterior is going
to<00:00:57.290> get<00:00:57.410> hot<00:00:57.590> it's<00:00:58.280> going<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.520> want<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.790> conduct

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
to get hot it's going to want to conduct

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.240 
to get hot it's going to want to conduct
a<00:00:59.360> cross<00:00:59.629> but<00:00:59.930> when<00:01:00.290> it<00:01:00.410> hits<00:01:00.530> this<00:01:00.710> airspace

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
a cross but when it hits this airspace

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.580 
a cross but when it hits this airspace
in<00:01:01.489> order<00:01:02.270> to<00:01:02.360> get<00:01:02.480> across<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:02.750> airspace<00:01:03.230> it

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
in order to get across that airspace it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.770 
in order to get across that airspace it
mostly<00:01:03.829> has<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.100> convert<00:01:04.579> to<00:01:04.820> radiant<00:01:05.329> and

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
mostly has to convert to radiant and

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.599 
mostly has to convert to radiant and
once<00:01:06.020> heat<00:01:06.319> is<00:01:06.499> in<00:01:06.619> a<00:01:06.709> radiant<00:01:07.130> form<00:01:07.429> it's

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:07.609 
once heat is in a radiant form it's

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:09.429 
once heat is in a radiant form it's
great<00:01:07.939> because<00:01:08.149> we<00:01:08.450> own<00:01:08.600> it<00:01:08.810> we<00:01:08.959> can<00:01:09.409> just

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
great because we own it we can just

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.889 
great because we own it we can just
reflect<00:01:10.009> it<00:01:10.189> back<00:01:10.219> what<00:01:11.119> that<00:01:11.299> does<00:01:11.509> is<00:01:11.719> keep

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
reflect it back what that does is keep

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.870 
reflect it back what that does is keep
the<00:01:12.049> insulation<00:01:12.439> right<00:01:12.920> here<00:01:13.189> cooler<00:01:13.670> and

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
the insulation right here cooler and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.410 
the insulation right here cooler and
that<00:01:14.359> drives<00:01:14.749> less<00:01:15.170> heat<00:01:15.560> into<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.189> home<00:01:16.520> so

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
that drives less heat into the home so

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.510 
that drives less heat into the home so
the<00:01:18.049> insulation<00:01:18.649> is<00:01:18.770> more<00:01:19.009> effective

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
the insulation is more effective

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.069 
the insulation is more effective
basically<00:01:20.090> it's<00:01:20.209> almost<00:01:20.359> like<00:01:20.600> adding<00:01:20.929> more

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
basically it's almost like adding more

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.590 
basically it's almost like adding more
insulation<00:01:21.619> is<00:01:21.950> then<00:01:22.459> that<00:01:22.579> effect<00:01:22.939> now<00:01:23.509> if

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
insulation is then that effect now if

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.059 
insulation is then that effect now if
you're<00:01:23.749> doing<00:01:23.929> a<00:01:24.020> remodel<00:01:24.319> and<00:01:24.560> you<00:01:24.619> really

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
you're doing a remodel and you really

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:26.649 
you're doing a remodel and you really
want<00:01:25.249> to<00:01:25.369> do<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:26.119> way<00:01:26.149> you<00:01:26.270> do<00:01:26.450> is<00:01:26.539> you're

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
want to do it the way you do is you're

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.599 
want to do it the way you do is you're
going<00:01:26.749> to<00:01:26.840> put<00:01:26.990> some<00:01:27.109> foam<00:01:27.350> strips<00:01:27.709> in<00:01:27.920> then

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
going to put some foam strips in then

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.660 
going to put some foam strips in then
you're<00:01:28.759> going<00:01:28.939> to<00:01:29.389> staple<00:01:30.380> your<00:01:30.590> foil<00:01:30.950> up<00:01:31.219> so

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
you're going to staple your foil up so

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.760 
you're going to staple your foil up so
the<00:01:31.789> foil<00:01:32.029> is<00:01:32.179> going<00:01:32.329> to<00:01:32.420> go<00:01:33.249> basically<00:01:35.770> right

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
the foil is going to go basically right

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.289 
the foil is going to go basically right
up<00:01:36.889> against<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.279> wall<00:01:37.399> either<00:01:37.639> 1/2<00:01:37.880> inch<00:01:38.149> or

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
up against the wall either 1/2 inch or

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.109 
up against the wall either 1/2 inch or
3/4<00:01:38.779> inch<00:01:39.009> foam<00:01:40.009> boards<00:01:40.369> you<00:01:40.490> just<00:01:40.639> staple<00:01:40.999> in

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
3/4 inch foam boards you just staple in

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.179 
3/4 inch foam boards you just staple in
there<00:01:41.270> pull<00:01:41.539> it<00:01:41.630> across<00:01:41.689> staple<00:01:42.380> on<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.619> other

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
there pull it across staple on the other

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.239 
there pull it across staple on the other
side<00:01:43.490> put<00:01:44.450> your<00:01:44.479> bad<00:01:44.749> insulation<00:01:45.439> in<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:45.799> then

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:46.249 
side put your bad insulation in and then

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:47.980 
side put your bad insulation in and then
this<00:01:46.369> is<00:01:46.549> an<00:01:46.700> optional<00:01:47.119> layer<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:47.569> is<00:01:47.749> 1/2

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
this is an optional layer this is 1/2

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.589 
this is an optional layer this is 1/2
inch<00:01:48.289> blue<00:01:48.590> board<00:01:48.859> or<00:01:49.099> foam<00:01:49.700> board<00:01:49.939> blue<00:01:50.270> pink

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:50.599 
inch blue board or foam board blue pink

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.419 
inch blue board or foam board blue pink
you<00:01:50.689> don't<00:01:50.869> really<00:01:50.959> matter<00:01:51.200> but<00:01:51.889> what<00:01:52.069> it<00:01:52.189> does

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
you don't really matter but what it does

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.989 
you don't really matter but what it does
is<00:01:52.759> it<00:01:53.240> gives<00:01:53.389> more<00:01:53.840> r-value<00:01:54.529> to<00:01:54.709> the<00:01:54.799> wall<00:01:55.039> but

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
is it gives more r-value to the wall but

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.289 
is it gives more r-value to the wall but
it<00:01:56.149> also<00:01:56.299> makes<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.990> wall<00:01:57.139> airtight<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.299> it

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
it also makes the wall airtight and it

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.550 
it also makes the wall airtight and it
reduces<00:01:59.630> what's<00:01:59.840> called<00:02:00.049> thermal<00:02:00.380> bypass

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
reduces what's called thermal bypass

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.409 
reduces what's called thermal bypass
basically<00:02:01.340> this<00:02:01.459> is<00:02:01.609> heat<00:02:01.849> coming<00:02:02.179> through

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:02.419 
basically this is heat coming through

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:04.690 
basically this is heat coming through
the<00:02:02.569> stud<00:02:02.929> that<00:02:03.560> would<00:02:03.709> go<00:02:03.889> into<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:04.520> house

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
the stud that would go into the house

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.819 
the stud that would go into the house
it's<00:02:04.969> kind<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.149> putting<00:02:05.359> a<00:02:05.479> jacket<00:02:05.810> on<00:02:06.169> that

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
it's kind of putting a jacket on that

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.339 
it's kind of putting a jacket on that
wall<00:02:07.099> and<00:02:07.369> then<00:02:07.909> ultimately<00:02:08.090> drywall<00:02:09.080> or

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
wall and then ultimately drywall or

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.440 
wall and then ultimately drywall or
sheetrock<00:02:09.890> so<00:02:10.490> coming<00:02:10.820> from<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:10.970> outside<00:02:11.300> in

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
sheetrock so coming from the outside in

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.880 
sheetrock so coming from the outside in
you've<00:02:11.660> got<00:02:11.690> your<00:02:12.050> exterior<00:02:12.650> sheathing

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
you've got your exterior sheathing

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.370 
you've got your exterior sheathing
you've<00:02:13.670> got<00:02:13.820> your<00:02:14.000> airspace<00:02:14.480> made<00:02:14.930> up<00:02:15.080> by<00:02:15.200> you

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
you've got your airspace made up by you

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.470 
you've got your airspace made up by you
Foam<00:02:15.620> furring<00:02:16.160> strips<00:02:16.700> you've<00:02:17.120> got<00:02:17.300> your

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
Foam furring strips you've got your

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.770 
Foam furring strips you've got your
insulation<00:02:18.400> optional<00:02:19.400> foam<00:02:19.640> board<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.150> then

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
insulation optional foam board and then

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.600 
insulation optional foam board and then
sheetrock<00:02:21.350> now<00:02:21.740> if<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:21.950> do<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.220> foam<00:02:22.400> board

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
sheetrock now if you do the foam board

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.920 
sheetrock now if you do the foam board
in<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.850> sheetrock<00:02:23.090> one<00:02:23.420> thing<00:02:23.570> you<00:02:23.690> want<00:02:23.870> to

in the sheetrock one thing you want to

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.260 
in the sheetrock one thing you want to
do<00:02:24.110> is<00:02:24.350> offset<00:02:25.160> all<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.430> pieces<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.030> don't

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
do is offset all the pieces so you don't

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.840 
do is offset all the pieces so you don't
have<00:02:26.420> two<00:02:26.690> seams<00:02:27.080> on<00:02:27.380> one<00:02:28.100> location<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.670> don't
