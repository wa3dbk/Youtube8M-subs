that tells us if the difference is

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.500 
that tells us if the difference is
working<00:00:38.500> and<00:00:38.650> here's<00:00:39.340> where<00:00:39.610> you<00:00:40.000> get<00:00:40.270> your

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
have iron wars in the system and this is

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.540 
have iron wars in the system and this is
where<00:00:48.850> we<00:00:49.030> place<00:00:49.450> it<00:00:49.480> and<00:00:50.010> same<00:00:51.010> for<00:00:51.040> this<00:00:51.280> but

for cool so this tells us if we have
called<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.720> system<00:00:56.490> so<00:00:57.490> now<00:00:57.670> i'm<00:00:57.760> going<00:00:57.820> to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
called the system so now i'm going to

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.400 
called the system so now i'm going to
show<00:00:58.150> you<00:00:58.180> how<00:00:58.600> it's<00:00:58.840> working

so as you can see this in the car for

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.289 
so as you can see this in the car for
our<00:01:26.700> core<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> card<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.740> disco

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
our core and this is a card for disco

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.510 
our core and this is a card for disco
goes<00:01:30.299> into<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.750> hopper<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.920> put<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.250> for

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
goes into this hopper to put this for

this so the iron ore came first to fill
the<00:01:37.680> first<00:01:38.070> lap<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.789> then<00:01:39.270> equals<00:01:39.750> after<00:01:40.530> to

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189

when so this others try to get the iron

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.330 
when so this others try to get the iron
horde<00:02:20.840> over<00:02:21.230> here<00:02:21.470> but<00:02:21.709> it's<00:02:21.890> not<00:02:22.099> able

horde over here but it's not able

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.360 
horde over here but it's not able
because<00:02:23.620> there's<00:02:24.620> no<00:02:24.739> more<00:02:25.099> clicks<00:02:25.550> in<00:02:25.670> the

because there's no more clicks in the
upper<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.330> density<00:02:27.690> one<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:29.129> gonna<00:02:29.370> be

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
upper so density one on this gonna be

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.640 
upper so density one on this gonna be
cooked<00:02:29.760> can<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.540> go<00:02:30.690> here<00:02:30.989> there's<00:02:31.500> nothing

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
cooked can I go here there's nothing

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.289 
cooked can I go here there's nothing
here<00:02:32.519> it's<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.330> take<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.659> iron<00:02:33.900> good

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
here it's going to take the iron good

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.350 
here it's going to take the iron good
then<00:02:36.470> because<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.709> dirt<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.790> will<00:02:39.120> count

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
then because of this dirt it will count

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.270 
then because of this dirt it will count
22<00:02:40.670> dirt<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.940> sin<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.599> sign<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.379> to<00:02:43.560> this

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.190 

mesum<00:02:47.060> comparator<00:02:47.709> like<00:02:48.709> this<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.520> then<00:02:50.200> the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
mesum comparator like this and then the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.110 
mesum comparator like this and then the
cars<00:02:51.560> gonna<00:02:51.709> take<00:02:52.069> it<00:02:52.819> cut<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:55.610> put<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.910> in<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
cars gonna take it cut and put it in the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.220 
cars gonna take it cut and put it in the
chest<00:02:56.560> as<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.620> saw<00:02:57.860> out<00:02:57.980> there<00:02:58.750> guys<00:02:59.750> start

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
chest as you saw out there guys start

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.960 
chest as you saw out there guys start
again<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.540> as<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.290> can<00:03:03.440> see<00:03:03.470> how<00:03:04.040> we<00:03:04.100> feel

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
again and as you can see how we feel

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.960 
again and as you can see how we feel
them<00:03:05.890> so<00:03:06.890> this<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.250> reason<00:03:07.400> why<00:03:07.550> I'm

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
them so this is the reason why I'm

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.920 
them so this is the reason why I'm
listen<00:03:08.450> one<00:03:09.020> kool<00:03:09.560> i'm<00:03:10.130> at<00:03:10.520> a<00:03:10.580> time<00:03:10.880> so<00:03:11.690> this

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
listen one kool i'm at a time so this

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.059 
listen one kool i'm at a time so this
cool<00:03:12.230> there's<00:03:12.950> always<00:03:13.160> one<00:03:13.489> calling<00:03:13.910> here<00:03:14.390> and

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
cool there's always one calling here and

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.430 
cool there's always one calling here and
all<00:03:16.069> my<00:03:16.310> coat<00:03:16.580> is<00:03:16.850> in<00:03:16.910> this<00:03:17.300> upper<00:03:17.989> over<00:03:18.200> here

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
all my coat is in this upper over here

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.470 
all my coat is in this upper over here
so<00:03:18.950> it's<00:03:19.040> going<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.310> put<00:03:20.000> on<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.239> cool

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
so it's going to put on a cool

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.210 
so it's going to put on a cool
indifference<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.230> then<00:03:21.380> take<00:03:21.620> another<00:03:21.800> one

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
indifference and then take another one

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.820 
indifference and then take another one
and<00:03:23.230> 30<00:03:24.230> times<00:03:24.470> its<00:03:24.590> going<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.830> do<00:03:24.890> this<00:03:25.390> and

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
and 30 times its going to do this and

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.630 
and 30 times its going to do this and
also<00:03:27.830> over<00:03:28.280> here<00:03:28.550> i<00:03:28.730> have<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.330> third<00:03:29.600> so<00:03:30.640> when

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
also over here i have to third so when

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.949 
also over here i have to third so when
there's<00:03:31.940> one<00:03:32.330> code<00:03:32.950> 21<00:03:33.950> blocks<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.450> where<00:03:35.930> i

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
there's one code 21 blocks and where i

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.120 
there's one code 21 blocks and where i
get<00:03:36.140> too<00:03:36.410> cold<00:03:36.670> 22<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:37.970> this<00:03:38.950> comparator<00:03:39.950> is

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
get too cold 22 and this comparator is

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.790 
get too cold 22 and this comparator is
going<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.430> turn<00:03:40.910> on<00:03:41.150> so<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.989> system<00:03:42.319> go<00:03:42.590> on

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
going to turn on so the system go on

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.800 
going to turn on so the system go on
because<00:03:43.069> i<00:03:43.250> have<00:03:43.459> not<00:03:44.019> enough<00:03:45.019> cold<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:47.420> this

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
because i have not enough cold so this

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.990 
because i have not enough cold so this
is<00:03:47.840> how<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.140> know<00:03:48.319> if<00:03:48.739> I<00:03:48.950> have<00:03:49.069> enough<00:03:49.280> cool<00:03:49.760> or

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
is how I know if I have enough cool or

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.650 
is how I know if I have enough cool or
not<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:50.920> here<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:52.850> a<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:54.590> same<00:03:54.920> thing<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.660> have

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
not and here is a the same thing I have

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.720 
not and here is a the same thing I have
the<00:03:57.079> iron<00:03:57.739> ores<00:03:58.489> chest<00:03:58.910> it's<00:03:59.720> going<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.140> these

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
the iron ores chest it's going to these

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.220 
the iron ores chest it's going to these
uppers<00:04:01.730> into<00:04:02.239> here<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:02.890> this<00:04:03.890> is<00:04:03.980> on<00:04:04.190> because

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
uppers into here and this is on because

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.920 
uppers into here and this is on because
with<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.410> dirt<00:04:06.590> if<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.519> have<00:04:07.670> exactly<00:04:08.660> eight

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
with the dirt if I have exactly eight

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.550 
with the dirt if I have exactly eight
iron<00:04:09.290> ore<00:04:09.560> this<00:04:10.130> is<00:04:10.220> gonna<00:04:10.370> go<00:04:10.640> on<00:04:10.820> and

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
iron ore this is gonna go on and

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.870 
iron ore this is gonna go on and
this<00:04:12.890> is<00:04:13.010> a<00:04:13.040> wire<00:04:13.310> I<00:04:13.489> start<00:04:13.849> the<00:04:14.360> whole<00:04:14.480> system

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
this is a wire I start the whole system

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.319 
this is a wire I start the whole system
I'm<00:04:16.880> over<00:04:17.389> here<00:04:17.570> I've<00:04:17.840> another<00:04:18.290> word<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:19.329> make

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
I'm over here I've another word to make

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.950 
I'm over here I've another word to make
this<00:04:21.019> nut<00:04:21.440> nut<00:04:22.430> bugging<00:04:22.960> because<00:04:25.090> so<00:04:26.090> can<00:04:26.720> see

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
this nut nut bugging because so can see

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.820 
this nut nut bugging because so can see
it

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.870 

because<00:04:30.750> if<00:04:31.750> I<00:04:32.110> run<00:04:32.380> out<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.770> iron<00:04:33.310> ore<00:04:33.520> ore

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
because if I run out of iron ore ore

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.070 
because if I run out of iron ore ore
coal<00:04:34.450> and<00:04:34.960> then<00:04:35.500> place<00:04:35.770> it<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:37.540> book

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
coal and then place it to book

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.650 
coal and then place it to book
everything<00:04:38.590> so<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:38.830> had<00:04:39.010> to<00:04:39.040> do<00:04:39.340> other<00:04:39.700> logic

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
everything so I had to do other logic

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.100 
everything so I had to do other logic
over<00:04:41.170> here<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.980> make<00:04:42.160> all<00:04:42.790> this<00:04:43.540> work<00:04:43.780> properly

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
over here to make all this work properly

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.750 
over here to make all this work properly
in<00:04:44.860> every<00:04:45.460> situation<00:04:45.930> so<00:04:46.930> it<00:04:47.710> works<00:04:48.040> low<00:04:48.520> Bei

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
in every situation so it works low Bei

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.920 
in every situation so it works low Bei
do<00:04:49.570> this<00:04:49.750> more<00:04:50.050> compact<00:04:50.430> but<00:04:51.430> yeah<00:04:51.930> that's

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
do this more compact but yeah that's

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.240 
do this more compact but yeah that's
pretty<00:04:53.920> much<00:04:54.100> all<00:04:54.340> about

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.860 

to<00:04:59.250> finish<00:04:59.430> this<00:04:59.610> video<00:04:59.760> i<00:05:00.030> just<00:05:00.060> want<00:05:00.389> to<00:05:00.449> show

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
you the things i used in this creature

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.670 
you the things i used in this creature
so<00:05:06.720> first<00:05:07.229> what<00:05:07.560> i<00:05:07.620> told<00:05:07.949> you<00:05:08.100> is<00:05:09.350> as<00:05:10.350> you<00:05:10.530> can

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
so first what i told you is as you can

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:18.200 
so first what i told you is as you can
see<00:05:10.979> over<00:05:11.880> here<00:05:12.080> if<00:05:13.080> i<00:05:13.380> get<00:05:13.790> 90<00:05:14.790> got<00:05:16.699> an<00:05:17.699> 8<00:05:18.000> think

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
see over here if i get 90 got an 8 think

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.290 
see over here if i get 90 got an 8 think
that<00:05:18.360> it's<00:05:18.930> gonna<00:05:19.020> turn<00:05:19.290> on<00:05:19.530> so<00:05:20.430> if<00:05:20.580> i<00:05:20.699> take<00:05:20.850> one

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
that it's gonna turn on so if i take one

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.580 
that it's gonna turn on so if i take one
yes<00:05:22.340> you<00:05:23.340> can<00:05:23.520> see<00:05:23.820> so<00:05:24.630> this<00:05:24.840> is<00:05:24.870> what<00:05:25.139> i<00:05:25.169> made

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
yes you can see so this is what i made

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.320 
yes you can see so this is what i made
for<00:05:26.210> this<00:05:27.210> actually<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:27.840> iron<00:05:28.050> ore<00:05:29.000> over<00:05:30.000> here

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
for this actually the iron ore over here

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.770 
for this actually the iron ore over here
but<00:05:31.139> you<00:05:31.320> haven't<00:05:31.560> third<00:05:32.130> entry<00:05:32.760> mortar<00:05:33.210> so<00:05:34.110> 40

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
but you haven't third entry mortar so 40

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:44.500 
but you haven't third entry mortar so 40
and<00:05:36.020> I<00:05:38.500> just<00:05:39.500> took<00:05:39.920> one<00:05:40.250> this<00:05:41.350> for<00:05:43.210> this<00:05:44.210> part

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
and I just took one this for this part

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.030 
and I just took one this for this part
right<00:05:44.570> here<00:05:44.720> and<00:05:46.510> yeah<00:05:47.510> that's<00:05:47.840> hard<00:05:48.620> to<00:05:48.830> take
