00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.660
 good afternoon channel viewers without cracks 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.200
 home today I want to make a video review 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.599
 coal pump which was discussed on 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.520
 Channel Forum 10 years on the hill site b03 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.609
 then acquired such a unit here it is 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.939
 worth me mean here right here in my 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.730
 jar of 2 liters of wheat vodka decided it 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.010
 from coal Vat I want to do so 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.420
 the party from the coals of the park left and 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.940
 a tasting better became worse 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.520
 does that mean I run water through it 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.620
 the usual so easy to check u was water 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:47.370
 very black he will see how now 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:51.739
 the pump will behave after the water 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.260
 it means the construction is very simple bed 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.449
 I immediately ordered this pump cartridge with 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.480
 stainless steel there you can buy plastic 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.049
 I have a lot of coal so I decided that 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.600
 coal will change itself means this hose 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:16.070
 water supply is already a return hose and so 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.070
 turn on look so the process has started 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:28.910
 Yes, in principle, the water is water is accurate 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:32.170
 the boat goes very often I spend such not 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.600
 very pleasant but everyone sees that 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:41.020
 pretty clean goes that is 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.020
 then filtering will be very fast 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.280
 the vibration of course is the only thing that i 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.230
 noticed the disadvantage of this pump 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.620
 manufacturer gives very short hoses 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:02.690
 of course I would like a little bit of length 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:05.150
 and so very well one works 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:11.000
 such cottages cries enough liters 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:13.580
 35 product your jar these seven liters 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.030
 vodka obtained from filtered and think 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.950
 change but definitely coal must either 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.440
 blowing dust because no 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.750
 the load does not carry less then 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.290
 clogged up the finished product because 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.730
 filtering the internet is very difficult 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.390
 here by the way I have before this the fact that I 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.390
 calibrated through the same pump here 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.270
 You see, that is so very perky 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.300
 literally everything is filtered in five minutes 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.790
 already glass here 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.590
 that is coal this cotton filter nobody 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.790
 did not cancel after all because 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.100
 the smallest particle remains but I am so 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.440
 I think here fifteen minutes he is all 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.640
 This bank drives 1 5 through itself 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.730
 have a general 10 hours to withstand a 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.520
 since katrich is here full deepen 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:12.110
 straight forward but in principle i think 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:15.380
 cleans up should not bad as I said 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.860
 earlier that I leave a little bit literally 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.170
 liters of milliliters 800 vodka no 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.210
 and then spend even when tasting 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.250
 I will settle for it that is not cleaned 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.250
 cleaned it stayed coming 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.700
 this is our short review 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.820

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.630
