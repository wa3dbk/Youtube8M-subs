working<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.979> staining<00:01:47.460> your<00:01:47.850> skin<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
working in and staining your skin a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.260 
working in and staining your skin a
little<00:01:48.630> bit<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.820> intensely

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
little bit because it is so intensely

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.090 
little bit because it is so intensely
colored<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.990> then<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.530> texture<00:01:52.950> that's

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
colored and then it's a texture that's

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.340 
colored and then it's a texture that's
not<00:01:53.310> super<00:01:53.759> dry<00:01:54.000> almost<00:01:54.420> reminds<00:01:54.899> me<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
not super dry almost reminds me of the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.530 
not super dry almost reminds me of the
kind<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.680> effect<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.189> get<00:01:56.430> from<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.149> stain

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
kind of effect I get from the in stain

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.840 
kind of effect I get from the in stain
blushes<00:01:58.140> from<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.530> balm<00:01:58.770> because<00:01:59.549> they're

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
blushes from the balm because they're

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.580

and I've seen pictures I've seen videos

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.910 
and I've seen pictures I've seen videos
where<00:02:40.580> people<00:02:41.090> with<00:02:41.600> fair<00:02:42.020> or<00:02:42.320> pretty<00:02:42.620> light

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
where people with fair or pretty light

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.070 
where people with fair or pretty light
skin<00:02:43.430> have<00:02:43.790> this<00:02:43.970> blush<00:02:44.300> on<00:02:44.570> and<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.870> looks

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
really really nice and fresh on my skin

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.090 
really really nice and fresh on my skin
it'll<00:02:47.600> still<00:02:47.960> show<00:02:47.990> up<00:02:48.260> but<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:48.650> just<00:02:48.680> tend<00:02:49.040> to

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
it'll still show up but I just tend to

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.920 
it'll still show up but I just tend to
gravitate<00:02:49.310> toward<00:02:49.940> those<00:02:50.120> colors<00:02:50.600> that<00:02:50.630> are<00:02:50.900> a

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
gravitate toward those colors that are a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.740 
gravitate toward those colors that are a
little<00:02:51.200> more<00:02:51.470> vibrant<00:02:51.770> on<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.340> skin<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:53.330> think

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
little more vibrant on the skin I think

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.930 
little more vibrant on the skin I think
they<00:02:53.930> just<00:02:53.960> give<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.470> little<00:02:54.920> more<00:02:55.250> look<00:02:55.730> of

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
they just give a little more look of

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.120 
they just give a little more look of
health<00:02:56.240> to<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.630> face<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:57.170> know<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.320> love<00:02:57.770> just

health to the face you know I love just

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.890 
health to the face you know I love just
having<00:02:58.400> that<00:02:58.640> feeling<00:02:58.910> as<00:02:59.180> soon<00:02:59.210> as<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.570> apply<00:02:59.870> a

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
having that feeling as soon as I apply a

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.420 
having that feeling as soon as I apply a
blush<00:03:00.230> like<00:03:00.500> oh<00:03:00.680> okay

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
blush like oh okay

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.370 
blush like oh okay
there's<00:03:01.850> my<00:03:02.150> skin<00:03:02.480> back<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:02.960> know<00:03:03.080> there's

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380

there's my skin back you know there's
that<00:03:03.620> glow<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.070> was<00:03:04.340> kind<00:03:04.520> of<00:03:04.550> looking<00:03:04.760> pick<00:03:05.360> of

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
that glow I was kind of looking pick of

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.870 
that glow I was kind of looking pick of
the<00:03:05.570> litter<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.870> guess<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.410> this<00:03:06.620> one<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:07.160> just

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
the litter I guess is this one I just

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.330 
the litter I guess is this one I just
think<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.330> shade<00:03:08.630> life's<00:03:09.020> a<00:03:09.170> cherry<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:10.130> is

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
think the shade life's a cherry this is

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.180 
think the shade life's a cherry this is
such<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.940> pretty<00:03:11.390> color<00:03:11.690> um<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.500> little<00:03:12.950> goes<00:03:13.160> a

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
such a pretty color um a little goes a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.000 
such a pretty color um a little goes a
long<00:03:13.370> way<00:03:13.880> you<00:03:14.150> know<00:03:14.360> it's<00:03:14.570> pigmented<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.440> it

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
long way you know it's pigmented and it

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.980 
long way you know it's pigmented and it
is<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.490> know<00:03:16.610> just<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.910> bright<00:03:17.210> tone<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:17.870> they

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
is you know just a bright tone that they

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.750 
is you know just a bright tone that they
chose<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.410> put<00:03:18.590> in<00:03:18.710> here<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.070> I<00:03:19.460> think<00:03:19.670> it

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
chose to put in here and I think it

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.550 
chose to put in here and I think it
gives<00:03:19.940> such<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.210> nice<00:03:20.480> like<00:03:20.750> kind<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:20.960> a<00:03:21.080> rosy

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
gives such a nice like kind of a rosy

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.310 
gives such a nice like kind of a rosy
flush<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.550> the<00:03:22.580> cheeks<00:03:22.670> it's<00:03:23.270> really<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.990> kind

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
the way into deeper skin tones could get

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.600 
the way into deeper skin tones could get
into<00:03:47.840> this<00:03:47.990> but<00:03:48.470> even<00:03:48.680> lighter<00:03:48.920> skin<00:03:49.340> tones

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610

great<00:04:27.130> thing<00:04:27.400> going<00:04:27.430> with<00:04:27.850> this<00:04:28.210> silky<00:04:28.750> touch

Pink's<00:04:35.710> some<00:04:36.250> corals<00:04:36.820> you<00:04:37.240> know<00:04:37.360> there's<00:04:37.630> so

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
Pink's some corals you know there's so

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.620 
Pink's some corals you know there's so
many<00:04:38.290> fun<00:04:38.710> colors<00:04:39.250> that<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.610> could<00:04:39.880> give<00:04:40.420> you

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
many fun colors that you could give you

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.990

know this kind of intensity too and I
think<00:04:43.240> people<00:04:43.420> would<00:04:43.750> just<00:04:43.900> be<00:04:44.050> all<00:04:44.260> over<00:04:44.830> it

think people would just be all over it

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.610 
think people would just be all over it
