hello<00:00:00.900> and<00:00:00.930> welcome<00:00:01.410> everybody<00:00:01.890> today<00:00:02.879> I'm

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
hello and welcome everybody today I'm

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.450 
hello and welcome everybody today I'm
going<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.389> be<00:00:03.480> showcasing<00:00:04.170> off<00:00:04.500> my<00:00:04.920> latest

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
going to be showcasing off my latest

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.370 
going to be showcasing off my latest
creation<00:00:06.080> this<00:00:07.080> is<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:08.809> transforming<00:00:09.809> station

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
creation this is a transforming station

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.320 
creation this is a transforming station
we're<00:00:11.130> going<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.309> call<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:12.059> looks

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
we're going to call it that it looks

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.490 
we're going to call it that it looks
more<00:00:12.570> like<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.870> spaceship<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.950> be<00:00:14.009> honest<00:00:14.370> but

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
more like a spaceship to be honest but

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.010 
more like a spaceship to be honest but
whatever<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:18.060> something<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:18.750> I

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
whatever it is this is something that I

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.759 
whatever it is this is something that I
think<00:00:19.170> might<00:00:19.650> be<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> first<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:21.080> have<00:00:22.080> here<00:00:22.710> a

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
think might be a first I have here a

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.390 
think might be a first I have here a
lone<00:00:23.250> piece<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.730> copper<00:00:24.060> cabling<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.189> if<00:00:26.189> we

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
lone piece of copper cabling and if we

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.810 
lone piece of copper cabling and if we
get<00:00:26.730> an<00:00:26.820> ET<00:00:27.300> measurement<00:00:30.170> 32768<00:00:31.170> EU<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> tea<00:00:32.340> or

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
get an ET measurement 32768 EU a tea or

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.440 
get an ET measurement 32768 EU a tea or
a<00:00:33.270> tick<00:00:33.690> over<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.489> so<00:00:35.489> yeah<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.000> thing<00:00:36.239> is

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
a tick over it so yeah this thing is

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.940 
a tick over it so yeah this thing is
insane<00:00:37.399> amount<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.550> power<00:00:39.320> this<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.500> courtesy

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
insane amount of power this is courtesy

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.819 
insane amount of power this is courtesy
of<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.219> fusion<00:00:41.850> reactor<00:00:42.420> over<00:00:43.410> here<00:00:43.649> from

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
of the fusion reactor over here from

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.000 
of the fusion reactor over here from
Greg<00:00:44.160> tech<00:00:44.960> basically<00:00:45.960> think<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> nuclear

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
Greg tech basically think of the nuclear

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.040 
Greg tech basically think of the nuclear
reactor<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.820> steroids<00:00:49.340> as<00:00:50.600> you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.690> see<00:00:51.899> it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
reactor on steroids as you can see it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.439 
reactor on steroids as you can see it
produces<00:00:52.469> some<00:00:52.620> really<00:00:53.399> insane<00:00:53.730> numbers<00:00:54.149> here

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
produces some really insane numbers here

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.900 
produces some really insane numbers here
and<00:00:54.660> that's<00:00:54.930> because<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:56.039> fusion<00:00:56.520> reactor

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
and that's because the fusion reactor

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.020 
and that's because the fusion reactor
puts<00:00:57.270> out<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.870> insane<00:00:58.530> 1<00:00:59.010> million<00:01:00.109> EU<00:01:01.109> packet

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
puts out and insane 1 million EU packet

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.539 
puts out and insane 1 million EU packet
doesn't<00:01:03.030> put<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.210> out<00:01:03.329> too<00:01:03.539> often<00:01:04.010> every<00:01:05.010> so

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
doesn't put it out too often every so

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.380 
doesn't put it out too often every so
many<00:01:05.610> tix<00:01:06.470> but<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.830> puts<00:01:08.220> out<00:01:08.369> packet<00:01:08.909> sizes<00:01:09.090> of

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
many tix but it puts out packet sizes of

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.160 
many tix but it puts out packet sizes of
1<00:01:09.840> million<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.150> averages<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.049> can

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
1 million you but it averages as you can

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.830 
1 million you but it averages as you can
see<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:13.619> under<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> recipe<00:01:15.770> 32768<00:01:17.689> and<00:01:18.689> that

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
see here under the recipe 32768 and that

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.539 
see here under the recipe 32768 and that
was<00:01:19.080> exactly<00:01:19.290> how<00:01:19.710> much<00:01:19.799> power<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.310> were

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
was exactly how much power we were

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.149 
was exactly how much power we were
getting<00:01:20.850> through<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.119> copper<00:01:21.450> cable<00:01:22.159> so

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
getting through that copper cable so

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.670 
getting through that copper cable so
basically<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.180> entire<00:01:24.570> transformer<00:01:25.320> setup

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
basically this entire transformer setup

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.249 
basically this entire transformer setup
is<00:01:25.890> designed<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> convert<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.030> amount<00:01:28.020> of

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
is designed to convert the amount of

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.420 
is designed to convert the amount of
power<00:01:28.590> which<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.250> from<00:01:29.549> 1<00:01:29.880> million<00:01:30.390> right<00:01:30.659> here

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
power which is from 1 million right here

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.499 
power which is from 1 million right here
into<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:33.110> 32<00:01:34.110> packet<00:01:34.680> over<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.790> it

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
into a 32 packet over here and it

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.460 
into a 32 packet over here and it
produces<00:01:37.520> what<00:01:38.520> was<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:39.770> 1028<00:01:41.329> packets<00:01:42.470> yeah

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
produces what was it 1028 packets yeah

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.670 
produces what was it 1028 packets yeah
it's<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.490> lot<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.360> what<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
it's a lot so what we have here is the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.840 
it's a lot so what we have here is the
standard<00:01:47.100> setup<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.820> 42<00:01:48.810> 42<00:01:49.049> 44<00:01:49.710> ratio<00:01:50.220> now

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
standard setup of 42 42 44 ratio now

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.090 
standard setup of 42 42 44 ratio now
what<00:01:51.030> do<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.180> mean<00:01:51.390> by<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.600> 42<00:01:52.020> 42<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.530> ratio<00:01:52.950> I

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
what do I mean by a 42 42 for ratio I

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.370 
what do I mean by a 42 42 for ratio I
mean<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.180> takes<00:01:54.360> four<00:01:54.780> times<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
mean that it takes four times the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.170 
mean that it takes four times the
transformers<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.189> convert<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> next

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
transformers to convert to the next

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.450 
transformers to convert to the next
level<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.439> we're<00:01:58.590> converting<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.070> million

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
level so here we're converting a million

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.850 
level so here we're converting a million
pulse<00:01:59.729> via<00:02:00.000> superconductors<00:02:00.930> into<00:02:01.350> four

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
pulse via superconductors into four

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.590 
pulse via superconductors into four
separate<00:02:03.140> 8192<00:02:04.140> pulses<00:02:05.270> this<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.479> very

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
separate 8192 pulses this is very

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.359 
separate 8192 pulses this is very
convenient<00:02:07.320> for<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.619> math<00:02:07.799> because<00:02:08.069> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
convenient for the math because the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.760 
convenient for the math because the
high-voltage<00:02:08.729> transformer<00:02:09.179> converts<00:02:10.080> those

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
high-voltage transformer converts those

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.210 
high-voltage transformer converts those
pulses<00:02:11.099> into<00:02:12.050> 512<00:02:13.050> pulses<00:02:13.560> but<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.830> makes

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
pulses into 512 pulses but it makes

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.220 
pulses into 512 pulses but it makes
four<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.520> them<00:02:14.640> each<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:15.720> can<00:02:15.840> convert<00:02:16.020> up

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
four of them each so it can convert up

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.620 
four of them each so it can convert up
to<00:02:16.350> 2,000<00:02:17.220> per<00:02:17.370> pulse<00:02:17.640> medium<00:02:18.510> voltage

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
to 2,000 per pulse medium voltage

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.470 
to 2,000 per pulse medium voltage
converters<00:02:19.260> low<00:02:19.440> voltage<00:02:19.800> converts<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:21.060> what

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
converters low voltage converts so what

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.980 
converters low voltage converts so what
I<00:02:21.510> mean<00:02:21.630> by<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.870> 424<00:02:22.410> ratio<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.280> takes<00:02:23.490> for

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
I mean by the 424 ratio is it takes for

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.900 
I mean by the 424 ratio is it takes for
superconductors<00:02:24.990> for<00:02:25.770> high<00:02:26.310> voltage<00:02:26.670> for

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
superconductors for high voltage for

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.090 
superconductors for high voltage for
medium<00:02:27.180> voltage<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.750> for<00:02:28.050> look<00:02:28.230> however<00:02:28.920> that

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
medium voltage and for look however that

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
you should never do this the only reason

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.820 
you should never do this the only reason
to<00:02:48.240> have<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.570> much<00:02:48.750> power<00:02:48.990> is<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.470> be<00:02:49.560> running

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
to have this much power is to be running

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.680 
to have this much power is to be running
a<00:02:50.010> trick<00:02:50.280> directly<00:02:50.760> into<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.060> mass<00:02:51.330> fabricator

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
a trick directly into a mass fabricator

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.610 
a trick directly into a mass fabricator
and<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:53.100> could<00:02:53.280> put<00:02:53.490> this<00:02:53.640> mass<00:02:53.850> fabricator

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
and you could put this mass fabricator

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.440 
and you could put this mass fabricator
right<00:02:55.620> after<00:02:55.830> these<00:02:56.130> super<00:02:56.640> condensers<00:02:57.180> and

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
right after these super condensers and

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.630 
right after these super condensers and
it<00:02:57.990> would<00:02:58.110> be<00:02:58.140> perfectly<00:02:58.709> fine<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.280> line<00:02:59.459> if

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
it would be perfectly fine in line if

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.240 
it would be perfectly fine in line if
you<00:02:59.760> just<00:02:59.970> set<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.209> right<00:03:00.330> here<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.920> that

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
you just set it right here and that

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.120 
you just set it right here and that
would<00:03:02.459> save<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:03.290> god<00:03:04.290> only<00:03:04.530> knows<00:03:04.830> how<00:03:05.010> much

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
would save you god only knows how much

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.820 
would save you god only knows how much

and I really not going to tutorial on
this<00:03:16.560> no<00:03:17.430> one<00:03:17.700> should<00:03:17.880> ever<00:03:17.940> repeat<00:03:18.630> this

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
this no one should ever repeat this

this no one should ever repeat this

madness it works it's completely a

hundred percent lossless power which by

hundred percent lossless power which by

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
the way was insanely hard to achieve

the way was insanely hard to achieve
matter<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.290> fact<00:03:28.410> I've<00:03:28.709> redone<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.310> wiring<00:03:29.790> on

matter of fact I've redone the wiring on

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.580 
matter of fact I've redone the wiring on
this<00:03:30.060> thing<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.239> many<00:03:30.570> times<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.380> just

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
this thing so many times and I just

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.290 
this thing so many times and I just
could<00:03:31.769> not<00:03:31.950> get<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.280> get<00:03:32.489> lossless<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.150> was

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
could not get it to get lossless I was

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.740 
could not get it to get lossless I was
losing<00:03:33.510> 300e<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.709> for<00:03:35.459> some<00:03:35.700> reason<00:03:35.730> here<00:03:36.630> in

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
losing 300e you for some reason here in

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.630 
losing 300e you for some reason here in
this<00:03:37.140> guy<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.769> could<00:03:37.950> not<00:03:38.070> figure<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.489> out

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
this guy and I could not figure it out

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.990 
this guy and I could not figure it out
at<00:03:38.910> all<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.330> oddly<00:03:40.019> enough<00:03:40.530> what<00:03:41.190> fixed<00:03:41.850> it

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
at all and oddly enough what fixed it

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.170 
at all and oddly enough what fixed it
was<00:03:42.630> when<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.019> tried<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.500> remove<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:44.100> fifth<00:03:44.670> super

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
was when I tried to remove a fifth super

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.270 
was when I tried to remove a fifth super
condenser<00:03:45.600> I<00:03:45.630> had<00:03:45.870> put<00:03:46.110> over<00:03:46.260> here<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.739> put<00:03:47.160> it

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
condenser I had put over here I put it

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.890 
condenser I had put over here I put it
there<00:03:47.310> just<00:03:47.640> so<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:47.850> could<00:03:47.970> be<00:03:48.150> absolute<00:03:48.630> sure

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
there just so I could be absolute sure

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.720 
there just so I could be absolute sure
that<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.620> wasn't<00:03:49.799> this<00:03:50.160> thing<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.580> was

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
that it wasn't this thing that was

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.970 
that it wasn't this thing that was
costing<00:03:51.180> me<00:03:51.360> power<00:03:51.620> not<00:03:52.620> being<00:03:52.799> able<00:03:52.860> to

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
costing me power not being able to

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.830 
costing me power not being able to
transform<00:03:53.549> enough<00:03:53.850> packets<00:03:54.330> I<00:03:54.390> was<00:03:54.510> thinking

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
transform enough packets I was thinking

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.960 
transform enough packets I was thinking
maybe<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:55.110> million<00:03:55.500> EU<00:03:56.160> didn't<00:03:56.549> get<00:03:56.670> broken

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
maybe a million EU didn't get broken

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.390 
maybe a million EU didn't get broken
down<00:03:57.120> into<00:03:57.830> five<00:03:59.239> 8192<00:04:00.239> packets<00:04:01.019> evenly<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:02.370> i

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
down into five 8192 packets evenly so i

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.009 
down into five 8192 packets evenly so i
put<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.790> fifth<00:04:03.090> one<00:04:03.299> just<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.660> make<00:04:03.780> sure<00:04:03.810> it

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
put a fifth one just to make sure it

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.470 
put a fifth one just to make sure it
could<00:04:04.140> catch<00:04:04.320> any<00:04:04.530> straggling<00:04:05.100> EU<00:04:05.610> however

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
could catch any straggling EU however

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.590 
could catch any straggling EU however
when<00:04:07.200> i<00:04:07.230> went<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.530> remove<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.910> this<00:04:09.420> whole

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
when i went to remove it that this whole

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.350 
when i went to remove it that this whole
thing<00:04:09.630> blew<00:04:10.019> up<00:04:11.030> basically<00:04:12.030> i<00:04:12.060> lost

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
thing blew up basically i lost

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.830 
thing blew up basically i lost
everything<00:04:12.660> from<00:04:13.320> here<00:04:13.860> down<00:04:14.370> here<00:04:14.430> up<00:04:15.420> to

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
everything from here down here up to

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.210 
everything from here down here up to
here<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.320> i<00:04:16.410> took<00:04:16.470> out<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:16.830> couple<00:04:17.070> of

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
here and i took out a couple of

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.219 
here and i took out a couple of
transformers<00:04:17.910> down<00:04:18.060> here<00:04:18.330> thankfully<00:04:19.109> it

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
transformers down here thankfully it

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.469 
transformers down here thankfully it
didn't<00:04:19.470> take<00:04:19.590> out<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.919> rest<00:04:20.130> of<00:04:20.280> my<00:04:20.430> stuff<00:04:20.640> but

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
didn't take out the rest of my stuff but

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.080 
didn't take out the rest of my stuff but
it<00:04:21.600> left<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:21.930> nice<00:04:22.080> little<00:04:22.410> crater<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.130> so<00:04:23.729> when

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
it left a nice little crater and so when

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.420 
it left a nice little crater and so when
I<00:04:24.120> redid<00:04:24.539> this<00:04:24.690> wiring<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.530> put<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.160> super

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
I redid this wiring and put the super

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.740 
I redid this wiring and put the super
condensers<00:04:26.910> back

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
condensers back

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.550 
condensers back
it<00:04:27.900> managed<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.590> work<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:29.160> so<00:04:30.120> now<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.230> is<00:04:31.350> one

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
it managed to work and so now it is one

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.110 
it managed to work and so now it is one
hundred<00:04:31.650> percent<00:04:31.830> lossless<00:04:32.610> which<00:04:32.790> is<00:04:32.910> neat

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
hundred percent lossless which is neat

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.620 
hundred percent lossless which is neat
that<00:04:33.330> these<00:04:33.510> things<00:04:33.810> don't<00:04:34.530> lose<00:04:34.770> any<00:04:35.010> energy

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
that these things don't lose any energy

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.180 
that these things don't lose any energy
that's<00:04:36.630> a<00:04:36.720> very<00:04:36.930> neat<00:04:37.170> feature<00:04:37.410> considering

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
that's a very neat feature considering

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.070 
that's a very neat feature considering
how<00:04:38.310> expensive<00:04:38.820> those<00:04:39.210> super<00:04:39.570> conductive

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
how expensive those super conductive

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.950 
how expensive those super conductive
wires<00:04:40.110> are<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:41.130> mean<00:04:41.490> my<00:04:42.150> god<00:04:42.390> these<00:04:42.690> things

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
wires are I mean my god these things

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.820 
wires are I mean my god these things
require<00:04:43.220> so<00:04:44.220> much<00:04:44.580> it's<00:04:45.300> not<00:04:45.510> even<00:04:45.630> funny<00:04:45.870> so

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
require so much it's not even funny so

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.490 
require so much it's not even funny so
they<00:04:46.950> should<00:04:47.160> be<00:04:47.190> lossless<00:04:47.960> but<00:04:48.960> yeah<00:04:49.110> this<00:04:49.350> is

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
they should be lossless but yeah this is

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.680 
they should be lossless but yeah this is
a<00:04:49.530> one<00:04:49.860> hundred<00:04:50.130> percent<00:04:50.160> lossless<00:04:51.000> system<00:04:51.510> to

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
a one hundred percent lossless system to

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.060 
a one hundred percent lossless system to
convert<00:04:52.050> down<00:04:52.350> to<00:04:52.560> 32<00:04:52.890> EU<00:04:53.370> a<00:04:53.720> tick<00:04:54.720> or<00:04:54.930> a<00:04:55.260> packet

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
convert down to 32 EU a tick or a packet

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.190 
convert down to 32 EU a tick or a packet
i<00:04:56.160> should<00:04:56.310> say<00:04:56.580> which<00:04:57.210> works<00:04:57.450> on<00:04:57.600> copper<00:04:57.990> wire

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
i should say which works on copper wire

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.620 
i should say which works on copper wire
and<00:04:58.500> which<00:04:59.040> by<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.490> way<00:04:59.580> the<00:05:00.180> reason<00:05:00.450> why<00:05:00.570> this

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
and which by the way the reason why this

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.060 
and which by the way the reason why this
whole<00:05:00.990> thing<00:05:01.230> isn't<00:05:01.500> made<00:05:01.590> of<00:05:01.710> coppers

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
whole thing isn't made of coppers

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.190 
whole thing isn't made of coppers
because<00:05:02.280> I<00:05:02.340> would<00:05:02.460> lose<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:02.940> much<00:05:03.090> EU<00:05:03.690> over<00:05:04.080> the

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
because I would lose so much EU over the

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.230 
because I would lose so much EU over the
distance<00:05:04.590> of<00:05:04.740> this<00:05:04.919> so<00:05:05.610> I<00:05:05.640> just<00:05:06.000> stuck<00:05:06.180> a

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
distance of this so I just stuck a

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.300 
distance of this so I just stuck a
copper<00:05:06.690> cable<00:05:07.050> here<00:05:07.230> at<00:05:07.350> the<00:05:07.470> very<00:05:07.650> end<00:05:07.890> which

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
copper cable here at the very end which

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.510 
copper cable here at the very end which
ironically<00:05:08.730> enough<00:05:09.320> you<00:05:10.320> can<00:05:10.500> mix<00:05:10.740> wire<00:05:11.160> types

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
ironically enough you can mix wire types

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.370 
ironically enough you can mix wire types
like<00:05:11.760> that<00:05:12.030> and<00:05:12.270> you<00:05:12.360> can<00:05:12.510> actually<00:05:12.660> avoid<00:05:13.110> the

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
like that and you can actually avoid the

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.909 
like that and you can actually avoid the
EU<00:05:13.800> loss<00:05:14.180> you<00:05:15.180> can't<00:05:15.450> cheat<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:16.020> too<00:05:16.169> though<00:05:16.320> it

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
EU loss you can't cheat it too though it

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.460 
EU loss you can't cheat it too though it
will<00:05:17.190> keep<00:05:17.460> track<00:05:17.820> of<00:05:17.850> in<00:05:18.210> memory<00:05:18.630> how<00:05:19.080> much<00:05:19.290> of

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
will keep track of in memory how much of

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.100 
will keep track of in memory how much of
an<00:05:19.590> EU<00:05:20.130> how<00:05:20.790> much<00:05:20.970> or<00:05:21.240> how<00:05:21.330> many<00:05:21.510> more<00:05:21.810> blocks

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
an EU how much or how many more blocks

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.570 
an EU how much or how many more blocks
it<00:05:22.320> should<00:05:22.530> be<00:05:22.620> able<00:05:22.680> to<00:05:22.830> travel<00:05:23.070> before<00:05:23.310> it

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
it should be able to travel before it

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.140 
it should be able to travel before it
loses<00:05:24.080> an<00:05:25.080> EU<00:05:25.590> and<00:05:25.890> it<00:05:26.370> seems<00:05:26.550> to<00:05:26.640> convert<00:05:27.030> it

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
loses an EU and it seems to convert it

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.880 
loses an EU and it seems to convert it
pretty<00:05:27.360> well<00:05:27.540> so<00:05:27.810> you<00:05:27.870> really<00:05:28.200> can't<00:05:28.440> cheat<00:05:28.770> it

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
pretty well so you really can't cheat it

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.150 
pretty well so you really can't cheat it
by<00:05:29.040> like<00:05:29.250> mixing<00:05:29.730> wire<00:05:30.060> types<00:05:30.390> in<00:05:30.600> a<00:05:30.690> row<00:05:30.840> I<00:05:31.770> did

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
by like mixing wire types in a row I did

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.730 
by like mixing wire types in a row I did
try<00:05:32.490> testing<00:05:32.790> that<00:05:33.060> before<00:05:33.419> this<00:05:33.570> but<00:05:34.050> it

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
try testing that before this but it

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.920 
try testing that before this but it
basically<00:05:34.890> lets<00:05:35.370> me<00:05:35.580> run<00:05:35.790> glass<00:05:36.090> fiber<00:05:36.450> cable

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
basically lets me run glass fiber cable

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.710 
basically lets me run glass fiber cable
which<00:05:37.169> won't<00:05:37.560> lose<00:05:37.770> EU<00:05:38.220> and<00:05:38.460> then<00:05:39.150> put<00:05:39.600> it

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
which won't lose EU and then put it

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.469 
which won't lose EU and then put it
right<00:05:39.930> here<00:05:39.990> at<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.919> very<00:05:41.190> end<00:05:41.400> just<00:05:41.669> as<00:05:41.880> proof

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
right here at the very end just as proof

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.310 
right here at the very end just as proof
that<00:05:42.840> it's<00:05:43.050> 32<00:05:43.620> e<00:05:43.650> you<00:05:43.890> a<00:05:43.919> packet<00:05:44.780> since<00:05:45.780> copper

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
that it's 32 e you a packet since copper

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.450 
that it's 32 e you a packet since copper
since<00:05:46.830> glass<00:05:47.190> fiber<00:05:47.430> can<00:05:47.640> take<00:05:47.790> up<00:05:47.940> to<00:05:47.970> 512<00:05:49.460> but

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
since glass fiber can take up to 512 but

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.840 
since glass fiber can take up to 512 but
yeah<00:05:50.669> this<00:05:51.540> is<00:05:51.780> a<00:05:51.810> crazy<00:05:52.229> contraption<00:05:53.010> I<00:05:53.190> try

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
yeah this is a crazy contraption I try

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.310 
yeah this is a crazy contraption I try
to<00:05:53.880> get<00:05:54.060> a<00:05:54.090> little<00:05:54.150> fancy<00:05:54.810> with<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:55.050> wiring

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
to get a little fancy with the wiring

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.730 
to get a little fancy with the wiring
early<00:05:55.860> on<00:05:56.330> but<00:05:57.330> I<00:05:57.390> quickly<00:05:57.660> gave<00:05:58.110> up<00:05:58.350> trying<00:05:58.590> to

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
early on but I quickly gave up trying to

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.550 
early on but I quickly gave up trying to
be<00:05:58.890> fancy<00:05:59.220> because<00:06:00.060> it<00:06:00.540> just<00:06:00.870> was<00:06:01.080> too<00:06:01.110> many

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
be fancy because it just was too many

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.270 
be fancy because it just was too many
lawyers<00:06:01.890> so<00:06:02.820> I<00:06:02.850> just<00:06:03.090> got<00:06:03.210> utilità

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
lawyers so I just got utilità

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.440 
lawyers so I just got utilità
utilitarian<00:06:05.280> at<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.550> end<00:06:05.729> and<00:06:05.940> just<00:06:05.970> made<00:06:06.330> it

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
utilitarian at the end and just made it

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.840 
utilitarian at the end and just made it
very<00:06:07.010> very<00:06:09.080> efficient<00:06:10.080> wiring<00:06:10.850> very

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
very very efficient wiring very

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.830 
very very efficient wiring very
mechanical<00:06:12.950> but<00:06:13.950> yeah<00:06:14.130> this<00:06:14.430> is<00:06:14.490> my<00:06:15.000> crazy

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
mechanical but yeah this is my crazy

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.060 
mechanical but yeah this is my crazy
design<00:06:16.350> to<00:06:16.590> make<00:06:16.950> a<00:06:17.990> amazingly<00:06:18.990> overpowered<00:06:19.830> a

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
design to make a amazingly overpowered a

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.360 
design to make a amazingly overpowered a
32<00:06:20.580> EU<00:06:20.940> packet<00:06:21.419> line<00:06:21.710> so<00:06:22.710> yeah<00:06:22.830> I<00:06:22.890> hope<00:06:22.979> you<00:06:23.340> all

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
32 EU packet line so yeah I hope you all

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.030 
32 EU packet line so yeah I hope you all
enjoyed<00:06:23.850> this<00:06:24.150> little<00:06:24.330> showcase<00:06:24.990> I<00:06:25.350> will<00:06:25.860> not
