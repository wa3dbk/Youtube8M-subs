well<00:00:06.189> here's<00:00:06.370> the<00:00:06.519> start<00:00:06.790> of<00:00:06.910> my<00:00:07.060> solar<00:00:07.330> hot

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:07.600 
well here's the start of my solar hot

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.709 
well here's the start of my solar hot
water<00:00:07.660> heater<00:00:08.230> project<00:00:08.889> I<00:00:09.240> finally<00:00:10.240> acquired

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 
water heater project I finally acquired

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.180 
water heater project I finally acquired
a<00:00:10.990> hot<00:00:11.170> water<00:00:11.410> heater<00:00:13.380> which<00:00:14.380> in<00:00:14.530> my<00:00:14.679> case<00:00:14.710> was

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
a hot water heater which in my case was

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.150 
a hot water heater which in my case was
very<00:00:15.429> hard<00:00:15.759> to<00:00:15.820> find<00:00:16.500> but<00:00:17.500> I<00:00:17.619> finally<00:00:17.860> found

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
very hard to find but I finally found

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.880 
very hard to find but I finally found
one<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:22.480> is<00:00:22.539> the<00:00:22.689> beginning<00:00:22.930> we'll<00:00:23.650> see

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
one so this is the beginning we'll see

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:34.740 
one so this is the beginning we'll see
exactly<00:00:24.220> how<00:00:24.580> this<00:00:24.820> works

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.240 

all<00:00:35.750> right<00:00:35.900> well<00:00:36.080> I've<00:00:36.230> got<00:00:36.410> my<00:00:36.530> tank<00:00:36.800> stripped

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
all right well I've got my tank stripped

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.190 
all right well I've got my tank stripped
all<00:00:37.460> off<00:00:37.760> all<00:00:38.720> the<00:00:39.140> outer<00:00:39.290> shell<00:00:39.620> stripped<00:00:40.340> off

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
all off all the outer shell stripped off

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.590 
all off all the outer shell stripped off
got<00:00:42.200> it<00:00:42.290> all<00:00:42.410> sanded<00:00:42.739> down<00:00:43.360> got<00:00:44.360> it<00:00:44.480> all

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
got it all sanded down got it all

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.000 
got it all sanded down got it all
painted<00:00:47.110> haven't<00:00:48.110> checked<00:00:48.320> for<00:00:48.500> leaks<00:00:48.650> yet

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
painted haven't checked for leaks yet

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.430 
painted haven't checked for leaks yet
but<00:00:49.450> I'll<00:00:50.450> do<00:00:50.660> that<00:00:50.720> I<00:00:50.930> probably<00:00:51.200> should<00:00:51.410> have

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
but I'll do that I probably should have

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.760 
but I'll do that I probably should have
done<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:51.680> for<00:00:51.920> a<00:00:51.980> painted<00:00:52.400> but<00:00:52.610> oh<00:00:52.820> well

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
done that for a painted but oh well

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.860 
done that for a painted but oh well
anyway<00:00:54.770> but<00:00:55.040> there's<00:00:55.190> my<00:00:55.370> tank<00:00:55.700> it's<00:00:56.360> ready<00:00:56.690> to

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
anyway but there's my tank it's ready to

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.030 
anyway but there's my tank it's ready to
go<00:01:01.059> and<00:01:02.059> I've<00:01:02.629> just<00:01:02.930> now<00:01:03.230> starting<00:01:03.800> on<00:01:03.860> the

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
go and I've just now starting on the

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.460 
go and I've just now starting on the
frame<00:01:04.339> for<00:01:04.820> it<00:01:07.660> started<00:01:08.660> cutting<00:01:08.810> some<00:01:09.080> spare

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
frame for it started cutting some spare

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.100 
frame for it started cutting some spare
two-by-fours<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:10.310> I<00:01:10.400> had<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:10.820> then<00:01:10.940> ran<00:01:11.930> out

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
two-by-fours that I had and then ran out

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.540 
two-by-fours that I had and then ran out
so<00:01:12.680> I<00:01:12.710> have<00:01:13.009> to<00:01:13.130> go<00:01:13.220> get<00:01:13.340> some<00:01:13.490> more

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
so I have to go get some more

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.870 
so I have to go get some more
two-by-fours<00:01:14.149> and<00:01:14.420> stuff<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:15.520> that's<00:01:16.520> where

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
two-by-fours and stuff and that's where

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.320 
two-by-fours and stuff and that's where
I'm<00:01:17.060> at<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:17.390> far<00:01:18.170> on<00:01:18.830> my<00:01:18.940> solar<00:01:19.940> hot<00:01:20.270> water

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
I'm at so far on my solar hot water

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.719 
I'm at so far on my solar hot water
heater<00:01:20.750> project

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.160 

all<00:01:24.329> right<00:01:24.750> well<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.170> far<00:01:25.380> here's<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> base<00:01:27.170> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
all right well so far here's the base to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.969 
all right well so far here's the base to
the<00:01:28.289> box<00:01:28.549> here's<00:01:29.549> where<00:01:29.700> I've<00:01:29.820> gotten<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.299> far

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
the box here's where I've gotten so far

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.529 
the box here's where I've gotten so far
went<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.070> got<00:01:32.189> some<00:01:32.429> two<00:01:32.850> by<00:01:33.000> fours<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.509> just

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
went you got some two by fours and just

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.580 
went you got some two by fours and just
made<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> basic<00:01:34.200> frame<00:01:34.820> four<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.969> half<00:01:36.590> feet

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
made a basic frame four and a half feet

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.800 
made a basic frame four and a half feet
by<00:01:38.070> two<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> half<00:01:38.640> feet<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.179> you<00:01:39.509> got<00:01:39.659> two

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
by two and a half feet and you got two

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.410 
by two and a half feet and you got two
Center<00:01:40.110> supports<00:01:40.289> in<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.740> middle<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.759> that's

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
Center supports in the middle so that's

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.690 
Center supports in the middle so that's
where<00:01:42.569> I'm<00:01:42.659> at<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:42.840> far<00:01:44.929> that's<00:01:45.929> the<00:01:46.200> base<00:01:49.700> all

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
where I'm at so far that's the base all

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.109 
where I'm at so far that's the base all
right<00:01:50.819> well<00:01:51.030> I've<00:01:51.149> got<00:01:51.179> my<00:01:51.450> base<00:01:51.630> complete<00:01:53.119> and

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
right well I've got my base complete and

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.850 
right well I've got my base complete and
I<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.450> set<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.719> tank<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.140> top<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.709> get

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
I just set the tank on top just to get

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.600 
I just set the tank on top just to get
measurements<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.670> how<00:01:57.569> high<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.810> want<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.610> in

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
measurements of how high I want it in

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.480 
measurements of how high I want it in
the<00:01:59.970> sides<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:03.799> but<00:02:04.799> that's<00:02:04.920> where<00:02:05.159> I'm<00:02:05.250> at<00:02:05.340> at

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the sides but but that's where I'm at at

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.960 
the sides but but that's where I'm at at
the<00:02:05.579> moment

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.200 
far I got the Box almost completed
painted<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.170> inside<00:03:10.320> we're<00:03:11.250> just<00:03:11.400> two<00:03:11.580> random

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
painted the inside we're just two random

painted the inside we're just two random
pain<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.660> had<00:03:12.960> hanging<00:03:13.290> around<00:03:13.560> just<00:03:13.740> to

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
pain I had hanging around just to

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.390 
pain I had hanging around just to
protect<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.250> inside<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:15.210> then<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.400> insulate

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
protect the inside and then I insulate

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:26.810 
protect the inside and then I insulate
it<00:03:19.010> insulated<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.130> with<00:03:22.220> that<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.670> that's

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
it insulated it with that and that's

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.000 
it insulated it with that and that's
where<00:03:27.000> I'm<00:03:27.090> at<00:03:27.210> so<00:03:27.510> far<00:03:30.470> as<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.620> can<00:03:31.710> see<00:03:31.890> it's

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
where I'm at so far as you can see it's

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.370 
where I'm at so far as you can see it's
very<00:03:32.190> reflective<00:03:33.710> so<00:03:34.710> it<00:03:34.890> should<00:03:35.100> capture

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
very reflective so it should capture

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.320 
very reflective so it should capture

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
hot water heater works very well at

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.370 
hot water heater works very well at
least<00:04:31.850> here<00:04:32.300> in<00:04:32.360> Florida<00:04:32.840> that's<00:04:33.110> where<00:04:33.350> I
