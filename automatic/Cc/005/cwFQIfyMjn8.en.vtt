00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
you're trying to do is place this block

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.219 
you're trying to do is place this block
that<00:01:28.080> they<00:01:28.439> give<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:30.600> direction<00:01:30.810> of

that they give you in the direction of

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.130 
that they give you in the direction of
the<00:01:31.350> path<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:33.000> ball<00:01:33.270> will<00:01:33.479> roll<00:01:33.750> to

the path so that the ball will roll to
the<00:01:34.259> finish<00:01:34.500> line<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.920> when<00:01:35.490> you're<00:01:35.670> when

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the finish line so when you're when

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.480 
the finish line so when you're when
you're<00:01:36.540> done<00:01:36.780> doing<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.200> all<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.189> is

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
you're done doing that all you do is

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.520 
you're done doing that all you do is
click<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.820> start<00:01:42.680> now<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.890> was<00:01:44.040> easy<00:01:45.320> but<00:01:46.320> as

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
click on start now that was easy but as

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.730 
click on start now that was easy but as
the<00:01:46.829> levels<00:01:47.250> go<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:49.579> it<00:01:50.579> doesn't<00:01:50.759> get<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.119> easy

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.770 

so<00:01:54.740> what<00:01:55.040> you're<00:01:55.190> trying<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.430> do<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:55.970> place<00:01:56.540> the

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
so what you're trying to do is place the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.290 
so what you're trying to do is place the
blocks<00:01:57.080> so<00:01:57.410> that<00:01:57.920> when<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.370> ball<00:01:58.610> rolls<00:01:58.910> it's

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
blocks so that when the ball rolls it's

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.110 
blocks so that when the ball rolls it's
gonna<00:01:59.510> roll<00:01:59.750> to<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.050> finish<00:02:00.350> line<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:01.120> you're

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
gonna roll to the finish line and you're

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.490 
gonna roll to the finish line and you're
trying<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.450> fill<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.720> gap<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:03.230> the<00:02:03.260> ball

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
trying to fill the gap so the ball

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.100 
trying to fill the gap so the ball
doesn't<00:02:03.680> roll<00:02:03.920> between<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.340> gaps<00:02:04.580> so<00:02:05.540> when

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
doesn't roll between the gaps so when

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.210 
doesn't roll between the gaps so when
you've<00:02:06.260> got<00:02:06.530> everything<00:02:06.560> in<00:02:06.950> place<00:02:07.160> just

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
you've got everything in place just

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.930 
you've got everything in place just
click<00:02:07.790> start<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:13.010> ball<00:02:13.220> will<00:02:13.460> roll<00:02:13.700> to

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
click start and the ball will roll to

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.670 
click start and the ball will roll to
the<00:02:14.030> finish<00:02:14.360> line<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:15.320> a<00:02:15.380> pretty<00:02:15.590> cool

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
the finish line so it's a pretty cool

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.430 
the finish line so it's a pretty cool
game<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:17.210> concept<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.900> really<00:02:18.020> cool<00:02:18.290> as

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
game and the concept is really cool as

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.810 
game and the concept is really cool as
well<00:02:19.720> so<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.680> graphics<00:02:22.190> aren't<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.610> bad<00:02:24.820> and
