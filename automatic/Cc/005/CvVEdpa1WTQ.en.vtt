race you want to be rust

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.320 
race you want to be rust
totally<00:00:50.920> decides<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.610> it's<00:00:51.909> linked<00:00:52.150> to<00:00:52.210> your

characters were you know white and kind

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.500 
characters were you know white and kind
of<00:00:59.140> cloned<00:00:59.409> like<00:00:59.680> so<00:00:59.949> adds<00:01:00.670> obviously<00:01:01.180> a<00:01:01.210> spot

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
of cloned like so adds obviously a spot

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.600 
of cloned like so adds obviously a spot
of<00:01:01.659> diversity<00:01:02.199> and<00:01:02.409> not<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:03.400> know<00:01:03.489> not

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
of diversity and not you know not

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.820 
of diversity and not you know not
everyone<00:01:03.970> gets<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.239> unique<00:01:04.479> skin<00:01:04.869> skin<00:01:05.680> tone

everyone gets a unique skin skin tone
and<00:01:06.010> face<00:01:06.220> so<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.580> face<00:01:06.729> is<00:01:06.760> piece<00:01:07.150> of<00:01:07.330> it<00:01:07.450> you

interesting about it they made some
really<00:01:14.500> interesting<00:01:14.650> observations<00:01:15.400> about

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
really interesting observations about

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.740 
really interesting observations about
the<00:01:15.700> nature<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:16.030> grades<00:01:16.300> I<00:01:16.390> mean<00:01:16.510> obviously

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
the nature of grades I mean obviously

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.330 
the nature of grades I mean obviously
some<00:01:16.900> people<00:01:17.110> are<00:01:17.200> not<00:01:17.320> happy<00:01:17.620> about<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.310> fact

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
some people are not happy about the fact

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.130 
some people are not happy about the fact
that<00:01:18.670> you<00:01:18.820> might<00:01:18.940> just<00:01:19.150> end<00:01:19.390> up<00:01:19.600> as<00:01:19.720> an<00:01:19.840> Asian

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140

that you might just end up as an Asian
guy<00:01:20.290> or<00:01:20.800> as<00:01:21.190> a<00:01:21.490> black<00:01:21.850> guy<00:01:22.120> which<00:01:22.840> is<00:01:22.990> sort<00:01:23.170> of

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
guy or as a black guy which is sort of

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.870 
guy or as a black guy which is sort of
ironic<00:01:23.740> because<00:01:23.770> in<00:01:24.220> a<00:01:24.280> lot<00:01:24.430> of<00:01:24.460> games<00:01:24.700> for

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
ironic because in a lot of games for

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.670 
ironic because in a lot of games for
example<00:01:25.000> that<00:01:25.360> I<00:01:25.420> have<00:01:25.690> to<00:01:25.810> play<00:01:25.990> that<00:01:26.290> sort<00:01:26.620> of

example that I have to play that sort of
decision<00:01:26.980> is<00:01:27.250> made<00:01:27.520> for<00:01:27.940> me<00:01:28.120> so<00:01:28.390> if<00:01:28.630> there's<00:01:28.990> an

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
decision is made for me so if there's an

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.020 
decision is made for me so if there's an
interesting<00:01:29.560> bit<00:01:29.920> of<00:01:29.950> comeuppance<00:01:30.550> there<00:01:30.850> in

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
interesting bit of comeuppance there in

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.490 
interesting bit of comeuppance there in
terms<00:01:31.210> of<00:01:31.330> like<00:01:31.480> you<00:01:31.630> know<00:01:32.230> getting

doesn't get to choose which is the vast
majority<00:01:39.580> of<00:01:40.060> games<00:01:40.390> one<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.260> the<00:01:41.320> interesting

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
majority of games one of the interesting

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.210 
majority of games one of the interesting
things<00:01:41.890> that<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.430> Gary<00:01:42.700> Numan<00:01:43.120> had<00:01:43.300> said<00:01:43.540> was

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
things that that Gary Numan had said was

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.280 
things that that Gary Numan had said was
that<00:01:45.220> players<00:01:45.820> just<00:01:46.330> it<00:01:46.960> was<00:01:47.080> really

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
that players just it was really

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.540 
that players just it was really
interesting<00:01:47.470> because<00:01:47.710> they<00:01:48.220> had<00:01:48.370> sort<00:01:48.490> of

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
interesting because they had sort of

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.530 
interesting because they had sort of
established<00:01:48.970> this<00:01:49.060> world<00:01:49.270> where<00:01:49.420> all<00:01:49.510> the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
established this world where all the

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.600 
established this world where all the
characters<00:01:49.780> were<00:01:50.140> white<00:01:50.470> really<00:01:51.100> really

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
characters were white really really

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.360 
characters were white really really
difficult<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:52.600> introduce

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
difficult to introduce

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.260 
difficult to introduce
non-white<00:01:54.370> characters<00:01:54.760> into<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.030> game<00:01:55.150> for

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
non-white characters into the game for

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.610 
non-white characters into the game for
example<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.600> darker<00:01:55.930> characters<00:01:56.350> because

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
example the darker characters because

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.830 
example the darker characters because
they<00:01:56.740> felt<00:01:57.010> quote-unquote<00:01:57.790> blacked<00:01:58.210> up<00:01:58.570> and

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
they felt quote-unquote blacked up and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.210 
they felt quote-unquote blacked up and
he<00:01:58.900> actually<00:01:59.020> linked<00:01:59.470> to<00:01:59.650> a<00:01:59.680> page<00:01:59.979> about

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
he actually linked to a page about

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.950 
he actually linked to a page about
blackface<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:01.180> reason<00:02:01.450> why<00:02:01.540> is<00:02:01.659> like<00:02:01.780> if<00:02:01.900> you

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
blackface the reason why is like if you

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.270 
blackface the reason why is like if you
see<00:02:02.140> all<00:02:02.260> the<00:02:02.350> characters<00:02:02.650> are<00:02:02.770> white<00:02:02.920> all<00:02:03.159> the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
see all the characters are white all the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.789 
see all the characters are white all the
time<00:02:03.490> any<00:02:03.970> kind<00:02:04.390> of<00:02:04.780> additional<00:02:05.049> skin<00:02:05.470> tone<00:02:05.650> so

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
time any kind of additional skin tone so

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.020 
time any kind of additional skin tone so
it<00:02:05.830> makes<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.130> feel<00:02:06.280> like<00:02:06.340> it's<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.940> know

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
it makes you feel like it's you know

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.330 
it makes you feel like it's you know
perhaps<00:02:07.210> quote-unquote<00:02:07.780> too<00:02:08.019> dark<00:02:08.379> he<00:02:09.159> also

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
perhaps quote-unquote too dark he also

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.499 
perhaps quote-unquote too dark he also
said<00:02:09.580> this<00:02:09.640> is<00:02:09.759> really<00:02:09.909> interesting<00:02:10.330> in<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
said this is really interesting in the

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.360 
said this is really interesting in the
blog<00:02:10.690> post<00:02:10.989> that<00:02:11.230> shows<00:02:11.709> you<00:02:11.890> how<00:02:12.099> arbitrary

this<00:02:15.850> experiment<00:02:16.540> by<00:02:16.720> rust<00:02:17.140> is

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
this experiment by rust is

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.470 
this experiment by rust is
truly<00:02:18.260> unheard<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.549> know<00:02:19.940> obviously<00:02:20.330> I've

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
truly unheard of you know obviously I've

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.449 
truly unheard of you know obviously I've
talked<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.810> lot<00:02:20.930> about<00:02:21.170> race<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.799> games<00:02:22.099> and

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
talked a lot about race and games and

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.649 
talked a lot about race and games and
how<00:02:22.519> there's<00:02:22.879> obviously<00:02:23.269> a<00:02:23.330> lot<00:02:23.390> of

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
how there's obviously a lot of

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.800 
how there's obviously a lot of
under-representation<00:02:24.500> on<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.159> side<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.810> game

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
under-representation on the side of game

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.199 
under-representation on the side of game
characters<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:28.069> so<00:02:28.220> this<00:02:28.400> is<00:02:28.519> technical<00:02:29.030> as

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
characters and so this is technical as

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.610 
characters and so this is technical as
I've<00:02:29.360> talked<00:02:29.569> about<00:02:29.690> in<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.930> past<00:02:30.140> some<00:02:30.409> of<00:02:30.500> it

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
I've talked about in the past some of it

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.649 
I've talked about in the past some of it
has<00:02:30.769> roots<00:02:31.129> in<00:02:31.400> charas<00:02:32.239> Goro

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
has roots in charas Goro

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.839 
has roots in charas Goro
for<00:02:32.900> example<00:02:33.409> and<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.680> black<00:02:34.310> characters

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
for example and that black characters

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.149 
for example and that black characters
are<00:02:35.060> often<00:02:35.329> placed<00:02:35.629> in<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.200> background<00:02:36.799> and

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
are often placed in the background and

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.319 
are often placed in the background and
lighter<00:02:37.430> characters<00:02:37.879> are<00:02:38.000> placed<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.269> the

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
lighter characters are placed in the

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.270 
lighter characters are placed in the
foreground<00:02:38.690> that's<00:02:38.989> a<00:02:39.200> common<00:02:39.829> thing<00:02:40.010> that's

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
foreground that's a common thing that's

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.009 
foreground that's a common thing that's
taught<00:02:40.489> to<00:02:40.640> artists<00:02:41.000> as<00:02:41.150> part<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.420> our<00:02:41.569> theory

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
taught to artists as part of our theory

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.600 
taught to artists as part of our theory
and<00:02:42.049> it's<00:02:42.290> part<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.620> sort<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.400> how<00:02:43.549> we

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
and it's part of sort of how we

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.390 
and it's part of sort of how we
understand<00:02:44.269> Western<00:02:44.720> art<00:02:45.099> obviously<00:02:46.099> that's

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
understand Western art obviously that's

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.589 
understand Western art obviously that's
no<00:02:46.489> excuse<00:02:46.790> but<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.060> know<00:02:47.209> one<00:02:47.360> of<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.480> other

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
no excuse but you know one of the other

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.360 
no excuse but you know one of the other
big<00:02:47.750> reasons<00:02:48.049> why<00:02:48.110> we<00:02:48.260> don't<00:02:48.349> see<00:02:48.530> as<00:02:49.040> much<00:02:49.220> of

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
big reasons why we don't see as much of

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.770 
big reasons why we don't see as much of
these<00:02:49.459> kinds<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.790> experiments<00:02:50.150> is<00:02:50.480> because

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
these kinds of experiments is because

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.479 
these kinds of experiments is because
it's<00:02:50.959> rooted<00:02:51.230> in<00:02:51.319> technology<00:02:51.950> itself<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:52.400> if

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
it's rooted in technology itself so if

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.670 
it's rooted in technology itself so if
you<00:02:52.549> go<00:02:52.670> back<00:02:52.819> to<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.359> original<00:02:53.900> NES<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.560> was

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
you go back to the original NES it was

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.280 
you go back to the original NES it was
only<00:02:54.890> capable<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.760> spitting<00:02:56.150> out<00:02:56.299> 54

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
only capable of spitting out 54

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.960 
only capable of spitting out 54
different<00:02:57.980> colors<00:02:58.280> which<00:02:58.430> really<00:02:58.640> isn't<00:02:58.819> a

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
different colors which really isn't a

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
technology but is sort of made to look

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.670 
technology but is sort of made to look
like<00:03:14.000> an<00:03:14.150> old<00:03:14.269> NES<00:03:14.629> game<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.049> color<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.440> one<00:03:15.590> of

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
like an old NES game and color is one of

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.599 
like an old NES game and color is one of
the<00:03:15.769> things<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:16.040> was<00:03:16.129> actually<00:03:16.400> really

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
the things that was actually really

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.490 
the things that was actually really
really<00:03:17.000> difficult<00:03:17.269> for<00:03:17.510> them<00:03:17.720> particularly

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
really difficult for them particularly

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.640 
really difficult for them particularly
getting<00:03:18.769> darker<00:03:19.250> darker<00:03:19.700> tones<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:21.200> then<00:03:21.470> you

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
getting darker darker tones so then you

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.990 
getting darker darker tones so then you
know<00:03:21.769> after<00:03:21.919> that<00:03:22.099> there's<00:03:22.459> also<00:03:22.579> these<00:03:22.760> games

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
know after that there's also these games

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.640 
know after that there's also these games
that<00:03:23.180> have<00:03:23.359> character<00:03:23.840> generators<00:03:24.319> as<00:03:24.470> well

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
that have character generators as well

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.099 
that have character generators as well
so<00:03:24.889> you<00:03:24.980> can<00:03:25.130> choose<00:03:25.569> you<00:03:26.569> can<00:03:26.630> choose<00:03:26.750> what

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
so you can choose you can choose what

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.140 
so you can choose you can choose what
your<00:03:27.230> race<00:03:27.470> is<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.190> that<00:03:28.280> certainly<00:03:28.730> is<00:03:28.910> step

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
your race is and that certainly is step

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.940 
your race is and that certainly is step
forward<00:03:29.630> again<00:03:29.780> it's<00:03:30.230> nothing<00:03:30.590> like<00:03:30.709> this

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
forward again it's nothing like this

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.830 
forward again it's nothing like this
experiment<00:03:31.849> and<00:03:31.970> rust<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.480> it's<00:03:32.569> a<00:03:32.660> step

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
experiment and rust and it's a step

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.619 
experiment and rust and it's a step
forward<00:03:33.340> however<00:03:34.340> there<00:03:35.000> are<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.120> lot<00:03:35.239> of<00:03:35.269> kind

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
forward however there are a lot of kind

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.229 
forward however there are a lot of kind
of<00:03:36.040> problems<00:03:37.040> along<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.519> way<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:37.879> they<00:03:38.180> can

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
of problems along the way so they can

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.020 
of problems along the way so they can
follow<00:03:38.450> up<00:03:38.660> fallout<00:03:39.109> 3<00:03:39.379> for<00:03:39.709> example

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
follow up fallout 3 for example

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.699 
follow up fallout 3 for example
selecting<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.120> black<00:03:41.329> character<00:03:41.599> would<00:03:42.410> result

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
selecting a black character would result

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.800 
selecting a black character would result
in<00:03:42.859> these<00:03:42.980> like<00:03:43.160> gross<00:03:43.489> green<00:03:43.940> splotches<00:03:44.329> on

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
in these like gross green splotches on

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.599 
in these like gross green splotches on
characters<00:03:45.230> face<00:03:45.500> or<00:03:45.769> if<00:03:45.859> you<00:03:45.919> go<00:03:46.069> in<00:03:46.310> GTA

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.559 
afro texture or cornrows and Dragons age
for<00:03:55.010> example<00:03:55.040> if<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.849> make<00:03:55.879> a<00:03:56.000> dark<00:03:56.269> skinned

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
for example if you make a dark skinned

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.050 
for example if you make a dark skinned
character<00:03:57.139> like<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:57.889> noble<00:03:58.220> background<00:03:58.370> your

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
character like the noble background your

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.789 
character like the noble background your
parents<00:03:59.389> will<00:03:59.480> be<00:03:59.569> noticeably<00:03:59.989> white<00:04:00.260> which

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
parents will be noticeably white which

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.500 
parents will be noticeably white which
just<00:04:01.040> sort<00:04:01.160> of<00:04:01.280> implies<00:04:01.609> the<00:04:01.940> character<00:04:02.269> isn't

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
just sort of implies the character isn't

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.270 
just sort of implies the character isn't
actually<00:04:02.840> black<00:04:03.079> or<00:04:03.349> is<00:04:03.410> adopted<00:04:03.889> or<00:04:04.010> whatever

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
actually black or is adopted or whatever

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.979 
actually black or is adopted or whatever
it<00:04:04.459> might<00:04:04.609> be<00:04:04.750> there's<00:04:05.750> an<00:04:05.810> interesting

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
it might be there's an interesting

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.059 
it might be there's an interesting
thread<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.440> reddit<00:04:06.709> that<00:04:06.859> will<00:04:06.949> actually

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
thread and reddit that will actually

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.949 
thread and reddit that will actually
link<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:07.760> part<00:04:08.180> of<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.359> problem<00:04:08.660> is<00:04:08.780> that

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
link to and part of the problem is that

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.960 
link to and part of the problem is that
you<00:04:09.319> know<00:04:09.440> race<00:04:09.859> is<00:04:10.099> more<00:04:10.340> than<00:04:10.579> just<00:04:10.879> skin

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
you know race is more than just skin

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.330 
you know race is more than just skin
skin<00:04:11.870> tone<00:04:12.049> it's<00:04:12.349> not<00:04:12.530> it's<00:04:12.680> more<00:04:12.829> than<00:04:13.099> just

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
skin tone it's not it's more than just

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.159 
skin tone it's not it's more than just
sort<00:04:13.459> of<00:04:13.519> color<00:04:13.760> its<00:04:14.030> facial<00:04:14.480> features<00:04:14.900> as

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
sort of color its facial features as

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:16.750 
sort of color its facial features as
well<00:04:15.319> so<00:04:15.620> it's<00:04:15.739> not<00:04:15.799> always<00:04:16.099> just<00:04:16.220> enough<00:04:16.549> to

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
well so it's not always just enough to

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.339 
well so it's not always just enough to
say<00:04:16.940> oh<00:04:17.120> we're<00:04:17.539> gonna<00:04:17.660> have<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.840> wide<00:04:18.079> variety

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
say oh we're gonna have a wide variety

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.129 
say oh we're gonna have a wide variety
of<00:04:18.799> different<00:04:19.699> source<00:04:19.849> kin<00:04:20.180> texture<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.900> skin

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
of different source kin texture of skin

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.260 
of different source kin texture of skin
tones<00:04:21.410> but<00:04:21.799> not<00:04:22.220> have<00:04:22.520> a<00:04:22.550> different<00:04:23.120> facial

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
tones but not have a different facial

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.390 
tones but not have a different facial
structures<00:04:23.960> so<00:04:24.139> for<00:04:24.410> me<00:04:24.470> for<00:04:24.710> example<00:04:24.770> like<00:04:25.099> I

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
structures so for me for example like I

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
I end up with this kind of like I'm all

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.059 
I end up with this kind of like I'm all
gum<00:04:45.030> of<00:04:45.210> facial<00:04:45.539> features<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:46.080> guess<00:04:46.319> you<00:04:46.889> could

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
gum of facial features I guess you could

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:48.710 
gum of facial features I guess you could
just<00:04:47.099> change<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.910> skin<00:04:48.150> tone<00:04:48.360> or<00:04:48.539> whatever

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
just change the skin tone or whatever

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.999 
just change the skin tone or whatever
but<00:04:48.870> that<00:04:48.930> wouldn't<00:04:49.229> really<00:04:49.289> fully<00:04:49.590> capture

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
but that wouldn't really fully capture

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.059 
but that wouldn't really fully capture
kind<00:04:50.220> of<00:04:50.280> my<00:04:50.729> racial<00:04:51.419> identity<00:04:52.199> what's

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069 
kind of my racial identity what's

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:54.499 
kind of my racial identity what's
interesting<00:04:53.310> I<00:04:53.610> mean<00:04:53.789> I<00:04:53.819> always<00:04:54.060> try<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.300> look

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
interesting I mean I always try to look

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.059 
interesting I mean I always try to look
at<00:04:54.599> these<00:04:54.690> things<00:04:54.870> from<00:04:55.020> an<00:04:55.139> outside<00:04:55.530> context

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
at these things from an outside context

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:57.740 
at these things from an outside context
I<00:04:56.130> think<00:04:56.160> that<00:04:56.340> this<00:04:56.520> experiment<00:04:56.849> rust<00:04:57.360> speaks

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
I think that this experiment rust speaks

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.080 
I think that this experiment rust speaks
to<00:04:57.990> some<00:04:58.590> larger<00:04:59.310> things<00:04:59.580> that<00:04:59.819> are<00:04:59.909> happening

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
to some larger things that are happening

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.570 
to some larger things that are happening
outside<00:05:00.720> of<00:05:01.229> the<00:05:01.380> world<00:05:01.530> of<00:05:01.770> games<00:05:02.069> as<00:05:02.370> well

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
outside of the world of games as well

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.089 
outside of the world of games as well
you<00:05:03.569> know<00:05:03.630> one<00:05:03.870> good<00:05:04.110> antecedent<00:05:04.889> to<00:05:04.979> this

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
you know one good antecedent to this

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.270 
you know one good antecedent to this
idea<00:05:05.580> that<00:05:05.930> sort<00:05:06.930> of<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.080> character's<00:05:07.710> race

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
idea that sort of a character's race

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.129 
idea that sort of a character's race
which<00:05:08.639> is<00:05:08.669> what<00:05:08.880> is<00:05:09.210> arbitrary<00:05:09.840> which<00:05:10.020> is

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
which is what is arbitrary which is

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.230 
which is what is arbitrary which is
basically<00:05:10.530> what<00:05:11.280> what<00:05:11.669> Gary<00:05:11.849> Numan<00:05:12.150> the

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
basically what what Gary Numan the

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.339 
basically what what Gary Numan the
developers<00:05:12.659> say<00:05:12.780> it's<00:05:12.930> like<00:05:13.020> you<00:05:13.139> know<00:05:13.229> it

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
developers say it's like you know it

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.589 
developers say it's like you know it
really<00:05:13.500> shows<00:05:13.800> you<00:05:14.039> when<00:05:14.580> you<00:05:14.819> change<00:05:15.509> the

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
really shows you when you change the

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.059 
really shows you when you change the
character's<00:05:15.990> racing<00:05:16.349> roster<00:05:16.680> shows<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:16.949> how

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:17.069 
character's racing roster shows you how

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.129 
character's racing roster shows you how
arbitrary<00:05:17.280> those<00:05:17.729> distinctions<00:05:18.270> are<00:05:18.509> on<00:05:18.870> one

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
arbitrary those distinctions are on one

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.450 
arbitrary those distinctions are on one
place<00:05:19.319> where<00:05:19.500> you're<00:05:19.620> seeing<00:05:19.860> some<00:05:20.220> of<00:05:20.340> these

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
place where you're seeing some of these

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.909 
place where you're seeing some of these
experiments<00:05:21.180> is<00:05:21.270> actually<00:05:21.810> on<00:05:22.380> Broadway

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
experiments is actually on Broadway

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.439 
experiments is actually on Broadway
where<00:05:23.220> there's<00:05:23.370> this<00:05:23.520> legacy<00:05:24.030> of<00:05:24.240> called

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
where there's this legacy of called

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.689 
where there's this legacy of called
what's<00:05:24.870> called<00:05:25.080> colorblind<00:05:25.740> casting<00:05:26.099> right

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
what's called colorblind casting right

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.120 
what's called colorblind casting right
so<00:05:26.909> obviously<00:05:27.389> you<00:05:28.349> know<00:05:28.380> if<00:05:28.650> you<00:05:28.740> have<00:05:28.860> a<00:05:28.919> play

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
so obviously you know if you have a play

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.700 
so obviously you know if you have a play
for<00:05:29.520> example<00:05:29.580> like<00:05:30.120> Billy<00:05:30.300> Elliot<00:05:30.750> you<00:05:31.620> know

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
for example like Billy Elliot you know

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.310 
for example like Billy Elliot you know
that's<00:05:31.860> a<00:05:32.009> specific<00:05:32.580> person<00:05:33.030> but<00:05:33.270> on<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:34.229> know

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
that's a specific person but on you know

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.110 
that's a specific person but on you know
Broadway<00:05:34.740> they've<00:05:34.889> also<00:05:35.219> tried<00:05:35.460> to<00:05:35.490> sort<00:05:36.060> of

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
Broadway they've also tried to sort of

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.370 
Broadway they've also tried to sort of
increase<00:05:37.020> diversity<00:05:37.380> by<00:05:37.919> try<00:05:38.159> to<00:05:38.219> have<00:05:38.430> non

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
increase diversity by try to have non

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.899 
increase diversity by try to have non
non-white<00:05:40.380> characters<00:05:40.590> play<00:05:41.159> traditionally

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
non-white characters play traditionally

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.249 
non-white characters play traditionally
white<00:05:42.000> characters<00:05:42.449> for<00:05:42.719> example

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
white characters for example

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.529 
white characters for example
Keke<00:05:43.740> Palmer<00:05:43.979> has<00:05:44.610> been<00:05:44.820> playing<00:05:45.060> Cinderella

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
Keke Palmer has been playing Cinderella

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.540 
Keke Palmer has been playing Cinderella
I<00:05:46.020> mean<00:05:46.259> if<00:05:46.349> nothing<00:05:46.469> in<00:05:46.770> Cinderella<00:05:47.280> story

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
I mean if nothing in Cinderella story

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.550 
I mean if nothing in Cinderella story
that<00:05:47.789> makes<00:05:48.180> her<00:05:48.389> white<00:05:48.570> it's<00:05:48.810> just<00:05:49.080> that<00:05:49.289> you

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
that makes her white it's just that you

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.659 
that makes her white it's just that you
know<00:05:49.620> it's<00:05:49.770> how<00:05:49.889> we<00:05:49.949> sort<00:05:50.159> of<00:05:50.219> know<00:05:50.340> her<00:05:50.490> from

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
know it's how we sort of know her from

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.670 
know it's how we sort of know her from
the<00:05:50.729> Disney<00:05:51.030> movies<00:05:51.300> for<00:05:51.539> example<00:05:51.570> so<00:05:52.530> it's

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
the Disney movies for example so it's

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.170 
the Disney movies for example so it's
cool<00:05:52.800> to<00:05:52.860> see<00:05:53.130> casting<00:05:53.490> directors<00:05:53.880> sort<00:05:54.060> of

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
cool to see casting directors sort of

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.510 
cool to see casting directors sort of
experiment<00:05:54.750> with<00:05:54.900> that<00:05:55.110> also<00:05:55.889> obviously<00:05:56.400> you

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
experiment with that also obviously you

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.270 
experiment with that also obviously you
know<00:05:56.580> I<00:05:56.849> just<00:05:57.300> Alba<00:05:57.690> and<00:05:57.990> Thor<00:05:58.349> I'm<00:05:58.800> a<00:05:58.919> job<00:05:59.099> see

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
know I just Alba and Thor I'm a job see

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.640 
know I just Alba and Thor I'm a job see
also<00:05:59.490> caused<00:05:59.909> some<00:06:00.289> backlog<00:06:01.289> because<00:06:01.530> the

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
also caused some backlog because the

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.010 
also caused some backlog because the
backlash<00:06:02.039> as<00:06:02.370> well<00:06:02.669> but<00:06:03.030> it's<00:06:03.389> nice<00:06:03.599> to<00:06:03.630> see<00:06:03.990> I

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
backlash as well but it's nice to see I

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.510 
backlash as well but it's nice to see I
think<00:06:04.349> that<00:06:04.590> this<00:06:04.770> experiment<00:06:05.400> by<00:06:05.490> the

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
think that this experiment by the

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.219 
think that this experiment by the
developers<00:06:06.060> of<00:06:06.180> rust<00:06:06.419> is<00:06:06.599> really<00:06:06.960> really

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
developers of rust is really really

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:08.779 
developers of rust is really really
important<00:06:07.710> one<00:06:07.889> I<00:06:08.159> don't<00:06:08.400> think<00:06:08.610> they're

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
important one I don't think they're

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:10.550 
important one I don't think they're
trying<00:06:09.030> to<00:06:09.090> make<00:06:09.270> a<00:06:09.300> political<00:06:09.509> statement<00:06:10.169> or

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
trying to make a political statement or

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.290 
trying to make a political statement or
anything<00:06:10.770> like<00:06:11.009> that<00:06:11.069> I<00:06:11.490> think<00:06:11.729> that<00:06:11.969> you<00:06:12.120> just

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
anything like that I think that you just

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.029 
anything like that I think that you just
wanted<00:06:12.509> to<00:06:12.539> introduce<00:06:12.780> diversity<00:06:13.620> into<00:06:13.919> this

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
wanted to introduce diversity into this

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.439 
wanted to introduce diversity into this
world<00:06:14.250> and<00:06:14.550> they<00:06:14.880> thought<00:06:15.030> it'd<00:06:15.120> be<00:06:15.150> really

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
world and they thought it'd be really

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:16.730 
world and they thought it'd be really
interesting<00:06:15.900> is<00:06:15.990> like<00:06:16.139> if<00:06:16.259> you<00:06:16.349> took<00:06:16.560> the

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
interesting is like if you took the

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.379 
interesting is like if you took the
