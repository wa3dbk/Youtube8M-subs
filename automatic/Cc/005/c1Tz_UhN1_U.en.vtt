and that's what keeps me inspired my
legs<00:00:38.510> are<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:39.020> tool<00:00:39.230> that<00:00:39.440> I<00:00:39.500> use<00:00:39.800> to<00:00:40.390> explore

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
legs are the tool that I use to explore

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.030 
legs are the tool that I use to explore
big<00:00:41.900> wide-open<00:00:42.440> terrain<00:00:44.470> in<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:45.650> last<00:00:45.830> few

in<00:00:48.140> climbing<00:00:48.620> I<00:00:51.550> think<00:00:52.550> what<00:00:52.670> draws<00:00:52.820> me<00:00:53.000> to

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
in climbing I think what draws me to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.970 
in climbing I think what draws me to
climbing<00:00:53.480> is<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.750> pure<00:00:54.080> commitment<00:00:54.860> and

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
climbing is the pure commitment and

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:02.850 
climbing is the pure commitment and
adventure<00:00:55.430> of<00:00:55.550> it

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.500 

the<00:01:03.860> combined<00:01:04.250> running<00:01:04.730> and<00:01:04.850> climbing<00:01:04.970> has

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
the combined running and climbing has

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.470 
the combined running and climbing has
always<00:01:05.690> been<00:01:05.960> a<00:01:06.230> dream<00:01:06.770> of<00:01:06.800> mine

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.210 

where<00:01:12.480> does<00:01:12.630> running<00:01:12.870> end<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.470> climbing

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
where does running end and climbing

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.180 
where does running end and climbing
begin<00:01:18.320> you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.470> take<00:01:19.620> that<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.950> bigger

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
begin you can take that to the bigger

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.610 
begin you can take that to the bigger
mountains<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.450> idea<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:22.350> bigger

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
mountains to the idea of going bigger

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.580 
mountains to the idea of going bigger
and<00:01:22.770> farther<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:27.350> think<00:01:28.350> we're<00:01:28.440> definitely

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
and farther I think we're definitely

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.350 
and farther I think we're definitely
starting<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.280> see<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.490> trend<00:01:29.550> in<00:01:29.910> ultrarunning

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
starting to see a trend in ultrarunning

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.560 
starting to see a trend in ultrarunning
pushing<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.260> sport<00:01:31.620> into<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.010> much<00:01:32.250> wilder

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
pushing this sport into a much wilder

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.630 
pushing this sport into a much wilder
steeper<00:01:33.570> environment<00:01:34.110> places<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.160> most

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
steeper environment places that most

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.460 
steeper environment places that most
people<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.090> never<00:01:36.240> considered<00:01:36.810> runnable<00:01:37.229> in

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
people have never considered runnable in

people have never considered runnable in
the<00:01:37.590> past<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.790> Dakota<00:01:39.390> Jones<00:01:39.690> is<00:01:39.960> definitely

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
the past and Dakota Jones is definitely

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.090 
the past and Dakota Jones is definitely
at<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.010> forefront<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.760> that<00:01:42.030> movement<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:43.100> a
