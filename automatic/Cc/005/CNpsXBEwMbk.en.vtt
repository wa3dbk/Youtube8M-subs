00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
going to be applying it with a lip brush

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.160 
going to be applying it with a lip brush
I'm<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.640> using<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.030> cameras<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.659> mirror<00:01:42.899> so

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
I'm just using the cameras in mirror so

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:52.370 
I'm just using the cameras in mirror so
he<00:01:43.200> won't<00:01:43.649> be<00:01:43.710> pretty<00:01:43.950> precise

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.649 

and<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.280> put<00:01:53.460> as<00:01:53.610> little<00:01:53.640> or<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.329> much<00:01:54.479> as

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
and you can put as little or as much as

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.139 
and you can put as little or as much as
you<00:01:54.840> want<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.350> color<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.149> create

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
you want of this color on and create

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.590 
you want of this color on and create
different<00:01:57.630> shades<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.079> purple<00:01:59.450> so<00:02:00.450> that's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
different shades of purple so that's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.139 
different shades of purple so that's
what<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.869> looks<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.710> pretty<00:02:02.149> intense

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
what this looks like it's pretty intense

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.300 
what this looks like it's pretty intense
and<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.840> people<00:02:04.140> would<00:02:04.320> not<00:02:04.530> go<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.070> but

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and some people would not go for it but

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.719 
and some people would not go for it but
I<00:02:05.520> really<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.630> think<00:02:06.659> it's<00:02:06.990> really<00:02:07.140> pretty
