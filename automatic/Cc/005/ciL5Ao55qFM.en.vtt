all right I'm going to demonstrate how

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.770 
all right I'm going to demonstrate how
to<00:00:01.500> use<00:00:01.709> the<00:00:01.949> swing-away<00:00:02.310> getting<00:00:02.970> met<00:00:03.179> with

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
to use the swing-away getting met with

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.050 
to use the swing-away getting met with
our<00:00:03.959> Bryce<00:00:04.200> Harper<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.560> beefy<00:00:04.890> model<00:00:05.190> also<00:00:05.879> the

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
our Bryce Harper a beefy model also the

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.930 
our Bryce Harper a beefy model also the
same<00:00:06.240> setup<00:00:06.629> for<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.080> XXL<00:00:07.620> model<00:00:07.950> pretty<00:00:08.760> much

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
same setup for the XXL model pretty much

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.240 
same setup for the XXL model pretty much
the<00:00:09.120> way<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.360> math<00:00:09.510> works<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:10.410> you<00:00:10.920> have<00:00:10.980> your

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
the way the math works is you have your

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.400 
the way the math works is you have your
different<00:00:11.610> colors<00:00:11.910> here<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.960> have<00:00:13.170> your

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
different colors here you have your

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.560 
different colors here you have your
right<00:00:14.160> hand<00:00:14.370> inside<00:00:14.639> your<00:00:15.000> left<00:00:15.179> hand<00:00:15.330> inside

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
right hand inside your left hand inside

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:26.660 
right hand inside your left hand inside
with<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.080> red<00:00:17.000> as<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.240> notice<00:00:25.430> the<00:00:26.430> way<00:00:26.550> it

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
with the red as you notice the way it

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.200 
with the red as you notice the way it
works<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.619> your<00:00:28.619> bottom<00:00:28.920> boom<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.730> gonna<00:00:29.939> line

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
works is your bottom boom is gonna line

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.620 
works is your bottom boom is gonna line
up<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.689> your<00:00:30.840> arrow<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:32.059> for<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> pitch<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
up with your arrow so for a pitch up the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.920 
up with your arrow so for a pitch up the
middle<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:34.410> ready<00:00:34.770> set<00:00:35.010> up<00:00:35.480> where<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.690> plate

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
middle we ready set up where the plate

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.990 
middle we ready set up where the plate
and<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.260> ball<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.860> can<00:00:38.040> move<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:38.730> far

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
and the ball is you can move it as far

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.900 
and the ball is you can move it as far
forward<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:40.260> want<00:00:40.579> it's<00:00:41.579> really

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
forward and actually want it's really

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.490 
forward and actually want it's really
gonna<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.210> depending<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.200> want<00:00:43.410> to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
gonna be depending on what you want to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.200 
gonna be depending on what you want to
work<00:00:48.829> now<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.670> want<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> work<00:00:51.030> on

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
work now if you want to work on

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.670 
work now if you want to work on
something<00:00:51.510> inside<00:00:52.579> position<00:00:54.590> you<00:00:55.590> would

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
something inside position you would

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.100 
something inside position you would
slide<00:00:55.920> them<00:00:56.160> over

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
slide them over

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.160 
slide them over
line<00:00:58.710> up<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.920> arrow<00:00:59.250> with<00:00:59.520> position<00:00:59.970> point<00:01:00.300> so

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
line up the arrow with position point so

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.990 
line up the arrow with position point so
the<00:01:01.290> ball<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.580> can<00:01:05.610> work<00:01:05.820> on

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the ball is and then you can work on

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.470 
the ball is and then you can work on
your<00:01:06.150> inside<00:01:06.450> page<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:08.090> your<00:01:09.090> hitter<00:01:09.270> would

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
your inside page so your hitter would

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.140 
your inside page so your hitter would
stand<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> plate<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.980> if<00:01:11.310> he<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:11.910> she's<00:01:12.120> in

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
stand at the plate as if he or she's in

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.349 
stand at the plate as if he or she's in
the<00:01:12.390> box

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:19.669 

fundamentally<00:01:18.359> when<00:01:18.899> you<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.289> inside

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
fundamentally when you get that inside

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.910 
fundamentally when you get that inside
pitch

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:43.980 

same<00:01:23.460> thing<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> outside<00:01:24.240> pitch

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.460 

once<00:01:44.409> again

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.740 

at<00:01:48.470> some<00:01:48.620> places<00:01:48.890> like<00:01:49.250> you're<00:01:49.400> in<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.580> box

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.750 

fundamentally

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.230 

that's<00:02:01.150> demonstration<00:02:01.780> on<00:02:01.870> how<00:02:01.900> do<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.080> say
