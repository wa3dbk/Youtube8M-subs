00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.759
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.380
 video 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.759
 today we are going to talk about 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.410
 first takeoffs that I could do 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.119
 with the jim phantom could show 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.949
 how when I made to fly 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.930
 what to do first 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.210
 before taking off there are checklists to 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.050
 therefore respect at checklist level 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.579
 me what I advise you to do 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.399
 already this exit with glasses of 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.530
 sun thing I did not do so 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.640
 always it's important to have a 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.350
 earth because even when there's no 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.460
 the sun does not hurt 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.170
 eyes when we look in the sky because 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.969
 that we must always keep in mind the 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.010
 drone then at the propellers are 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.710
 check that they are tight and well 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.540
 setting in counterclockwise time so it's 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.570
 easy black in the dark and gray 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.100
 of a gray it has already shown us in video 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.100
 then the ghost 3 is nothing else to 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.559
 to do besides the calibration not that I want 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.649
 show on video how we do then 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.479
 it's very simple already we take the cable 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.640
 smartphones for now the ones on 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.590
 ios soon on android 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.689
 so we plug behind usb into the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.159
 remote control I plug that on my 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.240
 iphone 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.490
 and here I'm going to unlock everything 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.889
 simply went into the application 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:27.179
 dj so show you a touch screen 

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:33.130
 the application dj which is right here hop 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:35.259
 this is the start up so there ok and here he goes 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.529
 ask me after to go in toto 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:43.090
 of honor not here tac 

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:46.090
 that's how he explains to you how 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.529
 do and so that's how 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.969
 connect you click on it and 

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:50.439
 then we will have to turn on the drone 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.749
 so always check that it is 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.729
 nobody around always do that 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:56.109
 in a place really not spaced 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.539
 side of the building not side of the houses 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.899
 etc that I teach you not already done 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.119
 a video 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:05.049
 so we turn on the remote I turn on 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.579
 my remote control by pressing in time in 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.119
 time the little noise and then we 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.119
 turn on the drone 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.420
 the tac 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.819
 connected devices so here they 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.049
 come and pick us up 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.079
 question entry in camera view 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:37.439
 good there I already did tutorial is 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.269
 wholesale then here he writes calibrated 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.680
 here normal me I still have the 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.359
 caliber and only once so to deliver 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.950
 the fight before he had to make a 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:48.420
 manifest a little special ok we'll do ok 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.939
 here and there we say it do it 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.569
 rotate here I leave you here the 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:03:00.030
 remote control to make it fly 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.379
 you take it and you have everything 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.319
 simply shot with first shout at 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:09.599
 the screen is german it happened 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.159
 something on the screen you take 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.159
 our sense there and you turn 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.310
 then as soon as it's done 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.670
 me then here and then well as you 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.950
 can see it here i'm right in front 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.770
 so after here we have the invs settings of 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.900
 the iso et cetera that would be born here of the 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.069
 camera so you will not see much 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.050
 on the screen but I 'm going to show you 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.090
 after what it gives so there it does 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.340
 not too bad trouble we come in 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.130
 end of the day so I think it's 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.810
 rather not bad 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.370
 then what are you going to do 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.450
 you're going to take off for that 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.800
 it's very simple there are several ways to 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.540
 paste or you take off the way 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.940
 classic or drop down you 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.920
 go up or is you leaning on this 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.660
 little button here they ask you to 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.769
 slide and he'll take off an event all 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.130
 alone here without touching remote control 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.130
 here 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.200
 so here we go to do a little 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.120
 turn so here I go you a few 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.980
 blanks on the screen that were filmed in 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.530
 case case is heard the video will only be 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.570
 not in 4k that the ex door in 1080p but 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.859
 good after it's me who chose to 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.540
 do like those like this because 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.830
 I was setting like this but as 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.710
 what to see already we have some 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.910
 really very clean thing there there 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.550
 had that hand in front when I filmed at 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.980
 above the sinn is really watching that 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.200
 do not move all the little ones at once there are 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.760
 has none that are given by for the 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.130
 remote control the same here there was no 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.990
 bad wind the day there and I was able to film 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.370
 really beautiful shots look at that 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.320
 really do not move we invent things 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.690
 very very clean and that's what I like 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.520
 really a lot in this drone 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.560
 otherwise that's what happens to 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.689
 the screen when we simply shoot 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.219
 is this drone 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:57.409
 in the next video I will show a 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:59.539
 little how to properly set up your drones 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:00.169
 before take off on the app and I 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.729
 will show you all 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.289
 features it offers as well 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.079
 that future updates that have been 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.979
 announced by dj novation so in all 

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:09.199
 case it is very useful 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:12.409
 it is very simple it's great I find 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:15.829
 not having to solder and c2 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:17.659
 of issuers as well as having to redeem 

00:05:15.829 --> 00:05:18.919
 a screen still next is super 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:20.389
 convenient to have his tablet or his 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.739
 smartphone at least we can do some 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.549
 streaming send it directly to 

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:22.969
 youtube that's really what's 

00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:24.469
 interesting 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.029
 in any case I hope this video 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.229
 you will have pleased and I tell you to the 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:29.769
 next your work more videos 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.769
 stick
