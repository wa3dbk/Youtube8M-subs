conservatives<00:03:30.000> want<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.600> Brownback<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:31.530> a

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
conservatives want and Brownback is a

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.010 
conservatives want and Brownback is a
guy<00:03:31.950> who's<00:03:32.190> been<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:33.120> little<00:03:33.510> too<00:03:33.660> liberal<00:03:33.870> for

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
guy who's been a little too liberal for

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.260 
guy who's been a little too liberal for
some<00:03:34.320> on<00:03:34.500> immigration<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.220> obviously<00:03:35.940> he's

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
some on immigration and obviously he's

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.170 
some on immigration and obviously he's
not<00:03:36.660> for<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.740> President<00:03:38.280> Bush's<00:03:38.430> surge<00:03:38.820> and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
not for the President Bush's surge and

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.330 
not for the President Bush's surge and
so<00:03:39.330> he's<00:03:39.510> been<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.840> little<00:03:40.470> more<00:03:40.830> dovish<00:03:41.100> an

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
so he's been a little more dovish an

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.850 
so he's been a little more dovish an
hour<00:03:41.459> on<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.610> rack<00:03:41.880> so<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.360> think<00:03:42.780> they're<00:03:43.500> flawed

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
hour on a rack so I think they're flawed

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.190 
hour on a rack so I think they're flawed
as<00:03:44.280> well<00:03:44.610> as<00:03:45.180> far<00:03:45.480> as<00:03:45.510> they're<00:03:45.780> concerned<00:03:45.810> but

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
as well as far as they're concerned but

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.540 
as well as far as they're concerned but
I<00:03:46.320> would<00:03:46.470> argue<00:03:46.500> i<00:03:46.830> guess<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.250> this<00:03:47.370> doesn't

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
I would argue i guess and this doesn't

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.740 
I would argue i guess and this doesn't
fit<00:03:47.820> with<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.060> mold<00:03:48.270> of<00:03:48.390> what<00:03:48.450> the

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
fit with the mold of what the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.910 
fit with the mold of what the
conservators<00:03:49.230> are<00:03:49.260> looking<00:03:49.530> for<00:03:49.680> but<00:03:49.800> that

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
conservators are looking for but that

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.830 
conservators are looking for but that
would<00:03:50.070> make<00:03:50.220> Huckabee<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.970> maybe<00:03:51.270> Brownback

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
would make Huckabee and maybe Brownback

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.750 
would make Huckabee and maybe Brownback
more<00:03:52.410> viable<00:03:52.620> in<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.920> general<00:03:53.250> election<00:03:53.310> look
