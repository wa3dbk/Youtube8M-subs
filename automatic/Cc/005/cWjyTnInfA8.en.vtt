wanted me to try them fries giant bombs

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.330 
wanted me to try them fries giant bombs
that's<00:00:28.109> right<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.590> wanted<00:00:28.800> me<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> try<00:00:29.160> and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
that's right you wanted me to try and

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.339 
that's right you wanted me to try and
freeze<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.939> giant<00:00:30.330> bomb<00:00:30.510> before<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.019> went<00:00:31.199> off

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
freeze the giant bomb before it went off

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.650 
freeze the giant bomb before it went off
which<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.070> impossible<00:00:32.399> but<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.030> was<00:00:33.120> still<00:00:33.390> fun

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
which is impossible but it was still fun

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.930 
which is impossible but it was still fun
to<00:00:33.690> try<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.530> see<00:00:34.739> if<00:00:34.920> maybe<00:00:35.430> just

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
to try and do and see if maybe just

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
to try and do and see if maybe just
maybe<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.630> would<00:00:37.020> actually<00:00:37.170> freeze<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.980> so

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
maybe it would actually freeze it so

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.290 
maybe it would actually freeze it so
let's<00:00:38.489> go<00:00:38.579> ahead<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.790> jump<00:00:39.030> into<00:00:39.180> these

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
tonight alright guys so here's the first

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.639 
tonight alright guys so here's the first
attack<00:00:49.410> against<00:00:49.800> ty<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.649> pretty

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
attack against ty and this is a pretty

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.520 
attack against ty and this is a pretty
naive<00:00:53.610> I'm<00:00:53.820> pretty<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.629> bad<00:00:54.809> base<00:00:55.050> so

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
naive I'm pretty a really bad base so

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
naive I'm pretty a really bad base so
we're<00:00:55.649> dropping<00:00:56.039> off<00:00:56.190> all<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.579> our<00:00:56.670> hog<00:00:56.879> riders

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
we're dropping off all of our hog riders

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.910 
we're dropping off all of our hog riders
from<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> bottom<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.960> base<00:00:58.140> I'm<00:00:58.559> supposed

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
from the bottom of the base I'm supposed

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.040 
from the bottom of the base I'm supposed
to<00:00:59.250> try<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.550> guess<00:01:00.030> where<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.510> giant<00:01:00.840> bombs

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
to try and guess where the giant bombs

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.080 
to try and guess where the giant bombs
are<00:01:01.320> I'm<00:01:01.469> guessing<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.100> there's<00:01:02.309> some<00:01:02.579> by

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
are I'm guessing that there's some by

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.240 
are I'm guessing that there's some by
the<00:01:03.149> mortars<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.719> wizard<00:01:04.049> towers<00:01:04.470> let's<00:01:05.070> see

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the mortars and wizard towers let's see

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.190 
the mortars and wizard towers let's see
if<00:01:05.400> there<00:01:05.549> are<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> drop<00:01:06.540> off<00:01:06.689> those<00:01:06.900> in

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
if there are so I drop off those in

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.170 
if there are so I drop off those in
there<00:01:07.350> were<00:01:07.500> not<00:01:07.740> giant<00:01:08.159> bombs<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.790> those<00:01:08.970> gaps

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
there were not giant bombs in those gaps

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.850 
there were not giant bombs in those gaps
even<00:01:09.630> though<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.840> looked<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.439> would<00:01:10.650> be

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
even though it looked like they would be

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.609 
even though it looked like they would be
there<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:12.000> those<00:01:12.630> free<00:01:12.930> smells<00:01:13.200> didn't<00:01:13.470> really

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
there so those free smells didn't really

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.320 
there so those free smells didn't really
do<00:01:13.770> too<00:01:13.799> much<00:01:14.159> let's<00:01:14.460> try<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.790> guess<00:01:15.030> once

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
do too much let's try and guess once

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.760 
do too much let's try and guess once
again<00:01:15.630> where<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.810> giant<00:01:16.229> bombs<00:01:16.409> are<00:01:16.619> there

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
again where the giant bombs are there

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.810 
again where the giant bombs are there
might<00:01:16.920> be<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.159> right<00:01:17.310> there<00:01:17.460> watch<00:01:17.640> we're

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
might be one right there watch we're

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.670 
might be one right there watch we're
gonna<00:01:17.909> try<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.630> went<00:01:19.320> off<00:01:19.470> too

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
gonna try and get it it went off too

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.469 
gonna try and get it it went off too
soon<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.310> giant<00:01:20.790> bomb<00:01:20.909> went<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.150> too<00:01:21.299> soon

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
soon so that giant bomb went up too soon

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.210 
soon so that giant bomb went up too soon
I<00:01:21.630> dropped<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.049> other<00:01:22.290> freeze<00:01:22.650> phone<00:01:22.890> trying

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
I dropped that other freeze phone trying

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.760 
I dropped that other freeze phone trying
to<00:01:23.369> get<00:01:23.520> those<00:01:23.670> bombs<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.270> missed<00:01:25.020> them<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
to get those bombs I missed them and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.700 
to get those bombs I missed them and
they<00:01:26.310> destroyed<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.450> lot<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.930> our<00:01:28.049> hog<00:01:28.290> riders

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
but it wasn't that big of a deal because

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.330 
but it wasn't that big of a deal because
the<00:01:30.990> hog<00:01:31.170> riders<00:01:31.439> destroyed<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.070> the
