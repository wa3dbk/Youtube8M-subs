the first version I built using

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.570 
the first version I built using
biomimicry<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:44.870> was<00:01:45.080> big<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:45.710> then<00:01:45.920> catch<00:01:46.190> as

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
biomimicry it was big and then catch as

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.520 
biomimicry it was big and then catch as
many<00:01:46.880> insects<00:01:47.270> as<00:01:47.480> i<00:01:47.660> would<00:01:47.720> have<00:01:47.900> liked<00:01:48.170> and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
many insects as i would have liked and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.370 
many insects as i would have liked and
so<00:01:48.740> i<00:01:48.980> redesigned<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.880> my<00:01:50.690> second<00:01:51.110> trap

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
so i redesigned and my second trap

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.760
