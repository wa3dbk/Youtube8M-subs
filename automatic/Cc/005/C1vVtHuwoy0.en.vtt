00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:10.200
 hello continuously their students ask 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.110
 what is modulation and in general how is it 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.109
 practically discern by ear these two 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.710
 words says modulation is a transition from 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.230
 one key to another while preserving 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.490
 the whole melodic line and harmony of that 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.160
 or other work 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.039
 how it sounds is practically there from you 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.900
 I 'll take a simple if this song 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.149
 for example, we all know 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.000
 Moscow evenings and first I will play 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.190
 the melody on the guitar is well understood that 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.430
 a little bit like that accompaniment 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.090
 0 minor on my and then you and me 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.809
 do the translation just come on modulation 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.870
 another one at the seminar or remember tpl 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.590
 or another scrape or member will send 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.550
 on channel 7 but u click you want goes 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.430
 in the country 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.410
 wide construction and occasionally builders 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.390
 hammering on bricks with a hammer 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.119
 put fruit types by specially 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.880
 position knocked on the idea that can 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.770
 they will not knock now or immediately to 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.080
 We will hear a few stocks for vodka 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.630
 for this whole movie we will not interfere 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.729
 I can understand the essence without you 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.729
 moscow evenings started for a minute 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.940
 so that's nothing complicated for the minutes and 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.900
 then minor on this one 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.720
 the essence is 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.910
 modulations all successes i think that more 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.910
 less understandable hotel themes
