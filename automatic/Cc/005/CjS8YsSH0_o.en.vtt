00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.966
 In this class we will know the modules that can 

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.466
 be inserted on this page 

00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.832
 Modules are highlights 

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:17.899
 which can stay on every page of the site. 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.633
 At home we have three modules under the banner. 

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:26.066
 but there may be two modules underneath the banner. 

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.399
 or a single module. 

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.633
 These modules can be repeated as many times as you want 

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.966
 below the banner. 

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.432
 See again: 

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:37.966
 3 modules, 

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.366
 2 modules, 

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.366
 1 module. 

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.232
 It is important for you to understand that this modules 

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:47.133
 that are under the banner only occur in the home. 

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:51.699
 On the other pages only side modules may exist. 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.366
 Let's look at examples of side modules. 

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.666
 These modules are in the sidebar 

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.066
 why are they on the inner page, 

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.599
 in the home they are under the banner. 

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:05.666
 The "sidebar" is the place where 

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:09.699
 the modules are on the internal pages. 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.466
 They can be placed right or left. 

00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:19.832
 They can not have one right and one left at the same time. 

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:22.766
 You must choose whether the sidebar is 

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.632
 left or right when placing the highlights. 

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.433
 Images placed within the 

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:31.933
 have these models: 

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:35.566
 "Small" model is a square image of 75 pixels 

00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:38.799
 used next to the text 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.733
 In the "width" model the system varies the size of the image, 

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:45.133
 adjusting the highlight area 

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:49.466
 In the "rectangular" model the system centralizes the image and cuts, 

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:52.599
 maintaining a rectangular proportion. 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.866
 No matter the format of the original photo 

00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:58.632
 the system always cuts the picture in a rectangle. 

00:01:58.633 --> 00:02:02.666
 Original model: The system puts the original image, 

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:07.832
 if it is larger than the area it cuts through the width available in the highlight 

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:11.399
 If you want your photo to have an exact size inside the site 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.166
 she has to be at your computer 

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.499
 in the exact size you want to use 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.066
 See example. 

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:22.266
 In the next classes you will learn how to insert these modules. 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.866
 SitePX 

00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:30.599
 The easiest way to make a website 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.000
 beautiful and functional.
