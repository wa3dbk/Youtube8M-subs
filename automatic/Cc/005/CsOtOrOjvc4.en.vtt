00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.519

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.309
 recovering from a knee injury and returned 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.139
 there in itu and has a certain moment of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.330
 play a scare or receive a 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.830
 Knee kick out of the field 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.330
 world got scared and came back normal wanted 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.210
 that you tell what you are in 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.880
 today to break this ice in the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.869
 debut for saints and are ready and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.119
 suddenly for 90 minutes in the classic 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.640
 I'm very happy to return to play ball. 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.410
 re-focus with friends with 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.489
 I know him to train so I'm very 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.649
 happy in the contact there in the game was the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.690
 who also hit the knee with 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.140
 psychological knee right 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.520
 trained in psychology but was only 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.480
 implanted thank god it was nothing 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.699
 too much 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.460
 I'm back soon for the quieter game. 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.820
 the palm trees have a 90 minute condition 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.589
 but still in the first time and in the second 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.360
 time 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.100
 so if you had to make a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.280
 propaganda kind of advertisement there for 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.270
 know what you will offer to 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.890
 this team 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.299
 You 're coming back, we know you have. 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.979
 quality of marking and knows how to 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.509
 game that will win the saints if you 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.490
 start as a holder for example with the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.380
 first who will win the Saints with the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.070
 your entrance 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.740
 I think the markup was as it spoke 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.900
 quality to get out of the game not 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.759
 what are you playing do not have this 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.930
 the group is very strong and has already proven this 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.840
 So 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.780
 but I really trust myself in the switchboard 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.670
 I'll certainly do my best and with 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.579
 marking quality pass in the game with 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.220
 sure only has to gain from this is the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.200
 saints have said to us here in 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.350
 backs it neymar that is neymar 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.689
 She came back today, she was not there in 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.189
 that he 's the same way we 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.000
 less on the field he's playful 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.130
 also how he came back 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.159
 especially after the two goals there 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.380
 It's beautiful, same playful way. 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.899
 ever 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.930
 That's a good head and I've been training. 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.720
 wanting every time every day 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.830
 always wanting no more quiet 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.480
 good people 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.610
 always working in the best way 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.640
 How long did you stand still? 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.920
 How long have you been unemployed for six months? 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.440
 and at least for those who were there in itu 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.650
 of repression that at the end of the game you 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.680
 I was very tired natural 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.420
 the oxygen is right there at the end of the game no 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.730
 It's been a long time in Italy then 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.390
 where he has been unemployed for a long time and 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.680
 then the game was very 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.080
 run so I thought right but that there 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.989
 You're going to win new ones right. 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.840
 day to day in the games I believe that the 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.150
 third game already with the third game already 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.980
 I'm good, calm down already 100% 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.500
 Felipe is spoke of you will have to me 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.530
 said that making an advertisement is for 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.840
 You're leaving for the game, you 're a 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.720
 steering wheel coming out for the game your fight 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.920
 in quotation marks a position would be serious 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.920
 who does he exchange with 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.560
 I think everyone is in the fight he 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:20.660
 fell possebon arouca adriano is a fight 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.609
 Good fight, I think the team is well. 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.069
 served as frills 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.600
 But I want my space, I'm going to fight. 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.480
 this is not it 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.299
 I do not want to pull you came hired 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.489
 I do not want to work on a day-to-day basis and 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.519
 you deserve to be a holder 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.250
 this is bound to be natural 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:44.660
 You talk about the classic 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.810
 Sunday the palm trees had lots of conversation 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.540
 Marcelo went there for us there much 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.920
 tranquility, the Palm Team is 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.780
 coming on a very good and growing 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.900
 then we have to have total 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.889
 attention but calm never talked 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.019
 nothing much 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.000
 He said nothing else if he talked about 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.920
 hiring is that you arrived as a contractor 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.829
 that we brought was adilson batista 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.190
 who is no longer in the saints as it is 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.190
 you 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.440
 fortunately I have not even returned from injury now 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:19.160
 take it apart is that 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.090
 and it is so very sad that he left 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.850
 already passed 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.270
 have to follow up on the work he 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.270
 have to give in his then the coach is 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.950
 The marcelo is what I said will be from 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.620
 just as it will be with 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.740
 always try to do my best in the game and 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.920
 get in the training on a daily basis to 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.200
 to be holder in five chances and 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.720
 played with kberber on cruise 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.460
 if the joão not playing no faster and 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.170
 It has information on the right kléber 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.910
 say they are a forward and a 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.980
 attacker of great strength and gives 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.110
 work for the defenders who 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:59.840
 markers with disputes in force 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:01.580
 deserves special attention or does not deserve 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.460
 kleber is a very strong player and likes 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.890
 to protect too much tone has to have total 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.810
 attention with him not only rabbit as a 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:13.750
 Palm tree team in the cast of the palm trees 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:16.580
 is very good and solid then championship 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.110
 in the clébio kleber is a very 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.920
 different then you have to have attention 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.920
 total with him
