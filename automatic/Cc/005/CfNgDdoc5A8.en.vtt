00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
a very you know uncommon recipe but it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.179 
a very you know uncommon recipe but it
was<00:01:16.080> very<00:01:16.259> easy<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.740> want<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> use<00:01:17.070> this

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
was very easy if you want to use this

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.580 
was very easy if you want to use this
mini<00:01:17.490> mod<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.299> simply<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.930> lots<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.439> water

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
mini mod so simply have lots of water

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.490 
mini mod so simply have lots of water
like<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.100> then<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.850> add<00:01:21.060> something<00:01:21.659> easy<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
like so then you add something easy the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.990 
like so then you add something easy the
easiest<00:01:22.799> thing<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.100> add<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.430> actually<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.759> sugar

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
easiest thing to add is actually a sugar

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.810 
easiest thing to add is actually a sugar
those<00:01:24.600> are<00:01:24.750> my<00:01:24.780> other<00:01:24.930> ingredients<00:01:25.229> like

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
those are my other ingredients like
