00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
with things like the chevy impala that's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.999 
with things like the chevy impala that's
great<00:01:48.000> because<00:01:48.329> toyota<00:01:48.990> need<00:01:49.259> all<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.740> ground

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
great because toyota need all the ground
