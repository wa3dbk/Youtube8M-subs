okay<00:00:01.020> so<00:00:01.079> this<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.650> tutorial<00:00:01.979> on<00:00:02.280> the

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
okay so this is a tutorial on the

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.450 
okay so this is a tutorial on the
sternoclavicular<00:00:03.210> joint<00:00:04.339> so<00:00:05.339> the

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
sternoclavicular joint so the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.150 
sternoclavicular joint so the
sternoclavicular<00:00:05.970> joint<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.799> joint

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
sternoclavicular joint is this joint

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.790 
sternoclavicular joint is this joint
here<00:00:08.400> between<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:09.170> proximal<00:00:10.170> end<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.679> the

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
here between the proximal end of the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.190 
here between the proximal end of the
clavicle<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:12.120> manubrium<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
clavicle and the manubrium of the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.369 
clavicle and the manubrium of the
sternum<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:14.000> you've<00:00:15.000> also<00:00:15.179> got<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.990> first

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
sternum and you've also got the first

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.529 
sternum and you've also got the first
costal<00:00:17.130> cartilage<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:17.940> involved<00:00:18.420> in

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
costal cartilage that is involved in

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.080 
costal cartilage that is involved in
this<00:00:18.690> joint

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
this joint

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.210 
this joint
so<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.270> joint<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.109> synovial<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
so this joint is a synovial and

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.290 
so this joint is a synovial and
saddle-shaped<00:00:23.760> joint<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.699> I'm<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:27.029> going<00:00:27.210> to

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
saddle-shaped joint so I'm just going to

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.210 
saddle-shaped joint so I'm just going to
isolate<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:28.199> structures<00:00:28.619> involved<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
isolate the structures involved and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.950 
isolate the structures involved and
we'll<00:00:29.310> take<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.519> look<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.420> them<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.720> closer

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
we'll take a look at them in closer

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.440 
we'll take a look at them in closer
detail

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
detail

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.120 
detail
so<00:00:33.450> you've<00:00:33.600> got<00:00:33.750> three<00:00:34.130> articulating

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
so you've got three articulating

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.650 
so you've got three articulating
surfaces<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.059> joint

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
surfaces in this joint

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.990 
surfaces in this joint
you've<00:00:36.989> got<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.410> proximal<00:00:38.250> end<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
you've got the proximal end of the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.720 
you've got the proximal end of the
clavicle

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
clavicle

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.690 
clavicle
you've<00:00:41.730> got<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.420> clavicular<00:00:43.170> notch<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
you've got the clavicular notch of the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.860 
you've got the clavicular notch of the
manubrium<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:46.969> you've<00:00:47.969> got<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.539> first

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
manubrium and you've got the first

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.630 
manubrium and you've got the first
costal<00:00:49.469> cartilage<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.860> joint<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
costal cartilage so as this joint is a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.639 
costal cartilage so as this joint is a
synovial<00:00:53.879> joint<00:00:54.600> you've<00:00:54.870> got<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.230> joint

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
synovial joint you've got a joint

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.520 
synovial joint you've got a joint
capsule<00:00:56.010> which<00:00:56.460> surrounds<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.780> joint<00:00:58.289> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
capsule which surrounds this joint and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.139 
capsule which surrounds this joint and
the<00:00:58.710> articulating<00:00:59.609> surfaces<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:01.820> this<00:01:02.820> joint

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the articulating surfaces and this joint

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.140 
the articulating surfaces and this joint
capsule<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.840> lined<00:01:04.589> by<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> synovial<00:01:05.369> membrane

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
capsule is lined by a synovial membrane

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.429 
capsule is lined by a synovial membrane
and<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:06.750> strengthened<00:01:07.439> by<00:01:07.710> ligaments<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
and it's strengthened by ligaments and

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.250 
and it's strengthened by ligaments and
in<00:01:10.439> between<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.400> clavicular<00:01:12.000> notch<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
in between the clavicular notch of the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.289 
in between the clavicular notch of the
manubrium<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.310> proximal<00:01:14.850> end<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
manubrium and the proximal end of the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.270 
manubrium and the proximal end of the
clavicle<00:01:15.509> you've<00:01:16.200> got<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.680> small

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
clavicle you've got a small

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.560 
clavicle you've got a small
fibrocartilage<00:01:18.119> anis<00:01:19.020> disc<00:01:20.330> so<00:01:21.330> you've<00:01:21.420> got

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
fibrocartilage anis disc so you've got

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.230 
fibrocartilage anis disc so you've got
an<00:01:21.689> articular<00:01:22.439> disc<00:01:22.830> which<00:01:23.640> splits<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
an articular disc which splits the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.830 
an articular disc which splits the
cavity<00:01:24.930> into<00:01:25.380> two<00:01:26.369> compartments<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.720> you've

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
cavity into two compartments so you've

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.569 
cavity into two compartments so you've
got<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.140> fibrocartilage<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.430> this

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
got this fibrocartilage in this

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.690 
got this fibrocartilage in this
articular<00:01:30.360> disc<00:01:30.659> sitting<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:32.130> articular

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
articular disc sitting in this articular

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.429 
articular disc sitting in this articular
cavity<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.240> separating<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:33.990> into<00:01:34.290> two

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
cavity and separating it into two

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.670 
cavity and separating it into two
compartments<00:01:35.329> so<00:01:36.329> strengthening<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.350> joint

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
compartments so strengthening this joint

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.999 
compartments so strengthening this joint
capsule<00:01:38.189> you've<00:01:38.340> got<00:01:38.520> four<00:01:38.820> ligaments<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
capsule you've got four ligaments and

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.260 
capsule you've got four ligaments and
the<00:01:41.009> way<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> think<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the way to think of this is just to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.090 
the way to think of this is just to
think<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> structures<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.619> involved

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
think of the structures that involved

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.880 
think of the structures that involved
and<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.460> names<00:01:44.729> are<00:01:45.060> logically<00:01:45.450> named<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.439> we

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
and the names are logically named so we

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.560 
and the names are logically named so we
know<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.280> we've<00:01:47.399> got<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.640> costal<00:01:48.149> cartilage

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
know that we've got a costal cartilage

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.480 
know that we've got a costal cartilage
involved<00:01:49.020> we've<00:01:49.380> got<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> manubrium<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
involved we've got the manubrium of the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.310 
involved we've got the manubrium of the
sternum<00:01:50.610> involved<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.570> we've<00:01:51.990> got<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
sternum involved and we've got the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.190 
sternum involved and we've got the
clavicle<00:01:52.829> involved<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> first<00:01:54.509> ligament

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
clavicle involved so the first ligament

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.800 
clavicle involved so the first ligament
I'm<00:01:55.380> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.890> talk<00:01:56.100> about<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:57.329> ligament

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
I'm going to talk about is this ligament

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.010 
I'm going to talk about is this ligament
here<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.549> ligament<00:01:59.939> connects<00:02:00.450> both

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
here so this ligament connects both

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.840 
here so this ligament connects both
clavicles<00:02:01.350> together<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.579> called<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
clavicles together so it's called the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.139 
clavicles together so it's called the
inter<00:02:03.420> clavicular<00:02:03.869> ligament<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.060> then<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
inter clavicular ligament and then the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.809 
inter clavicular ligament and then the
next<00:02:06.479> ligament<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:08.099> ligament<00:02:08.459> here

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
next ligament is this ligament here

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.059 
next ligament is this ligament here
which<00:02:09.300> connects<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.989> clavicle<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
which connects the clavicle to the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.890 
which connects the clavicle to the
manubrium<00:02:11.370> sternum

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
manubrium sternum

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.830 
manubrium sternum
so<00:02:13.769> this<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.099> called<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.840> sternoclavicular

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
so this is called the sternoclavicular

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.380 
so this is called the sternoclavicular
ligament<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.769> it's<00:02:17.010> got<00:02:17.159> two<00:02:17.400> parts<00:02:17.879> it's<00:02:18.150> got

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
ligament and it's got two parts it's got

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.030 
ligament and it's got two parts it's got
the<00:02:18.480> part<00:02:18.720> which<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.019> can<00:02:19.140> see<00:02:19.349> here<00:02:19.590> from<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
the part which you can see here from the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.250 
the part which you can see here from the
anterior<00:02:20.489> view<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.510> it's<00:02:21.629> got<00:02:21.750> an<00:02:21.810> anterior

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
anterior view so it's got an anterior

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.979 
anterior view so it's got an anterior
part<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.950> if<00:02:23.879> I<00:02:24.000> rotate<00:02:24.209> round<00:02:24.659> to<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.959> back

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
part and if I rotate round to the back

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.070 
part and if I rotate round to the back
it's<00:02:25.769> got<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.069> posterior<00:02:26.640> part<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.780> you've<00:02:27.900> got

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
it's got a posterior part so you've got

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.949 
it's got a posterior part so you've got
an<00:02:28.260> anterior<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.159> a<00:02:29.489> posterior

this joint they're fairly limited but

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.740 
this joint they're fairly limited but
you<00:03:19.560> get<00:03:19.829> there<00:03:20.220> mainly<00:03:20.549> occurring<00:03:21.359> in<00:03:21.540> the

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
you get there mainly occurring in the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.680 
you get there mainly occurring in the
anterior<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.739> posterior<00:03:23.069> plane<00:03:23.669> and<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.569> the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
anterior and posterior plane and in the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.990 
anterior and posterior plane and in the
vertical<00:03:24.870> plane<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:26.010> get<00:03:26.190> some<00:03:26.370> anterior

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
vertical plane so you get some anterior

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.270 
vertical plane so you get some anterior
and<00:03:27.120> posterior<00:03:27.450> movement<00:03:28.260> but<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.769> also<00:03:28.950> get

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
and posterior movement but you also get

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.409 
and posterior movement but you also get
some<00:03:29.549> superior<00:03:30.419> and<00:03:30.750> inferior<00:03:31.069> movement<00:03:32.069> and

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
some superior and inferior movement and

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.449 
some superior and inferior movement and
then<00:03:33.419> you<00:03:33.599> get<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.780> very<00:03:34.019> small<00:03:34.530> amount<00:03:34.769> of

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
then you get a very small amount of

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.360 
then you get a very small amount of
rotational<00:03:36.419> movement<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.829> that's<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.160> quick

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
rotational movement so that's a quick

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.169 
rotational movement so that's a quick
rundown<00:03:38.700> on<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.269> sternoclavicular<00:03:40.139> joint
