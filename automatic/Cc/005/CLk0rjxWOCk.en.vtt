00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.750 
played three or four and it's really
frustrating<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:57.440> don't<00:03:57.680> know<00:03:57.769> nobody<00:03:58.340> bought

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
frustrating I don't know nobody bought

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.750 
frustrating I don't know nobody bought
the<00:03:58.940> game<00:03:59.120> or<00:03:59.450> what<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.380> hell<00:04:00.560> happened<00:04:01.280> but

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
the game or what the hell happened but

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.830 
the game or what the hell happened but
it<00:04:01.880> just<00:04:02.030> keeps<00:04:02.299> happening

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.979 

and<00:04:05.709> you<00:04:05.860> see<00:04:06.069> if<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:06.370> says<00:04:06.610> like<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.750> sometimes

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
and you see if it says like it sometimes

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.330 
and you see if it says like it sometimes
it<00:04:08.260> doesn't<00:04:08.440> even<00:04:08.560> back<00:04:08.739> now<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.160> main

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
it doesn't even back now to the main

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.979 
it doesn't even back now to the main
menu<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:09.819> it's<00:04:09.940> slightly<00:04:10.060> consistent<00:04:10.900> with

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989
