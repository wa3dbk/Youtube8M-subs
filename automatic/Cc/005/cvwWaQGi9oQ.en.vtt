the<00:00:13.080> headlamps<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.710> my<00:00:13.830> first<00:00:14.130> car<00:00:14.370> still<00:00:14.670> had

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
the headlamps in my first car still had

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.660 
the headlamps in my first car still had
lightbulbs<00:00:15.420> when<00:00:16.320> LED<00:00:16.770> lamps<00:00:17.100> came<00:00:17.310> up<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.550> was

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
lightbulbs when LED lamps came up I was

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.269 
lightbulbs when LED lamps came up I was
quite<00:00:17.820> amazed<00:00:18.410> but<00:00:19.410> what<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.830> new<00:00:19.980> laser

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
quite amazed but what is this new laser
