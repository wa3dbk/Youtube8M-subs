00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
 you hi to all and local to leucan 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.899
 point fr it's nice birds 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.490
 sing it's great I'll have 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.990
 change is important today we're going 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.940
 talk about a little plugin of a small 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.620
 application for your mac that exists 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.780
 also on windows but it's funny 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.610
 is called flows and it serves to change the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.610
 color cast of your screen 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.390
 so why change the dominant of 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.040
 color of his screen since precisely 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.380
 it's all annoying to have cramps 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.640
 well calibrated and it's with centers 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.050
 calibration when we do the photo 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.510
 of the video to be sure because 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.120
 that we have on the screen is exactly what 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.890
 it's supposed to be in order to have 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.420
 too green towards bruising blues in 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.309
 your sky and that's where there is a 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.989
 advantage is the evening since as 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.940
 you know when the sun goes down 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.070
 your little brain secretes the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.690
 melatonin which is the little hormones 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.370
 at not so huge will start what serves 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.269
 to fall asleep little by little so a 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.479
 light in the evening 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.269
 crosses in intensity and tend towards the 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.769
 yellow to the orange red same but 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.380
 your brain says enough sleep time 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.479
 and little by little he adores your body 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.760
 except that bias I know that like all 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.220
 our screens they are white or blue 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.720
 some times and well if we are in front 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.070
 a computer screen or the screen of 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.060
 phone before going to bed 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.409
 well, we have our eyes wide open 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.150
 because we can not fall asleep 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.130
 why because our brain does not have 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.140
 had his reflex to swing the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.090
 melatonin novel you're worth sleeping it's 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.560
 there that intervenes flows is a small 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.580
 simple software that will put itself 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.000
 in the menu bar on your 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.550
 computer 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.530
 so on your windows it will be to my in 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.420
 bottom right there next to the clock and 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.490
 Savard also exists if you have a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.530
 iphone or ipad jailbroken he got there 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.180
 flex that can settle via if there is or 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.880
 a trick like that flows so you 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.530
 to say b in the last version I'm 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.720
 sink 21 years all models 1 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.909
 does it work it will detect a full 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.360
 your location and deer ab the evening at 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.890
 such time I start to raise the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.210
 twilight or just a little 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.430
 sun going down so the screen is going 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.970
 become orange and a yellow hue at 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.680
 early then orange was very yellow red 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.540
 delay at - party for just 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.710
 your brain's habit to the fact that 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.849
 but it must be dark that it is necessary that 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.229
 you went to sleep then 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.069
 the schedule at which you get up but 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.599
 it's just so that when 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.489
 you stand up for your silk 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.390
 white in a progressive way but at its 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.280
 request this offensive 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.680
 So here we are on the retina you 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.690
 have here in streams that will tell you that 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.980
 the screen temperature and 6500 k 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.720
 line now that the sun is getting 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.879
 will sleep with a cisr and get up 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.440
 there for 8 hours if clicked in 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.269
 preferences we are afraid 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.799
 I'm going down a little bit we have everything 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.720
 simply the possibility of 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.769
 geolocate so he will locate us 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.819
 simply because that's it 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.060
 market 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.560
 here he's going to have the c the cycle all 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.360
 just a little bit of care 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.620
 function of if you change their sim and 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.540
 we get up at 8 o'clock in the morning 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.959
 you see that it emerges small to 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.090
 small there will be the phase 2 of sun 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.189
 yellow bsa a little bit bigger if 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.099
 I come back pop on this hour here I am 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:59.290
 rises like these at 4 o'clock in the morning to 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.239
 4 o'clock in the morning my screen will already be yellow 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.220
 and kick but it will change the night he 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.720
 will go to bed earlier so I get up 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.250
 at 7 o'clock we did not do anything wrong with parma 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.549
 not to the program and to give you a 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.079
 idea here's the color when the 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.430
 sun goes down here the color 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.260
 when it's the night we see you 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.709
 it's very very young it's disturbing 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.879
 in December in the middle of the day and the soft 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.900
 in fact is just going to see you 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.620
 manage dynamically 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.540
 the temperature of your screen so you 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.010
 can then switched to different ya 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.560
 settings you can have fun with 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.790
 you see that change the bambara yard if 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.170
 a day at work and finally love 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.989
 can switch on that thing 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.000
 and so on to have fun with your 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.409
 little fire lux here I just wanted 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.150
 tell you about this application since 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.799
 it's a really great thing 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.840
 I obviously use everyday 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.760
 launch at 10.2 home startups that 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.980
 it's the mac pro or the retina and it's 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.090
 just super comfortable the spell when 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.859
 you point it's complementary 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.449
 totally with the philippe ciu which i 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.620
 you had done the test here so this is 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.209
 the lights that are controllable and 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.069
 so it's evening but the lights 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.620
 are the yellow sift etc 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.419
 the screens too and suddenly it allows 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.040
 to go to bed without having the games 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.090
 exploded for an all-white screen I'm doing 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.319
 no longer it's nice I want him 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.060
 cycling was the case for the 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.620
 point fr and it was not share this 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.819
 article follow me on twitter she car 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.500
