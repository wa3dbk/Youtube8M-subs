00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
them off one by one um I don't think you

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.460 
them off one by one um I don't think you
can<00:03:06.340> really<00:03:06.400> flash<00:03:07.090> your<00:03:07.450> way<00:03:07.540> through<00:03:07.900> and

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
can really flash your way through and

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.350 
can really flash your way through and
get<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.250> end<00:03:09.430> because<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:09.880> have<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.180> wait

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
get to the end because you have to wait

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.770 
get to the end because you have to wait
for<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:11.110> friendly<00:03:11.829> chopper<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.400> come<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.750> I

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
for a friendly chopper to come so I

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.809 
for a friendly chopper to come so I
don't<00:03:14.470> think<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.799> can<00:03:14.920> really<00:03:14.980> speed<00:03:15.579> run

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
don't think you can really speed run

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.670 
don't think you can really speed run
this<00:03:15.970> part<00:03:16.299> like<00:03:16.540> throw<00:03:16.810> flashing<00:03:17.260> just<00:03:17.500> run

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
this part like throw flashing just run

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.520 
this part like throw flashing just run
through<00:03:17.859> because<00:03:18.280> i<00:03:18.870> believe<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.049> chopper

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
through because i believe the chopper

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.199 
through because i believe the chopper
needs<00:03:20.859> a<00:03:21.190> clear<00:03:21.790> LZ<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.569> get<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:23.859> i<00:03:24.209> hope

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
needs a clear LZ to get you so i hope

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.460 
needs a clear LZ to get you so i hope
