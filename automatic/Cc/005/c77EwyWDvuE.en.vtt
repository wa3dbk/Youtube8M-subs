00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
here but Jed is unable to pick it up he

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.649 
here but Jed is unable to pick it up he
does<00:01:35.610> though<00:01:35.850> try<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> take<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> shot<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.630> goal

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
does though try to take a shot on goal

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.130 
does though try to take a shot on goal
here<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.110> he<00:01:37.439> draws<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.520> foul<00:01:39.329> now<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.930> for

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
here and he draws in a foul now I for

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840 
here and he draws in a foul now I for
one<00:01:40.619> thought<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:40.979> was<00:01:41.130> gonna<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> penalty

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
one thought this was gonna be a penalty

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.399 
one thought this was gonna be a penalty
I<00:01:41.880> imagine<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.659> he<00:01:42.750> was<00:01:42.869> inside<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.140> box<00:01:43.350> so

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
I imagine that he was inside the box so

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.719 
I imagine that he was inside the box so
he<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.619> kind<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.860> see<00:01:44.009> right<00:01:44.159> there<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.460> maybe

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
he can kind of see right there but maybe

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.280 
he can kind of see right there but maybe
he<00:01:44.970> wasn't<00:01:45.149> there's<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.479> possibility<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.200> he

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
he wasn't there's a possibility that he

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.679 
he wasn't there's a possibility that he
was<00:01:46.470> not<00:01:46.740> he<00:01:47.280> unfortunately<00:01:47.939> does<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.360> get<00:01:48.600> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
was not he unfortunately does not get to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.969 
was not he unfortunately does not get to
take<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> free<00:01:49.170> kick<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.470> don't<00:01:49.649> believe<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
take the free kick I don't believe the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.969 
take the free kick I don't believe the
manager<00:01:50.490> completely<00:01:51.270> trusts<00:01:51.869> him<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.320> taking

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
manager completely trusts him and taking

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.130 
manager completely trusts him and taking
free<00:01:53.189> kicks<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.610> yet<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.689> free<00:01:54.840> kick<00:01:55.020> is

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
free kicks just yet so the free kick is

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.719 
free kicks just yet so the free kick is
taken<00:01:55.259> right<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.100> unfortunately<00:01:56.640> it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
taken right here and unfortunately it

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.760 
taken right here and unfortunately it
doesn't<00:01:56.880> get<00:01:57.060> anywhere<00:01:57.659> close<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.560> in

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
doesn't get anywhere close to going in

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.499 
doesn't get anywhere close to going in
the<00:01:58.890> gold<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.399> very<00:01:59.610> unfortunate<00:01:59.850> actually

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the gold it's very unfortunate actually

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.209 
the gold it's very unfortunate actually
I<00:02:00.689> think<00:02:01.079> if<00:02:01.290> Jed<00:02:01.530> was<00:02:01.710> up<00:02:01.799> there<00:02:01.950> he<00:02:02.130> would

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
I think if Jed was up there he would

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.380 
I think if Jed was up there he would
have<00:02:02.250> possibly<00:02:02.490> had<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.909> chance<00:02:03.149> maybe

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
have possibly had that chance maybe

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.030 
have possibly had that chance maybe
we'll<00:02:03.630> try<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.079> don't<00:02:04.320> know<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> petition<00:02:04.860> for

did<00:02:53.109> against<00:02:53.319> Millsboro<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.919> he'd<00:02:54.010> get<00:02:54.099> a

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
did against Millsboro and he'd get a

did against Millsboro and he'd get a
victory<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:55.030> seems<00:02:55.090> as<00:02:55.389> though<00:02:55.540> when<00:02:55.720> Jed<00:02:56.079> is

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
victory it seems as though when Jed is

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.259 
victory it seems as though when Jed is
actually<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:56.889> the<00:02:57.099> match<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.579> Jed<00:02:58.180> is

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
actually in the match and Jed is

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.899

participating<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.409> scoring<00:03:00.189> goals<00:03:00.400> like<00:03:00.790> he

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
participating and scoring goals like he

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.099 
participating and scoring goals like he
should<00:03:01.090> be<00:03:01.120> doing<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.629> Doncaster<00:03:02.079> Rovers

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.259 
should be doing the Doncaster Rovers
have<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:02.739> chance<00:03:03.040> of<00:03:03.189> winning<00:03:03.220> but<00:03:03.939> when<00:03:04.090> he's

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
have a chance of winning but when he's

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.940 
have a chance of winning but when he's
not<00:03:04.299> in<00:03:04.689> the<00:03:04.780> match<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.230> whenever<00:03:05.349> he's<00:03:05.709> sat

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
not in the match and whenever he's sat

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.710 
not in the match and whenever he's sat
by<00:03:06.129> the<00:03:06.189> manager<00:03:06.639> which<00:03:07.120> seems<00:03:07.389> to<00:03:07.510> have<00:03:07.659> been

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
by the manager which seems to have been

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.589 
by the manager which seems to have been
or<00:03:08.680> what<00:03:08.889> will<00:03:09.010> be<00:03:09.040> in<00:03:09.459> some<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.269> like<00:03:10.450> two

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
or what will be in some of like two

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.869 
or what will be in some of like two
championships<00:03:11.230> they<00:03:11.799> don't<00:03:12.010> win<00:03:12.220> so<00:03:12.669> he<00:03:12.760> gets

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
championships they don't win so he gets

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.520 
championships they don't win so he gets
a<00:03:12.939> six<00:03:13.150> point<00:03:13.329> nine<00:03:13.359> rating<00:03:13.720> got<00:03:13.840> about<00:03:13.959> 66

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
a six point nine rating got about 66

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.839 
a six point nine rating got about 66
percent<00:03:14.590> shooting<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.250> could<00:03:15.370> obviously<00:03:15.609> be

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
percent shooting that could obviously be

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.189 
percent shooting that could obviously be
a<00:03:15.879> lot<00:03:16.060> better<00:03:16.269> but<00:03:16.389> we<00:03:16.599> do<00:03:16.750> get<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:16.930> lot<00:03:17.109> of

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:17.199 
a lot better but we do get a lot of

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.719 
a lot better but we do get a lot of
accomplishments<00:03:17.829> here<00:03:17.949> short<00:03:18.190> passing<00:03:18.579> was<00:03:18.669> a

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:18.729 
accomplishments here short passing was a

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:22.379 
accomplishments here short passing was a
big<00:03:18.909> one<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:20.620> gentle<00:03:21.099> move<00:03:21.250> on<00:03:21.430> looking<00:03:22.239> at

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
big one and so gentle move on looking at

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:23.580 
big one and so gentle move on looking at
some<00:03:22.569> of<00:03:22.659> the<00:03:22.720> statistics<00:03:22.870> he's<00:03:23.379> doing

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
exactly what his manager once but it's

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.490 
exactly what his manager once but it's
kind<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.239> averaged<00:03:25.629> and<00:03:25.840> Jed<00:03:26.079> definitely

kind of averaged and Jed definitely

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.719 
kind of averaged and Jed definitely

you guys will be able to see in the

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.729 
you guys will be able to see in the
moment<00:04:00.459> this<00:04:00.939> team<00:04:01.209> played<00:04:01.540> really<00:04:02.049> well<00:04:02.260> some

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
moment this team played really well some

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.110 
moment this team played really well some
of<00:04:02.829> the<00:04:02.889> teams<00:04:03.069> that<00:04:03.220> you'll<00:04:03.310> play<00:04:03.459> I'm

of the teams that you'll play I'm

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.729 
of the teams that you'll play I'm
obviously<00:04:04.449> not<00:04:04.810> playing<00:04:05.049> unlike<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.409> hardest

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
obviously not playing unlike the hardest

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.619 
obviously not playing unlike the hardest
which<00:04:06.220> I<00:04:06.340> probably<00:04:06.579> should<00:04:06.939> because<00:04:07.150> possibly

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
which I probably should because possibly

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:08.909 
which I probably should because possibly
maybe<00:04:07.780> my<00:04:07.959> keepers<00:04:08.319> will<00:04:08.439> play<00:04:08.560> better<00:04:08.709> and

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
maybe my keepers will play better and

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.640 
maybe my keepers will play better and
possibly<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.959> computer<00:04:10.959> that<00:04:11.290> is<00:04:11.409> playing

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
possibly the computer that is playing

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.839 
possibly the computer that is playing
and<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:11.859> other<00:04:12.009> opponents<00:04:12.489> will<00:04:12.579> play<00:04:12.729> better

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
and the other opponents will play better

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.030 
and the other opponents will play better
maybe<00:04:13.120> I<00:04:13.239> should<00:04:13.419> play<00:04:13.509> on<00:04:13.569> a<00:04:13.720> harder

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
maybe I should play on a harder

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.749 
maybe I should play on a harder
difficulty<00:04:15.040> because<00:04:15.459> I<00:04:15.519> think<00:04:15.579> I'm

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:15.759 
difficulty because I think I'm

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.569 
difficulty because I think I'm

nothing can completely go wrong I can
completely<00:04:24.130> go<00:04:24.310> right<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:24.820> you<00:04:25.240> know<00:04:25.360> series

completely go right and you know series

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.580 
completely go right and you know series
right<00:04:25.870> here<00:04:25.900> you<00:04:26.110> try<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.289> maker

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
right here you try the maker

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.650 
right here you try the maker
cross<00:04:26.740> it<00:04:26.949> almost<00:04:27.160> actually<00:04:27.520> goes<00:04:27.669> in<00:04:27.940> for<00:04:28.630> a

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
cross it almost actually goes in for a

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.240 
cross it almost actually goes in for a
goal<00:04:28.870> sometimes<00:04:29.169> I<00:04:29.440> wonder<00:04:29.860> I've<00:04:30.010> seen<00:04:30.190> that

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
goal sometimes I wonder I've seen that

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.470 
goal sometimes I wonder I've seen that
happen<00:04:30.430> on<00:04:30.639> the<00:04:30.730> other<00:04:30.760> games<00:04:31.060> but<00:04:31.240> sometimes

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
happen on the other games but sometimes

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.610 
happen on the other games but sometimes
I<00:04:31.540> wonder<00:04:31.720> if<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:31.900> could<00:04:32.020> go<00:04:32.110> in<00:04:32.169> for<00:04:32.410> a<00:04:32.440> goal

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
I wonder if I could go in for a goal

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.230 
I wonder if I could go in for a goal
right<00:04:33.190> here<00:04:33.400> he<00:04:33.550> gets<00:04:33.639> a<00:04:33.760> nice<00:04:33.880> little<00:04:34.030> pass

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
right here he gets a nice little pass

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.610 
right here he gets a nice little pass
and<00:04:34.480> he<00:04:34.540> decides<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:34.810> pass<00:04:35.169> it<00:04:35.440> back

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
and he decides to pass it back

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.110 
and he decides to pass it back
unfortunately<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.310> doesn't<00:04:36.430> work<00:04:36.580> out<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:37.030> his

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
unfortunately it doesn't work out to his

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.400 
unfortunately it doesn't work out to his
benefit<00:04:37.570> it<00:04:37.690> actually<00:04:37.960> gets<00:04:38.110> kind<00:04:38.260> of<00:04:38.290> messy

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
benefit it actually gets kind of messy

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.830 
benefit it actually gets kind of messy
but<00:04:38.770> he<00:04:38.860> does<00:04:39.040> draw<00:04:39.340> in<00:04:39.550> another<00:04:39.820> free<00:04:40.660> kick

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
but he does draw in another free kick

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.000 
but he does draw in another free kick

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
something I'm gonna probably add to him
