00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
through yeah I think so certainly at the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.529 
through yeah I think so certainly at the
start<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:13.580> that<00:00:14.580> period<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.120> didn't<00:00:15.329> feel

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:15.539 
start of that period that I didn't feel

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.250

too<00:00:15.570> well<00:00:16.910> it's<00:00:17.910> difficult<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.630> kind<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.140> get

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
too well it's difficult to kind of get

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.200 
too well it's difficult to kind of get
to<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> place<00:00:19.710> where<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.099> not<00:00:20.670> thinking

pressure pain sport and suppose there's

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.150 
pressure pain sport and suppose there's
a<00:02:55.080> lot<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.260> sports<00:02:55.500> people<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:55.890> come<00:02:56.040> out

they've struggle a little bit and try

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.140 
they've struggle a little bit and try
out<00:03:00.090> their<00:03:00.299> period<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.730> think<00:03:02.850> it's<00:03:03.090> a

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
out their period so so I think it's a
