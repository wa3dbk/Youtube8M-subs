00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
quite a symbol of that well I think it's

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.680 
quite a symbol of that well I think it's
like<00:00:33.500> every<00:00:33.800> contract<00:00:34.370> we've<00:00:35.150> still<00:00:35.420> and<00:00:35.629> I

the<00:00:41.960> way<00:00:42.079> this<00:00:42.320> is<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:44.059> biggest<00:00:44.360> one<00:00:44.450> but<00:00:45.140> we

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
the way this is the biggest one but we

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.110 
the way this is the biggest one but we
still<00:00:45.320> have<00:00:45.739> a<00:00:45.770> few<00:00:45.860> T's<00:00:46.399> to<00:00:46.579> cross<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:47.000> eyes

still have a few T's to cross and eyes
to<00:00:47.149> dot<00:00:47.570> but<00:00:48.350> none<00:00:48.890> of<00:00:48.920> them<00:00:49.129> should<00:00:49.340> be<00:00:49.399> a

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
to dot but none of them should be a

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.660 
to dot but none of them should be a
problem<00:00:51.079> in<00:00:51.440> terms<00:00:51.530> of<00:00:51.890> us<00:00:52.070> completing<00:00:52.579> the

for someone in your situation to be

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.260 
for someone in your situation to be

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
suing the other part in it before you

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.850 
suing the other part in it before you
built<00:01:25.270> or<00:01:25.480> not<00:01:25.750> build<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.140> stadium<00:01:26.320> so<00:01:26.650> things

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
built or not build the stadium so things

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.710 
built or not build the stadium so things
are<00:01:26.980> always<00:01:27.070> quite<00:01:27.430> difficult<00:01:27.610> well<00:01:28.330> I<00:01:28.360> met

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
are always quite difficult well I met

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.020 
are always quite difficult well I met
happy<00:01:28.930> we<00:01:29.500> didn't<00:01:29.800> sue<00:01:30.010> them<00:01:30.220> we<00:01:30.550> threatened

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
happy we didn't sue them we threatened

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.880 
happy we didn't sue them we threatened
to<00:01:31.270> if<00:01:31.510> they<00:01:31.720> didn't<00:01:31.960> come<00:01:32.170> along<00:01:32.410> on<00:01:32.620> board

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
to if they didn't come along on board

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.640 
to if they didn't come along on board
and<00:01:33.190> I<00:01:33.370> think<00:01:33.580> that's<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.910> point<00:01:34.290> they<00:01:35.290> agreed

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
and I think that's the point they agreed

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.170 
and I think that's the point they agreed
with<00:01:35.680> us<00:01:35.979> that<00:01:36.040> they<00:01:36.310> needed<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.729> complete<00:01:37.060> the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
with us that they needed to complete the

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.570 
with us that they needed to complete the
contract<00:01:37.510> and<00:01:37.780> that's<00:01:37.990> worthy<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:39.430> heard

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
contract and that's worthy we heard

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.580 
contract and that's worthy we heard
today<00:01:39.760> though<00:01:40.119> from<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.810> TV<00:01:41.110> executive<00:01:41.470> think

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
today though from the TV executive think

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.240 
today though from the TV executive think
they're<00:01:42.040> pulling<00:01:42.369> out<00:01:42.490> of<00:01:42.670> about<00:01:42.930> 290

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
a large supermarket development do you

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.470

worry<00:01:49.300> crashing<00:01:50.230> men<00:01:50.380> like<00:01:50.590> one<00:01:50.830> of<00:01:50.860> those

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
worry crashing men like one of those

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.120 
worry crashing men like one of those
well<00:01:52.480> it<00:01:52.600> would<00:01:52.750> be<00:01:52.870> naive<00:01:53.110> me<00:01:53.530> not<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:53.860> believe

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
well it would be naive me not to believe

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.830 
well it would be naive me not to believe
that<00:01:54.370> that<00:01:54.940> we<00:01:55.090> might<00:01:55.300> not<00:01:55.390> be<00:01:55.540> on<00:01:55.660> that<00:01:55.780> list

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
that that we might not be on that list
