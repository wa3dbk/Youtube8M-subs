believe me later put your second finger

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.000 
believe me later put your second finger
and<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.640> third<00:02:11.910> fret<00:02:12.300> it's<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.780> G<00:02:13.160> pluck<00:02:14.160> it

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
and the third fret it's a G pluck it

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.759 
and the third fret it's a G pluck it
pinkie<00:02:15.819> on<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:16.000> on<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.420> fifth<00:02:16.690> string<00:02:17.260> or<00:02:17.500> on

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
pinkie on the on the fifth string or on

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.490 
pinkie on the on the fifth string or on
the<00:02:17.860> fifth<00:02:18.040> fret<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:20.019> d-string

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
the fifth fret of the d-string

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.589 
the fifth fret of the d-string
so<00:02:20.739> it<00:02:20.799> really<00:02:21.010> should<00:02:21.220> be<00:02:21.250> fingers<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:22.120> inform

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
so it really should be fingers to inform

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.270 
so it really should be fingers to inform
when<00:02:23.200> I'm<00:02:23.290> teaching<00:02:23.590> this<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.799> my<00:02:23.920> students

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
when I'm teaching this to my students

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.530 
when I'm teaching this to my students
that's<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.580> way<00:02:24.700> I'll<00:02:24.790> do<00:02:24.909> it<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.060> say<00:02:25.209> second

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
that's the way I'll do it I say second

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.890 
that's the way I'll do it I say second
position<00:02:25.980> which<00:02:26.980> we're<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.360> fingers<00:02:28.360> two<00:02:28.599> and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
position which we're in fingers two and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.500 
position which we're in fingers two and
four<00:02:29.190> move<00:02:30.190> down<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.730> next<00:02:30.760> string<00:02:31.330> and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
four move down to the next string and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.740 
four move down to the next string and
play<00:02:32.170> one<00:02:33.000> two<00:02:34.230> four<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:36.970> far<00:02:37.180> we<00:02:37.299> got<00:02:37.360> two

four<00:02:39.900> okay<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.260> then<00:02:41.349> for<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.590> last<00:02:41.829> string

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
four okay and then for the last string

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.410 
four okay and then for the last string
we're<00:02:42.370> going<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.549> play<00:02:42.700> one<00:02:43.209> three<00:02:44.140> four<00:02:45.420> so

okay<00:02:52.299> this<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:52.900> great<00:02:53.200> scale<00:02:53.500> because

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
okay this is a great scale because

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.110 
okay this is a great scale because
unlike<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.379> piano<00:02:56.829> or<00:02:57.129> a<00:02:57.160> horn<00:02:57.579> or<00:02:57.790> something

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
unlike the piano or a horn or something

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.099 
unlike the piano or a horn or something
like<00:02:58.239> that<00:02:58.299> you<00:02:58.599> have<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.780> know<00:02:58.900> all<00:02:58.930> the

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
like that you have to know all the

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.349 
like that you have to know all the
sharps<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.500> flats<00:02:59.590> with<00:03:00.579> guitar<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.209> don't

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
sharps and flats with guitar you don't

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.210 
sharps and flats with guitar you don't
have<00:03:01.629> to<00:03:01.840> really<00:03:02.140> know<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.319> it's<00:03:02.739> helpful<00:03:03.010> of

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
have to really know that it's helpful of

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.500 
have to really know that it's helpful of
course<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.670> know<00:03:03.790> that<00:03:04.000> it's<00:03:04.150> good<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.299> know

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
course to know that it's good to know

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.930 
course to know that it's good to know
your<00:03:04.629> theory<00:03:04.930> but<00:03:05.500> guitar<00:03:06.280> players<00:03:06.519> use<00:03:06.609> these

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
your theory but guitar players use these

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.630 
your theory but guitar players use these
forms<00:03:07.569> all<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.810> time<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.530> run<00:03:09.160> their<00:03:09.310> scales

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
forms all the time to run their scales

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
forms all the time to run their scales
and<00:03:09.940> they<00:03:10.000> don't<00:03:10.180> know<00:03:10.239> they're<00:03:10.450> playing

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
and they don't know they're playing

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.430 
and they don't know they're playing
sharps<00:03:10.959> flats<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:12.540> for<00:03:13.540> instance<00:03:13.900> this<00:03:14.140> starts

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
sharps flats so for instance this starts

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.509 
sharps flats so for instance this starts
on<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.590> G<00:03:14.890> we<00:03:15.640> have<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.790> tonic<00:03:16.269> in<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.720> a<00:03:16.810> scale<00:03:17.519> so

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
on a G we have a tonic in in a scale so

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.370 
on a G we have a tonic in in a scale so
it<00:03:18.579> means<00:03:18.730> it's<00:03:18.910> our<00:03:19.030> root<00:03:19.329> or<00:03:19.630> our<00:03:19.720> tonic<00:03:20.139> so

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
it means it's our root or our tonic so

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.440 
it means it's our root or our tonic so
starts<00:03:23.380> on<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.530> G<00:03:23.769> ends<00:03:24.130> on<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.250> G<00:03:24.489> -<00:03:24.880> G<00:03:24.910> major

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
starts on a G ends on a G - G major

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.720 
starts on a G ends on a G - G major
scale<00:03:25.780> we<00:03:26.319> want<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.620> move<00:03:26.769> this<00:03:26.859> to<00:03:27.040> G<00:03:27.250> sharp

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
scale we want to move this to G sharp

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.190 
scale we want to move this to G sharp
we<00:03:27.910> just<00:03:28.090> scooch<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.540> whole<00:03:28.660> thing<00:03:28.900> up<00:03:29.049> the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
we just scooch the whole thing up the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.150 
we just scooch the whole thing up the
third<00:03:29.440> position<00:03:29.650> so<00:03:31.169> that's<00:03:32.169> G<00:03:32.440> here's<00:03:32.919> G

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
third position so that's G here's G

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.600 
third position so that's G here's G
sharp

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.890 

here's<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:38.240> major<00:03:39.240> there's<00:03:39.960> a<00:03:40.140> sharp<00:03:40.470> major

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
here's a major there's a sharp major

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.680 
here's a major there's a sharp major
obviously<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.050> can<00:03:43.200> see<00:03:44.180> I'm<00:03:45.180> just<00:03:45.420> taking

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
BAM a sharp G flat BAM same form so

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.750 
BAM a sharp G flat BAM same form so
memorize<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.690> form<00:04:15.959> get<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.200> down<00:04:16.320> quickly
