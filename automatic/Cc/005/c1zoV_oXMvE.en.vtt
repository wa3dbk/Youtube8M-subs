00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
smaller moons have less gravity and so

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.160 
smaller moons have less gravity and so
they<00:01:41.220> may<00:01:41.400> not<00:01:41.640> pull<00:01:42.000> into<00:01:42.270> perfect<00:01:42.750> spheres

they may not pull into perfect spheres
