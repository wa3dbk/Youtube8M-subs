00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
person gave me this engine yesterday I

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.869 
person gave me this engine yesterday I
just<00:03:46.260> put<00:03:46.379> on<00:03:46.409> my<00:03:46.590> MTD<00:03:46.920> body<00:03:47.129> just<00:03:47.400> something

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
just put on my MTD body just something

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.940 
just put on my MTD body just something
to<00:03:47.970> hold<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.049> you<00:03:49.109> so<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.349> shaft<00:03:49.620> doesn't

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
to hold it to you so the shaft doesn't

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.319 
to hold it to you so the shaft doesn't
make<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.459> go<00:03:50.549> everywhere<00:03:50.849> I<00:03:51.560> think<00:03:53.060> if<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.209> can

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
make it go everywhere I think if I can

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.309 
make it go everywhere I think if I can
get<00:03:54.480> this<00:03:54.659> running

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
get this running

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.259 
get this running
I<00:03:55.349> think<00:03:55.829> it<00:03:55.980> has<00:03:56.129> no<00:03:56.609> it<00:03:56.700> doesn't<00:03:56.909> have<00:03:57.000> spark

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
I think it has no it doesn't have spark

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.780 
I think it has no it doesn't have spark
right<00:03:57.569> now<00:03:57.739> but<00:03:58.739> if<00:03:58.889> I<00:03:59.040> get<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.340> running<00:03:59.609> then

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
right now but if I get it running then

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.470 
right now but if I get it running then
I'll<00:03:59.909> just<00:04:00.030> put<00:04:00.599> this<00:04:00.720> engine<00:04:00.959> on<00:04:01.670> that<00:04:02.670> one

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
I'll just put this engine on that one

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.520 
I'll just put this engine on that one
there<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:03.720> then<00:04:03.930> I'll<00:04:04.049> just<00:04:04.170> have<00:04:04.260> another

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530
