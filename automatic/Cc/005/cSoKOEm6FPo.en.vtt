turbo<00:00:20.919> now<00:00:21.369> the<00:00:21.429> reason<00:00:21.789> we're<00:00:21.909> doing<00:00:22.119> that<00:00:22.269> is

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
turbo now the reason we're doing that is

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.659 
turbo now the reason we're doing that is
because<00:00:22.630> we<00:00:23.140> ran<00:00:23.380> a<00:00:23.409> little<00:00:23.679> too<00:00:24.039> much<00:00:24.279> boost

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
because we ran a little too much boost

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.970 
because we ran a little too much boost
if<00:00:25.060> there's<00:00:25.509> such<00:00:25.659> a<00:00:25.689> thing<00:00:25.810> and<00:00:26.259> definitely

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
if there's such a thing and definitely

here's<00:06:50.189> a<00:06:50.249> shot<00:06:50.550> of<00:06:50.580> the<00:06:50.729> engine<00:06:51.029> hook<00:06:51.210> with

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:51.389 
here's a shot of the engine hook with

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:53.179 
here's a shot of the engine hook with
the<00:06:51.479> engine<00:06:51.810> out<00:06:51.930> to<00:06:52.409> help<00:06:52.529> you<00:06:52.680> see<00:06:52.860> all<00:06:52.979> those

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:53.189 
the engine out to help you see all those

bolts<00:06:55.490> okay<00:06:56.520> summarize<00:06:57.210> what<00:06:57.389> we<00:06:57.509> done<00:06:57.719> so<00:06:57.960> far

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
bolts okay summarize what we done so far

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.409 
bolts okay summarize what we done so far
we<00:06:58.860> started<00:06:59.249> by<00:06:59.340> removing<00:06:59.490> that<00:06:59.699> strut<00:07:00.120> upper

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 
we started by removing that strut upper

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.239 
we started by removing that strut upper
brace<00:07:00.659> and<00:07:00.960> draining<00:07:01.560> the<00:07:01.590> engine<00:07:01.919> coolant

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:02.249 
brace and draining the engine coolant

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:04.429 
brace and draining the engine coolant
next<00:07:03.090> up<00:07:03.210> we<00:07:03.270> remove<00:07:03.569> those<00:07:03.719> engine<00:07:04.169> side

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:04.439 
next up we remove those engine side

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.409 
next up we remove those engine side
panels<00:07:04.949> and<00:07:05.340> got<00:07:05.520> that<00:07:05.699> engine<00:07:05.939> hood<00:07:06.180> out<00:07:06.330> of

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:06.419 
panels and got that engine hood out of

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:08.029 
panels and got that engine hood out of
our<00:07:06.569> way<00:07:06.719> I<00:07:06.900> cannot<00:07:07.590> tell<00:07:07.740> you<00:07:07.800> how<00:07:07.949> much

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 
our way I cannot tell you how much

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:10.399 
our way I cannot tell you how much
easier<00:07:08.460> a<00:07:08.490> time<00:07:08.789> you<00:07:09.270> will<00:07:09.389> have<00:07:09.569> without<00:07:10.199> that

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:10.409 
easier a time you will have without that

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:12.140 
easier a time you will have without that
engine<00:07:10.680> hood<00:07:10.830> in<00:07:10.979> your<00:07:11.099> way<00:07:11.250> it's<00:07:11.729> just<00:07:11.789> four

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
engine hood in your way it's just four

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.209 
engine hood in your way it's just four
bolts<00:07:12.479> so<00:07:12.840> get<00:07:12.990> that<00:07:13.139> thing<00:07:13.319> unfolded<00:07:13.830> you'll

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:14.219 
bolts so get that thing unfolded you'll

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:15.890 
bolts so get that thing unfolded you'll
have<00:07:14.340> much<00:07:14.610> easier<00:07:15.060> access<00:07:15.270> to<00:07:15.479> the<00:07:15.689> engine

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900

had<00:07:38.249> to<00:07:38.400> get<00:07:38.550> this<00:07:38.669> out<00:07:38.819> of<00:07:38.849> our<00:07:39.029> out<00:07:39.210> of<00:07:39.240> the

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:39.389 
had to get this out of our out of the

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:41.480 
had to get this out of our out of the
way<00:07:39.569> so<00:07:39.990> that<00:07:40.110> we<00:07:40.229> have<00:07:40.319> easy<00:07:40.560> access<00:07:40.800> to<00:07:41.430> the

time belt

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:44.570 
time belt
next<00:07:43.169> up<00:07:43.319> would<00:07:43.469> remove<00:07:43.680> the<00:07:43.860> exhaust<00:07:44.250> gas

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:44.580 
next up would remove the exhaust gas

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.850 
next up would remove the exhaust gas
recirculation<00:07:45.060> assembly<00:07:45.750> and<00:07:45.960> this<00:07:46.439> engine

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.760 
recirculation assembly and this engine
hook<00:07:47.039> with<00:07:47.339> about<00:07:47.550> a<00:07:47.580> million<00:07:47.849> bolts<00:07:48.300> in<00:07:48.419> it

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:48.770 
hook with about a million bolts in it

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.850 
hook with about a million bolts in it
finally<00:07:49.770> we<00:07:50.460> unbolted<00:07:51.089> the<00:07:51.240> throttle<00:07:51.569> body

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:51.860 
finally we unbolted the throttle body

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.439 
finally we unbolted the throttle body
from<00:07:52.860> chrome<00:07:53.129> now<00:07:53.669> I<00:07:53.729> know<00:07:53.849> the<00:07:54.029> position<00:07:54.360> I

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:54.449 
from chrome now I know the position I

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:57.079 
from chrome now I know the position I
like<00:07:54.479> my<00:07:54.779> throttle<00:07:55.169> in<00:07:55.289> wide-open<00:07:56.250> haha<00:07:56.639> now

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:57.089 
like my throttle in wide-open haha now

00:07:57.089 --> 00:07:59.540 
like my throttle in wide-open haha now
next<00:07:57.839> up<00:07:58.050> we<00:07:58.409> would<00:07:58.560> ruin<00:07:58.770> the<00:07:58.949> distributor

00:07:59.540 --> 00:07:59.550 
next up we would ruin the distributor

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.730 
next up we would ruin the distributor
the<00:07:59.939> coolant<00:08:00.389> neck<00:08:00.539> the<00:08:00.990> tort<00:08:01.289> of<00:08:01.409> variable

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:01.740 
the coolant neck the tort of variable

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.679 
the coolant neck the tort of variable
induction<00:08:02.159> system<00:08:02.490> actuators<00:08:03.089> and<00:08:03.270> then<00:08:03.569> the

00:08:03.679 --> 00:08:03.689 
induction system actuators and then the

00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:05.269 
induction system actuators and then the
brackets<00:08:04.139> holding<00:08:04.379> an<00:08:04.439> intake<00:08:04.680> manifold<00:08:05.159> on

brackets holding an intake manifold on

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:08.930 
brackets holding an intake manifold on
so<00:08:05.729> that<00:08:05.849> we<00:08:05.909> can<00:08:06.029> get<00:08:06.149> that<00:08:06.240> thing<00:08:06.509> unbolt
