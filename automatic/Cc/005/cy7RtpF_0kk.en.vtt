00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello friends in this video are you going to 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.620
 Learn how to turn a light bulb 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.380
 old mobile phone case and several components 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.870
 electronic in a mini plasma ball 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.880
 If you do not have a minimum knowledge of 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.650
 matter I ask you not to do this 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.359
 experiment because they can be very 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.970
 dangerous if not taken proper 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.550
 caution in any case if you decide 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.199
 do it you should ask for help from a person 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.529
 older who has knowledge of 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.529
 electronics 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.850
 we are going to need the following 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.430
 materials two diodes that can 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.950
 support 400 volts or more a 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.230
 200 ohm resistor that holds 2 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.980
 watts and a resistance of 100 ovens 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.989
 a condenser from a micro to gave 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.340
 650 volts any director who 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:54.340
 Support 400 volts or more a bulb 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.040
 230 volts a bulb holder a 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.370
 transformer that converts 230 volts 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.290
 from 6 to 12 volts a coil of 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.479
 ignition that can be extracted from 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.580
 any old vehicle that goes to 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.430
 gasoline you can get very 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.100
 easily from a scrapyard a bit of 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.970
 cable for lighting an old box 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.619
 mobile an electric soldering iron 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.340
 screwdrivers tip and pliers 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:24.350
 Cut tin for soldering and a lighter 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.659
 the scheme that you must do so that the 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.820
 plasma ball function is this can 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.619
 seem complicated but really like 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.020
 right away you'll see it's pretty easy to 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.000
 do and once done it works without having 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.590
 to make any kind of adjustments what 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.569
 first you have to keep in mind 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.539
 is the space that you have for 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.670
 assemble the circuit first such and 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.979
 As the diagram shows, we are going to unite a 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.740
 diode to one end of the winding 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.590
 primary to save space I'm going to 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.299
 bend your ends in this way before 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.090
 to unite him you must verify his 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.799
 orientation the white line is the cathode 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.369
 and it has to be soldered to the 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.369
 resistance 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.570
 we also join the other diode something 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.929
 secondary binary guiding it in the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.690
 same sense we weld the resistance of 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.569
 200 or less to the diode that is attached to 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.610
 primary winding we join the other 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.560
 resistance to the second diode 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.540
 the next step is to connect the 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.900
 condenser in its corresponding site 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.970
 according to the scheme 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.189
 we also put the three legs of the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.189
 director to the corresponding ends 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.070
 finally let's release the coil 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.070
 switched on 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.230
 we put all the components in the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.420
 box and he invented the circuit 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.400
 finally we make a hole in the lid 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.980
 top of the box and we connect the 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.650
 cable to lampholder 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.849
 our plasma ball is finished 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.849
 let's see how it works 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.200
 so that the effect looks good is 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.970
 advisable to turn off the lights I owe to 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.750
 say that by running your finger through the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.520
 light bulb electricity it shows a little 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.620
 on the other hand the one that the scheme has 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.270
 a transformer does not make it harmless 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.270
 since for all the components 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.510
 electronic circulate 220 volts 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.000
 so you must go very carefully to 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.190
 bring a low-energy bulb closer 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.530
 high voltage in titan double gases 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.320
 inside and in this way starts to 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.100
 issue the same thing happens if you 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.330
 we approach a phosphorescent lamp 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.489
 finally if this experiment has 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.739
 liked I ask you to tell the button me 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.080
 like and see the other videos of my 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.630
 channel 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.000
 also if they are not yet subscribed to 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.280
 channel cordially invite you to 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.850
 you do greetings and until the next 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.850
