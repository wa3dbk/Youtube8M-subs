alright so this video will be about the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.230 
alright so this video will be about the
camber<00:00:17.279> link<00:00:18.859> this<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.070> just<00:00:20.369> my<00:00:20.580> traxxas

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
camber link this is just my traxxas

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
on the ultimate RC forums so basically a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.830 
on the ultimate RC forums so basically a
kimber<00:00:29.910> adjust<00:00:30.570> how<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.700> tire<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:33.059> angled<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
kimber adjust how the tire is angled to

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.770 
kimber adjust how the tire is angled to
the<00:00:34.020> grounds<00:00:34.590> are<00:00:34.790> there<00:00:35.790> are<00:00:35.880> two<00:00:36.090> types<00:00:36.390> of

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the grounds are there are two types of

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.670 
the grounds are there are two types of
can<00:00:37.290> burn<00:00:37.530> positive<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.550> negative<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:40.290> front

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
can burn positive and negative the front

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.040 
can burn positive and negative the front
and<00:00:40.860> rear<00:00:41.100> are<00:00:41.520> two<00:00:42.180> different<00:00:42.629> types<00:00:42.809> of

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
and rear are two different types of

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.010 
and rear are two different types of
camber<00:00:44.000> with<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> front<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
camber with the front you have the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.279 
camber with the front you have the
positive<00:00:46.649> from<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.700> top<00:00:47.969> closer<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
positive from the top closer to the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.040 
positive from the top closer to the
chassis<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.489> rear<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
chassis but with the rear you have the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.130 
chassis but with the rear you have the
positive<00:00:52.590> side<00:00:52.879> with<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> bottom<00:00:54.360> closer<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
positive side with the bottom closer to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.110 
positive side with the bottom closer to
the<00:00:55.289> rear<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.980> they're<00:00:56.640> opposite<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.820> may

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the rear so they're opposite so you may

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.410 
the rear so they're opposite so you may
ask<00:01:00.390> what's<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> difference<00:01:01.440> between<00:01:01.530> a

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
ask what's the difference between a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.080 
ask what's the difference between a
positive<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.780> more<00:01:04.439> negative<00:01:04.650> camber<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
positive and more negative camber on the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.570 
positive and more negative camber on the
front<00:01:06.360> or<00:01:06.510> rear<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.740> when<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> more

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
front or rear so when you have a more

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.890 
front or rear so when you have a more
negative<00:01:08.880> camber<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.439> front<00:01:11.720> which<00:01:12.720> is

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
negative camber on the front which is

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.740 
negative camber on the front which is
when<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.380> top<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> tire<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.640> front<00:01:15.600> is

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
when the top of the tire in the front is

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.310 
when the top of the tire in the front is
farther<00:01:16.409> away<00:01:16.439> from<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.920> chassis<00:01:18.320> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
farther away from the chassis you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.390 
farther away from the chassis you
basically<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:20.040> more<00:01:20.369> steering<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:22.250> in<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
basically have more steering but in the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.300 
basically have more steering but in the
rear<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.630> negative<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
rear when you have the negative with the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.550 
rear when you have the negative with the
top<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> tire<00:01:27.360> closer<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> shock<00:01:28.259> or

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
top of the tire closer to the shock or

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.020 
top of the tire closer to the shock or
chassis<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.820> decrease<00:01:30.540> rear<00:01:30.930> traction

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
chassis you decrease rear traction

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.969 
chassis you decrease rear traction
entering<00:01:33.140> corners<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> when<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.619> more

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
entering corners so when you have a more

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.730 
entering corners so when you have a more
positive<00:01:38.640> or<00:01:40.520> strict<00:01:41.520> more<00:01:41.759> vertical<00:01:42.740> camber

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
positive or strict more vertical camber

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.310 
positive or strict more vertical camber
in<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:45.689> front<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.380> less<00:01:46.740> steering<00:01:48.320> but

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
in the front you have less steering but

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.910 
in the front you have less steering but
you<00:01:49.649> increase<00:01:50.220> rear<00:01:50.610> traction<00:01:51.920> entering

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
you increase rear traction entering

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.080 
you increase rear traction entering
corners<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.640> such<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.930> basically<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:56.090> setups

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
corners and such so basically I setups

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.649 
corners and such so basically I setups
do<00:01:57.540> really<00:01:57.930> matter<00:01:59.299> even<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.390> small<00:02:00.570> change<00:02:01.079> can

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
do really matter even a small change can

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.050 
do really matter even a small change can
make<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.869> car<00:02:04.229> or<00:02:04.560> kit<00:02:05.130> control<00:02:05.670> differently

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
make the car or kit control differently

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.680 
make the car or kit control differently
so<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.690> test<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.140> out<00:02:10.289> and

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
so just test that out and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.260 
so just test that out and
you<00:02:12.080> begin<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:12.830> start<00:02:13.310> understanding<00:02:13.730> what

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
you begin to start understanding what

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.580 
you begin to start understanding what
kind<00:02:14.600> of<00:02:14.660> setups<00:02:14.990> you'll<00:02:15.800> like<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:18.200> thanks<00:02:18.500> for

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
kind of setups you'll like so thanks for

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.150 
kind of setups you'll like so thanks for
