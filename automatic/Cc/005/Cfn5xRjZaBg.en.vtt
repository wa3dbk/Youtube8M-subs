00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.490
 with the pad rock and in the selection I will be 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.120
 demonstrating three exercises 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.359
 Okay, it's gonna help you get it. 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.660
 speed both the single debuted and 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.720
 I give the fruits or it is a simple touch and 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.619
 the double touch beauty 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.650
 first of all the posture you go 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:37.020
 find on facebook what is facebook.com 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.520
 bar gerson lima son videos ok and the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.160
 link is also in the description that the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.020
 youtube and enjoy it there to give a like 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.780
 to give strength and share with 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.950
 your bacteria friends and percussionist 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.600
 ok let's go then the first exercise and 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:58.109
 will work the way you do 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.809
 already must have seen is or not more so 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.489
 I think important legal will have these by 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.519
 simpler it is, it gives a 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.439
 cool result as will be the first 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.890
 first we will work time 1 and 2 with 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.710
 couchÃª are two notes per time and in 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.970
 time point 3 and 4 with the four sixteenth 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.130
 notes the time but the order of the hands 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.460
 manipulations to function properly 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.110
 we will do the first 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.659
 and second time in stables we by 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.360
 time alternating with the single debuted 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.189
 which would be with 12 which at time 3 and 4 uses 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.280
 at five full 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.720
 we'll do the single show that still only 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.500
 four hours by time 31 to whom much 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.960
 care for wrist forceps and avoid using the arm 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.439
 you start turning into a robot that has 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.770
 something is wrong, it 's always cool, you? 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.040
 also discuss commenting this is under 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.979
 this application that the teacher is 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.950
 analyze your posture okay so it's a lot 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.140
 It is important for you to have a 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.129
 good training so you can take 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.819
 this support 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:26.629
 beauty is then applying will stay 12 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:33.349
 3 4 1 2 3 1 to 1 234 which avoids 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:37.609
 for example one is then one 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:41.019
 reflect yes or no more 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.019
 not so good 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:58.340
 I could have trained this is that way you 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.500
 you can reverse your hands by keeping left 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.079
 right and left and right and four 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.639
 obtained notes still beginning with the 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:11.859
 left to the same exercise starting 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.859
 Whatever you want then he'll stay 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.280
 and then you can increase right and nor is 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.799
 cool also work with dynamics 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:39.250
 train so much exercise the way 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:39.250
 low bass medium fast 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.199
 the aap not strong 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:59.610
 ok and it's increasing speed and touch 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.530
 exercise two years dow the Stroud 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.530
 double tap ok 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.770
 we will use the same idea with two with 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.890
 full of the two beats a time and 2 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.570
 time 3 and 4 and 5 x 4 beats 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.840
 only now twice the first time 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:36.750
 we will have 12 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:43.980
 there 31 to 27 11 and 24 almost touching a shape 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:49.500
 very relaxed and rebounding here to speak 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:52.340
 Be careful not to hurt your arm here. 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.340
 little faster 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.440
 Are you sure you can do that too? 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.980
 same idea of watching one and 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.560
 hands 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:14.520
 so it's left left 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:19.740
 right and left tvv funny talk 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:23.190
 of an ok clan will have on hand 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:26.070
 this exercise two exercises 3 you 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:30.060
 will now mix the single with the 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:33.090
 Mute then you will do right 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:41.280
 left right left time with two 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:45.620
 notes are there you use of bo the time three 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.760
 and four you will join then you will stay 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.890
 4 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.310
 The only thing you get with cingo 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:55.320
 on both thighs 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:06:01.110
 the two times using the thighs do not 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:13.080
 will stay with 23 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:15.960
 with the 1 to 1 with the fastest 123 caa 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:27.240
 both 30 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:33.810
 okay okay careful hands to avoid 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:36.300
 situations are avoiding the arm too much 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.550
 important that in case you will train 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.780
 much time has in speed is with 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:47.430
 arm may end up causing serious injury 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:49.590
 what studies with good weather then 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.720
 this was three variations 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:55.470
 I hope you enjoyed helping your father 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.490
 share this video with the galley 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:00.260
 and this is it 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.260
