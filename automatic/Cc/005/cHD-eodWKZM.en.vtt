here that the comb is built on by the
bees<00:01:46.479> this<00:01:47.050> is<00:01:47.200> what<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.440> comb<00:01:47.650> would<00:01:47.830> look

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
like when it's inside the hive there's a

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.250

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.820 
reason the comb is shaped in this V
shape<00:02:00.070> is<00:02:00.670> because<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.540> box<00:02:01.780> itself<00:02:02.229> has<00:02:02.560> that

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
shape is because the box itself has that

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.460 
shape is because the box itself has that
V<00:02:03.070> shape<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.670> cavity<00:02:04.060> so<00:02:04.330> these<00:02:05.110> bars

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
V shape to the cavity so these bars

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.770 
V shape to the cavity so these bars
basically<00:02:05.860> make<00:02:06.310> up<00:02:06.490> what<00:02:07.000> would<00:02:07.150> be<00:02:07.330> the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
basically make up what would be the

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.130 
basically make up what would be the
inside<00:02:08.350> ceiling<00:02:09.100> for<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.670> bees<00:02:09.910> each<00:02:10.810> one

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
inside ceiling for the bees each one

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.190 
inside ceiling for the bees each one
fits<00:02:11.560> tight<00:02:11.890> together<00:02:12.100> side-by-side<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:13.570> a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
fits tight together side-by-side and a

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.290 
fits tight together side-by-side and a
cavity<00:02:14.440> inside<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.130> where<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.400> bees<00:02:15.610> live<00:02:15.970> and

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
cavity inside is where the bees live and

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.020 
cavity inside is where the bees live and
build<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.900> comb<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:18.340> we<00:02:18.459> might<00:02:18.610> put<00:02:18.820> one

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
build the comb so we might put one

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.420 
build the comb so we might put one
collar<00:02:19.300> board<00:02:19.690> at<00:02:19.810> one<00:02:19.959> end<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.850> then<00:02:22.330> put

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
collar board at one end and then put

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.750 
collar board at one end and then put
eight<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.670> ten<00:02:24.910> bars<00:02:25.950> for<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.040> bees<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.370> build

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
eight to ten bars for the bees to build

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.800 
eight to ten bars for the bees to build
comb<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.959> put<00:02:29.230> another<00:02:29.470> follower<00:02:29.890> board<00:02:30.810> to

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
comb and put another follower board to

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.420 
comb and put another follower board to
limit<00:02:32.140> their<00:02:32.260> cavity<00:02:32.650> space<00:02:32.769> so<00:02:33.160> they're<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:33.370> a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
limit their cavity space so they're in a

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
limit their cavity space so they're in a
smaller<00:02:33.790> area<00:02:34.920> as<00:02:35.920> they<00:02:36.250> grow<00:02:36.459> you<00:02:37.090> just<00:02:37.269> move

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
smaller area as they grow you just move

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.449 
smaller area as they grow you just move
the<00:02:37.480> follower<00:02:37.900> cord<00:02:38.170> out<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.650> put<00:02:39.190> in<00:02:39.310> new

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
the follower cord out and put in new

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.270 
the follower cord out and put in new
bars<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.269> they<00:02:41.260> continue<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.709> build<00:02:41.890> out<00:02:42.100> on

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
bars and they continue to build out on

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.940 
bars and they continue to build out on
these<00:02:42.420> when<00:02:43.420> you're<00:02:43.570> inspecting<00:02:43.959> in<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.739> top

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
these when you're inspecting in a top

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.580 
these when you're inspecting in a top
bar<00:02:45.160> hive<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.820> actually<00:02:46.390> start<00:02:46.690> at<00:02:46.780> one<00:02:46.959> end<00:02:47.230> I

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
bar hive you actually start at one end I

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.610 
bar hive you actually start at one end I
see<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.489> lot<00:02:48.730> of<00:02:48.760> new<00:02:49.269> beekeepers<00:02:49.959> starting<00:02:50.470> out

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
see a lot of new beekeepers starting out

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.320 
see a lot of new beekeepers starting out
and<00:02:50.860> they<00:02:50.950> grab<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.190> bar<00:02:51.489> from<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.820> middle

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
and they grab a bar from the middle

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.380 
and they grab a bar from the middle
pull<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.540> out<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.640> 90<00:02:54.640> percent<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.180> time

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
pull it out and 90 percent of the time

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.350 
pull it out and 90 percent of the time
they'll<00:02:55.690> break<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.230> comb<00:02:56.770> off<00:02:57.100> so<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.090> trick

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
they'll break that comb off so the trick

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.690 
they'll break that comb off so the trick
is<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:59.170> move<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.650> follower<00:03:00.010> board<00:03:00.340> out<00:03:00.550> of<00:03:00.610> the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
is to move the follower board out of the

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.570 
is to move the follower board out of the
way<00:03:01.650> then<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.740> can<00:03:02.890> take<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.070> peek<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:03.490> there

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
way then you can take a peek in there

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.460 
way then you can take a peek in there
and<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:03.760> can<00:03:03.910> see<00:03:04.150> if<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.510> comb<00:03:04.960> is<00:03:05.140> attached

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
and you can see if that comb is attached

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.140 
and you can see if that comb is attached
to<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.770> walls<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.340> can<00:03:06.370> cut<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:06.760> free<00:03:07.000> and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
to the walls and you can cut it free and

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.750 
to the walls and you can cut it free and
then<00:03:07.210> you<00:03:07.300> can<00:03:07.510> move<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:08.110> bar<00:03:08.410> over<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:09.670> you

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
then you can move that bar over and you

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.850 
then you can move that bar over and you
work<00:03:10.030> from<00:03:10.300> one<00:03:10.540> end<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.320> other

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
work from one end to the other

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.250 
work from one end to the other
lifting<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.910> comb<00:03:13.120> out<00:03:13.330> or<00:03:13.720> example<00:03:14.140> this

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
lifting the comb out or example this

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.630 
lifting the comb out or example this
comb<00:03:14.530> might<00:03:14.770> be<00:03:14.890> sitting<00:03:15.220> in<00:03:15.750> like<00:03:16.750> this<00:03:17.640> so

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
comb might be sitting in like this so

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.850 
comb might be sitting in like this so
when<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.090> pull<00:03:19.330> it<00:03:19.420> out<00:03:19.540> you'll<00:03:20.410> be<00:03:20.440> covered

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
when you pull it out you'll be covered

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.890 
when you pull it out you'll be covered
with<00:03:21.010> bees<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:22.090> can<00:03:22.240> take<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.420> look<00:03:22.630> at<00:03:22.780> it

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.340 
with bees and you can take a look at it
it's<00:03:23.740> a<00:03:23.800> very<00:03:23.980> simple<00:03:24.280> hive<00:03:24.610> design<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.390> it's

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
here and you can see the bees and the

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.210 
here and you can see the bees and the
comb<00:03:43.450> without<00:03:44.170> having<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.500> open<00:03:44.650> anything<00:03:44.950> up

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
comb without having to open anything up

so<00:03:45.550> you<00:03:46.209> can<00:03:46.420> don't<00:03:46.570> disturb<00:03:46.990> the<00:03:47.170> bees<00:03:47.350> at<00:03:47.590> all

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
so you can don't disturb the bees at all

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.550 
so you can don't disturb the bees at all
but<00:03:48.340> you<00:03:48.400> can<00:03:48.550> see<00:03:48.790> how<00:03:49.060> things<00:03:49.270> are<00:03:49.420> going<00:03:49.560> and

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
but you can see how things are going and

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.910 
but you can see how things are going and
if<00:03:51.130> they<00:03:51.250> need<00:03:51.400> more<00:03:51.520> space<00:03:52.740> this<00:03:53.740> is<00:03:53.890> a

inspection on these types of hives is

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.620 
inspection on these types of hives is
when<00:05:13.140> you<00:05:13.230> remove<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.740> comb<00:05:13.980> they<00:05:14.850> can<00:05:15.180> attach
