00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
contemplate as John Muir did the great

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.609 
contemplate as John Muir did the great
naturalist<00:01:32.000> what<00:01:32.540> one<00:01:32.810> drop<00:01:33.140> of<00:01:33.170> water

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
naturalist what one drop of water

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.240 
naturalist what one drop of water
flowing<00:01:34.220> down<00:01:34.670> from<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:35.210> snowmelt

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.150 

I<00:01:44.610> think<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.600> traffic<00:01:45.960> jams<00:01:46.170> are<00:01:46.410> an

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
I think the traffic jams are an

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.480 
I think the traffic jams are an
important<00:01:47.730> part<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.180> democracy<00:01:49.160> if<00:01:50.160> there

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
important part of democracy if there

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.550 
important part of democracy if there
were<00:01:50.610> no<00:01:50.760> traffic<00:01:51.180> jams<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.930> national<00:01:52.320> parks

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
were no traffic jams the national parks

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.410 
were no traffic jams the national parks
would<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.830> no<00:01:52.980> constituency<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
would have no constituency and then the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.260 
would have no constituency and then the
next<00:01:54.690> time<00:01:54.900> somebody<00:01:55.800> wants<00:01:56.010> to<00:01:56.220> dam<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> river

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
next time somebody wants to dam a river

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.360 
next time somebody wants to dam a river
