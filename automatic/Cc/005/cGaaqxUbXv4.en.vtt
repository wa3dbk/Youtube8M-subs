I<00:00:43.550> then<00:00:44.550> Tom<00:00:44.879> doubt<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.890> top<00:00:46.890> section<00:00:47.460> he'll

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
I then Tom doubt the top section he'll

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.310 
I then Tom doubt the top section he'll
unduly<00:00:48.769> and<00:00:49.769> drill<00:00:50.580> the<00:00:50.730> hole<00:00:50.989> down<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.230> the

I<00:01:07.950> started<00:01:08.549> my<00:01:08.700> team<00:01:08.940> in<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.120> shipyards<00:01:09.690> and<00:01:10.010> I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
I started my team in the shipyards and I

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.080 
I started my team in the shipyards and I
basically<00:01:11.220> use<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> couple<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.940> different

through
what's<00:01:50.760> the<00:01:50.850> way<00:01:50.970> hot<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:52.100> you'll<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.310> what's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
what's the way hot and you'll see what's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.110 
what's the way hot and you'll see what's
so<00:01:54.660> job<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.140> stand<00:01:55.410> out<00:01:55.560> no<00:01:56.040> there<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.910> no

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
so job it stand out no there is no

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.360 
so job it stand out no there is no
chance<00:01:57.150> matul<00:01:57.900> was<00:01:58.110> going<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.320> cut<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.650> the

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
chance matul was going to cut that the

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.110 
chance matul was going to cut that the
hell<00:01:59.640> face<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.120> odds<00:02:00.300> are<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:01.080> he<00:02:01.380> said<00:02:01.620> half

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
hell face and odds are as he said half

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.270 
hell face and odds are as he said half
since<00:02:03.120> I<00:02:03.210> put<00:02:03.360> my<00:02:03.450> till<00:02:03.659> until<00:02:04.050> I<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.350> took

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
since I put my till until I just took

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.059 
since I put my till until I just took
the<00:02:05.490> edge<00:02:05.820> right<00:02:06.150> offer<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.750> was<00:02:06.840> useless

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
the edge right offer and it was useless

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.520 
the edge right offer and it was useless
so<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.519> sort<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.879> cheated<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.569> what<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.780> did<00:02:10.050> was

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
so I sort of cheated and what I did was

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.149 
so I sort of cheated and what I did was
I<00:02:11.009> say<00:02:11.790> out<00:02:11.940> my<00:02:12.180> grain<00:02:12.510> done<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.989> as<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.069> was

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
I say out my grain done and as it was

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.920 
I say out my grain done and as it was
spinning<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.640> quite<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.849> fast<00:02:15.120> speed<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.750> took

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
spinning that quite a fast speed I took

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.070 
spinning that quite a fast speed I took
the<00:02:16.230> grinder<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.620> up<00:02:16.940> no<00:02:17.940> don't<00:02:18.390> recommend<00:02:18.870> us

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
the grinder to up no don't recommend us

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.619 
the grinder to up no don't recommend us
and<00:02:19.440> if<00:02:20.129> you<00:02:20.250> do<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.730> get<00:02:20.819> involved<00:02:21.180> then

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
and if you do it you get involved then

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.559 
and if you do it you get involved then
you're<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> twat<00:02:22.470> just<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.099> I<00:02:23.250> was<00:02:23.430> dinner<00:02:23.790> but

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
you're a twat just like I was dinner but

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.580 
you're a twat just like I was dinner but
here<00:02:25.190> itself<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.370> person's<00:02:26.909> done<00:02:27.030> their<00:02:27.209> job

here itself the person's done their job
there's<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.650> wee<00:02:28.860> bit<00:02:29.129> of<00:02:29.280> porosity<00:02:29.670> just<00:02:30.620> on

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
there's a wee bit of porosity just on

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.740 
there's a wee bit of porosity just on
the<00:02:31.920> face<00:02:32.129> of<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.519> you<00:02:32.940> receive<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.510> black

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
the face of that you receive a black

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.250 
the face of that you receive a black
mark<00:02:34.190> will<00:02:35.190> see<00:02:35.430> if<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.299> going<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.900> affect

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
mark will see if that is going to affect

some<00:05:41.520> relief<00:05:42.449> and<00:05:42.689> going<00:05:42.959> draw<00:05:43.169> for<00:05:43.349> issue<00:05:43.499> so

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
some relief and going draw for issue so

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.489 
some relief and going draw for issue so
I<00:05:44.009> can<00:05:44.219> make<00:05:44.490> up<00:05:44.519> numerous<00:05:44.849> ones<00:05:45.240> of<00:05:45.389> ease<00:05:45.569> as<00:05:46.439> I

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:46.499 
I can make up numerous ones of ease as I

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:50.149 
I can make up numerous ones of ease as I
go<00:05:46.800> along<00:05:46.919> and<00:05:47.779> it<00:05:48.779> simply<00:05:49.229> fits<00:05:49.469> into<00:05:50.009> the<00:05:50.129> top

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
go along and it simply fits into the top

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:57.589 
go along and it simply fits into the top
a<00:05:50.809> field<00:05:51.809> and<00:05:52.249> then<00:05:53.249> the<00:05:53.639> whole<00:05:53.819> thing<00:05:56.599> fits

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
a field and then the whole thing fits

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:02.179 
a field and then the whole thing fits
into<00:05:58.050> there<00:05:58.379> and<00:05:58.999> the<00:06:00.529> ball<00:06:01.529> side<00:06:01.769> me<00:06:02.039> to

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:02.189 
into there and the ball side me to

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.179 
into there and the ball side me to
adjust<00:06:02.309> that's<00:06:02.759> up<00:06:02.909> and<00:06:03.089> down<00:06:03.740> so<00:06:04.740> get

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:05.189 
adjust that's up and down so get

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:08.509 
adjust that's up and down so get
invertible<00:06:05.819> amount<00:06:06.089> of<00:06:06.330> v<00:06:06.719> of<00:06:07.649> movement

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:08.519 
invertible amount of v of movement

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:11.149 
invertible amount of v of movement
enough<00:06:08.729> and<00:06:09.439> we'll<00:06:10.439> see<00:06:10.649> here<00:06:10.800> that<00:06:10.919> what's

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:11.159 
enough and we'll see here that what's

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:12.529 
enough and we'll see here that what's
going<00:06:11.399> to<00:06:11.459> start<00:06:11.639> using<00:06:11.879> that<00:06:11.969> i'll<00:06:12.149> maybe<00:06:12.269> put

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
going to start using that i'll maybe put

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.080 
going to start using that i'll maybe put
a<00:06:12.569> clip<00:06:12.779> on<00:06:13.039> me<00:06:14.240> walking

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
a clip on me walking
