00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.139
 In order to achieve small tolerance holes, it is important to choose the correct cutting method. 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.819
 It is well known that when using slender tools larger than four times the tool diameter, 

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:21.869
 Since the mast is prone to skew, it is difficult to machine high quality parts. 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.969
 Therefore, the unstable processing process increases the risk of waste. 0:00:25.969, 0:00:32.660 It is not easy to choose the correct depth of cut. It usually takes many passes to complete. 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.350
 Now Sandvik Coromant offers you a solution, using our Silent Tool to dampen the mast and combine our 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.660
 The three-passing method is easy to implement. 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.520
 Let us now demonstrate the use of a 10x diameter damping mast. 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.050
 To process a 56 mm hole with a tolerance of H7. 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:01.580
 When using our three-pass method, we first need to measure the current hole diameter. 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:10.570
 Now you can calculate the depth of cut for the first pass and program the input values. 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:32.450
 Next, measure the diameter again after completing the first cut, calculate and program the new value. 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.490
 Now we can make the last cut 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.490
 Measure the diameter and calculate and program the last value. 0:02:08.549,0:02:12.919 When we compare the finished diameter to the target size, you can be pleasantly surprised to find that it only takes three passes. 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:18.059
 A hole with a tolerance of H7 is realized. 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:19.869
 in conclusion: 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:24.479
 To achieve small hole tolerances, use our Silent Tool to dampen the mast. 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.370
 At the same time, it is supplemented by three passes. 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.059
 The combination is characterized by: Small tolerances for safety 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:34.939
 Excellent surface quality and part quality 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.999
 Reliable processing 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:42.899
