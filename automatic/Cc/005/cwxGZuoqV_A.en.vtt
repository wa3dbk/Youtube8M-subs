00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
and so it's a flash game it's a puzzle

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.150 
and so it's a flash game it's a puzzle
platformer<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:18.990> two<00:00:19.650> modes<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.010> play

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
platformer you have two modes of play

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.550 
platformer you have two modes of play
you<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.640> mode<00:00:21.390> rears<00:00:21.779> kind<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.199> solving

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
you have this mode rears kind of solving

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.650 
you have this mode rears kind of solving
a<00:00:22.650> sliding<00:00:23.130> tile<00:00:23.310> puzzle<00:00:23.730> but<00:00:24.269> you're<00:00:24.420> doing

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
a sliding tile puzzle but you're doing

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.320 
a sliding tile puzzle but you're doing
that<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.289> can<00:00:25.590> move<00:00:26.000> the<00:00:27.000> character

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
that so that you can move the character

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.450 
that so that you can move the character
around<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.960> world<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.130> can<00:00:29.279> collect

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
around the world so that you can collect

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.299 
around the world so that you can collect
various<00:00:30.269> items<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> key<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
various items like you have a key and

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.760 
various items like you have a key and
then<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.329> get<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> door<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.170> finish

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
then you can get to the door to finish

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.830 
then you can get to the door to finish
the<00:00:34.860> level<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.600> you<00:00:36.600> need<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:37.520> play<00:00:38.520> both

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
the level so you need to play both

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.410 
the level so you need to play both
simultaneously<00:00:39.840> or<00:00:40.469> alternatingly<00:00:41.420> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
simultaneously or alternatingly to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.170 
simultaneously or alternatingly to
advance<00:00:43.309> so

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.420 

there's<00:00:48.810> we<00:00:49.080> have<00:00:49.200> kind<00:00:49.830> of<00:00:49.890> two<00:00:50.100> types<00:00:50.310> of

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
there's we have kind of two types of

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.520 
there's we have kind of two types of
levels<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:50.970> these<00:00:51.630> longer<00:00:52.170> more

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
levels we have these longer more

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.140 
levels we have these longer more
maze-like<00:00:52.710> levels<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:55.080> I<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.740> skip<00:00:56.150> we

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
maze-like levels and then I can skip we

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.420 
maze-like levels and then I can skip we
have<00:00:57.300> some<00:00:57.570> shorter<00:00:57.870> levels<00:00:58.340> where<00:00:59.340> you

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
have some shorter levels where you

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.640 
have some shorter levels where you
actually<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.080> kind<00:01:01.080> of<00:01:01.170> more<00:01:01.290> figure<00:01:01.530> out

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
actually have to kind of more figure out

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.520 
actually have to kind of more figure out
like<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.190> key<00:01:02.400> concept<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.870> one<00:01:04.050> it's<00:01:04.350> kind

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
like a key concept so this one it's kind

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:16.590 
like a key concept so this one it's kind
of<00:01:04.620> using<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:04.979> room<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.550> as<00:01:05.700> an<00:01:05.790> elevator

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.690 

okay<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:19.470> then<00:01:20.470> we<00:01:20.560> have<00:01:20.650> these<00:01:20.950> more<00:01:21.189> kind<00:01:21.670> of

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
okay so then we have these more kind of

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.980 
okay so then we have these more kind of
levels<00:01:21.970> that<00:01:22.060> are<00:01:22.119> really<00:01:22.420> just<00:01:22.600> about<00:01:22.750> trying

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
levels that are really just about trying

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.090 
levels that are really just about trying
to<00:01:23.110> figure<00:01:23.320> out<00:01:23.380> what<00:01:23.590> exactly<00:01:23.680> you're

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
to figure out what exactly you're

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.440 
to figure out what exactly you're
supposed<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:24.369> do<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:24.940> can't<00:01:25.150> really<00:01:25.240> go

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
supposed to do you can't really go

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.510 
supposed to do you can't really go
anywhere<00:01:25.479> until<00:01:26.409> you<00:01:26.650> figure<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:26.920> out<00:01:27.070> so<00:01:27.310> it's

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
anywhere until you figure it out so it's

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.890 
anywhere until you figure it out so it's
a<00:01:27.610> lot<00:01:27.729> of<00:01:27.880> thinking<00:01:28.180> but<00:01:28.330> not<00:01:28.479> really<00:01:28.630> doing

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
a lot of thinking but not really doing

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.300 
a lot of thinking but not really doing
anything<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.649> then<00:01:29.860> you<00:01:29.920> kind<00:01:30.070> of<00:01:30.100> come<00:01:30.220> up

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
anything and then you kind of come up

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.510 
anything and then you kind of come up
with<00:01:30.399> a<00:01:30.479> kind<00:01:31.479> of<00:01:31.570> aha<00:01:31.810> moment<00:01:32.460> when<00:01:33.460> you

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
with a kind of aha moment when you

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.630 
with a kind of aha moment when you
finish<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:35.229> ris<00:01:35.590> is<00:01:35.830> only<00:01:36.039> demo<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.520> real

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
finish the ris is only demo the real

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.789 
finish the ris is only demo the real
games<00:01:36.850> 32<00:01:37.240> levels<00:01:37.570> long<00:01:37.750> have<00:01:38.350> you<00:01:38.530> considered

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
games 32 levels long have you considered

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.410 
games 32 levels long have you considered
developing<00:01:39.340> for<00:01:39.490> netbooks<00:01:39.789> before<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.090> bullied

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
developing for netbooks before I bullied

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.170 
developing for netbooks before I bullied
you<00:01:40.619> well<00:01:41.619> we<00:01:42.009> intentionally<00:01:42.340> I<00:01:42.580> mean<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:43.000> runs

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
you well we intentionally I mean it runs

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.420 
you well we intentionally I mean it runs
at<00:01:43.270> 640<00:01:43.630> by<00:01:43.720> 480<00:01:44.049> so<00:01:44.289> we<00:01:44.590> wanted<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.310> be

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
at 640 by 480 so we wanted it to be

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.399 
at 640 by 480 so we wanted it to be
small<00:01:46.000> so<00:01:46.060> that<00:01:46.330> it<00:01:46.509> would<00:01:46.600> work<00:01:46.720> on<00:01:46.899> laptops

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
small so that it would work on laptops

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.919 
small so that it would work on laptops
so<00:01:47.680> we<00:01:47.799> intentionally<00:01:48.789> designed<00:01:49.060> for<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.630> it

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
so we intentionally designed for that it

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.800 
so we intentionally designed for that it
only<00:01:50.259> is<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.649> keyboard<00:01:51.039> so<00:01:51.310> that's<00:01:51.720> good<00:01:52.720> as

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
only is the keyboard so that's good as

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.200 
only is the keyboard so that's good as
well<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:52.990> guess
