 next mission of 2000 and 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.860
 the cup 16

 now a professor at the University of Michigan and current 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.610
 person becomes the scientist of crestana 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.729
 first of all I would very much like to go away because the competition for this 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.690
 right project 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.770

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.560
 something you can use to help save science the cost to the
