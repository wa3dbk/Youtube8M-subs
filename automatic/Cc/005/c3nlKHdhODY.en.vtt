explanation<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.700> how<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.719> power<00:00:34.170> reserve

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
explanation on how the power reserve

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.119 
explanation on how the power reserve
works<00:00:36.200> first<00:00:37.200> let's<00:00:37.500> learn<00:00:37.649> how<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.920> adjust

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
works first let's learn how to adjust

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.280 
works first let's learn how to adjust
the<00:00:38.520> date<00:00:39.500> start<00:00:40.500> by<00:00:40.770> pulling<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.850> crown<00:00:42.290> to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the date start by pulling the crown to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.869 
the date start by pulling the crown to
the<00:00:43.469> first<00:00:43.890> position<00:00:46.070> at<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.309> first<00:00:47.670> is

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the first position at the first is

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.319 
the first position at the first is
position<00:00:48.690> roll<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.800> crown<00:00:50.100> towards<00:00:50.460> your

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
position roll the crown towards your

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.720 
position roll the crown towards your
body<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.140> you'll<00:00:52.710> notice<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> date

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
body and you'll notice that the date

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.619 
body and you'll notice that the date
wheel<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.329> advancing<00:00:56.149> once<00:00:57.149> you've<00:00:57.390> reached

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
wheel is advancing once you've reached

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.160 
wheel is advancing once you've reached
your<00:00:57.750> desired<00:00:58.280> date<00:00:59.280> go<00:00:59.850> ahead<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.390> place<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
your desired date go ahead and place the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.649 
your desired date go ahead and place the
crown<00:01:01.440> back<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.250> towards<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> case

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
crown back in towards the case

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.530 
crown back in towards the case
you<00:01:05.229> have<00:01:05.350> completed<00:01:05.799> adjusting<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.579> dates

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.310 

let's<00:01:10.170> now<00:01:10.350> show<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.740> how<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.100> adjust<00:01:11.550> time<00:01:12.320> go

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
let's now show you how to adjust time go

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.280 
let's now show you how to adjust time go
ahead<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.860> pull<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.370> crown<00:01:14.730> out<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
ahead and pull the crown out to the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.250 
ahead and pull the crown out to the
second<00:01:16.740> position<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.960> depending<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
second position and depending on the

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.980 
second position and depending on the
direction<00:01:19.440> of<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.370> crown<00:01:20.700> turn<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.810> will

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
direction of the crown turn you will

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.200 
direction of the crown turn you will
notice<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.830> will<00:01:22.920> either<00:01:23.190> go<00:01:23.520> forward<00:01:24.030> or

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
notice that it will either go forward or

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.930 
notice that it will either go forward or
reverse<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.440> time<00:01:28.280> around<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> 12<00:01:29.700> o'clock

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
reverse in time around the 12 o'clock

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.930 
reverse in time around the 12 o'clock
position<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.870> will<00:01:30.960> see<00:01:31.260> a<00:01:31.290> gauge<00:01:31.800> from<00:01:32.250> 0<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
position you will see a gauge from 0 to

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.550 
position you will see a gauge from 0 to
40<00:01:34.040> that<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.220> your<00:01:35.400> power<00:01:35.610> reserve<00:01:36.180> indicator

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
40 that is your power reserve indicator

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
40 that is your power reserve indicator
which<00:01:37.560> works<00:01:37.890> very<00:01:38.010> similarly<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:39.180> gas

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
which works very similarly to a gas

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.460 
which works very similarly to a gas
gauge<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.350> your<00:01:40.470> car<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:42.810> were<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.229> watch

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
gauge in your car as you were the watch

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.880 
gauge in your car as you were the watch
you're<00:01:44.160> basically<00:01:44.900> fueling<00:01:45.900> or<00:01:46.140> you're

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
you're basically fueling or you're

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.810 
you're basically fueling or you're
basically<00:01:47.340> winding<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.560> spring<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.890> you'll

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
basically winding the spring and you'll

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.840 
basically winding the spring and you'll
notice<00:01:51.120> that<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:52.020> gauge<00:01:52.260> will<00:01:52.950> go<00:01:53.250> towards

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
notice that the gauge will go towards

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.310 
notice that the gauge will go towards
the<00:01:53.970> 40<00:01:54.390> as<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.780> wear<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:56.510> when<00:01:57.510> you<00:01:57.540> take<00:01:58.050> off

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the 40 as you wear it when you take off

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.490 
the 40 as you wear it when you take off
the<00:01:58.560> wash<00:01:58.770> depending<00:01:59.729> on<00:01:59.910> what<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.840> set<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
the wash depending on what is set on the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.940 
the wash depending on what is set on the
gauge<00:02:01.740> for<00:02:02.070> example<00:02:02.580> if<00:02:02.790> there's<00:02:03.090> 10<00:02:03.710> units<00:02:04.710> on

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
gauge for example if there's 10 units on

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.430 
gauge for example if there's 10 units on
the<00:02:05.280> power<00:02:05.490> reserve<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.240> means<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.260> without

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
the power reserve it means that without

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.060 
the power reserve it means that without
any<00:02:07.800> motion<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.820> watch<00:02:09.060> will<00:02:09.660> remain<00:02:10.229> working

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
any motion the watch will remain working

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.570 
any motion the watch will remain working
for<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.640> next<00:02:11.940> 10<00:02:12.180> hours<00:02:13.040> every<00:02:14.040> hour<00:02:14.280> you

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
for the next 10 hours every hour you

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.370 
for the next 10 hours every hour you
check<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.970> power<00:02:15.150> reserve<00:02:15.570> indicator<00:02:16.140> it

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
check the power reserve indicator it

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.360 
check the power reserve indicator it
will<00:02:16.530> reduce<00:02:16.920> by<00:02:17.190> one<00:02:17.640> unit

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
will reduce by one unit

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.699 
will reduce by one unit
