see<00:01:58.770> it'll<00:01:59.280> already<00:01:59.460> use<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.850> one<00:02:00.000> sweet<00:02:00.180> kid

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
see it'll already use the one sweet kid

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.429 
see it'll already use the one sweet kid
in<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.689> don't<00:02:00.719> have<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.049> wait<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.320> you've

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
in so you don't have to wait so you've

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.020 
in so you don't have to wait so you've
already<00:02:01.680> pulled<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.100> one<00:02:02.310> time<00:02:02.549> as<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
already pulled it in one time as the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.639 
already pulled it in one time as the
default<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.840> them<00:02:04.020> key<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.320> then<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.530> can

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
default to them key and then you can

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.850 
default to them key and then you can
keep<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.040> right<00:02:05.219> off<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> bat<00:02:06.590> alright<00:02:07.590> so

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
keep in right off the bat alright so

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.559 
keep in right off the bat alright so
let's<00:02:08.009> build<00:02:08.160> some<00:02:08.310> graphs<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.759> time<00:02:08.940> now

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
let's build some graphs this time now

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.999 
let's build some graphs this time now
you've<00:02:09.929> got<00:02:10.050> two<00:02:10.259> different<00:02:10.410> options<00:02:10.619> for<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
you've got two different options for the

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.960 
you've got two different options for the
graphs<00:02:11.190> here

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
graphs here

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.120 
graphs here
top<00:02:12.150> button<00:02:12.480> which<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.200> quick<00:02:13.560> build<00:02:13.800> graph

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
top button which is a quick build graph

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.160 
top button which is a quick build graph
all<00:02:14.880> right<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.330> way<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.510> use<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.900> one<00:02:16.080> is

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
all right and the way to use that one is

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.660 
all right and the way to use that one is

all of them we can actually include the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.270 
all of them we can actually include the
US<00:02:39.630> recession<00:02:40.050> shading<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:40.800> we'll<00:02:40.920> click<00:02:41.130> that

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
US recession shading so we'll click that

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.540 
US recession shading so we'll click that
and<00:02:41.580> we'll<00:02:42.120> click<00:02:42.330> build<00:02:42.570> grass<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:47.400> there

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
and we'll click build grass and there

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.580 
and we'll click build grass and there
you<00:02:47.610> go<00:02:47.700> all<00:02:48.150> three<00:02:48.450> graphs<00:02:48.690> with<00:02:49.110> recession

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
you go all three graphs with recession

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.880 
you go all three graphs with recession
shading<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.700> can<00:02:50.820> see<00:02:51.000> they're<00:02:51.180> all<00:02:51.660> right

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
shading so you can see they're all right

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.320 
shading so you can see they're all right
now<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.310> other<00:02:53.400> great<00:02:53.580> thing<00:02:53.640> about<00:02:53.820> this<00:02:54.000> is

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
now the other great thing about this is

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.170 
now the other great thing about this is
that<00:02:54.870> we<00:02:55.860> can<00:02:56.010> actually<00:02:56.220> update<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.790> data<00:02:56.970> and

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
that we can actually update the data and

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.240 
that we can actually update the data and
not<00:02:57.360> only<00:02:57.480> will<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.840> update<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.230> data<00:02:58.440> here<00:02:58.890> so

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
not only will it update the data here so

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:08.120 
not only will it update the data here so
let's<00:02:59.370> list<00:02:59.850> 2006<00:03:01.250> like<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.860> not<00:03:08.040> only

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
let's list 2006 like this so not only

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.380 
let's list 2006 like this so not only
will<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.520> up<00:03:08.610> take<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.820> data<00:03:09.000> on<00:03:09.209> the

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
will it up take the data on the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.270 
will it up take the data on the
worksheet<00:03:09.660> but<00:03:10.110> i'll<00:03:10.470> actually<00:03:10.680> update<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
worksheet but i'll actually update the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.190 
worksheet but i'll actually update the
graphs<00:03:11.490> automatically<00:03:12.060> for<00:03:12.270> us<00:03:12.390> as<00:03:12.510> well<00:03:12.690> as

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
graphs automatically for us as well as

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.540 
graphs automatically for us as well as
you'll<00:03:13.350> see<00:03:13.500> here<00:03:13.590> in<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.740> second<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:14.340> as<00:03:14.459> you

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
you'll see here in a second so as you

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.000 
you'll see here in a second so as you
can<00:03:14.670> see<00:03:14.900> you've<00:03:15.900> got<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.170> CPI's<00:03:16.590> move<00:03:16.830> down

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
can see you've got the CPI's move down

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.949 
can see you've got the CPI's move down
2008<00:03:17.820> same<00:03:18.450> thing<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:20.010> core<00:03:20.280> CPI<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.269> we<00:03:21.720> have

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
2008 same thing the core CPI and we have

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.780 
2008 same thing the core CPI and we have
the<00:03:22.230> pans<00:03:22.950> up<00:03:23.100> there<00:03:23.280> we<00:03:23.459> should<00:03:23.519> actually

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
the pans up there we should actually

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.850 
the pans up there we should actually
move<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.239> 2006<00:03:25.110> as<00:03:25.380> we've<00:03:25.590> made<00:03:25.709> the

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
move to 2006 as we've made the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.270 
move to 2006 as we've made the
adjustment<00:03:26.280> there<00:03:27.110> all<00:03:28.110> right<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.130> can

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
adjustment there all right so you can

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.790 
adjustment there all right so you can
see<00:03:29.810> automatically<00:03:30.810> will<00:03:30.959> update<00:03:31.080> for<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.590> if

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
see automatically will update for you if

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.090 
see automatically will update for you if
you<00:03:32.040> change<00:03:32.310> your<00:03:32.370> data<00:03:32.640> set<00:03:32.880> which<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.660> great
