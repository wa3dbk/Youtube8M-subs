00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.650
 fissure sealing 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.480
 or sealing fissures this is one of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.849
 the most effective procedures for protection against 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.790
 caries and other dental scourges 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.470
 what does a fissure board inhabit about 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.270
 50 billion bacteria 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.100
 these bacteria are natural 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.650
 oral cavity dwellers 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.500
 if bacteria often get sugar or 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.090
 sugars containing food and drinks and tony 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.879
 and instantly multiply and 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.670
 fixed as a sticky mass raid on 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.830
 teeth and plaques they produce 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.309
 harmful acids for teeth 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.449
 protective wall can no longer wash out 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.170
 ecological equilibrium in the oral cavity 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.140
 broken 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.390
 there is caries all teeth with a surface 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.900
 dissected grooves and grooves efi 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.570
 suras 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.610
 especially prone to caries because 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.860
 deep fissures create bacteria 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.260
 oral cavities are good conditions for 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.659
 to entrench who is the procedure 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.710
 sealing fissure 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.869
 sealing fissure lies in 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.119
 applying a thin layer of film on 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.920
 in the chewing surfaces of teeth 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.049
 the result of sealing fissure 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.270
 and teeth get caries protection on 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.710
 many years 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.740
 Fissure sealing procedure consists 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.810
 of the following stages sealing before 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.799
 total includes cleaning and processing 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.380
 tooth surfaces 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.409
 as well as rinsing the surface for 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.409
 removal of particles remaining after cleaning 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.150
 then smoothing is applied to the tooth 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.370
 the paste or gel which is the thinnest layer 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.110
 level the surface of the tooth and after 15 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.300
 seconds paste or gel thoroughly 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.610
 washed off with water after 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.410
 the surface dries on the tooth is applied 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.380
 sealing material 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.680
 and dried until cured 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.820
 using a special lamp 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.160
 sealing is much like 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.410
 nail polishing procedure 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.770
 sealing is absolutely painless and 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.420
 may take 5 to 45 minutes to 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.410
 depending on the number of processed 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.410
 of teeth 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.170
 as long as the film remains on the tooth 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.240
 small pieces of food and bacteria 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.870
 which cause tooth decay cannot 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.780
 get under the film and clump around 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.190
 research has shown that sealing 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.130
 stops and already formed 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.830
 caries since applied film 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.470
 blocks access of substances necessary 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.630
 bacteria causing caries 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.730
 scientific studies have proven that 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.460
 properly performed procedure for a hundred 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.710
 percent effective surface protection 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.870
 tooth decay because it serves 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.970
 physical barrier of the possible 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.680
 destruction efficiency of action 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.610
 procedures 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.220
 pauses or stops 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.100
 when bonding agents break down 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.830
 between the film and the teeth or lost them 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.500
 part however the teeth of which were sealed 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.410
 further less susceptible 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.780
 formation of caries than those that never 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.240
 not processed sealing 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.490
 effectively for five years but may 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.880
 maintain their properties for up to 10 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.670
 years old 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.080
 reports of doctors show that after seven 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.990
 years after sealing 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.770
 about 49 percent of the teeth remain 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.800
 completely 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.110
 sealed but not sealing 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.060
 regarded as constant 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.240
 procedures are required regular 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.800
 dental visits for 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.080
 preventive examination that allows 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.150
 monitor sealed condition 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.240
 teeth according to statistics 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.920
 sealant application results 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.160
 inspire the safety of sealants 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.260
 early years reach 80 percent through 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.960
 five years seventy percent 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.220
 in 10 years thirty percent in 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.880
 resulting in reduced life 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.430
 formation of caries 70 80 percent 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.950
 I also want to clarify a very important point 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.080
 breast oats are made only in 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.720
 intact teeth, that is, they study in their teeth 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.230
 Here are the fillings of the carious cavity 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.720
 she's mostly kids and teens then 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.480
 have that patient teeth which 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.000
 cut a year and a half ago in 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.530
 In this case, the teeth remain completely 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.430
 clean 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.959
 undefeated then we can hold 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.480
 such prevention of caries 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.220
 still a very important point probably more often 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.740
 parents should pay attention to this 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.580
 question and more often bring the child to us 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.340
 on a medical examination 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.290
 then we are here directly doctor 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.510
 the dentist will be able to identify indications 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.230
 sealing and find out whether 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.210
 this patient 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.610
 this child is in such prevention 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.520
 caries do we need the right you motivation 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.010
 fissure zealand and can serve all 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.910
 life often in adult patients can 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.820
 see teeth 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.080
 covered with antae forces 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.600
 in childhood 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.270
 it is believed that the sealing is done 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.970
 successfully there and sea land and saved on 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.190
 tooth for three to five years but even in 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.030
 In case of loss of silane, then we are more 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.610
 early terms 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.890
 you can not talk about failure so that's all 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.160
 this time of strength he defended the surface 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.930
 tooth from acid forming 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.870
 microorganisms and respectively from 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.060
 caries for the state of your forces ants 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.760
 the doctor will regularly monitor during 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.620
 preventive checkup time in order 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.830
 to monitor the condition as 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.290
 the very forces on the same tooth and 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.540
 correct the situation in a timely manner 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.230
 Surely that more reliably protects 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.720
 here is sea-land 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.710
 which is on the tooth without any 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.200
 damage 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.330
 if you notice that some of the forces are on the 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.910
 missing on tooth or sealant 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:43.260
 completely dropped it is necessary immediately 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.260
 report this to the doctor
