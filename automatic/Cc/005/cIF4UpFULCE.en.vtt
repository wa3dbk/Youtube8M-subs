00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.210
 where I very much like to focus attention on film 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.210
 is the new generation in cosmetics 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.069
 from organic cotton 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.039
 six people it's called skiing and the ek 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.440
 and the most special products in this line is this and the end of June 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.439
 concentrate of animals 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:17.780
 this concentration 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.050
 per barrel it promises an extract 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.220
 but that says very little but if I tell you it is the most 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.359
 powerful antioxidant effect 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.659
 It is still quite a very difficult story and therefore in Brussels today 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.130
 I have helped a lot, it smells 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.740
 I'm going to show you with this text what is actually editing of it 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.239
 skimming concentrate 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.300
 the Apple 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.190
 it normally involves oxidizing your waste to cut so it goes 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.199
 turn brown 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.280
 but 9 is going to use this powerful anti-oxidizing concert 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.060
 I'm going to put it on the pile 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.530
 well if i normally lay on my skin day i lay if it where what 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.510
 it saves on the last time with a powerful 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.960
 the workplace 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.130
 powerful anti-oxidant effect 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.960
 other part of the waste 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.430
 later we could hand later the second time what happened my own 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.830
 half has been completed 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.970
 Linda Tripodia just saying that you are troubling a tired halep 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.740
 that intention 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.360
 what a nice feeling 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.780
 that is indeed one of the signs of a tired fetch he is often going 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.800
 to regain the energy and be pulled away regularly 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.320
 to be 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.979
 that is why I was especially introduced to the new way of working and studying 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.359
 and the ipa the concentration 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.039
 because what goes is this well for your team he needs a boost of energy 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.050
 so if you really get a glowing skin 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.870
 on the surface it is going to explode a little so that is 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.880
 he tastes good radiant domestic violence 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.070
 mr most important thing 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.540
 as we have been able to see that little piece of the ash cloud 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.800
 He is going to take a protective shield over your living room 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.560
 that he would actually have antioxidant effect with the project for you alone 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.400
 but say so 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.770
 further losses 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.030
 who really did get more resistance is that those ordered against all influences 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.410
 beyond what do you think i'm talking to your face again 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.439
 had settled for a little bit for now 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.639
 but I'm going to a room 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.700
 the day after day 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.729
 expected to energize the breast of this product 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.169
 so he does not leave the field of stimulation to waste the energy 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.829
 if you are going to use this product 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.719
 found under the rubble 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.680
 so if you go for it this is a whole interior en cnn that very quickly 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.409
 to go 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.540
 often I could surrender a little less but by biotherm two very beautiful others 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.239
 products in this list 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.059
 the best ten combination can be used 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:46.749
 The advantage of day care is that it will also give an extra boost 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:50.979
 and a lot of protection because that is what Jana needs during the day when you do this 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:55.429
 going to use night care also has the same benefits as 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:59.859
 extra advantage that you will be able to dispose of all the waste you want in the future 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.519
 Imagine all the intense color things that you obtain afterwards better 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.389
 works 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.469
 well then let's see how it went with my cashier of the 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:08.769
 abyss 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.769
 He is as you can see the apple on hand with the child and me 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.630
 have my concentration it is a normal stress 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.119
 and very clear of clappers if you want your skin to postpone 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:22.399
 other part of the or we do not handle combination of these 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:26.809
 gallmard inspections yield it is therefore the shortest turn 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:29.790
 tip when you start using this concert 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.779
 just a game makes the beautiful destination obvious 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.389
 he explains a lot of stress because of color
