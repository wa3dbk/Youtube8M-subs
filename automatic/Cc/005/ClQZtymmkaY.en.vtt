so<00:02:36.590> then<00:02:36.800> in<00:02:37.040> Rio<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.490> good<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:37.940> town<00:02:38.240> but<00:02:38.540> let's

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
so then in Rio is good in town but let's

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.300 
so then in Rio is good in town but let's
face<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:38.960> we<00:02:39.110> kind<00:02:39.350> of<00:02:39.410> expected<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:40.010> didn't

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
face it we kind of expected that didn't

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.590 
face it we kind of expected that didn't
we<00:02:40.490> how<00:02:40.880> did<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.090> fare<00:02:41.330> on<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.900> faster<00:02:42.350> road<00:02:42.530> well

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
we how did it fare on a faster road well

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.520 
we how did it fare on a faster road well
you<00:02:44.600> thought<00:02:44.750> was<00:02:44.900> gonna<00:02:45.050> start<00:02:45.230> talking

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
you thought was gonna start talking

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.170 
you thought was gonna start talking
about<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.770> negatives<00:02:46.160> there<00:02:46.340> didn't<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:46.760> but

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
about the negatives there didn't you but

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.880 
about the negatives there didn't you but
I'm<00:02:47.240> not<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:47.510> told<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.080> just<00:02:48.380> because<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:48.770> is

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
I'm not I told you just because this is

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.550 
I'm not I told you just because this is
a<00:02:48.920> cure<00:02:49.250> don't<00:02:49.790> prejudge<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.570> because

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
a cure don't prejudge it because

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.410 
a cure don't prejudge it because
actually<00:02:51.950> at<00:02:52.040> high<00:02:52.190> speeds<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.820> fares<00:02:53.150> very

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
actually at high speeds it fares very

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.450 
actually at high speeds it fares very

any<00:03:02.960> body<00:03:03.140> rolling<00:03:03.440> corners<00:03:04.100> I<00:03:04.190> like<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.550> gear

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
any body rolling corners I like the gear

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.280 
any body rolling corners I like the gear
shift<00:03:04.970> as<00:03:05.120> well<00:03:05.270> because<00:03:05.510> it's<00:03:05.660> almost<00:03:06.110> as

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
shift as well because it's almost as

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.190 
shift as well because it's almost as

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
sharp as on many sports cars that said

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.650

the<00:03:09.440> costal<00:03:09.770> ISM<00:03:09.950> is<00:03:10.040> much<00:03:10.220> fun<00:03:10.550> as<00:03:10.670> more<00:03:11.210> zesty

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
the costal ISM is much fun as more zesty

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.440 
the costal ISM is much fun as more zesty
super<00:03:11.960> minis<00:03:12.260> such<00:03:12.470> as<00:03:12.650> Ford<00:03:13.580> Fiesta<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:14.360> the

super minis such as Ford Fiesta and the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.610 
super minis such as Ford Fiesta and the
reason<00:03:14.750> for<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:14.960> is<00:03:15.110> that<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.350> steering

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
reason for that is that the steering

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.510 
reason for that is that the steering
it's<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:16.730> just<00:03:17.000> way<00:03:17.360> too<00:03:17.420> vague<00:03:18.130> as<00:03:19.130> for<00:03:19.400> other

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
it's is just way too vague as for other

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.580 
it's is just way too vague as for other
problems<00:03:19.760> while<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.720> engines<00:03:21.110> are<00:03:21.380> a<00:03:21.410> little

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
problems while the engines are a little

problems while the engines are a little
bit<00:03:21.800> gutless<00:03:22.220> which<00:03:22.460> means<00:03:22.700> if<00:03:22.850> you<00:03:22.940> want<00:03:23.090> to

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
bit gutless which means if you want to

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.210 
bit gutless which means if you want to
go<00:03:23.210> fast<00:03:23.510> in<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.750> Rio<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.260> have<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.620> thrash<00:03:24.950> it

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
go fast in the Rio you have to thrash it

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.070 
go fast in the Rio you have to thrash it
to<00:03:25.700> within<00:03:25.880> an<00:03:26.090> inch<00:03:26.240> of<00:03:26.360> its<00:03:26.720> life

to within an inch of its life

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.020 
to within an inch of its life
then<00:03:27.800> there's<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.070> visibility<00:03:28.640> which<00:03:28.850> isn't

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
then there's the visibility which isn't

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.510 
then there's the visibility which isn't
as<00:03:29.210> good<00:03:29.330> as<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.480> get<00:03:29.750> in<00:03:29.990> a<00:03:30.290> VW<00:03:30.650> Polo

the<00:03:49.060> final<00:03:49.420> problem<00:03:51.690> now<00:03:52.690> it's<00:03:53.050> by<00:03:53.200> no<00:03:53.230> means

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
the final problem now it's by no means

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.170 
the final problem now it's by no means
small<00:03:53.920> in<00:03:54.130> fact<00:03:54.250> it's<00:03:54.460> about<00:03:54.880> as<00:03:55.000> big<00:03:55.120> as

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
small in fact it's about as big as

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.700 
small in fact it's about as big as
you're<00:03:55.390> gonna<00:03:55.480> get<00:03:55.690> on<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.900> supermini<00:03:56.380> the

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
you're gonna get on a supermini the

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.530 
you're gonna get on a supermini the
problem<00:03:57.220> is<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.850> fact<00:03:58.030> there's<00:03:58.180> a<00:03:58.240> massive

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
problem is the fact there's a massive

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.200 
problem is the fact there's a massive
lip<00:03:58.990> to<00:03:59.830> lift<00:04:00.040> things<00:04:00.250> over<00:04:00.670> which<00:04:00.940> means

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
lip to lift things over which means

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.550 
lip to lift things over which means
you've<00:04:01.390> got<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.510> watch<00:04:01.660> your<00:04:01.690> back<00:04:01.840> when

supermini
it<00:04:20.320> looks<00:04:20.590> smart<00:04:21.010> it's<00:04:21.700> good<00:04:21.910> value<00:04:22.060> for<00:04:22.210> money
