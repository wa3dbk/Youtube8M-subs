00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 what's up, stay, I'm wing haven and 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.049
 we are in jumping for battle fil 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.210
 we are in rebroadcast a map 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.010
 I had not followed until today where you 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.750
 I will teach a couple of jumps pretty cool 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.309
 is the first of them imagine that 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.199
 we have climbed up to this roof here 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.910
 for whatever reason and they are 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.859
 shooting from my different sides by 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.180
 so we want to get covered and 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.550
 jumping down is not an option because 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.050
 we would die then what we will do will be 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.910
 jump up to this booth here 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.189
 go ahead and for that we have to jump 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.650
 something before the edge more or less by 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.510
 here about and when we are 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.130
 point to get what we have to do 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.590
 is to hit the crouch button to 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.710
 to be able to sneak through the window and it would be 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.690
 more or less something that way and good we 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.820
 we have strained and as this is here we are 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.210
 to cover and we can catch the sniper 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.230
 pick up and make us then kill 1520 and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.340
 how to get us the pole so willy rex 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.320
 I hope you liked it and we're going towards 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 the next jump and we have not left 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.770
 very far we are practically next door 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.629
 if in this jump what we do will be 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.850
 jump up this mountain from here 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.199
 for this we will get in a straight line and 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.330
 when we skip what we will have to 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.280
 to do is to surround this wall in 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.670
 both with the mouse and with the control 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.260
 something quite simple as you can see and 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.760
 once we are in the container because 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.980
 You can choose if you want to care for 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.810
 that those who climb up the back since 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.120
 obviously this is not a position where 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.980
 they will look at it regularly or the other 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.660
 option because you already go down and if you want 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.820
 then you take cover or if you see that 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.770
 up people will decide will be why 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.840
 follow something on your back 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.370
 good and it is that as you have seen 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.740
 made the jump and in neither of the two 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.300
 I have taken nothing of life and also not 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.070
 I have needed to deploy the 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.560
 parachute therefore is quite something 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.810
 good because obviously if I do this 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.510
 I have to wait for the parachute 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.130
 to not hurt me and when someone 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.750
 deploying parachutes is something that 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.430
 listen a lot therefore the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.640
 enemies will know exactly where 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.290
 we are doing this jump as we can 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.790
 fall to the ground without needing 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.040
 take away life or without unfolding the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.540
 parachute therefore the enemy does not 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.520
 will know exactly where we are and 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.890
 we can play with that trick 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.300
 we will try then to cover or take it 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.070
 in the back try to kill the 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.360
 enemies so nothing this is the second 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.250
 jump and go to the next 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.110
 and we continue in rebel transmission although 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.730
 is the last jump on the map and for this 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.770
 last jump we'll get to the truck 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.480
 since it's a pretty busy area 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.550
 where a lot of people lay down so much here 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.440
 as in the other part of the truck since 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.870
 you see this whole area of the hallway like 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.520
 all this is a pretty good area since 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.110
 that if you get knocked down and they come 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.640
 a couple, the safest thing is that others end up 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.500
 going down because it 's a pretty area 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.180
 good as I said and for that what 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.680
 what we will do will be release here after 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.420
 here and then obviously towards the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.550
 truck everything pretty fast with the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.980
 tight sprint without hesitation or anything like 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.510
 you can see something quite simple that 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.220
 we need here over then 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.810
 obviously it depends on the situation and 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.150
 It depends on a thousand factors because you can already 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.970
 Who wants to choose to shoot or 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.190
 you please do and if you are lucky 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.010
 some support lying with the vip or what 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.200
 so be it, you can always make a 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.060
 support the iron I hope that what 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.500
 you get to do so nothing these are 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.230
 the three golmud jumps now we're going 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.090
 towards the last jump and finally 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.950
 we are in a flooded area a jump that 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.350
 I personally quite like what 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.300
 use in a fairly regular way and to 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.430
 we will enjoy up to this roof here 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.020
 and we will point to the lowest area not to the 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.150
 higher because, if not the only 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.250
 we will get will eat the roof 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.410
 with the teeth and fall and die something 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.020
 really unproductive so 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.320
 we caught a little run and 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.820
 we jump patapon and once we are here 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.860
 obviously we already decided if we 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.200
 we stay and shoot an enemy that 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.390
 come or whatever, although I recommend 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.300
 that we're going up here since we have 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.850
 practically not to say control 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.320
 the whole map and also something pretty 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.390
 good in this jump is that if some 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.490
 enemy is chasing us and not all 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.160
 we have little ammunition little life what 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.130
 be it when doing this jump also what 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.020
 what we will do will be confusing him again 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.520
 we can see up here and I lose by the 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.170
 back and it's the safest thing I do not know 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.870
 find out anything since as you have seen 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.910
 we have taken between 2 and 3 seconds in 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.310
 make the jump and climb up here 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.280
 even a little less where the enemy 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.260
 will have virtually no time 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.180
 respond to the action you have done 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.220
 so nothing these are the four jumps 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.020
 I wanted to show you if you know 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.549
 of some pretty cool and I have not yet 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.560
 post leaving it in the comments if 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.150
 I of course will look at it and also 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.850
 would like already finally asked the 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.500
 opinion of the series 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.470
 I do not know if he's really enjoying himself 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.540
 or not so do less to see the 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.580
 comments obviously as always by 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.560
 my part nothing more to add I hope that 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.060
 you liked the video and we'll see you in 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.060
 another session people see you later
