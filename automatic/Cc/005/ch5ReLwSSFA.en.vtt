three<00:01:15.170> chords<00:01:15.560> G<00:01:15.890> minor<00:01:16.720> d7<00:01:17.720> in<00:01:18.200> Twitter<00:01:18.560> I<00:01:18.980> can

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
three chords G minor d7 in Twitter I can

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.910 
three chords G minor d7 in Twitter I can
use<00:01:19.940> out<00:01:20.450> I<00:01:20.840> could<00:01:21.170> still<00:01:21.380> use<00:01:21.410> the<00:01:21.650> D<00:01:21.770> blue

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
use out I could still use the D blue

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.530 
use out I could still use the D blue
scale<00:01:22.160> but<00:01:22.340> I<00:01:22.400> can<00:01:22.520> also<00:01:22.640> use<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:23.120> G<00:01:23.300> minor

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
scale but I can also use the G minor

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.960 
scale but I can also use the G minor
scale<00:01:29.979> so<00:01:30.979> that's<00:01:31.130> what<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.370> G<00:01:31.550> minor<00:01:31.729> blues

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
scale so that's what the G minor blues

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.520 
scale so that's what the G minor blues
scale<00:01:32.210> sounds<00:01:32.510> like<00:01:32.630> on<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.170> then<00:01:33.320> for

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
scale sounds like on that and then for

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.350 
scale sounds like on that and then for
the<00:01:33.620> B<00:01:33.740> flat<00:01:33.920> chord<00:01:34.040> you<00:01:34.430> can<00:01:34.460> carry<00:01:35.060> through

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
the B flat chord you can carry through

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.080 
the B flat chord you can carry through
the<00:01:35.420> G<00:01:35.660> minor<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.960> little<00:01:36.229> bit<00:01:39.820> sounds<00:01:40.820> kind<00:01:41.000> of

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
the G minor a little bit sounds kind of

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.499 
the G minor a little bit sounds kind of
happy<00:01:41.330> now<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.140> e<00:01:42.790> he's<00:01:43.790> setting<00:01:44.119> apart<00:01:44.360> it's

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
happy now the e he's setting apart it's

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.480 
happy now the e he's setting apart it's
a<00:01:44.540> little<00:01:44.810> bit<00:01:44.930> funny<00:01:45.170> I<00:01:45.259> used<00:01:45.350> a<00:01:45.860> harmonic

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
a little bit funny I used a harmonic

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:55.660 
a little bit funny I used a harmonic
minor<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:52.009> each<00:01:52.100> other<00:01:53.860> there<00:01:54.860> are<00:01:54.979> v<00:01:55.220> apart

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
minor to each other there are v apart

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.430 
minor to each other there are v apart
and<00:01:55.940> it's<00:01:56.090> just<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.479> passing<00:01:56.930> chord<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:57.410> I

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
and it's just a passing chord so I

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.270 
and it's just a passing chord so I
really<00:01:57.860> need<00:01:58.070> e<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:59.630> get<00:01:59.780> into<00:01:59.960> half<00:02:00.280> that's

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
really need e to get into half that's

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.730 
really need e to get into half that's
why<00:02:01.490> I<00:02:01.520> want<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.820> have<00:02:02.000> an<00:02:02.330> F<00:02:02.660> in<00:02:02.869> my<00:02:03.020> scale<00:02:03.350> for

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
why I want to have an F in my scale for

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:14.870 
why I want to have an F in my scale for
the<00:02:03.800> E<00:02:03.830> chord

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.210 

so<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.270> harmonic<00:02:16.020> or<00:02:16.260> sorry<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.800> harmonic

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
so the harmonic or sorry a harmonic

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.020 
so the harmonic or sorry a harmonic
minor<00:02:18.530> on<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.590> fifth<00:02:19.920> motor<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.430> looks<00:02:20.850> like

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
minor on the fifth motor that looks like

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.300 
minor on the fifth motor that looks like
this<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.960> harmonic<00:02:22.770> minor<00:02:22.920> but

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
this so this is a harmonic minor but

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.870 
this so this is a harmonic minor but
starting<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.760> e<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.930> ending<00:02:25.320> up<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.700> in

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
starting on e and ending up on it is in

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.440 
starting on e and ending up on it is in
the<00:02:27.000> root<00:02:27.210> position<00:02:29.930> sharp<00:02:32.030> that's<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.270> scale

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the root position sharp that's the scale

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.030 
the root position sharp that's the scale
I'm<00:02:33.600> using<00:02:33.780> for<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.080> visa<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:34.710> don't<00:02:34.980> worry

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
I'm using for the visa so don't worry

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.230 
I'm using for the visa so don't worry
about<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.370> too<00:02:35.550> much<00:02:35.580> because<00:02:35.850> it's<00:02:36.090> really

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
about that too much because it's really

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.400 
about that too much because it's really
only<00:02:36.390> two<00:02:36.690> beats<00:02:36.900> long<00:02:41.720> if<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.870> use<00:02:43.050> chord

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
only two beats long if you use chord

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.290 
only two beats long if you use chord
tones<00:02:43.650> over<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.040> e<00:02:44.070> port<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.790> really<00:02:45.150> you

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
tones over the e port it really you

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.490 
tones over the e port it really you
don't<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.630> think<00:02:45.750> about<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.080> scale<00:02:46.290> too

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
don't have to think about the scale too

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.110 
don't have to think about the scale too
much<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.830> can<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.010> play<00:02:47.370> around<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.880> chord

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
much you can just play around the chord

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.110 
much you can just play around the chord
tones<00:02:51.050> until<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.140> get<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.470> F<00:02:52.590> chord<00:02:53.120> and

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
tones until you get to the F chord and

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.460 
tones until you get to the F chord and
then<00:02:54.270> you're<00:02:54.390> back<00:02:54.540> for<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.080> rest<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.350> this

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
then you're back for the rest of this

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.140 
then you're back for the rest of this
song<00:02:55.740> you<00:02:55.980> can<00:02:56.010> pretty<00:02:56.460> much<00:02:56.550> play<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.000> D

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
song you can pretty much play the D

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:11.839 
song you can pretty much play the D
blues<00:02:57.390> scale
