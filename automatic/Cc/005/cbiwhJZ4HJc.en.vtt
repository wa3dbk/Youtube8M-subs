HDMI<00:00:05.580> VGA<00:00:06.799> so<00:00:07.799> they're<00:00:08.309> all<00:00:08.490> three<00:00:08.910> great<00:00:09.269> for

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
HDMI VGA so they're all three great for

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.560 
HDMI VGA so they're all three great for
hooking<00:00:10.110> up<00:00:10.260> your<00:00:10.500> monitor<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.700> your<00:00:12.059> computer

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
hooking up your monitor to your computer

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.700 
hooking up your monitor to your computer
ah<00:00:13.219> VGA<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.429> obviously<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.089> old<00:00:15.570> one<00:00:15.990> as<00:00:16.230> it

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
ah VGA is obviously the old one as it

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.529 
ah VGA is obviously the old one as it
were<00:00:16.830> yeah<00:00:17.220> why<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.580> even<00:00:17.699> still<00:00:17.970> around

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
were yeah why is it even still around

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.750 
were yeah why is it even still around
well<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:18.990> VG<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.439> actually<00:00:19.949> superior<00:00:20.430> in<00:00:20.550> some

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
well so VG is actually superior in some

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.660 
well so VG is actually superior in some
ways<00:00:21.000> because<00:00:21.570> over<00:00:22.020> an<00:00:22.170> old<00:00:22.380> VGA<00:00:22.830> cable<00:00:23.430> but

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
ways because over an old VGA cable but

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.019 
ways because over an old VGA cable but
isn't<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:23.939> analog<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:24.750> analog<00:00:25.260> but<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.250> used

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
isn't it analog it's analog but I used

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.800 
isn't it analog it's analog but I used
to<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.180> able<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.689> push<00:00:28.550> 2,400<00:00:29.550> by<00:00:29.760> whatever<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
to be able to push 2,400 by whatever the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.670 
to be able to push 2,400 by whatever the
equivalent<00:00:31.520> resolution<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.700> yeah<00:00:33.559> 1440<00:00:34.559> or

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
equivalent resolution is yeah 1440 or

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.520 
equivalent resolution is yeah 1440 or
something<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.399> over<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.450> VGA<00:00:36.870> cable<00:00:37.380> at

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
something like that over a VGA cable at

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.069 
something like that over a VGA cable at
200<00:00:38.520> Hertz<00:00:38.809> Wow

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
200 Hertz Wow

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.400 
200 Hertz Wow
you<00:00:40.620> can't<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.329> over<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> digital<00:00:42.899> HDMI

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
you can't do that over the digital HDMI

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.319 
you can't do that over the digital HDMI
why<00:00:44.420> because<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.320> analog<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.180> this<00:00:48.180> is

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
why because this is analog and this is

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.360 
why because this is analog and this is
digital<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:49.079> isn't<00:00:49.590> digital<00:00:49.950> always<00:00:50.190> better

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
digital but isn't digital always better

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.470 
digital but isn't digital always better
digital<00:00:51.059> means<00:00:51.510> less<00:00:52.140> noise<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.070> pure

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
digital means less noise and a pure

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.720 
digital means less noise and a pure
representation<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.989> out<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.489> if

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
representation of what the out was so if

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.459 
representation of what the out was so if
you<00:00:56.879> say<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.420> bit<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.230> this

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
you say this bit is going to be this

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.990 
you say this bit is going to be this
color<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.100> are<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.430> sure<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.879> have

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
color you are for sure going to have

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.070 
color you are for sure going to have
this<00:01:00.180> bit<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.930> color<00:01:01.399> with<00:01:02.399> analog<00:01:03.080> you

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
this bit be that color with analog you

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.170 
this bit be that color with analog you
may<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:04.530> get<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.610> noise<00:01:05.970> in

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
may not get that you can have noise in

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.000 
may not get that you can have noise in
the<00:01:06.270> signal<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.659> if<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> bad<00:01:07.409> VGA

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the signal and if you have a bad VGA

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.090 
the signal and if you have a bad VGA
cable<00:01:08.490> or<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.640> long<00:01:08.909> VGA<00:01:09.450> cable<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.409> remember

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
cable or a long VGA cable you remember

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.270 
cable or a long VGA cable you remember
the<00:01:11.250> wobble<00:01:11.850> or<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> Wiggles<00:01:12.810> or<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.830> oil<00:01:13.860> or

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the wobble or the Wiggles or the oil or

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.850 
the wobble or the Wiggles or the oil or
the<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:15.090> Pink's<00:01:15.479> don't<00:01:15.720> quite<00:01:15.990> line<00:01:16.259> up<00:01:16.290> so

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the the Pink's don't quite line up so

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.480 
the the Pink's don't quite line up so
the<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.490> lines<00:01:17.729> are<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> little<00:01:18.240> off<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.490> it

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the the lines are a little off so it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.200 
the the lines are a little off so it
does<00:01:20.759> matter

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
does matter

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.850 
does matter
then<00:01:21.720> HDMI<00:01:22.500> has<00:01:22.740> audio<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.640> VGA<00:01:24.000> didn't<00:01:24.479> have

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
then HDMI has audio and VGA didn't have

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.219 
then HDMI has audio and VGA didn't have
audio<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.240> an<00:01:27.240> interesting<00:01:27.750> thing<00:01:27.780> about

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
audio but an interesting thing about

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.810 
audio but an interesting thing about
them<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:29.009> when<00:01:30.000> DVI<00:01:30.450> came<00:01:30.930> out<00:01:31.520> DVI<00:01:32.520> was

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
them is that when DVI came out DVI was

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.450 
them is that when DVI came out DVI was
before<00:01:33.180> HDMI<00:01:33.720> DVI<00:01:34.320> had<00:01:34.860> backwards

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
before HDMI DVI had backwards

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.690 
before HDMI DVI had backwards
compatibility<00:01:36.090> with<00:01:36.930> VGA<00:01:37.439> yeah<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.610> an

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
compatibility with VGA yeah you get an

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.569 
compatibility with VGA yeah you get an
adapter<00:01:38.909> row<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.750> there<00:01:40.560> are<00:01:40.680> DV<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:41.460> are

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
adapter row and there are DV there are

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.679 
adapter row and there are DV there are
two<00:01:41.790> types<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.240> DVI<00:01:42.630> DVI<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.280> DVI<00:01:44.759> D<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
two types of DVI DVI a and DVI D and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.280 
two types of DVI DVI a and DVI D and
this<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.920> DVI<00:01:47.670> D<00:01:48.860> G<00:01:50.270> on<00:01:51.270> there<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:51.930> L<00:01:52.140> about

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
this is a DVI D G on there but L about

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.190 
this is a DVI D G on there but L about
the<00:01:52.530> bars<00:01:52.770> there<00:01:53.280> there's<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.939> metal<00:01:54.930> bar<00:01:55.170> in

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the bars there there's this metal bar in

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.100 
the bars there there's this metal bar in
here<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.860> if<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.759> cable<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:57.960> will<00:01:58.079> be

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
here and if it's a a cable there will be

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.789 
here and if it's a a cable there will be
four<00:01:58.619> little<00:01:58.979> pins<00:01:59.430> around<00:02:00.259> that<00:02:01.259> metal<00:02:01.590> bar

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
four little pins around that metal bar

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.620 
four little pins around that metal bar
this<00:02:02.250> one<00:02:02.399> doesn't<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.600> a

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
this one doesn't have it so this is a

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.249 
this one doesn't have it so this is a
DVID<00:02:04.340> only<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> DVI<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:07.079> will<00:02:07.890> pass<00:02:08.099> vga<00:02:09.259> over

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
DVID only but a DVI a will pass vga over

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.619 
DVID only but a DVI a will pass vga over
it<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.129> could<00:02:11.459> plug<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.940> an<00:02:12.060> adapter<00:02:12.510> and

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
it so you could plug in an adapter and

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.180 
it so you could plug in an adapter and
this<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.840> not

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
this is not

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.390 
this is not
laughter<00:02:13.490> but<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.760> could<00:02:13.940> go<00:02:14.060> VGA<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.660> DVI

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
laughter but you could go VGA to DVI

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.830 
laughter but you could go VGA to DVI
okay

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
okay

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.720 
okay
which<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:17.960> hang<00:02:18.500> on<00:02:18.650> would<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.220> be<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.400> dual

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
which is hang on would this be a dual

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.020 
which is hang on would this be a dual
link<00:02:19.910> DVI<00:02:20.300> then<00:02:20.600> since<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:20.960> DVID<00:02:21.560> no<00:02:22.340> D<00:02:22.730> was

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
link DVI then since is a DVID no D was

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.560 
link DVI then since is a DVID no D was
for<00:02:23.270> digital<00:02:23.930> uh<00:02:24.220> not<00:02:25.220> do<00:02:25.610> okay<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.330> then<00:02:26.450> the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
for digital uh not do okay and then the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.800 
for digital uh not do okay and then the
aim<00:02:26.720> would<00:02:26.840> be<00:02:26.900> analog<00:02:27.710> yes<00:02:28.400> now<00:02:29.240> if<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.630> have

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
aim would be analog yes now if you have

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.960 
aim would be analog yes now if you have
a<00:02:29.840> DVI<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.920> cable<00:02:31.880> with<00:02:32.600> an<00:02:32.920> HDMI<00:02:33.920> adapter<00:02:34.550> you

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
a DVI a cable with an HDMI adapter you

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.360 
a DVI a cable with an HDMI adapter you
can<00:02:35.120> actually<00:02:35.300> pass<00:02:35.690> VGA<00:02:37.000> over<00:02:38.000> HDMI<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:40.160> your

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
can actually pass VGA over HDMI to your

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.780 
can actually pass VGA over HDMI to your
display

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
display

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.690 
display
so<00:02:41.060> there<00:02:41.450> are<00:02:41.480> VGA<00:02:42.140> HDMI<00:02:42.310> adapters<00:02:43.310> that

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
so there are VGA HDMI adapters that

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.020 
so there are VGA HDMI adapters that
there<00:02:44.630> are<00:02:44.870> combinations<00:02:45.500> of<00:02:46.130> cables<00:02:46.910> that

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
there are combinations of cables that

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.690 
there are combinations of cables that
would<00:02:47.300> get<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:47.780> there<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.950> it<00:02:49.430> would<00:02:49.580> all

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
would get you there and it would all

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.310 
would get you there and it would all
work<00:02:49.730> that's<00:02:50.390> not<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.810> preferred<00:02:51.110> way<00:02:51.290> of

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
work that's not the preferred way of

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.470 
work that's not the preferred way of
doing<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.830> usually<00:02:52.700> you're<00:02:52.850> going<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.150> go<00:02:53.270> with

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
doing it usually you're going to go with

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.970 
doing it usually you're going to go with
one<00:02:53.630> of<00:02:53.660> these<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.320> you're<00:02:54.380> going<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.680> use<00:02:54.800> the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
one of these and you're going to use the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.520 
one of these and you're going to use the
D<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.430> you're<00:02:55.520> going<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.670> DVI<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.630> HDMI<00:02:56.870> it

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
D and you're going to DVI to HDMI it

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.770 
D and you're going to DVI to HDMI it
just<00:02:57.680> seems<00:02:57.800> like<00:02:57.860> even<00:02:58.100> today<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:59.030> see<00:02:59.450> plenty

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
just seems like even today I see plenty

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.080 
just seems like even today I see plenty
of<00:02:59.930> notebook<00:03:00.290> computers<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:01.220> projectors

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
of notebook computers and projectors

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.740 
of notebook computers and projectors
that<00:03:02.990> still<00:03:03.440> use<00:03:03.590> VGA<00:03:03.950> not<00:03:04.790> DisplayPort

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
that still use VGA not DisplayPort

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.170 
that still use VGA not DisplayPort
DVI<00:03:06.230> not<00:03:06.590> even<00:03:06.770> HDMI<00:03:07.310> that's<00:03:07.700> probably

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
DVI not even HDMI that's probably

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.300 
DVI not even HDMI that's probably
because<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:08.960> many<00:03:09.080> people<00:03:09.230> have<00:03:09.710> business

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
because so many people have business

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.940 
because so many people have business
conference<00:03:10.850> rooms<00:03:11.180> with<00:03:11.600> old<00:03:11.900> projectors<00:03:12.680> if

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
conference rooms with old projectors if

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.040 
conference rooms with old projectors if
you've<00:03:13.160> got<00:03:13.370> an<00:03:13.520> old<00:03:13.730> projector<00:03:14.450> it's

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
you've got an old projector it's

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.810 
you've got an old projector it's
probably<00:03:15.560> VGA<00:03:16.100> not<00:03:17.530> HDMI<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.920> imagine<00:03:19.580> and

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
probably VGA not HDMI and imagine and

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.030 
probably VGA not HDMI and imagine and
this<00:03:20.090> is<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.239> big<00:03:20.720> port<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.470> put<00:03:21.620> on<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.860> side

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
this is a big port to put on the side

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.820 
this is a big port to put on the side
here<00:03:22.670> a<00:03:22.820> MacBook<00:03:23.600> Air<00:03:23.870> yeah<00:03:24.230> but<00:03:24.380> this<00:03:24.560> is<00:03:24.739> a

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
here a MacBook Air yeah but this is a

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.040 
here a MacBook Air yeah but this is a
small<00:03:24.980> port<00:03:25.550> well<00:03:25.850> yeah<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.510> this<00:03:26.630> one<00:03:26.840> you've

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
small port well yeah and this one you've

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.460 
small port well yeah and this one you've
actually<00:03:27.200> got<00:03:27.500> an<00:03:27.650> HDI<00:03:28.130> Mini<00:03:29.090> right<00:03:29.480> which<00:03:30.320> is

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
actually got an HDI Mini right which is

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.680 
actually got an HDI Mini right which is
even<00:03:30.709> smaller<00:03:30.950> right<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.640> it's<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.209> great<00:03:32.390> form

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
even smaller right and it's a great form

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.300 
even smaller right and it's a great form
factor<00:03:33.050> with<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.260> exception<00:03:33.680> of<00:03:33.800> it<00:03:34.040> falls

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
factor with the exception of it falls

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.240 
factor with the exception of it falls
out<00:03:34.550> still<00:03:35.390> which<00:03:35.690> is<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:36.020> reason<00:03:36.590> everyone's

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
out still which is the reason everyone's

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.130 
out still which is the reason everyone's
starting<00:03:37.580> to<00:03:37.670> move<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:38.030> DisplayPort<00:03:39.610> which<00:03:40.610> is

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
starting to move to DisplayPort which is

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.890 
starting to move to DisplayPort which is
better<00:03:42.140> than<00:03:42.470> HDMI<00:03:43.040> in<00:03:43.340> most<00:03:43.550> regards<00:03:43.760> and<00:03:44.360> is

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
better than HDMI in most regards and is

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.190 
better than HDMI in most regards and is
a<00:03:44.959> locking<00:03:45.560> mechanism<00:03:45.739> so<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:47.630> can't<00:03:47.930> just

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
a locking mechanism so you can't just

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.070 
a locking mechanism so you can't just
pull<00:03:48.620> it<00:03:48.739> out<00:03:48.860> it<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.340> catches<00:03:49.820> Oh<00:03:50.269> so<00:03:50.780> that's

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
pull it out it it catches Oh so that's

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.840 
pull it out it it catches Oh so that's
is<00:03:51.530> that<00:03:51.590> pretty<00:03:52.040> much<00:03:52.160> what<00:03:52.370> Apple<00:03:52.820> is

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
is that pretty much what Apple is

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.030 
is that pretty much what Apple is
