00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.729
 and let's go forward 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.559
 by segi 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.630
 we have come to site closed today to site 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.869
 closed because it's cold and I have 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.990
 to sing tomorrow because I can not 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.689
 risk to cool the clear voice I depend 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.000
 of this the fragile tool between 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.820
 many others is the throat na but that 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.040
 is yours is the imagination that does not know 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.360
 how to fuck me every day then good 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.390
 since we can not cook, I have to 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.760
 invent something for processes for 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.710
 Take advantage of training time and 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.989
 has brought here a super weird contraption 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.120
 that's good and that's why you explain it a little 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.969
 why still assimilating all the 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:55.950
 information that because what for 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.900
 you need and first where the language 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.850
 they use the fractionators many times 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.970
 to be able to train at home then 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.370
 the defects within the skating of the 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.820
 technique and such is crushed by that to 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.160
 I do not like to sing I think I had the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.290
 another essentiality to perfection to see 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.090
 why it 's so said to not sing more 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.530
 we carry it forward or that you teach me 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.870
 before training a bit because if not 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.090
 but I think it's going to be more difficult 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.680
 that he had the urge to sing and that I 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.680
 I learn to skate which is already saying 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.670
 out there they slide 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.670
 that's that 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.020
 to draw 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.580
 pushed 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.790
 today I do not have even working 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.260
 some things 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.680
 sometimes 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.680
 these 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.569
 good today has been a training 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.240
 atypical because usually now 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.400
 we are used to training on 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.980
 skates but like today it was not possible 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.540
 because it's cold and I can not 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.650
 risk acts of the granda as we have 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.170
 tested with the slide board 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.200
 how good is good is the truth that 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.209
 it has worked 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.190
 It's funny because it's really 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:38.379
 practice the skating technique but 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:41.090
 on a seat slides the feet and 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.370
 well, this one is fine 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.069
 it's harder than skating because of course 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.680
 there is no slip and this the while 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.060
 on the site then but well the truth 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.330
 that he hits me his good dagger 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.820
 and I think it's not going to be good for 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.040
 continue to assimilate the technique that still 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.520
 I'm still too clear to imagine five 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.820
 of these to buy one for each 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.820
 room 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.590
 enough for the effort 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.870
 physical what can you get to there 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.719
 easy output but I think this one 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.790
 comes as a tool from 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:24.780
 workouts also what is very 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.819
 boring 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.230
 claudio and that we were now asked 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.359
 and there is journalism, this is not only in 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.859
 home putting yourself doing this because world in 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.250
 half an hour or an hour wants to be super 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.250
 boring 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.500
 it's much more entertaining to skate 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.180
 on track and move is more entertaining 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.129
 but this is fine as a complement 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.080
 to the training comes phenomenal not so 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.239
 goes to the next training that already 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.019
 I hope it's on wheels 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:56.190
 skating restlessness that awakens so much 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.190
 like you
