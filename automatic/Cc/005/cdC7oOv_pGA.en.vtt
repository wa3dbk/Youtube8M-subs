00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello and welcome to our 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.520
 preview to oculus meets the whole is 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.980
 a virtual reality then man again 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.840
 the 3d call you on the screen 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.570
 can put nose were all 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.009
 pixner project last year and indeed 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.440
 still not available in stores 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.170
 but at least already as of 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.300
 Some of us are now on the table 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.130
 who at that time had no money is clicked 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.170
 However, a few friends of 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.210
 us and that's why we could now 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.580
 once we have that opportunity 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.800
 to raise development kit and say 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.800
 whatever your writing is now 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.530
 if you meet does not know then 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.960
 I want to explain it to you shortly 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.430
 is de facto two screens directly 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.140
 sitting in front of her nose you pull that 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.890
 Whole on how a ski goggles 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.800
 and well then you just play games 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.390
 or watching 3d movies in really real 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.379
 3d virtual reality 3d and additionally that 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.110
 is probably even better 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.790
 as 3d it is so that is not the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.360
 position however the tendency of the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.040
 head 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.890
 we are expecting respectively 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.259
 just tracked and her camera 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.210
 moves that means you look to the left 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.100
 then the camera also looks in the game 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.840
 left depending of course on how it is in 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.009
 game is integrated but that's it 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.869
 What that is ok really can 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.299
 It is not more than how 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.180
 actually said a screen 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.409
 question is so is the whole thing is good 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.119
 all the fun it hurts in the eyes 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.640
 Now the whole thing is good 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.380
 it is as I said currently in this 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.960
 world with phase so it is still that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.840
 development kit no buyable version 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.259
 im loading and i have to say it is 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.590
 indescribably good we have helped life 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.149
 2 played just like the tech demo and 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.189
 in half life 2 you really have that 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.009
 had the feeling come the two are 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.149
 especially or you are really running now 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.399
 through a door 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.020
 that's an incredible one terrific 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.539
 Feeling that almost impossible to describe 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.950
 is when you really feel like that 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.290
 runs around 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.690
 the only problem was just this 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.879
 All first person games have 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.610
 that you still with the sd or the 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.129
 controller is running and yes actually 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.200
 that means you have to be a bit in the 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.910
 Rethink your head when you 're actually walking 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.450
 Actually , you really want to be in this 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.220
 world third is in films for example 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.230
 is it so that you are really real 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.090
 3d not have since it is natural then 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.980
 more of the rift is of course for games 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.810
 been developed and I have to say 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.310
 Unfortunately, there are no but as soon as it 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.250
 simulation games are racing simulations 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.200
 and flight simulations then I can 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.390
 nothing but nothing better 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.040
 imagine a raise in rift 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.160
 steering wheel in hand and one 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.230
 surround system because that's what I think 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.060
 that's what's really next 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.709
 right car racing gets and 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.870
 I am really looking forward to that 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.170
 I'm very excited about rift 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.750
 but it also has negative points yes 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.300
 currently in this development kit phase 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.890
 it is so that the screens are very very 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.970
 low dissolve 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.180
 that means you partly see possible 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.860
 own the pixels you can 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.000
 We did not recognize the font correctly 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.409
 so in the team fortress for example the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.489
 console made on there you can not 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.530
 recognize something 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.940
 that's not just because I have one 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.870
 Wear glasses because you can really do that 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.370
 to adjust 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.379
 that means i can even do that with glasses 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.390
 play and also the right glasses 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.280
 inside in the ok let's have in the rift 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.780
 that you can see everything exactly 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.610
 but the screens are so low 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.379
 dissolve because there is simply no 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.330
 manufacturer of such a small screen 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.330
 with a high resolution establishes that 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.549
 you really very partial in part 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.090
 only things you can see everything but 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:54.120
 it's like you do not have to go along 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.180
 but on the console four times as bad 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.189
 at a bad resolution 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.319
 it is to be hoped that the developer of 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.700
 rift so okay let the company know you 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.129
 that still change that they have someone else 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.200
 Finding the screens builds the so small 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:11.129
 are in the higher resolution then because 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.909
 It is not really where I am now 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:16.889
 I would say 300 400 euro or 200 150 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.660
 euro for lying down i would not yet 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.870
 times 100 euro for lying down because it is 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.530
 a grandiose avenue 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.880
 but it is not necessarily an experience 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.470
 they say I will now always play 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.900
 I play as someone who plays a lot 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.600
 it is games very long games 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:40.310
 So so you just about to well 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.920
 60 70 minutes but gets slightly seasick 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.810
 Motion sickness is the keyword it is 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.310
 Of course an unfamiliar thing could 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.490
 are also related to the low 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.810
 resolution for the wearer of glasses is like 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.490
 So you said with the glasses 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.800
 to go in what is very welcome 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.390
 is more you can headline 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.190
 actually do not say it is still there 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.840
 no no real price yet 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.520
 release date but I'm happy 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.830
 really on it and as I just said 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.060
 where you actually play where 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.860
 the character does not move that 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.300
 is where you as a character in a seat 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.240
 as with all authors play or 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.610
 Flight simulations because the thing is mega 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.290
 be terrific for so long then the games 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.270
 are implemented it and as long as 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.440
 the screens are a little better 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.180
 will definitely stay tuned and 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.930
 max rift and then tell you more if 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.640
 it comes out 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.350
 currently you see ever megacool 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.510
 and you look at it 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.050
 if it should buy then say buy 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.610
 we then asked you to see me 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.870
 and points out that we like it 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.250
 subscribed to youtube that we 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.540
 but like to get a like from you 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.250
 that we have a newsletter to 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.320
 can subscribe where we are giving away lots of things 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.330
 and not to lift you with e mails 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.190
 We also have him in the group 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.570
 can join and we have facebook 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.920
 what can you licon before he 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.020
 continue to speak I say thank you 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.020
 see you and see you next time
