very<00:02:09.360> fun<00:02:09.630> game<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.899> think<00:02:10.320> as<00:02:10.440> far<00:02:10.470> as<00:02:10.800> being<00:02:11.310> a

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
very fun game I think as far as being a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.690 
very fun game I think as far as being a
co-op<00:02:11.850> in<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.720> like<00:02:13.500> co-op<00:02:13.890> board<00:02:14.400> games

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
co-op in I like co-op board games

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.060 
co-op in I like co-op board games
personally<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.840> definitely<00:02:16.260> love<00:02:16.800> board

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
personally and I definitely love board

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.430 
personally and I definitely love board
games<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.490> allow<00:02:17.670> me<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:17.940> paint<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.840> minis<00:02:19.200> uh

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
games of allow me to paint the minis uh

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.210 
games of allow me to paint the minis uh
so<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:21.120> very<00:02:21.390> fun<00:02:21.750> game<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.890> going<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.130> be

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
so a very fun game this is going to be

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.250 
so a very fun game this is going to be
something<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.760> picked<00:02:24.000> up<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.300> play<00:02:24.570> when

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
something that I picked up and play when

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.410 
something that I picked up and play when
let's<00:02:25.620> say<00:02:25.770> we<00:02:26.010> we<00:02:26.370> play<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> game<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.850> mal<00:02:27.120> phone

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
let's say we we play a game of mal phone

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.970 
let's say we we play a game of mal phone
and<00:02:27.660> we<00:02:28.140> still<00:02:28.350> have<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.500> group<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.800> people

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
and we still have a group of people

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.040 
and we still have a group of people
around<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.640> we<00:02:29.790> want<00:02:30.000> something<00:02:30.450> fun<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.870> do<00:02:31.020> I

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
around and we want something fun to do I

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.730 
around and we want something fun to do I
think<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.680> really<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.490> game<00:02:32.700> for<00:02:33.000> that

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
think this is really the game for that

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.470 
think this is really the game for that
as<00:02:34.740> far<00:02:34.980> as<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.130> painting<00:02:35.520> very<00:02:35.790> simple<00:02:36.300> I

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
as far as a painting very simple I

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.270 
as far as a painting very simple I
didn't<00:02:36.870> really<00:02:36.959> spend<00:02:37.290> too<00:02:37.470> much<00:02:37.590> time<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
didn't really spend too much time on the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.800 
didn't really spend too much time on the
zombies<00:02:38.730> as<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.180> see<00:02:39.330> there<00:02:39.540> they're

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
pretty pretty straight forward just a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.770 
pretty pretty straight forward just a
couple<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.160> layers<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.370> flesh<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:45.209> wash<00:02:45.450> and
