00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.899
 greetings boys good as is shown 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.780
 with the onion that is a plant let's say 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.670
 biannual as the parsley is the same on 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.000
 first year that the embrace is going to 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.310
 give seeds but in the second year 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.880
 that simply with that the parsley is 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.220
 those letting yourself be carried away by him that you see 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.349
 that grows you see cutting it and drying it 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.179
 you know how more or less dry all 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:32.879
 the herbs and such that goes dry and it 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.640
 is saving and then there are going to be times 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:39.600
 in which good is going to dry though 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.820
 then I regrow and kiss more and I see the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.180
 theme of seeds in seedlings 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.020
 they will be throwing their who stop growing 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.199
 it goes dry they are short bet in 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.539
 high and I say if you leave them some 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.520
 grow and do not cut it is like there's more 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.710
 high because those are going to throw more seeds 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.920
 undoubtedly, those that are more 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.500
 hurry but I'll tell you that this is 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.950
 easy seeds of parsley 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.950
 and well the steps are here is this 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.070
 it's good it's green quote 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.729
 let's say you are growing by casting these 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.440
 bouquets of say these balls 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.440
 that are like little capes 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.200
 as 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.200
 the little flower 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.670
 and from there 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.659
 how are they opening those tiny 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:44.700
 little flowers and then the little flowers 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.110
 the little flowers are drying again and 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.670
 then good 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.250
 they start after they dry up 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.219
 the flowers here you see how those 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.569
 little flowers are coming out again 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.760
 other little capes but this time 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:01.780
 little cauliflowers are the seeds that are left 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.570
 the seed that you see the different steps 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:11.740
 that takes until more or less then 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:15.640
 good has a dark brown tone 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.260
 there you see the cousin how he camouflages himself 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.260
 It looks like a seed 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.989
 of parsley 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.319
 he's a little fatter but he 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.319
 the cousin 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.870
 and those guys I have the say here 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.090
 I already have a little cut here 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.580
 it would be more or less then the optimal point 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.260
 to collect these seeds save them 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.260
 there it is and dry them 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.280
 the more dry any seed already 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.230
 you know that some in some videos of 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.020
 that the memories and the worst I mention it 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.970
 any seed the drier or 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.690
 be the more I know that the sun more 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.840
 big miss more years will last with 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.540
 lifetime 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.120
 and good guys this has few 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.269
 mysteries we have already seen another little thing and 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.150
 that those stories always here we go 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.530
 to say goodbye 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.530

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.909
