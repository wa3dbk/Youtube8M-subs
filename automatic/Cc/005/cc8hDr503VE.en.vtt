00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
dolt does this a large percentage of the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.490 
dolt does this a large percentage of the
time<00:00:40.980> he<00:00:41.730> curves<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.329> ball<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> backhand

time he curves the ball to the backhand

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.220 
time he curves the ball to the backhand
even<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> first<00:00:44.700> serve<00:00:45.059> he<00:00:45.510> rarely<00:00:46.020> goes

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
even on the first serve he rarely goes

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.380 
even on the first serve he rarely goes
for<00:00:46.469> those<00:00:46.590> huge<00:00:46.980> serves<00:00:47.309> even<00:00:47.789> though<00:00:47.910> he<00:00:48.120> can

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
for those huge serves even though he can

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.750 
for those huge serves even though he can
hit<00:00:48.660> those<00:00:48.840> huge<00:00:49.170> serves<00:00:49.469> nowadays<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.670> he

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
hit those huge serves nowadays but he

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.990 
hit those huge serves nowadays but he
only<00:00:51.030> uses<00:00:51.210> them<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.660> mix<00:00:52.250> mix<00:00:53.250> up<00:00:53.430> his<00:00:53.460> pattern

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
only uses them to mix mix up his pattern

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.970 
only uses them to mix mix up his pattern
the<00:00:54.239> favorite<00:00:54.870> pattern<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.469> serve<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the favorite pattern is to serve to the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.189 
the favorite pattern is to serve to the
backhand<00:00:56.489> from<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.910> position<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
backhand from this position and the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.930 
backhand from this position and the
reason<00:00:58.379> for<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.129> increases<00:00:59.789> his

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
reason for that is this increases his

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.029 
reason for that is this increases his
chances<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.510> hitting<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.079> forehand<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
chances of hitting a forehand on the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.640 
chances of hitting a forehand on the
next<00:01:02.309> shot<00:01:02.660> if<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.719> put<00:01:04.049> yourself<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
next shot if you put yourself in the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.260 
next shot if you put yourself in the
position<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.580> returner

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
position of the returner

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.929 
position of the returner
you<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> lefty<00:01:07.799> serve<00:01:08.070> coming<00:01:08.549> at<00:01:08.700> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
you have a lefty serve coming at you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.390 
you have a lefty serve coming at you
it's<00:01:09.119> curving<00:01:09.450> away<00:01:09.990> from<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:11.280> your

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it's curving away from you to your

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.250 
it's curving away from you to your
backhand<00:01:11.970> side<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.659> that's<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.140> be

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
backhand side and that's going to be

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.109 
backhand side and that's going to be
very<00:01:13.560> difficult<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.250> get<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.820> ball<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
very difficult to get that ball to

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.679 
very difficult to get that ball to
Nadal's<00:01:15.720> backhand<00:01:16.409> from<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.770> situation<00:01:17.689> now

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
Nadal's backhand from that situation now

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.749 
Nadal's backhand from that situation now
an<00:01:18.810> adult<00:01:19.049> knows<00:01:19.380> how<00:01:19.650> difficult<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.310> return

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
an adult knows how difficult that return

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.030 
an adult knows how difficult that return
is<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.020> result<00:01:22.590> he's<00:01:22.799> already

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
is and as a result he's already

forehand now I'll take a look at the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.070 
forehand now I'll take a look at the
height<00:02:44.760> over<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.180> net<00:02:45.360> here<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.900> height

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
height over the net here and the height

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.259 
height over the net here and the height
is<00:02:46.260> crucial<00:02:46.769> for<00:02:46.800> an<00:02:47.040> adult<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.850> gives<00:02:48.120> him

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
is crucial for an adult this gives him

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.930 
is crucial for an adult this gives him
time<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.600> get<00:02:48.959> into<00:02:49.170> position<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.040> then<00:02:50.670> use<00:02:50.910> a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
time to get into position and then use a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.420 
time to get into position and then use a
powerful<00:02:51.780> step<00:02:52.140> in<00:02:52.650> order<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.040> hit<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.160> forehand

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
powerful step in order to hit a forehand

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.570 
powerful step in order to hit a forehand
next<00:02:54.090> also<00:02:54.660> by<00:02:55.319> getting<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.800> ball<00:02:56.040> up<00:02:56.280> high

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
next also by getting that ball up high

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.540 
next also by getting that ball up high
he<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.330> getting<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.870> ball<00:02:58.080> out<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.680> strike

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
he is getting the ball out of the strike

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.000 
he is getting the ball out of the strike
zone<00:02:59.610> of<00:03:00.000> his<00:03:00.150> opponent<00:03:00.690> we<00:03:00.870> all<00:03:01.019> know<00:03:01.290> how

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
zone of his opponent we all know how

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.770 
zone of his opponent we all know how
difficult<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.640> can<00:03:02.880> be<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.120> hit<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> high

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
difficult it can be to hit a high

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.160 
difficult it can be to hit a high
bouncing<00:03:04.410> shot<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.980> your<00:03:05.130> backhand

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
bouncing shot to your backhand

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.600 
bouncing shot to your backhand
so<00:03:07.170> now<00:03:07.350> Nadal<00:03:07.739> is<00:03:07.890> going<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.160> position

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
so now Nadal is going to position

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.370 
so now Nadal is going to position
himself<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.420> increase<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.900> chances<00:03:10.320> of

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
himself to increase the chances of

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.259 
himself to increase the chances of
hitting<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.739> forehand<00:03:10.950> we<00:03:11.519> can<00:03:11.700> see<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:12.090> his

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
hitting a forehand we can see that his

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.509 
hitting a forehand we can see that his
legs<00:03:13.140> are<00:03:13.320> offset<00:03:13.769> from<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:14.040> middle<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
with a forehand he realized that he got

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.170

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
backhand which is going to make it

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.830 
backhand which is going to make it
difficult<00:03:23.310> for<00:03:23.640> his<00:03:23.880> opponent<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.480> hit<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.630> very

to hit a forehand the strategy did not

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.000 
to hit a forehand the strategy did not
work<00:03:32.700> out<00:03:32.940> after<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.540> first<00:03:33.870> serve<00:03:34.140> but<00:03:34.799> now
