00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
cocoon which kind of makes sense

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.370

butterflies<00:03:38.010> came<00:03:38.250> from<00:03:38.400> cocoons<00:03:38.820> but<00:03:39.380> you

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
butterflies came from cocoons but you

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.990

so<00:03:42.270> I<00:03:42.300> don't<00:03:42.420> know<00:03:42.480> why<00:03:42.600> a<00:03:42.630> butterfly<00:03:43.020> then

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
so I don't know why a butterfly then

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.900 
so I don't know why a butterfly then
wrapped<00:03:43.440> himself<00:03:43.590> in<00:03:43.770> a<00:03:43.860> cocoon<00:03:44.100> but<00:03:44.460> whatever

wrapped himself in a cocoon but whatever

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.100 
wrapped himself in a cocoon but whatever
I<00:03:45.150> didn't<00:03:45.420> actually<00:03:45.510> think<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:45.870> this<00:03:45.930> when<00:03:46.080> I

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
I didn't actually think of this when I

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.990 
I didn't actually think of this when I
first<00:03:46.260> read<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.560> manga<00:03:46.710> so<00:03:47.280> that's<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.850> bit

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
first read the manga so that's a bit

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.940 
first read the manga so that's a bit
yeah<00:03:48.570> I<00:03:48.630> didn't<00:03:48.810> understand<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.350> but<00:03:49.560> you

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
yeah I didn't understand that but you

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.860 
yeah I didn't understand that but you
know<00:03:50.180> frickin<00:03:51.590> you've<00:03:52.590> going<00:03:53.370> like

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
know frickin you've going like

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
know frickin you've going like
transforming<00:03:54.870> which<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.320> guess<00:03:55.470> works<00:03:55.710> for

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
transforming which I guess works for

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.080 
transforming which I guess works for
morale<00:03:56.160> because<00:03:56.280> he<00:03:56.490> can<00:03:56.610> just<00:03:56.760> stand<00:03:57.000> there

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
morale because he can just stand there

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.320 
morale because he can just stand there
just<00:03:57.570> waiting<00:03:57.960> but<00:03:58.710> obviously<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.330> gets

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
just waiting but obviously it gets

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.730 
just waiting but obviously it gets
ridiculous<00:04:00.840> he's<00:04:01.080> strong<00:04:01.320> this<00:04:01.500> will<00:04:01.650> be<00:04:01.710> a

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
ridiculous he's strong this will be a

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.140 
ridiculous he's strong this will be a
problem<00:04:02.010> but<00:04:02.700> yeah

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
problem but yeah

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.210 
problem but yeah
the<00:04:03.270> fights<00:04:03.510> are<00:04:03.690> most<00:04:03.900> hyped<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.410> see<00:04:04.440> on<00:04:04.890> a

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
separate the King from any of the

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.629 
separate the King from any of the
straggling<00:04:21.660> royal<00:04:22.350> guards<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.889> in<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:23.460> case

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
straggling royal guards I in this case

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.620 
straggling royal guards I in this case
was<00:04:24.570> Peter<00:04:24.930> who<00:04:25.650> was<00:04:25.680> healing<00:04:26.220> chromakey<00:04:26.639> but

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
was Peter who was healing chromakey but

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.600 
was Peter who was healing chromakey but
obviously<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.410> you<00:04:28.560> know<00:04:28.680> how<00:04:28.949> they<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.490> know

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
obviously and you know how they you know

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.999 
obviously and you know how they you know
the<00:04:30.479> zoldak<00:04:30.870> sever<00:04:31.199> seem<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.590> fight<00:04:31.830> when

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
the zoldak sever seem to fight when

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:33.350 
the zoldak sever seem to fight when
they're<00:04:32.099> not<00:04:32.220> getting<00:04:32.250> paid<00:04:32.610> for<00:04:32.849> it<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:33.300> I

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
they're not getting paid for it and I

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.180 
they're not getting paid for it and I
think<00:04:33.419> this<00:04:33.630> kind<00:04:33.780> of<00:04:33.870> fulfills<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.650> contract

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
think this kind of fulfills the contract

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.400 
think this kind of fulfills the contract
because<00:04:35.880> you<00:04:36.240> know<00:04:36.389> they<00:04:36.570> have<00:04:36.750> separated<00:04:37.199> the

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
because you know they have separated the

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.999 
because you know they have separated the
King<00:04:37.590> from<00:04:38.009> the<00:04:38.460> different<00:04:39.110> royal<00:04:40.110> guards<00:04:40.560> so

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
King from the different royal guards so

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.290 
King from the different royal guards so
actually<00:04:41.310> I<00:04:41.340> think<00:04:41.400> it<00:04:41.639> might<00:04:41.759> be<00:04:41.789> net<00:04:42.090> error

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
actually I think it might be net error

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.240 
actually I think it might be net error
versus<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.870> king<00:04:43.080> I<00:04:43.229> think<00:04:43.410> I<00:04:43.590> don't<00:04:43.860> know<00:04:44.039> how

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
versus the king I think I don't know how

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.249 
versus the king I think I don't know how
but<00:04:44.580> soon<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:45.000> think<00:04:45.060> grandpa's<00:04:45.780> old<00:04:45.930> it<00:04:46.139> may

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
but soon I think grandpa's old it may

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.900 
but soon I think grandpa's old it may
just<00:04:46.500> bugger<00:04:46.830> off<00:04:47.099> and<00:04:47.400> just<00:04:47.550> be<00:04:47.610> like<00:04:47.699> you
