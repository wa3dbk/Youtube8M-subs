00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 It's beauty guys plus a video here and 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.440
 This is going to be the series rapidinhas to us 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.590
 will learn to create a system of climbing 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.380
 Stairs beauty is this system will be 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.609
 simple but I hope it helps 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.380
 Come on, I've already created 11 scripps here . 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.000
 you follow the channel already 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.170
 Do you know how to create this from here? 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.580
 I called here the keys only appears here 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.310
 is doing some tests 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.240
 We'll learn here, there's the others. 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.420
 parts 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.750
 I called the keys to promote the cube 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.890
 now I'm going to add the controller here 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.300
 parent then connect the script to a 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.820
 Kind of alloy, we're moving now. 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.670
 our hub in these directions on the y-axis 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.969
 for this as I already called the keys 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.469
 and that's just the way I'm going to do 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.079
 so the point to claire movement 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:06.270
 move 0 praxes and here I'll put 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.670
 the value of yo power - sometimes 10.10 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.470
 pleasure 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.770
 now look is moving when people at 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.549
 I'll get the keys up. 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.220
 ladder 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.380
 Let's do it like this, here's a wall. 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.040
 I'm going to duplicate this wall and I'm going 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.720
 climb it on the y axis and that little bit 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.890
 that will be our ladder 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.450
 I'll call her here and I'll add the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.360
 material that is here 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:43.100
 thousand put the name of the material as 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.100
 this each color can be a color 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.330
 our agreement 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.680
 but to be green then we have a material 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.090
 called ladder and agreement it's green 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.940
 now let's add a tie puts 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.910
 always in the cube position and let's 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:14.230
 position it here in the y y down 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:18.670
 here from the clicks to it drags backwards 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.030
 of the cube is clicked on the two draws 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.520
 in the cube against the p7 relative object 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.100
 apparent to objects to object cuba 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.590
 now our examples in this environment 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.230
 is selected by y plus 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.200
 naming as that of the direction of when 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.870
 The people at his door move here in that 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.770
 The other one, we would not have to squeeze. 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.920
 love back and forth and beauty 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:51.450
 select to add a sensor type 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:55.090
 and not 6 as rapa radius dn a 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.560
 direction of haken own material boot 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.310
 and select the material called 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:05.620
 ladder in the distance here in value you 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:09.850
 puts 10.3 puts x paec and leaves the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.330
 person more select and then this 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.880
 that we created logic will object 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:20.440
 game with plastic brics by selecting 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:25.239
 this one from y - leaves materials every 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:30.310
 distance even here places y - beauty 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:34.090
 who names Ray the beauty now 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.270
 selected the two chips and with the 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:42.340
 character here in the cube case and 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:44.910
 sensors in the script beauty sensors 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.910
 stayed like this 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:53.530
 so when our character is 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:56.049
 coming here on y - I want him 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.630
 climb the stairs is the same thing here 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:02.370
 So I'll pick up here and select this one. 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:05.820
 wall and the staircase double drag here 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.250
 rotating will not stay this way 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:12.720
 if I came here and collide with this 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.280
 ladder our aware radius goes 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.290
 detecting this ladder I want it to go up 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.859
 same by lightning 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:24.190
 in this other tie here on this side there 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.070
 I'll do it like this, I'll call those 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:34.900
 sensors of each entity here the rdr a 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:37.630
 thus making rb equal to r d e is equal 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.700
 air 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.220
 now let's work here first 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.500
 RB logic to this side 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.610
 so if this comrade who collides with 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:52.780
 this stuff let's do the following if 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.910
 rd positive point before you have 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.490
 positive I press the neca key 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.800
 to vote to promote to here then he 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.220
 will make the positive point is a 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.389
 point z is more equal to zero point 1 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.389
 lets test 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.280
 there trying to climb only he did not 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.530
 because dynamic logic does not 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.719
 then lets him get up to 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:21.340
 People put down here the 7th point 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:24.159
 and places the object here. 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:29.199
 being edited by the radius of rb prb with 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:32.379
 political object let's see it up there 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:34.210
 only he does not for it does not remove 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:38.650
 a relative when he arrives at the top I 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:43.449
 I want him to remove it so I put the 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:47.969
 point moves relative when he arrives at the 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:50.949
 top it will normally walk her to 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:53.110
 beauty the same to here that is not 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.509
 then running to that side to 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.520
 people will reverse the values copy this 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:04.409
 part like the glue down here boots elif 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.409
 and all you have of you exchange for ha ha 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:12.940
 ha 7 relative to point and object let's see 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.460
 speak everything right 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.870
 he climbs the ladder beauty if I let go 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.870
 keys it drops you 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.009
 This is it, I hope you have 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.319
 Understood, I hope this will help. 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.800
 something and you may be leaving 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.779
 your invisible ladder if you want 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.550
 lets test 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:35.740
 only in case you leave the invisible 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.800
 here it will have to have an object of 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:42.639
 ladder with textures fits you 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.610
 drags me here and there in my case 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:47.650
 I want you to keep the same invisible. 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:51.580
 because in the case I would have a texture of 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:55.240
 ladder here on this green object is under 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:58.479
 usually if you were afraid that it is in the format 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.159
 platform game is good for 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:03.009
 any other game you want 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:06.189
 so just follow these steps there gives 17 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:08.949
 relative position add the position zÃ© 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:10.659
 the same object explained that you will 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:14.620
 able to make a stair system 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:16.680
 Just like it and if I get this beauty, I'll put the 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:22.229
 point there in the description 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:25.500
 An you can share this video there 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:27.180
 with whom you want and sign up for 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.550
 channel if you are not 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:33.110
 Thank you for watching this video. 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.110
 beauty spoke hugs
