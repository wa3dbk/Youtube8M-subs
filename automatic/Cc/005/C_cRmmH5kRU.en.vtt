there's a couple of things that could

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.790 
there's a couple of things that could
come<00:00:23.740> into<00:00:23.890> play<00:00:24.480> hey<00:00:25.480> if<00:00:25.720> I've<00:00:25.900> had<00:00:26.140> if<00:00:26.619> I

faced him before if I've had success if

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.130 
faced him before if I've had success if
I<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:30.580> a<00:00:30.609> good<00:00:30.849> idea<00:00:31.060> of<00:00:31.300> what<00:00:31.660> he's<00:00:31.869> going<00:00:32.080> to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
I have a good idea of what he's going to

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.830 
I have a good idea of what he's going to
try<00:00:32.349> and<00:00:32.380> do<00:00:32.680> to<00:00:32.800> me<00:00:32.950> then<00:00:33.280> I'm<00:00:34.090> gonna<00:00:34.300> try<00:00:34.660> and

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
try and do to me then I'm gonna try and

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.580 
try and do to me then I'm gonna try and
draw<00:00:35.170> on<00:00:35.470> those<00:00:35.740> experiences<00:00:36.670> and<00:00:37.590> understand

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
draw on those experiences and understand

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.070 
draw on those experiences and understand
that<00:00:38.950> you<00:00:39.670> know<00:00:39.790> if<00:00:39.910> I<00:00:40.030> had<00:00:40.210> a<00:00:40.420> good<00:00:40.630> result

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
that you know if I had a good result

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.570 
that you know if I had a good result
against<00:00:41.620> him<00:00:41.740> that<00:00:41.890> day<00:00:42.070> then<00:00:42.340> he's<00:00:42.550> probably

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
against him that day then he's probably

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.920 
against him that day then he's probably
going<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.090> try<00:00:43.270> and<00:00:43.300> do<00:00:43.540> something<00:00:43.720> different

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
going to try and do something different

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.370 
going to try and do something different
than<00:00:44.470> he<00:00:44.620> did<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:45.640> last<00:00:45.940> time<00:00:46.360> but<00:00:46.960> if<00:00:47.200> I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
than he did the last time but if I

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.250 
than he did the last time but if I
haven't<00:00:47.770> faced<00:00:47.980> him<00:00:48.510> then<00:00:49.510> I'm<00:00:49.630> looking<00:00:49.810> for

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
haven't faced him then I'm looking for

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.250 
haven't faced him then I'm looking for
or<00:00:50.740> just<00:00:51.040> kind<00:00:51.280> of<00:00:51.430> I<00:00:51.730> guess<00:00:51.850> very<00:00:52.660> general

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
or just kind of I guess very general

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.810 
or just kind of I guess very general
things<00:00:53.650> does<00:00:53.980> he<00:00:54.100> throw<00:00:54.220> right-handed<00:00:54.490> or

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
things does he throw right-handed or

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.600 
things does he throw right-handed or
left-handed<00:00:54.850> you<00:00:55.600> know<00:00:55.750> what's<00:00:56.530> his<00:00:56.710> velocity

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
left-handed you know what's his velocity

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.840 
left-handed you know what's his velocity
what<00:00:58.180> what<00:00:58.630> is<00:00:58.810> his<00:00:59.080> best<00:00:59.800> pitch<00:01:00.130> and<00:01:00.460> I<00:01:00.610> think

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
what what is his best pitch and I think

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.220 
what what is his best pitch and I think
when<00:01:01.240> you're<00:01:01.360> kind<00:01:01.480> of<00:01:01.570> hitting<00:01:01.750> towards<00:01:02.140> the

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
when you're kind of hitting towards the

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.480 
when you're kind of hitting towards the
middle<00:01:02.410> of<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.590> lineup<00:01:02.800> and<00:01:03.070> there's<00:01:03.400> a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
middle of the lineup and there's a

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.029 
middle of the lineup and there's a
thread<00:01:04.210> of<00:01:04.239> being<00:01:05.140> able<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.500> do<00:01:05.649> some<00:01:05.859> damage

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:06.039 
thread of being able to do some damage

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:08.639 
thread of being able to do some damage
then<00:01:06.630> you're<00:01:07.630> more<00:01:07.810> of<00:01:07.929> a<00:01:07.990> strikeout<00:01:08.409> guy<00:01:08.590> you

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
then you're more of a strikeout guy you

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:09.990 
then you're more of a strikeout guy you
know<00:01:08.890> they're<00:01:09.039> trying<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.340> strike<00:01:09.820> you<00:01:09.969> out

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
know they're trying to strike you out

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.779 
know they're trying to strike you out
and<00:01:10.359> and<00:01:10.509> make<00:01:11.020> you<00:01:11.259> leave<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.100> zone<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.579> swing

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
and and make you leave the zone to swing

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.849 
and and make you leave the zone to swing
at<00:01:12.909> pitches<00:01:13.119> and<00:01:13.420> so<00:01:13.539> I<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:14.350> one<00:01:14.530> thing<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:14.740> I

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:14.859 
at pitches and so I the one thing that I

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:18.149 
at pitches and so I the one thing that I
look<00:01:15.219> at<00:01:15.369> is<00:01:15.670> what<00:01:16.210> his<00:01:16.570> out<00:01:17.049> pitches<00:01:17.619> what<00:01:17.920> you

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
look at is what his out pitches what you

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.859 
look at is what his out pitches what you
know<00:01:18.249> what<00:01:18.460> is<00:01:18.609> he<00:01:18.759> going<00:01:18.939> to<00:01:19.060> if<00:01:19.420> he<00:01:19.509> gets<00:01:19.539> to

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
know what is he going to if he gets to

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.260 
know what is he going to if he gets to
two<00:01:20.020> strikes<00:01:20.609> what<00:01:21.609> is<00:01:21.729> he<00:01:21.880> going<00:01:21.999> to<00:01:22.060> try<00:01:22.240> and

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
two strikes what is he going to try and

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.569 
two strikes what is he going to try and
do<00:01:22.509> to<00:01:22.659> get<00:01:22.780> me<00:01:22.899> out<00:01:22.929> and<00:01:23.289> inevitably<00:01:23.979> it

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
do to get me out and inevitably it

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.190 
do to get me out and inevitably it
happens<00:01:25.060> a<00:01:25.179> lot<00:01:25.299> of<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.509> time<00:01:25.689> if<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:25.929> do<00:01:26.079> get

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
happens a lot of the time if you do get

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.450 
happens a lot of the time if you do get
to<00:01:26.350> two<00:01:26.469> strikes<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:26.920> it's<00:01:26.979> kind<00:01:27.219> of<00:01:27.280> one<00:01:27.429> of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
to two strikes and it's kind of one of

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.980 
to two strikes and it's kind of one of
those<00:01:27.549> things<00:01:27.820> that<00:01:27.969> you're<00:01:28.179> able<00:01:28.299> to<00:01:28.600> pick<00:01:28.840> it

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
those things that you're able to pick it

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.370 
those things that you're able to pick it
up<00:01:29.229> just<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:29.920> much<00:01:30.130> sooner<00:01:30.520> than<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:32.350> know

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
up just that much sooner than you know

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.480 
up just that much sooner than you know
you<00:01:32.499> have<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:32.890> little<00:01:33.130> bit<00:01:33.219> more<00:01:33.340> of<00:01:33.429> an

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
you have a little bit more of an

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.859 
you have a little bit more of an
advantage<00:01:33.759> I<00:01:33.939> mean<00:01:34.090> you<00:01:34.179> still<00:01:34.359> may<00:01:34.509> swing<00:01:34.749> at

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
advantage I mean you still may swing at

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.080 
advantage I mean you still may swing at
it<00:01:34.899> if<00:01:35.049> it's<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.259> good<00:01:35.409> pitch<00:01:35.619> but<00:01:36.520> at<00:01:36.640> least<00:01:36.759> you

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
it if it's a good pitch but at least you

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.599 
it if it's a good pitch but at least you
you<00:01:37.569> understand<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.380> that<00:01:38.679> that's<00:01:38.859> you<00:01:39.520> know

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
you understand that that that's you know

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:41.520 
you understand that that that's you know
he<00:01:39.789> has<00:01:39.999> that<00:01:40.479> capability<00:01:40.689> and<00:01:41.259> that's<00:01:41.409> what

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
he has that capability and that's what

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.819 
he has that capability and that's what
he's<00:01:41.619> going<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.829> try<00:01:42.009> and<00:01:42.039> do<00:01:42.219> if<00:01:42.729> I'm<00:01:43.030> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
he's going to try and do if I'm a

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.379 
he's going to try and do if I'm a
younger<00:01:44.829> kid<00:01:45.069> and<00:01:45.340> I'm<00:01:45.429> going<00:01:45.729> into<00:01:45.909> a<00:01:46.060> game

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
starts to move a little bit more but i

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.099 
starts to move a little bit more but i
think<00:02:02.319> the<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:03.299> most<00:02:04.299> important<00:02:04.840> thing<00:02:05.079> that

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
think the the most important thing that

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.160 
think the the most important thing that
i<00:02:05.319> would<00:02:05.469> say<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.579> this<00:02:06.700> has<00:02:06.909> kind<00:02:07.240> of<00:02:07.359> always

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
i would say and this has kind of always

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.370 
i would say and this has kind of always
been<00:02:08.650> my<00:02:09.150> overarching<00:02:10.150> philosophy<00:02:11.110> with

hitting is

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.670
