 president danilo medina gave the 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.610
 first piebald building a 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.730
 liquefied natural gas terminal in san 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.560
 pedro de macorís the work will be lifted 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.930
 by the business consortium until jean 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.509
 gas ltd conformed by companies 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.169
 coastal propagas and tropigás own 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.640
 ipsom inter energy wv it is a 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.340
 project whose investment is estimated 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.260
 superior to 13 billion pesos 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.239
 and that will allow the production of 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.640
 important savings for the country to 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.190
 get gas at competitive prices and with 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.350
 guaranteed supplies 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.710
 rolando gonzález-bunster member of the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.879
 Board of Directors of until jan gas ltd 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.350
 expressed that the work will allow the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.600
 transformation of more than 1,000 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.609
 megawatts of generation when using a 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.010
 cheaper and cleaner fuel that is 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.140
 will translate into lower prices than 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.749
 would also have a capacity to 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.179
 storage of 127 thousand cubic meters 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.890
 and would receive more than a million 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.860
 metric tons of natural gas 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.920
 liquefied per year 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.920
 ah 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.310
 and that's price to impact 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.310
 enormously 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.720
 the conversions for those plants 

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:26.620
 only 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.240
 of saving for the state are 10 to 12 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.000
 million 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.590
 while the executive vice president of 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.600
 the Dominican corporation of companies 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.299
 state electric 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.159
 rubén jiménez bichara said that the 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.590
 implementation of this draft 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.750
 conservation and utilization of gas 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.170
 natural in the park of san pedro de 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.509
 Macorís as a whole about 950 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.060
 megawatts is a great proposal 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.520
 importance by virtue of the impact of 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.500
 public finance project the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.180
 stability and improvement of 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.490
 Dominican electrical system 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.980
 the expected results of the project 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.420
 conversion of the macorís park through 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.810
 the installation of a terminal 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.180
 product accompanied by the guarantee of 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.820
 supply of natural gas 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.820
 continue the prices reference to the 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.030
 genius said máynez is a combination in 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.090
 the time of factors that hardly 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.849
 can be repeated 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.440
 the facilities of the facilities 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.349
 for export leave to your great 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.780
 other united states indicate that we are 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.030
 in the right scenario to establish 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.819
 the conditions that allow to perform 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.310
 long-term supplies contracts 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.280
 of natural gas adapted for reference 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.650
 nine is the simple observation of the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.930
 trend of technological changes but 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.900
 latin america to use the gas 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.540
 natural comfort the challenge of increasing 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.150
 the competitive ability of the country something 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.120
 that would directly contribute the strong 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.400
 execution of the present project by the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.890
 reduction of generation costs 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.810
 electrical energy in that sense the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.450
 businessman dissimilar john 's advice 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.700
 manager expressed satisfaction and 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.890
 pride that he said he felt when starting a 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.319
 project he had told the first 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.360
 agent that would be implemented and 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.640
 that with him the conversion starts 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.590
 gas in san pedro de macorís that 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.799
 will allow a contribution to the strategy 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.139
 national development with a view to 2030 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.780
 to consolidate many of these 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.760
 electrical projects 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.060
 and what the republic will offer 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.329
 the indispensable tool that 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.090
 needs to be acquired at the push 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.659
 industrial industry that the world has 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.659
 experienced 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.280
 for 100 years in about 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.440
 about 18 months president 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.410
 you will be able to inaugurate some 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.440
 infrastructures that will take almost 100 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.520
 megawatts of electrical capacity in 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.030
 cold they say natural and natural gas to 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.720
 also a turbine takes us over 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.660
 400 megawatts combined cycle factory 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.780
 of the United States of North America 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.459
 that only with his weight the eyes gives me gas 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.840
 natural to be able to support this terminal 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.480
 assuring a good part of the 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.000
 fuel to which this terminal is 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.700
 commits to acquire from the company 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.260
 American exporter called Chinese 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.260
 in salt in peace
