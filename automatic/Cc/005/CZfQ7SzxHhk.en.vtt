00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
original I guess japanese version

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.409 
original I guess japanese version
Devastator<00:00:20.189> all<00:00:21.189> of<00:00:21.460> this<00:00:21.610> I<00:00:21.910> just<00:00:22.450> paint<00:00:22.840> is

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
Devastator all of this I just paint is

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.779 
Devastator all of this I just paint is
comes<00:00:25.419> off<00:00:25.599> really<00:00:25.779> easily<00:00:26.140> other<00:00:26.859> blackened

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
comes off really easily other blackened

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.970 
comes off really easily other blackened
with<00:00:28.779> a<00:00:28.840> little<00:00:29.140> bit<00:00:29.289> of<00:00:29.910> paint<00:00:30.910> thinner<00:00:31.980> and

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
with a little bit of paint thinner and

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.350 
with a little bit of paint thinner and
actually<00:00:33.400> I<00:00:33.430> think<00:00:33.519> the<00:00:34.000> underlying

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
actually I think the underlying

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.600 
actually I think the underlying
component<00:00:35.230> base<00:00:35.559> color<00:00:35.890> of<00:00:36.070> everything<00:00:36.489> is

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
component base color of everything is

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.049 
component base color of everything is
gray<00:00:37.559> because<00:00:38.559> I<00:00:39.010> got<00:00:39.370> a<00:00:39.400> little<00:00:39.580> bit<00:00:39.820> on<00:00:39.910> this

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
gray because I got a little bit on this

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.069 
gray because I got a little bit on this
face<00:00:40.300> and<00:00:40.920> turning<00:00:41.920> gray<00:00:42.100> and<00:00:43.090> here's<00:00:43.719> my

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
face and turning gray and here's my

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:53.760 
face and turning gray and here's my
updated<00:00:48.420> custom<00:00:49.420> painted<00:00:50.520> Devastator<00:00:52.559> at<00:00:53.559> the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
updated custom painted Devastator at the

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:01.590 
updated custom painted Devastator at the
end<00:00:53.949> of<00:00:54.039> the<00:00:54.690> light<00:00:55.690> does<00:00:55.960> it<00:00:56.109> justice<00:00:56.590> but<00:01:00.600> so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
end of the light does it justice but so

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.900 
end of the light does it justice but so
I<00:01:01.629> went<00:01:02.140> with<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:03.869> black<00:01:04.869> background<00:01:05.259> and

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
I went with the black background and

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.540 
I went with the black background and
this<00:01:06.910> is<00:01:07.119> silver<00:01:07.690> on<00:01:07.929> black<00:01:07.990> so<00:01:08.860> it<00:01:09.009> looks<00:01:09.190> kind

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
this is silver on black so it looks kind

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.980 
this is silver on black so it looks kind
of<00:01:09.670> like<00:01:11.100> gunmetal<00:01:12.100> I<00:01:12.190> think<00:01:12.690> this<00:01:13.690> is<00:01:13.900> the

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
of like gunmetal I think this is the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.980 
of like gunmetal I think this is the
metallic<00:01:14.439> green<00:01:14.799> it<00:01:15.250> came<00:01:15.520> like<00:01:15.790> that<00:01:16.119> but<00:01:16.780> I

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
metallic green it came like that but I

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.929 
metallic green it came like that but I
did<00:01:17.409> paint<00:01:17.710> everything<00:01:18.009> black<00:01:18.189> so<00:01:18.820> it's

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
did paint everything black so it's

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.760 
did paint everything black so it's
metallic<00:01:19.299> green<00:01:19.720> on<00:01:19.990> black<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:22.770> everything

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
metallic green on black so everything

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.370 
metallic green on black so everything
was<00:01:23.890> black<00:01:24.130> this<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:25.060> metallic<00:01:25.390> purple<00:01:25.869> I<00:01:26.170> made

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
was black this is metallic purple I made

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.340 
was black this is metallic purple I made
custom<00:01:26.680> zoo<00:01:27.009> it's<00:01:27.340> actually<00:01:27.670> purple<00:01:28.659> mixed<00:01:29.229> in

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
custom zoo it's actually purple mixed in

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.219 
custom zoo it's actually purple mixed in
with<00:01:29.500> silver<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:32.200> black<00:01:32.259> I<00:01:33.810> think<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:34.960> can<00:01:35.079> see

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.770 
really see it but this here is a slight
lead<00:02:10.899> darker<00:02:11.760> silver<00:02:12.760> than<00:02:12.910> this<00:02:13.120> chair<00:02:13.480> it's

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780

lead darker silver than this chair it's
the<00:02:13.959> same<00:02:14.200> silver<00:02:14.530> but<00:02:14.829> this<00:02:15.010> one<00:02:15.220> wasn't<00:02:15.910> I

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
the same silver but this one wasn't I

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.199 
the same silver but this one wasn't I
just<00:02:16.510> spread<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.840> on<00:02:17.110> lighter<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:19.030> one

just spread it on lighter and this one
was<00:02:19.359> I<00:02:19.570> guess<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.810> heavier<00:02:20.380> spray

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
was I guess a heavier spray
