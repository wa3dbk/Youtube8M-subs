hey<00:00:01.469> good<00:00:01.709> burgers<00:00:02.070> I<00:00:02.220> know<00:00:02.280> I<00:00:02.370> have<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.639> ton<00:00:03.240> of

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hey good burgers I know I have a ton of

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.619 
hey good burgers I know I have a ton of
tutorials<00:00:03.929> that<00:00:04.529> I<00:00:05.250> can't<00:00:06.150> wait<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.480> get<00:00:06.569> up

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
tutorials that I can't wait to get up

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.509 
tutorials that I can't wait to get up
and<00:00:06.960> show<00:00:07.140> you<00:00:07.200> guys<00:00:07.350> it's<00:00:07.589> been<00:00:07.620> quite<00:00:08.189> some

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
and show you guys it's been quite some

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.850 
and show you guys it's been quite some
time<00:00:08.550> since<00:00:08.820> I've<00:00:09.360> posted<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:10.050> tutorial<00:00:10.139> but

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
time since I've posted a tutorial but

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.709 
time since I've posted a tutorial but
I'm<00:00:11.160> super<00:00:11.519> excited<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:12.030> get<00:00:12.120> back<00:00:12.210> into<00:00:12.450> it

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
I'm super excited to get back into it

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.790 
I'm super excited to get back into it
and<00:00:13.219> this<00:00:14.219> first<00:00:14.580> one<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.210> going<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.260> be<00:00:16.379> for

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
and this first one is going to be for

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.349 
and this first one is going to be for
move<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.279> don't<00:00:17.490> necessarily<00:00:18.090> have<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
move that I don't necessarily have a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.750 
move that I don't necessarily have a
name<00:00:18.600> for<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:19.170> kind<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.920> cross<00:00:20.130> between<00:00:20.189> a

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
name for it's kind of a cross between a

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.660 
name for it's kind of a cross between a
linear<00:00:21.119> isolation<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.380> barrel<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.220> it's

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
linear isolation and barrel and it's

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.130 
linear isolation and barrel and it's
something<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.060> learned<00:00:24.359> wasn't<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
something I learned wasn't for the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:37.010 
something I learned wasn't for the
summer<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.400> move<00:00:26.609> looks<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.210> this

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.340 

so<00:00:38.020> I'm<00:00:38.140> kind<00:00:38.320> of<00:00:38.350> continuously<00:00:39.280> turning

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
so I'm kind of continuously turning

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.030 
so I'm kind of continuously turning
doing<00:00:41.350> a<00:00:41.440> barrel<00:00:41.739> roll<00:00:41.860> with<00:00:42.309> one<00:00:43.590> double<00:00:44.590> hoop

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
doing a barrel roll with one double hoop

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.119 
doing a barrel roll with one double hoop
and<00:00:45.309> then<00:00:45.910> doing<00:00:46.210> a<00:00:47.550> linear<00:00:48.550> isolation<00:00:50.129> with

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
and then doing a linear isolation with

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.399 
and then doing a linear isolation with
the<00:00:51.309> other<00:00:51.430> one<00:00:51.699> and<00:00:51.970> you<00:00:52.839> can<00:00:52.989> go<00:00:53.110> backwards

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
the other one and you can go backwards

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.500 
the other one and you can go backwards
too<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:55.239> I'll<00:00:55.420> show<00:00:55.659> you<00:00:55.690> guys<00:00:56.100> both<00:00:57.480> now<00:00:58.480> I

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
too so I'll show you guys both now I

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.180 
too so I'll show you guys both now I
think<00:00:58.870> that<00:00:58.989> this<00:00:59.170> move<00:00:59.470> looks<00:00:59.500> a<00:00:59.920> little<00:01:00.010> bit

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
think that this move looks a little bit

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.430 
think that this move looks a little bit
better<00:01:00.309> with<00:01:00.640> slightly<00:01:01.120> larger<00:01:01.480> hoops<00:01:01.750> rather

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
better with slightly larger hoops rather

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.730 
better with slightly larger hoops rather
than<00:01:02.620> minis<00:01:02.829> these<00:01:03.129> are<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.489> 19<00:01:03.879> inches<00:01:04.239> um

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:04.740 
than minis these are and 19 inches um

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.690 
than minis these are and 19 inches um
but<00:01:05.740> you<00:01:05.830> can<00:01:05.979> do<00:01:06.070> it<00:01:06.100> either<00:01:06.280> way<00:01:06.520> it<00:01:06.580> doesn't

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
but you can do it either way it doesn't

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.060 
but you can do it either way it doesn't
matter<00:01:06.940> doesn't<00:01:07.420> matter<00:01:08.050> how<00:01:08.320> big<00:01:08.590> your<00:01:08.800> hoops

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
matter doesn't matter how big your hoops

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.859 
matter doesn't matter how big your hoops
are<00:01:09.310> or<00:01:09.490> anything<00:01:09.729> like<00:01:10.000> that<00:01:10.030> is<00:01:10.509> you<00:01:10.690> can

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
are or anything like that is you can

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.870 
are or anything like that is you can
still<00:01:11.200> just<00:01:11.770> still<00:01:11.979> be<00:01:12.130> able<00:01:12.220> to<00:01:12.369> do<00:01:12.520> this<00:01:12.640> move

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
still just still be able to do this move

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.460 
still just still be able to do this move
so<00:01:13.509> the<00:01:13.630> first<00:01:13.840> thing<00:01:13.990> we're<00:01:14.200> going<00:01:14.289> to<00:01:14.350> work

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
so the first thing we're going to work

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.859 
so the first thing we're going to work
on<00:01:14.679> is<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.490> linear<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.060> rotating<00:01:16.539> linear

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
on is the linear the rotating linear

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.719 
on is the linear the rotating linear
isolation<00:01:17.350> which<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.619> a<00:01:17.770> pretty<00:01:18.100> cool<00:01:18.340> move<00:01:18.550> by

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
isolation which is a pretty cool move by

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.230 
isolation which is a pretty cool move by
itself<00:01:18.759> so<00:01:19.660> I'm<00:01:19.720> going<00:01:19.840> to<00:01:19.899> drop<00:01:20.140> my<00:01:20.200> left<00:01:20.619> hoop

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
itself so I'm going to drop my left hoop

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.820 
itself so I'm going to drop my left hoop
hoop<00:01:22.240> in<00:01:22.390> my<00:01:22.509> right<00:01:22.750> hand<00:01:23.020> I'm<00:01:23.380> facing<00:01:24.310> forward

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
hoop in my right hand I'm facing forward

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.020 
hoop in my right hand I'm facing forward
I'm<00:01:26.830> going<00:01:27.039> to<00:01:27.100> take<00:01:27.399> I'm<00:01:27.640> going<00:01:27.759> to<00:01:27.820> star<00:01:27.970> with

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
I'm going to take I'm going to star with

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.669 
I'm going to take I'm going to star with
my<00:01:28.149> thumb<00:01:28.420> up<00:01:28.600> I'm<00:01:28.929> going<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.170> push<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.530> hoop

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
my thumb up I'm going to push the hoop

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.550 
my thumb up I'm going to push the hoop
across<00:01:30.070> my<00:01:30.340> body<00:01:30.990> now<00:01:31.990> I'm<00:01:32.080> going<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.289> turn

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
across my body now I'm going to turn

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.169 
across my body now I'm going to turn
towards<00:01:33.429> the<00:01:33.550> hoop<00:01:34.110> I'm<00:01:35.110> going<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.409> pivot<00:01:36.179> and

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
towards the hoop I'm going to pivot and

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:38.910 
towards the hoop I'm going to pivot and
I'm<00:01:37.330> going<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:37.479> bring<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.840> hoop<00:01:37.990> in<00:01:38.229> front<00:01:38.830> of

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
I'm going to bring the hoop in front of

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.969 
I'm going to bring the hoop in front of
me<00:01:39.069> and<00:01:39.390> then<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.599> the<00:01:40.720> other<00:01:40.750> side<00:01:41.319> my<00:01:41.679> thumbs

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.300 
me and then to the other side my thumbs
up<00:01:42.280> then<00:01:42.849> I'm<00:01:42.940> going<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.119> keep<00:01:43.270> turning<00:01:44.310> then

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
up then I'm going to keep turning then

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.160 
up then I'm going to keep turning then
the<00:01:45.489> hoop<00:01:45.670> is<00:01:45.789> going<00:01:45.819> to<00:01:46.000> roll<00:01:46.270> on<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.720> back<00:01:46.929> of

rotate on the back of my hand push the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.430 
rotate on the back of my hand push the
other<00:02:07.569> side<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:10.810> just<00:02:10.989> want<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.200> first

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
other side so you just want to first

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.380 
other side so you just want to first
practice<00:02:11.800> this<00:02:12.400> getting<00:02:12.879> comfortable<00:02:13.209> with

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
practice this getting comfortable with

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.309 
practice this getting comfortable with
turning<00:02:14.170> doing<00:02:15.069> this<00:02:15.250> move<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:17.200> can

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
turning doing this move and you can

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.010 
turning doing this move and you can
practice<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.770> other<00:02:17.920> way<00:02:18.190> too<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:19.360> I'm<00:02:19.870> going

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
practice the other way too so I'm going

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.020 
practice the other way too so I'm going
to<00:02:20.080> push<00:02:20.260> out<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.310> right<00:02:21.520> with<00:02:21.700> my<00:02:21.819> thumb

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
to push out to the right with my thumb

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.650 
to push out to the right with my thumb
up<00:02:22.060> turn<00:02:22.989> towards<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.470> hoop<00:02:24.270> come<00:02:25.270> along<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
up turn towards the hoop come along the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.900 
up turn towards the hoop come along the
back<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.480> same<00:02:28.959> thing<00:02:29.290> this<00:02:30.250> opposite

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
back so same thing this opposite

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.370 
back so same thing this opposite
direction

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.220 

okay<00:02:38.380> now<00:02:38.590> we<00:02:38.650> want<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.980> work<00:02:39.130> on<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:40.020> link<00:02:41.020> of

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
okay now we want to work on the link of

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.120 
okay now we want to work on the link of
the<00:02:41.680> barrel<00:02:42.550> roll<00:02:42.730> portion<00:02:43.209> of<00:02:43.330> this<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:44.130> the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
the barrel roll portion of this so the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.809 
the barrel roll portion of this so the
barrel<00:02:45.550> roll<00:02:47.250> we're<00:02:48.250> going<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.430> have<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:48.670> hoop

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
barrel roll we're going to have the hoop

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.449 
barrel roll we're going to have the hoop
on<00:02:48.970> our<00:02:49.090> left<00:02:49.390> hand<00:02:50.610> thumb<00:02:51.610> up<00:02:52.800> I'm<00:02:53.800> going<00:02:54.250> to

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
on our left hand thumb up I'm going to

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.770 
on our left hand thumb up I'm going to
first<00:02:55.170> come<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.530> little<00:02:56.890> bit<00:02:57.100> in<00:02:57.250> front<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:58.000> I'm

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
first come a little bit in front and I'm

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.170 
first come a little bit in front and I'm
going<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.989> start<00:02:59.350> my<00:02:59.590> isolation<00:03:00.160> now<00:03:01.060> I'm

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
going to start my isolation now I'm

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.210 
going to start my isolation now I'm
going<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.420> fall<00:03:01.810> out<00:03:01.840> my<00:03:02.260> hand<00:03:02.590> just<00:03:02.890> like<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.160> do

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
going to fall out my hand just like I do

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.199 
going to fall out my hand just like I do
on<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.459> barrel<00:03:03.760> roll<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:05.050> come<00:03:05.380> back<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:07.090> this

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
on a barrel roll and come back so this

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.030 
on a barrel roll and come back so this
is<00:03:07.360> our<00:03:07.480> barrel<00:03:07.870> little<00:03:08.110> portion<00:03:08.500> so<00:03:08.769> while

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
is our barrel little portion so while

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.920 
is our barrel little portion so while
we're<00:03:09.250> doing<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.489> barrel<00:03:09.790> roll<00:03:09.910> one<00:03:10.690> hoops

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
we're doing a barrel roll one hoops

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.410 
we're doing a barrel roll one hoops
going<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.140> be<00:03:11.200> coming<00:03:11.470> over<00:03:12.000> around<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.150> back

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
going to be coming over around the back

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.850 
going to be coming over around the back
and<00:03:13.690> then<00:03:13.780> back<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.320> Center

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
and then back to Center

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.670 
and then back to Center
so<00:03:15.790> let's<00:03:16.000> put<00:03:16.269> these<00:03:16.360> together<00:03:16.600> so<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.440> have

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
so let's put these together so I have

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.090 
so let's put these together so I have

to<00:04:03.820> here<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.239> I<00:04:04.329> turn<00:04:04.630> my<00:04:04.660> body<00:04:05.940> okay<00:04:07.799> then<00:04:08.799> to

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
to here and I turn my body okay then to

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.390 
to here and I turn my body okay then to
come<00:04:09.760> back<00:04:09.790> all<00:04:10.329> you're<00:04:11.049> going<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.200> do<00:04:11.470> is<00:04:11.829> just

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
come back all you're going to do is just

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.280 
come back all you're going to do is just
bring<00:04:12.790> this<00:04:13.090> forward<00:04:13.480> so<00:04:13.720> your<00:04:13.810> palms<00:04:14.079> are

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
bring this forward so your palms are

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.590 
bring this forward so your palms are
facing<00:04:14.320> it<00:04:14.799> again<00:04:15.010> so<00:04:15.790> we<00:04:16.180> do<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.479> cross<00:04:18.570> B<00:04:19.570> cross

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
facing it again so we do a cross B cross

facing it again so we do a cross B cross
the<00:04:20.289> one<00:04:20.500> on<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:21.070> right<00:04:21.340> in<00:04:21.579> front<00:04:24.810> linear

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
the one on the right in front linear

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.450 
the one on the right in front linear
isolation<00:04:27.960> rotate<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.260> come<00:04:29.470> forward<00:04:29.860> so

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
isolation rotate and come forward so

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:39.779 
isolation rotate and come forward so
cross<00:04:32.220> turn<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:33.880> then<00:04:34.720> meet<00:04:34.960> together<00:04:38.789> okay

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789

you're just going to do it completely in

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.850 
you're just going to do it completely in
Reverse<00:04:45.729> so<00:04:46.150> right<00:04:47.080> hand<00:04:47.289> comes

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
Reverse so right hand comes

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:59.209 
Reverse so right hand comes
out<00:04:47.949> I<00:04:48.569> turn<00:04:49.569> towards<00:04:49.840> it<00:04:55.680> keep<00:04:56.680> rotating<00:04:57.039> and

00:04:59.209 --> 00:04:59.219 
out I turn towards it keep rotating and

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:05.939 
out I turn towards it keep rotating and
come<00:05:00.219> back<00:05:00.400> in<00:05:01.319> so<00:05:02.319> push<00:05:02.710> out<00:05:04.050> turn<00:05:05.050> i'm

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
come back in so push out turn i'm

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.029 
come back in so push out turn i'm
turning<00:05:06.639> towards<00:05:06.969> the<00:05:07.060> right<00:05:07.389> and<00:05:07.900> now<00:05:08.830> my

turning towards the right and now my

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.909 
turning towards the right and now my
thumb<00:05:09.310> which<00:05:09.490> is<00:05:09.669> down<00:05:09.939> here<00:05:09.969> is<00:05:10.830> going<00:05:11.830> to

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
thumb which is down here is going to

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:24.749 
thumb which is down here is going to
come<00:05:12.129> up<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:14.110> face<00:05:14.349> the<00:05:15.159> sky

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759

a thread the needle which I've tutorial
for<00:05:37.050> we're<00:05:38.050> in<00:05:38.259> Reverse<00:05:38.740> of<00:05:39.099> the<00:05:39.219> needle<00:05:39.550> if

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
for we're in Reverse of the needle if

for we're in Reverse of the needle if
you<00:05:39.849> do<00:05:40.059> it<00:05:40.240> in<00:05:40.389> Reverse<00:05:43.620> but<00:05:44.620> it's<00:05:44.830> a<00:05:44.860> pretty
