00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.220 
or talking about media and movies and
things<00:02:12.760> like<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.090> in<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.630> future<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:14.110> think

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
things like that in the future I think

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.610 
things like that in the future I think
that<00:02:14.880> this<00:02:15.880> pasty<00:02:16.390> 3<00:02:16.660> was<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> little<00:02:17.200> bit<00:02:17.320> of<00:02:17.470> a

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
that this pasty 3 was a little bit of a

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.450 
that this pasty 3 was a little bit of a
aberration<00:02:18.430> because<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:20.440> know<00:02:20.560> people<00:02:20.830> were

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
aberration because you know people were

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.300 
aberration because you know people were
expecting<00:02:21.940> Microsoft<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.570> talk<00:02:22.750> about<00:02:22.900> the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
expecting Microsoft to talk about the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.610 
expecting Microsoft to talk about the
apps<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.700> entertainment<00:02:25.360> movies<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.110> TV<00:02:26.470> and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
apps and entertainment movies and TV and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.500 
apps and entertainment movies and TV and
stuff<00:02:26.800> like<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.760> wasn't<00:02:28.120> them<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.480> I

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
stuff like that and it wasn't them and I

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.480 
stuff like that and it wasn't them and I
think<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:28.960> sense<00:02:29.350> a<00:02:29.500> media<00:02:29.830> scrambling

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
think that that sense a media scrambling

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.220 
think that that sense a media scrambling
and<00:02:30.790> I've<00:02:31.030> actually<00:02:31.210> seen<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:31.630> little<00:02:31.990> bit<00:02:32.110> of

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
and I've actually seen a little bit of

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.340 
and I've actually seen a little bit of
backlash<00:02:33.720> towards<00:02:34.720> some<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.930> these<00:02:34.990> media

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
backlash towards some of these media

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.330 
backlash towards some of these media
outlets<00:02:35.710> because<00:02:36.070> they<00:02:36.280> didn't<00:02:36.550> call<00:02:36.730> sony<00:02:37.510> on

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
outlets because they didn't call sony on

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.410 
outlets because they didn't call sony on
the<00:02:39.340> exact<00:02:39.670> thing<00:02:39.880> that<00:02:40.060> they<00:02:40.180> called
