00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
I got a body tech power worker which is

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.660 
I got a body tech power worker which is
basically<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:02.939> ripoff<00:00:03.270> of<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.540> bull<00:00:03.750> worker<00:00:03.990> and

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:04.670 
basically a ripoff of a bull worker and

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.460 
basically a ripoff of a bull worker and
I<00:00:05.670> was<00:00:05.819> pleasantly<00:00:06.330> surprised<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:07.109> find<00:00:07.319> that

I was pleasantly surprised to find that
you<00:00:07.649> can<00:00:07.830> simulate<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.400> lot<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.760> archery<00:00:09.300> style

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.959 
you can simulate a lot of archery style
things<00:00:10.230> with<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:11.519> I'm<00:00:11.639> going<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.790> do<00:00:11.940> a

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
things with it so I'm going to do a

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.459 
things with it so I'm going to do a
little<00:00:12.179> video<00:00:12.360> on<00:00:12.690> what<00:00:12.840> they<00:00:12.960> can<00:00:13.110> be<00:00:13.230> used

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
little video on what they can be used

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.950 
little video on what they can be used
for<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.250> terms<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.910> both<00:00:15.150> conventional

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
for in terms of both conventional

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.349 
for in terms of both conventional
archery<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.560> crossbows<00:00:17.130> style<00:00:17.430> archery<00:00:18.029> sort

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
archery and crossbows style archery sort

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.390 
archery and crossbows style archery sort
of<00:00:18.420> for<00:00:18.539> building<00:00:18.900> muscles<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:22.130> what<00:00:23.130> cuz<00:00:23.310> I

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
of for building muscles and what cuz I

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.310 
of for building muscles and what cuz I
get<00:00:23.460> asked<00:00:23.910> quite<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.090> bit<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.750> comments

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
get asked quite a bit in like comments

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.259 
get asked quite a bit in like comments
you<00:00:25.560> know<00:00:25.680> people<00:00:26.369> asking<00:00:26.670> will<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> be<00:00:27.029> able<00:00:27.150> to

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
you know people asking will I be able to

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.390 
you know people asking will I be able to
 a<00:00:27.510> certain<00:00:27.960> strength<00:00:28.260> crossbow<00:00:28.859> or<00:00:29.130> well

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
 a certain strength crossbow or well

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.370 
 a certain strength crossbow or well
you<00:00:29.730> know<00:00:29.970> how<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.480> build<00:00:30.689> up<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.960> muscles

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
you know how can I build up the muscles

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.530 
you know how can I build up the muscles
to<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> crossbow<00:00:32.340> then<00:00:33.090> actually<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.480> think

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
to a crossbow then actually I think

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.780 
to a crossbow then actually I think
out<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.290> everything<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.770> found<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.280> far<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.640> is

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
out of everything I found so far this is

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.370 
out of everything I found so far this is
probably<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.360> best<00:00:36.570> thing<00:00:36.870> because<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.230> can

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
probably the best thing because you can

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.720 
probably the best thing because you can
measure<00:00:37.559> how<00:00:37.710> much<00:00:38.100> you're<00:00:38.340> current<00:00:38.640> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
measure how much you're current and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.330 
measure how much you're current and
you're<00:00:38.820> sort<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.000> lifting<00:00:39.420> or<00:00:39.570> pulling<00:00:39.840> and

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
you're sort of lifting or pulling and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.830 
you're sort of lifting or pulling and
then<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.700> obviously<00:00:41.790> use<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.750> couple

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
then you can obviously use it a couple

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.930 
then you can obviously use it a couple
of<00:00:43.200> times<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.620> week<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.040> build<00:00:44.160> up<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.610> required

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
of times a week to build up the required

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.500 
of times a week to build up the required
muscles<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.200> let's<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.190> look<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:48.059> firstly

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
muscles so let's have a look so firstly

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.240 
muscles so let's have a look so firstly
let's<00:00:48.780> use<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> conventional<00:00:50.010> boat

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
let's use it like a conventional boat

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.240 
let's use it like a conventional boat
what<00:00:51.090> you've<00:00:51.239> got<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.780> these<00:00:52.079> slide<00:00:52.949> down

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
what you've got here is these slide down

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.590 
what you've got here is these slide down
with<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.879> tell<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.239> what<00:00:54.420> you're

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
with it to tell you what you're

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.720 
with it to tell you what you're
currently<00:00:55.020> lifting<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.370> each<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.670> these

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
currently lifting and each of these

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.900 
currently lifting and each of these
represents<00:00:57.570> poundage<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.469> 10<00:00:58.710> 20<00:00:58.890> 30<00:00:59.340> 40<00:00:59.789> 50

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
represents poundage is so 10 20 30 40 50

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.689 
represents poundage is so 10 20 30 40 50
60<00:01:00.420> 70<00:01:00.449> 80<00:01:00.719> 90<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.500> 100<00:01:01.920> pounds<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.520> they<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:02.670> a

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
60 70 80 90 to 100 pounds and they go a

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.000 
60 70 80 90 to 100 pounds and they go a
bit<00:01:02.879> further<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:03.600> 110<00:01:04.350> pounds<00:01:04.860> or

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
bit further so it's about 110 pounds or

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.179 
bit further so it's about 110 pounds or
so<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:06.030> will<00:01:06.240> actually<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.810> now<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> take

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
so this will actually go to now I take

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.740 
so this will actually go to now I take
all<00:01:08.400> these<00:01:08.520> readings<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.119> pinch<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.540> salt

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
all these readings of a pinch of salt

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.880 
all these readings of a pinch of salt
because<00:01:09.960> with<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> lot<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.380> these<00:01:10.590> sort<00:01:10.860> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
because with a lot of these sort of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.480 
because with a lot of these sort of
assisted<00:01:12.320> sort<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.380> exercise<00:01:13.860> tools<00:01:14.250> they

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
assisted sort of exercise tools they

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.280 
assisted sort of exercise tools they
seem<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.850> always<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> bit<00:01:15.600> off<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:16.020> what

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
seem to always be a bit off on what

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.899 
seem to always be a bit off on what
you're<00:01:16.439> actually<00:01:16.619> doing<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.430> what<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.790> know

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
you're actually doing to what you know

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.499 
you're actually doing to what you know
like<00:01:18.240> scales<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.960> often<00:01:19.259> be<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:20.479> for<00:01:21.479> a

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
like scales can often be so for a

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.120 
like scales can often be so for a
conventional<00:01:22.140> bow<00:01:22.290> type<00:01:22.619> thing<00:01:22.860> you'd

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
conventional bow type thing you'd

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
conventional bow type thing you'd
obviously<00:01:23.250> hold<00:01:23.670> out<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.150> whatever<00:01:24.509> home<00:01:24.930> -

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
obviously hold out with whatever home -

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.810 
obviously hold out with whatever home -
like<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.100> whatever<00:01:26.250> hand<00:01:26.670> you're

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
like that and with whatever hand you're

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.149 
like that and with whatever hand you're
drawing<00:01:27.060> back

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.669 

then<00:01:31.159> release<00:01:31.429> it<00:01:32.079> and<00:01:33.079> that's<00:01:33.229> given<00:01:33.530> me<00:01:33.649> a

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
then release it and that's given me a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.609 
then release it and that's given me a
reading<00:01:34.159> of<00:01:34.250> about<00:01:34.570> just<00:01:35.570> over<00:01:35.869> 90<00:01:36.289> on<00:01:36.380> that

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
reading of about just over 90 on that

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.219 
reading of about just over 90 on that
one<00:01:36.909> just<00:01:37.909> over<00:01:38.090> 80<00:01:38.359> on<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:38.780> one<00:01:38.929> so<00:01:39.140> I'm

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
one just over 80 on that one so I'm

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.349 
one just over 80 on that one so I'm
guessing<00:01:39.530> somewhere<00:01:39.859> around<00:01:40.009> 90<00:01:40.460> pounds<00:01:41.060> draw

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
guessing somewhere around 90 pounds draw

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:42.429 
guessing somewhere around 90 pounds draw
give<00:01:41.780> or<00:01:41.899> take

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
give or take

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.289 
give or take
obviously<00:01:43.280> that'd<00:01:43.399> be<00:01:43.520> quite<00:01:43.670> hard<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.149> keep

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
obviously that'd be quite hard to keep

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.539 
obviously that'd be quite hard to keep
that<00:01:44.450> going<00:01:44.659> turned<00:01:45.439> with<00:01:45.709> this<00:01:45.920> it's<00:01:46.219> a<00:01:46.369> bit

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
that going turned with this it's a bit

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:47.800 
that going turned with this it's a bit
easier<00:01:46.909> than<00:01:47.030> normal<00:01:47.360> bow<00:01:47.509> because<00:01:47.630> you're

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
easier than normal bow because you're

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.779 
easier than normal bow because you're
essentially<00:01:48.110> pushing<00:01:48.619> away<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:49.039> this<00:01:49.189> hand<00:01:49.459> I

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
essentially pushing away of this hand I

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.230 
essentially pushing away of this hand I
mean<00:01:50.209> if<00:01:50.420> I<00:01:50.569> try<00:01:51.250> with<00:01:52.250> one<00:01:52.310> hand<00:01:52.789> it's<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.090> lot

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
mean if I try with one hand it's a lot

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.699 
mean if I try with one hand it's a lot
more<00:01:53.390> difficult<00:01:53.569> which<00:01:54.079> is<00:01:54.109> probably<00:01:54.560> giving

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
more difficult which is probably giving

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.319 
more difficult which is probably giving
you<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:54.950> more<00:01:55.100> accurate<00:01:55.310> reading<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.179> what<00:01:56.299> I

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
you a more accurate reading and what I

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.819 
you a more accurate reading and what I
would<00:01:56.810> be<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.200> that's<00:01:58.069> somewhere<00:01:58.609> between

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
would be and that's somewhere between

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.779 
would be and that's somewhere between
because<00:02:00.829> I<00:02:00.920> was<00:02:01.039> blocking<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.459> thing<00:02:01.700> with

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
because I was blocking the thing with

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.630 
because I was blocking the thing with
that<00:02:01.819> one<00:02:01.909> between<00:02:02.539> 30<00:02:02.929> and<00:02:03.409> 70<00:02:03.890> pounds<00:02:04.579> of

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
that one between 30 and 70 pounds of

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.699 
that one between 30 and 70 pounds of
draw<00:02:04.939> so<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.569> could<00:02:05.780> call<00:02:05.899> that<00:02:06.079> fifty<00:02:06.349> maybe

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
draw so you could call that fifty maybe

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.199 
draw so you could call that fifty maybe
pounds<00:02:07.280> draw<00:02:07.459> which<00:02:07.640> is<00:02:07.700> probably<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.090> better

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
pounds draw which is probably a better

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.979 
pounds draw which is probably a better
reading<00:02:08.810> but<00:02:09.819> obviously<00:02:10.819> using<00:02:11.569> this<00:02:11.750> you

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
reading but obviously using this you

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.720 
reading but obviously using this you
could<00:02:12.170> be<00:02:12.319> building<00:02:12.769> up<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.980> muscles<00:02:13.130> the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
could be building up the muscles the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.180 
could be building up the muscles the
caulking<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.750> conventional<00:02:15.379> though<00:02:15.530> I'm<00:02:16.010> not

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
caulking a conventional though I'm not

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.369 
caulking a conventional though I'm not
copying<00:02:16.489> but<00:02:19.360> using<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.450> conventional<00:02:20.750> recurve

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
copying but using a conventional recurve

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.089 
copying but using a conventional recurve
bow<00:02:21.620> or<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.890> compound<00:02:22.310> bow<00:02:23.319> now<00:02:24.319> for<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.620> crossbow

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
bow or a compound bow now for a crossbow

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.199 
bow or a compound bow now for a crossbow
part<00:02:25.370> but<00:02:26.329> put<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.540> on<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.900> ground<00:02:27.079> here<00:02:27.470> and

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
part but put that on the ground here and

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.780 
part but put that on the ground here and
slide<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.390> under<00:02:29.629> my<00:02:29.780> shoe<00:02:30.430> we've<00:02:31.430> got<00:02:31.670> it

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
slide it under my shoe we've got it

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.099 
slide it under my shoe we've got it
pretty<00:02:31.940> much<00:02:32.239> how<00:02:32.450> we<00:02:32.480> would<00:02:32.750> we<00:02:33.049> would

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
pretty much how we would we would

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.770 
pretty much how we would we would
copying<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.620> crossbow<00:02:34.100> now<00:02:34.970> get<00:02:35.299> my<00:02:35.450> hand<00:02:35.660> on

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
copying a crossbow now get my hand on

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.340 
copying a crossbow now get my hand on
there

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
there

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.849 
there
stand<00:02:36.980> up<00:02:37.160> hook<00:02:38.079> hold<00:02:39.079> it<00:02:39.260> like<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.440> for<00:02:39.620> a

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
stand up hook hold it like that for a

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.809 
stand up hook hold it like that for a
minute<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:41.420> that's<00:02:41.870> on<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.310> 410<00:02:43.310> pounds<00:02:43.549> this

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
minute and that's on the 410 pounds this

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.449 
minute and that's on the 410 pounds this
will<00:02:43.970> go<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:45.430> do<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.489> again

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.929 

so<00:02:50.000> that's<00:02:50.150> just<00:02:50.299> like<00:02:50.420> cocking<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.959> crossbow

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:51.939 
so that's just like cocking a crossbow

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.339 
so that's just like cocking a crossbow
so<00:02:52.939> obviously<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:53.329> can<00:02:53.390> do<00:02:53.689> that<00:02:53.840> repeatedly

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
so obviously you can do that repeatedly

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.589 
so obviously you can do that repeatedly
to<00:02:55.310> build<00:02:55.549> up<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.819> muscles<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.329> you<00:02:56.450> would

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
to build up the muscles that you would

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.380 
to build up the muscles that you would
want<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.900> do<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:58.400> copying<00:02:58.819> a<00:02:58.939> hundred<00:02:59.269> and

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
want to do the copying a hundred and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.940 
want to do the copying a hundred and
fifty<00:02:59.689> hundred<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.079> twenty<00:03:00.290> pound<00:03:00.500> cross<00:03:00.709> or

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
fifty hundred and twenty pound cross or

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.309 
fifty hundred and twenty pound cross or
what<00:03:01.099> have<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.719> mean<00:03:02.900> it's<00:03:03.140> gonna<00:03:03.260> be

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
what have you and I mean it's gonna be

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.229 
what have you and I mean it's gonna be
used<00:03:03.500> for<00:03:03.590> more<00:03:03.799> things<00:03:04.099> than<00:03:04.250> that<00:03:04.459> but<00:03:04.849> I'll

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
used for more things than that but I'll

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.610 
used for more things than that but I'll
probably<00:03:05.480> go<00:03:05.689> into<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.109> a<00:03:06.139> bit<00:03:06.230> more<00:03:06.530> on

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
probably go into that a bit more on

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.490 
probably go into that a bit more on
another<00:03:06.799> video<00:03:07.510> but<00:03:08.510> now<00:03:08.930> I'll<00:03:09.019> just<00:03:09.049> do<00:03:09.290> one

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
another video but now I'll just do one

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.259 
another video but now I'll just do one
again<00:03:09.709> without<00:03:10.219> facing<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:10.790> can<00:03:10.969> you<00:03:11.030> so<00:03:11.150> you

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
again without facing you can you so you

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.610 
again without facing you can you so you
can<00:03:11.420> see<00:03:11.569> I'm<00:03:11.689> actually<00:03:11.840> doing<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.590> whole

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
can see I'm actually doing the whole

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:22.750 
can see I'm actually doing the whole
maneuver<00:03:18.129> that<00:03:19.129> is<00:03:19.310> on<00:03:21.189> 110<00:03:22.189> pound<00:03:22.489> mark

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
maneuver that is on 110 pound mark

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.729 
maneuver that is on 110 pound mark
really<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.790> it's<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.090> good<00:03:26.269> tool<00:03:26.599> now<00:03:27.200> as<00:03:27.379> I<00:03:27.500> said

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
really so it's a good tool now as I said

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.470 
really so it's a good tool now as I said
take<00:03:28.129> it<00:03:28.159> with<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.459> bit<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:28.760> pinch<00:03:29.120> of<00:03:29.329> salt

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
take it with a bit of pinch of salt

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.659 
take it with a bit of pinch of salt
because<00:03:29.780> um<00:03:30.230> with<00:03:30.859> these<00:03:31.069> things<00:03:31.340> they<00:03:31.489> tend

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
because um with these things they tend

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.970 
because um with these things they tend
to<00:03:31.819> actually<00:03:31.939> be<00:03:32.150> easier<00:03:32.480> than<00:03:32.629> won't<00:03:32.840> be<00:03:33.079> with

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
to actually be easier than won't be with

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.830 
to actually be easier than won't be with
a<00:03:34.069> real<00:03:34.250> thing<00:03:34.579> but<00:03:34.790> obviously<00:03:35.209> it's<00:03:35.389> gonna<00:03:35.540> be

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
a real thing but obviously it's gonna be

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.509 
a real thing but obviously it's gonna be
building<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.290> muscles<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:36.799> want<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.280> use

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
building the muscles you want to use

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.000 
building the muscles you want to use
when<00:03:38.120> using<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:38.959> bow<00:03:39.109> or<00:03:39.290> whatever<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:42.010> these

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
when using a bow or whatever so these

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.039 
when using a bow or whatever so these
are<00:03:43.340> about<00:03:43.400> forty<00:03:43.879> quid<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.569> I<00:03:44.719> think<00:03:44.930> the

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
are about forty quid and I think the

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.069 
are about forty quid and I think the
