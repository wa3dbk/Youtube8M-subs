suggested that you lay the track a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.910 
suggested that you lay the track a
perimeter<00:02:28.840> track<00:02:29.230> going<00:02:29.500> all<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.770> way<00:02:29.800> around

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
around to this side I laid a track just

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.510 
around to this side I laid a track just
so<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.500> hair<00:02:35.650> would<00:02:35.710> be<00:02:35.800> coming<00:02:35.980> forward<00:02:36.400> so

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
so the hair would be coming forward so

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.570 
so the hair would be coming forward so

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.310 
about it because here in Portland a lot
of<00:05:05.100> people<00:05:05.370> aren't<00:05:05.520> doing<00:05:05.820> this<00:05:06.260> you<00:05:07.260> know

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
of people aren't doing this you know

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.140 
of people aren't doing this you know
like<00:05:07.470> I<00:05:07.590> said<00:05:07.650> it's<00:05:08.550> just<00:05:08.610> something<00:05:08.910> I<00:05:08.970> found

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
like I said it's just something I found

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.300 
like I said it's just something I found
out<00:05:09.300> about<00:05:09.420> on<00:05:09.690> YouTube<00:05:09.900> as<00:05:10.800> far<00:05:11.100> as<00:05:11.190> the

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
out about on YouTube as far as the

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.100 
out about on YouTube as far as the
visible<00:05:11.610> hairline<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:12.300> I<00:05:12.330> think<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:12.960> was<00:05:13.080> a

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
visible hairline so I think it was a

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.920 
visible hairline so I think it was a
good<00:05:13.320> success<00:05:13.470> for<00:05:13.830> my<00:05:13.950> first<00:05:14.190> try<00:05:14.900> but<00:05:15.900> I

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
good success for my first try but I

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.910 
good success for my first try but I
don't<00:05:16.110> think<00:05:16.200> I'd<00:05:16.350> be<00:05:16.440> doing<00:05:16.560> it<00:05:16.740> too<00:05:16.890> much

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
don't think I'd be doing it too much

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.010 
don't think I'd be doing it too much
just<00:05:17.340> because<00:05:17.490> I'd<00:05:18.420> like<00:05:18.600> to<00:05:18.750> be<00:05:18.870> able<00:05:18.930> to
