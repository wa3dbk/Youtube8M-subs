 Phlebology Belyaev Nikolai Petrovich as 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.220
 leaders of this direction 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.139

 today with the gold standard 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.359
 examination of the venous system are 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.489
 ultrasound angel scan when 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.370
 which can be estimated valve parade 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.290
 vessels, the presence of varicose changes 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.050
 walls also thrombosis and thrombophlebitis 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.550
 these are complicated forms of varicose disease 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.020
 on the basis of complaints 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.260
 ultrasound data inspection 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.809
 research we will establish a diagnosis for 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.820
 determine further treatment tactics 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.559
 we use modern 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.149
 non-surgical treatments such as 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.309
 radius here are you a walkie-talkie 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.820
 or endova zalny laser coagulation 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.500
 which do not require anesthesia 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.239
 surgical incisions are done only 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.100
 through skin puncture under local anesthesia 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.960
 she is the present moment 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.240
 radiofrequency obliteration is 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.700
 popular enough treatment method 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.640
 Tell us more about this technique. 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.900
 yes this is a modern method of treatment 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.580
 varicose veins 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.900
 which is widely used in 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.700
 ambulatory phlebology 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.009
 the procedure is carried out under local 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.259
 anesthesia through the skin marrow lumen 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.229
 veins injected radiofrequency catheter 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.759
 under the control of an ultrasound machine 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.610
 by the temperature of the vein wall 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.869
 the patient heats up and shrinks when 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.290
 do not experience any pain 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.119
 sensations duration of the procedure is about 30

 minutes later dressing 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.200
 compression knit and patient

 no varicose veins patient 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.299
 but there are superficially located 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.630
 spider veins as in this situation 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.610
 you do what you suggest in these 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.890
 cases we use sclerotherapy 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.200
 when the vein lumen is injected 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.600
 special substance which causes 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.579
 aseptic inflammation of the vascular walls and 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.900
 glued together depending on the diameter 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.910
 vessel we use different types 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.370
 lera therapy with deeper 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.200
 located this echo sclerotherapy and 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.330
 more surface is micro 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.890
 sclerotherapy in our clinic we 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.260
 we use the most modern methods 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.210
 diagnosis and treatment of varicose veins 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.720
 we have an individual approach to each 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.720
 to the patient
