and then also for lips I'm just keeping
this<00:02:00.149> very<00:02:00.509> simple<00:02:00.989> and<00:02:01.140> I'm<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.440> going<00:02:01.590> in

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
this very simple and I'm just going in

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.639 
this very simple and I'm just going in
with<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> clear<00:02:02.610> gloss<00:02:02.940> from<00:02:03.360> benefit<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:04.530> I

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.350 
with a clear gloss from benefit and I
didn't<00:02:04.860> want<00:02:05.039> the<00:02:05.160> ellipse<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.729> overpower<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
didn't want the ellipse to overpower the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.820 
didn't want the ellipse to overpower the
eyes<00:02:06.479> or<00:02:06.509> anything<00:02:06.959> so<00:02:07.080> I<00:02:07.140> would<00:02:07.530> keep<00:02:07.679> them

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.820 

so<00:02:20.390> this<00:02:20.569> next<00:02:20.750> one<00:02:20.959> now<00:02:21.140> I've<00:02:21.349> named<00:02:21.590> ice

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
so this next one now I've named ice

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.589
