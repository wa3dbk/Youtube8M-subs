products at the same in the same day I

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.190 
products at the same in the same day I
was<00:04:20.980> actually<00:04:21.160> scaling<00:04:21.760> pan<00:04:22.240> bread<00:04:22.540> and<00:04:22.870> that

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
was actually scaling pan bread and that

was actually scaling pan bread and that
was<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.620> time<00:04:23.860> when<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.130> Arabic<00:04:24.790> bread<00:04:25.120> had

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
was the time when the Arabic bread had

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.820 
was the time when the Arabic bread had
to<00:04:26.050> be<00:04:26.650> baked<00:04:26.950> so<00:04:27.790> I<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:28.450> showed<00:04:28.870> them<00:04:29.140> how<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.440> do

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
to be baked so I I showed them how to do

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.580 
to be baked so I I showed them how to do
that<00:04:30.070> with<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.430> couple<00:04:30.910> of<00:04:31.000> like<00:04:31.300> though<00:04:32.050> discs

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
that with a couple of like though discs

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.980 
that with a couple of like though discs
going<00:04:33.040> through<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.520> oven<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.360> then<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:34.750> said

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
going through the oven and then I said

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.200 
going through the oven and then I said
well<00:04:35.230> it's<00:04:35.590> nothing<00:04:36.190> complicated<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:37.060> you

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
well it's nothing complicated and you

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.240 
well it's nothing complicated and you
can<00:04:37.390> do<00:04:37.570> it<00:04:37.660> by<00:04:37.780> yourself<00:04:38.260> so<00:04:39.010> they<00:04:39.190> were

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
can do it by yourself so they were

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.490 
can do it by yourself so they were
interested<00:04:39.610> maybe<00:04:40.390> like<00:04:40.930> it's<00:04:41.290> an

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
interested maybe like it's an

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.220 
interested maybe like it's an
interesting<00:04:41.740> process<00:04:42.280> if<00:04:43.270> you<00:04:43.930> watch<00:04:44.200> like

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230
