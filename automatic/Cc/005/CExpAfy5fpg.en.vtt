you not well not in this prototype here

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.270 
you not well not in this prototype here
it<00:00:58.239> would<00:00:58.570> prove<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.899> most<00:00:59.140> useful<00:00:59.500> ingredient

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
when the time comes to give birth to a

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.320 
when the time comes to give birth to a
new<00:01:03.039> God<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:05.199> know<00:01:05.379> I<00:01:05.710> think<00:01:06.190> you<00:01:06.759> might<00:01:07.090> add
