and I get the to do it here let
me<00:00:18.640> just<00:00:18.760> zoom<00:00:19.060> in<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.770> it's<00:00:20.950> not<00:00:21.130> classified

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
me just zoom in so it's not classified

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.769 
me just zoom in so it's not classified
all<00:00:23.590> the<00:00:23.949> rocks<00:00:24.190> are<00:00:24.490> in<00:00:24.610> there<00:00:24.850> big<00:00:25.150> and<00:00:25.330> small

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.080 

just<00:00:28.779> as<00:00:29.170> it<00:00:29.410> came<00:00:29.529> out<00:00:29.590> of<00:00:29.770> the<00:00:30.010> ground<00:00:33.090> right

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
just as it came out of the ground right

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.680 
just as it came out of the ground right
now<00:00:34.239> I'm<00:00:34.420> just<00:00:34.600> catching<00:00:34.930> it<00:00:35.229> in<00:00:35.379> a<00:00:35.499> tote<00:00:35.890> box

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
now I'm just catching it in a tote box

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.729 
now I'm just catching it in a tote box
so<00:00:37.690> I<00:00:37.749> can<00:00:37.929> check<00:00:38.800> my<00:00:40.229> classified<00:00:41.229> material

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
so I can check my classified material

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:50.099 
so I can check my classified material
later<00:00:42.010> on<00:00:43.379> now<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:47.350> have<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.559> scraper<00:00:48.719> whoops<00:00:49.719> my

12<00:01:08.740> volt<00:01:08.950> bilge<00:01:09.220> pump<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:11.290> that's<00:01:11.530> pretty

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
12 volt bilge pump but that's pretty

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.780 
12 volt bilge pump but that's pretty
much<00:01:12.130> how<00:01:13.090> it<00:01:13.240> looks<00:01:13.510> like<00:01:14.340> when<00:01:15.340> you<00:01:15.490> look<00:01:15.640> at

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
much how it looks like when you look at

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.440

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
let's call it this way I've got three of

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.200 
let's call it this way I've got three of
them<00:01:40.960> one<00:01:41.740> what<00:01:41.950> takes<00:01:42.190> all<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.700> heavy-duty

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.200 
them one what takes all the heavy-duty
dirt<00:01:43.690> then<00:01:44.650> it<00:01:44.830> just<00:01:45.070> gets<00:01:45.340> me<00:01:45.520> there<00:01:45.670> on<00:01:45.850> here

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
dirt then it just gets me there on here

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.590 
dirt then it just gets me there on here
and<00:01:47.080> I<00:01:47.320> end<00:01:47.500> up<00:01:47.710> with<00:01:47.950> more<00:01:48.790> cleaner<00:01:49.240> water

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
and I end up with more cleaner water

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.190 
and I end up with more cleaner water
here

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
here

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.730 
here
hardly<00:01:51.070> any<00:01:51.190> sediment<00:01:52.320> when<00:01:53.320> I<00:01:53.380> said<00:01:53.560> I'm<00:01:53.710> just

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
hardly any sediment when I said I'm just

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.450 
hardly any sediment when I said I'm just
running<00:01:54.280> this<00:01:54.400> on<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:54.610> pill<00:01:54.940> form<00:01:55.409> and

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.370 

there's<00:01:59.360> a<00:01:59.450> limited<00:01:59.900> amount<00:01:59.960> of<00:02:00.290> water<00:02:02.170> but<00:02:03.170> I

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
there's a limited amount of water but I

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.260 
there's a limited amount of water but I
will<00:02:03.620> turn<00:02:03.830> it<00:02:03.950> on<00:02:04.070> later<00:02:04.280> on<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:04.820> I<00:02:05.060> will<00:02:05.120> show

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
will turn it on later on and I will show

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.730 
will turn it on later on and I will show
you<00:02:05.570> what<00:02:06.050> it<00:02:06.170> does

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.520 
you what it does
I<00:02:07.149> don't<00:02:08.149> think<00:02:08.210> anybody<00:02:08.720> can<00:02:08.930> shovel<00:02:09.320> this

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
I don't think anybody can shovel this

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.120 
I don't think anybody can shovel this
fast<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.310> machine<00:02:10.610> actually<00:02:10.820> cleans<00:02:11.270> it

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
fast and the machine actually cleans it

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.680 
fast and the machine actually cleans it
so<00:02:14.260> keep<00:02:15.260> in<00:02:15.410> mind<00:02:15.620> it's<00:02:15.860> only<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.340> bilge<00:02:16.580> pump

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
so keep in mind it's only a bilge pump

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.340 
so keep in mind it's only a bilge pump
and<00:02:17.920> it's<00:02:18.920> only<00:02:19.390> 1250<00:02:20.390> gallons<00:02:20.540> an<00:02:20.870> hour

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
and it's only 1250 gallons an hour

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.670 
and it's only 1250 gallons an hour
I<00:02:22.390> haven't<00:02:23.390> hooked<00:02:23.480> up<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.840> electric<00:02:24.230> pump<00:02:24.500> or

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
I haven't hooked up the electric pump or

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.560 
I haven't hooked up the electric pump or
the<00:02:24.800> gas<00:02:24.980> powered<00:02:25.400> pump<00:02:25.730> but<00:02:26.000> if<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.240> would<00:02:26.390> do

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
the gas powered pump but if I would do

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.630 
the gas powered pump but if I would do
that<00:02:26.780> you'll<00:02:27.590> see<00:02:27.650> how<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.220> water<00:02:28.490> is

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
that you'll see how the water is

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.490 
that you'll see how the water is
spraying<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.240> a<00:02:29.360> second<00:02:29.750> here<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:30.080> will<00:02:30.380> hook

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
spraying in a second here I will hook

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.520 
spraying in a second here I will hook
this<00:02:30.709> up<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.970> it's<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.630> really<00:02:34.060> neat<00:02:35.060> toy<00:02:35.530> if

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
this up and it's a really neat toy if

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.410 
this up and it's a really neat toy if
you<00:02:37.100> want<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.400> go<00:02:37.550> through<00:02:37.790> material<00:02:38.270> really

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
you want to go through material really

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.520 
you want to go through material really
fast<00:02:39.310> unclassified<00:02:40.480> big<00:02:41.480> rock<00:02:41.750> small<00:02:42.200> walks

fast unclassified big rock small walks

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.699 
fast unclassified big rock small walks
it<00:02:42.800> doesn't<00:02:43.130> matter<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:44.150> eats<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.600> all<00:02:44.720> up<00:02:44.780> okay

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
it doesn't matter it eats it all up okay

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.790 
it doesn't matter it eats it all up okay
I<00:02:46.010> will<00:02:46.459> be<00:02:47.300> back<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:48.190> show<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.220> how<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.580> works
