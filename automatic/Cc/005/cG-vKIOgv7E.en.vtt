00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.700
 well girls are matt revolution and they are 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.070
 here to comment on this discovery 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.250
 in zombie mode on transit 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.719
 obviously of Greek was and the medium a 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.779
 these wheat fields I noticed that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.830
 there were little streets so I decided to 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.710
 go and I discovered that here it is 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.960
 hide waiting for you to turn 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.500
 meanwhile on this road a small one that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.250
 you don't even see it and I found out that 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.309
 there was attention to attention 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.989
 the nos for a tot and boys I do not know what 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.430
 home they had put here to do it 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.430
 shenaz of bets 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.100
 I don't think you're dealing with anybody 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.539
 however, you immediately notice that 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.190
 that map they proposed again 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.309
 probably it was in green run 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.949
 this is this map 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.350
 also you can stay away too 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.409
 from the low zombies or from the inhabitants 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.320
 the forest the goals at home are and 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.500
 you will find a part of the weapon 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.390
 final here is this piece here 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.040
 that I have not yet understood what the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.030
 piece the handle I think here it is here is the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.770
 found of your piece in a few words 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.700
 the map here is this does not linger 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.700
 more than that 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.360
 here they will be able to break even zombies 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.579
 in fact you will be able to stay there where he has placed 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.860
 to survive it is not open 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:46.520
 nothing else 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.520
 a little different from the old one 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.850
 I was trying to see if it opened 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.030
 some doors maybe close but 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.890
 even the lights do not open anything 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.310
 servers have something to do 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.820
 obviously more destroyed like a pa 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.820
 the previous one 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.929
 also to look for with there was nothing 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.459
 oh well guys and it's a nice I like it if you do 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.650
 liked the video though 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.750
 information on black ops 2 sign up 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.010

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.010
