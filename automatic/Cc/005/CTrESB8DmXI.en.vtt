00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.070 
research trends globally so I'm looking
at<00:00:16.890> runways<00:00:17.340> I'm<00:00:17.730> also<00:00:18.029> looking<00:00:18.330> at<00:00:18.690> what<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
at runways I'm also looking at what the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.870 
at runways I'm also looking at what the
European<00:00:19.560> market<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:19.980> doing<00:00:20.369> at<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> same

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
European market is doing at the same

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.599 
European market is doing at the same
time<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.449> love<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.779> people<00:00:22.380> watch<00:00:22.430> so<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.460> think

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
time I love to people watch so I think

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.400 
time I love to people watch so I think
between<00:00:24.000> those<00:00:24.269> three<00:00:24.539> things<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.260> really

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
between those three things I can really

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.679 
between those three things I can really
decide<00:00:25.769> for<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.640> trends<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.119> are<00:00:27.180> right<00:00:27.420> for

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
decide for the trends that are right for

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.389 
decide for the trends that are right for
our<00:00:27.750> Canadian<00:00:27.990> consumer<00:00:33.710> so<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> Cynthia

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
our Canadian consumer so in the Cynthia

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.090 
our Canadian consumer so in the Cynthia
sticks<00:00:35.760> really<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.600> looked<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.260> three<00:00:37.590> distinct

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
sticks really I looked at three distinct

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.889 
sticks really I looked at three distinct
looks<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.790> think<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.270> each<00:00:39.450> look<00:00:39.719> can

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
looks and I think that each look can

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.959 
looks and I think that each look can
talk<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.410> either<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.309> same<00:00:41.489> woman<00:00:41.850> or

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
talk to either the same woman or

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.760 
talk to either the same woman or
different<00:00:42.300> women<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.079> first<00:00:43.350> one<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.649> we

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
different women the first one that we

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.220 
different women the first one that we
really<00:00:43.980> looked<00:00:44.280> at<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:45.000> great<00:00:45.390> day<00:00:45.629> dress<00:00:45.960> in

a<00:00:46.289> floral<00:00:46.649> print<00:00:46.829> floral<00:00:47.579> prints<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:47.940> really

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
a floral print floral prints are really

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.430

classic it has a little bit more of a

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.219 
classic it has a little bit more of a
preppy<00:01:09.640> approach<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.330> really<00:01:10.659> wanted<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:10.990> use

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
preppy approach I really wanted to use

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.980 
preppy approach I really wanted to use
color<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:11.890> show<00:01:12.399> color<00:01:12.729> so<00:01:13.240> we<00:01:13.360> took<00:01:13.509> a<00:01:13.570> basic

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
color and show color so we took a basic

white<00:01:14.170> shirt<00:01:14.470> with<00:01:14.890> a<00:01:14.920> little<00:01:15.220> bit<00:01:15.340> of<00:01:15.369> updated

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
white shirt with a little bit of updated

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.149 
white shirt with a little bit of updated
details<00:01:16.299> in<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.570> collar<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:17.380> we<00:01:17.619> took<00:01:17.830> the

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
details in the collar and we took the

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.710 
details in the collar and we took the
new<00:01:18.399> trench<00:01:18.729> for<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:18.939> season<00:01:19.360> which<00:01:19.539> is<00:01:19.689> a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
new trench for the season which is a

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.690

white crop trench and we layered it
together<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.390> I<00:01:22.450> think<00:01:22.689> just<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.640> color
