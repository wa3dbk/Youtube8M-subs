00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
easy transfer everybody's got a

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.460 
easy transfer everybody's got a
different<00:00:37.000> style<00:00:37.360> of<00:00:37.600> transferring<00:00:38.110> that's

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
just the way that works the easiest for

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.930 
just the way that works the easiest for
me<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:41.070> basically<00:00:42.070> at<00:00:42.160> this<00:00:42.280> point<00:00:42.370> I<00:00:42.730> just

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
me and basically at this point I just

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.580 
me and basically at this point I just
kind<00:00:43.090> of<00:00:43.180> bring<00:00:43.450> my<00:00:43.600> legs<00:00:43.899> in<00:00:44.110> at<00:00:44.350> like<00:00:44.530> a

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
kind of bring my legs in at like a

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.069 
kind of bring my legs in at like a
downward<00:00:45.579> angle<00:00:45.760> I<00:00:46.120> kind<00:00:46.360> of<00:00:46.420> slide<00:00:46.720> them<00:00:46.930> in

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
downward angle I kind of slide them in

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.080 
downward angle I kind of slide them in
underneath<00:00:47.739> the<00:00:48.309> steering<00:00:48.579> wheel<00:00:48.820> like<00:00:49.059> that

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
underneath the steering wheel like that

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.160 
underneath the steering wheel like that
I<00:00:49.510> do<00:00:50.020> one<00:00:50.380> leg<00:00:50.620> at<00:00:50.649> a<00:00:50.829> time<00:00:50.860> and<00:00:52.020> then<00:00:53.020> I'm<00:00:53.140> just

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
I do one leg at a time and then I'm just

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.190 
I do one leg at a time and then I'm just
pinning<00:00:54.070> up<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.370> left<00:00:54.610> leg<00:00:54.880> like<00:00:55.059> that<00:00:55.360> once<00:00:56.079> I

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
pinning up the left leg like that once I

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.319 
pinning up the left leg like that once I
get<00:00:56.260> inside<00:00:56.590> of<00:00:56.920> my<00:00:57.010> car<00:00:57.219> I<00:00:57.250> like<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.670> cross<00:00:58.030> my

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
get inside of my car I like to cross my

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.330 
get inside of my car I like to cross my
legs<00:00:58.600> because<00:00:59.290> it's<00:00:59.530> more<00:00:59.710> efficient<00:01:00.160> for

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
legs because it's more efficient for

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.310 
legs because it's more efficient for
space<00:01:00.670> and<00:01:01.000> also<00:01:01.360> if<00:01:01.540> you<00:01:01.660> have<00:01:01.780> spasticity

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
space and also if you have spasticity

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.619 
space and also if you have spasticity
like<00:01:02.710> I<00:01:02.860> do<00:01:02.920> it<00:01:03.550> makes<00:01:03.790> them<00:01:03.940> less<00:01:04.119> likely<00:01:04.180> to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
like I do it makes them less likely to

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.559 
like I do it makes them less likely to
spasm<00:01:04.989> while<00:01:05.350> you're<00:01:05.500> driving<00:01:06.210> okay<00:01:07.210> now<00:01:07.509> to

00:01:07.559 --> 00:01:07.569 
spasm while you're driving okay now to

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:10.050 
spasm while you're driving okay now to
get<00:01:07.810> my<00:01:07.929> chair<00:01:08.200> into<00:01:08.649> the<00:01:08.770> car<00:01:09.009> I<00:01:09.249> start<00:01:09.939> with
