00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
just so much easier than sewing grunting

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.630 
just so much easier than sewing grunting

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
so this is just a lot quicker and a lot

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.520 
so this is just a lot quicker and a lot
easier<00:01:24.700> there's<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.630> really<00:01:25.900> fun<00:01:26.080> one<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.409> do

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
easier there's a really fun one to do

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.640 
easier there's a really fun one to do
with<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.740> kit<00:01:26.979> so<00:01:27.750> now<00:01:28.750> we've<00:01:28.930> cut<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.320> shape

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
with the kit so now we've cut a shape

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.210 
with the kit so now we've cut a shape
out<00:01:29.890> just<00:01:30.549> get<00:01:30.700> rid<00:01:30.790> of<00:01:30.850> that<00:01:31.119> for<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.450> moment

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.429 
out just get rid of that for the moment
we<00:01:33.220> need<00:01:33.369> to<00:01:33.520> score<00:01:33.939> this<00:01:34.540> line<00:01:34.810> here<00:01:35.170> so<00:01:35.320> we

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
we need to score this line here so we

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.990 
we need to score this line here so we
get<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.590> really<00:01:35.830> neat<00:01:36.070> fold<00:01:36.430> so<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.729> need<00:01:36.939> to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000
