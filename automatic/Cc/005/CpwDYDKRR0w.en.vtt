one<00:00:46.500> block<00:00:46.739> one<00:00:47.430> more<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:49.039> that's<00:00:50.090> like<00:00:51.090> save

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
one block one more like that's like save

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.340 
one block one more like that's like save
it<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> way<00:00:53.879> down<00:00:54.059> here

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
and then you put like a piston to out

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.640 
and then you put like a piston to out
and<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.800> put<00:01:04.280> that<00:01:05.280> there<00:01:06.200> redstone<00:01:07.200> so

and then you put that there redstone so
I<00:01:07.860> mean<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> redstone<00:01:08.670> torch<00:01:08.820> let<00:01:09.360> me<00:01:09.450> go

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.880 

donate<00:01:13.500> long<00:01:15.080> day<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.290> rest<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:16.830> cool<00:01:18.800> then<00:01:19.800> I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
donate long day to rest are cool then I

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.510 
donate long day to rest are cool then I
go<00:01:20.010> why<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.280> help<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.850> pressing<00:01:21.240> nine<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.340> it

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
go why the help and pressing nine so it

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.780 
go why the help and pressing nine so it
sets<00:01:23.730> it<00:01:23.850> off<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.300> then<00:01:24.710> redstone<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.010> up<00:01:28.790> I'm

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
sets it off and then redstone and up I'm

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.150 
sets it off and then redstone and up I'm
pressure<00:01:30.120> plate<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.160> resets<00:01:32.160> it<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.990> not

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
pressure plate so it resets it like not

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.520 
pressure plate so it resets it like not
so<00:01:35.160> then<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.610> go<00:01:35.820> ahead<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.540> get<00:01:37.250> your<00:01:39.530> signs

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
so then you go ahead and get your signs

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.340 
so then you go ahead and get your signs
and<00:01:40.950> pull<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.130> all<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.400> way<00:01:41.490> across<00:01:42.080> and<00:01:43.080> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
and pull it all the way across and you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.610 
and pull it all the way across and you
need<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:43.950> make<00:01:43.980> lava<00:01:44.610> too<00:01:45.000> deep<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:46.020> Sundance

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
need to make lava too deep the Sundance

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.730 
need to make lava too deep the Sundance
and<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:47.040> why<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.210> too<00:01:48.420> deep<00:01:48.740> make

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
and that's why it's not too deep make

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.930 
and that's why it's not too deep make
sense<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.160> too<00:01:50.490> deep<00:01:52.520> come<00:01:53.520> all<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.910> way

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
sense that too deep come all the way

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.050 
sense that too deep come all the way
across<00:01:54.090> er<00:01:54.330> I<00:01:54.780> start<00:01:55.650> put<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.130> out<00:01:56.220> there<00:01:56.250> but

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
across er I start put you out there but

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.440 
across er I start put you out there but
why<00:01:57.570> do<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.810> want<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.430> because<00:01:59.430> even<00:02:00.210> if<00:02:00.330> they

why do you want it because even if they
do<00:02:00.630> get<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.990> they're<00:02:01.140> gonna<00:02:01.260> die<00:02:01.500> anyway<00:02:01.970> well

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
do get it they're gonna die anyway well

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.110 
do get it they're gonna die anyway well
make<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.780> abundant<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.340> like<00:02:05.820> i<00:02:05.970> have

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
make it abundant like that like i have

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.630 
make it abundant like that like i have
done<00:02:06.300> with<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:07.050> light<00:02:07.229> vines<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:07.920> walk

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
done with the light vines and so walk

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.690 
done with the light vines and so walk
across<00:02:10.070> spray<00:02:11.070> into<00:02:11.250> lava<00:02:11.550> good<00:02:13.459> let's<00:02:14.459> get<00:02:14.640> to

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
across spray into lava good let's get to

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.729 
across spray into lava good let's get to
the<00:02:14.940> second<00:02:15.330> trap<00:02:15.510> very<00:02:16.110> simple<00:02:17.209> what<00:02:18.739> yeah

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
the second trap very simple what yeah

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.800 
the second trap very simple what yeah
very<00:02:20.010> simple<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.610> easy<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.209> get<00:02:21.330> out<00:02:21.480> from

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
very simple and easy to get out from

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.790 
very simple and easy to get out from

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
um you build like a trench like LA and

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.199 
um you build like a trench like LA and
then<00:02:33.680> sticky<00:02:34.680> pistons<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.250> contestant<00:02:35.730> sticky

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
then sticky pistons to contestant sticky

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.470 
then sticky pistons to contestant sticky
pistons<00:02:36.630> tickets<00:02:36.900> been<00:02:37.640> redstone<00:02:38.640> put

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
pistons tickets been redstone put

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.949 
pistons tickets been redstone put
waccabuc<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.140> redstone<00:02:40.560> pressure<00:02:41.430> plate

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
waccabuc the redstone pressure plate

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.140 
waccabuc the redstone pressure plate
block<00:02:42.959> block<00:02:44.330> okay<00:02:45.330> pop<00:02:46.140> shop

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.009

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
then make it go down with tinting go to

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.170 
then make it go down with tinting go to
the<00:02:57.370> third<00:02:57.579> trap<00:02:57.849> the<00:02:58.629> one<00:02:58.810> my<00:02:58.959> friend<00:02:59.200> made

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
the third trap the one my friend made

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.360 
the third trap the one my friend made
this<00:03:01.180> one<00:03:01.480> is<00:03:02.129> kind<00:03:03.129> of<00:03:04.230> like<00:03:05.230> yeah<00:03:05.829> it's<00:03:06.069> kind
