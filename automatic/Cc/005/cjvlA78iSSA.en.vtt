a video game together and here's here's

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.230 
a video game together and here's here's
a<00:01:18.109> starting<00:01:18.529> point<00:01:18.679> and<00:01:18.889> and<00:01:19.880> we've<00:01:19.999> kind<00:01:20.209> of

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
a starting point and and we've kind of

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.580 
a starting point and and we've kind of
been<00:01:20.329> on<00:01:20.450> this<00:01:20.539> journey<00:01:20.779> of<00:01:20.990> like<00:01:21.139> working<00:01:21.529> on

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
been on this journey of like working on

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.529 
been on this journey of like working on
it<00:01:21.740> in<00:01:21.859> bits<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.490> pieces<00:01:22.850> over<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.119> long<00:01:23.509> period

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
it in bits and pieces over a long period

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.330 
it in bits and pieces over a long period
of<00:01:23.810> time<00:01:23.869> and<00:01:24.259> it's<00:01:24.709> gone<00:01:24.889> through<00:01:25.100> all<00:01:25.310> kinds

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
of time and it's gone through all kinds

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.459 
of time and it's gone through all kinds
of<00:01:25.729> changes<00:01:25.880> over<00:01:26.359> over<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.929> years<00:01:27.109> and<00:01:27.380> it's

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
of changes over over the years and it's

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:28.890 
of changes over over the years and it's
gradually<00:01:28.039> kind<00:01:28.340> of<00:01:28.399> morphed

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
gradually kind of morphed

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.380 
gradually kind of morphed
to<00:01:29.110> what<00:01:29.290> it<00:01:29.410> is<00:01:29.610> what<00:01:30.610> weird<00:01:30.910> there<00:01:31.210> was<00:01:31.300> like

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
to what it is what weird there was like

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.290 
to what it is what weird there was like
