the most unique features on this truck

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.120 
the most unique features on this truck
that<00:02:30.510> stands<00:02:31.080> out<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.380> everybody<00:02:31.590> who<00:02:31.860> first

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
that stands out to everybody who first

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.120 
that stands out to everybody who first
sees<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.580> are<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:34.350> tires<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:34.920> it

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
sees it are the tires on it

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.340 
sees it are the tires on it
unlike<00:02:35.940> most<00:02:36.120> haul<00:02:36.390> trucks<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.990> would<00:02:37.170> have

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
unlike most haul trucks that would have

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.010 
unlike most haul trucks that would have
the<00:02:37.590> front<00:02:38.130> tires<00:02:38.480> centered<00:02:39.480> underneath<00:02:39.870> the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
tires and the rear tires and Center them

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.370 
tires and the rear tires and Center them
equally<00:02:47.100> under<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.580> dump<00:02:47.910> body<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.990> purpose

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
equally under the dump body the purpose

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.290 
equally under the dump body the purpose
was<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.680> spread<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.400> weight<00:02:50.550> of<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.880> load<00:02:51.060> on

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
was to spread the weight of the load on

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.140 
was to spread the weight of the load on
each<00:02:51.600> axle<00:02:52.230> equally<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.160> that's<00:02:53.550> exactly

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
each axle equally and that's exactly

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.540 
each axle equally and that's exactly
what<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.390> did<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.650> also<00:02:55.860> notice<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
what it did and you also notice that the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.760 
what it did and you also notice that the
front<00:02:56.790> two<00:02:56.970> tires

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
front two tires

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.140 
front two tires
unlike<00:02:58.770> most<00:02:58.920> trucks<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.580> would<00:02:59.730> have<00:02:59.910> the

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
unlike most trucks that would have the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.030 
unlike most trucks that would have the
front<00:03:00.450> tires<00:03:00.660> which<00:03:01.170> would<00:03:01.350> be<00:03:01.440> single

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
front tires which would be single

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.120 
front tires which would be single
this<00:03:02.610> has<00:03:02.820> dual<00:03:03.060> front<00:03:03.660> tires<00:03:03.930> on<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
this has dual front tires on it and the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.450 
this has dual front tires on it and the
idea<00:03:05.400> was<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.610> give<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.000> truck<00:03:06.210> better<00:03:07.460> make

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
idea was to give the truck better make

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.350 
idea was to give the truck better make
it<00:03:08.490> more<00:03:08.790> rugged<00:03:09.260> have<00:03:10.260> better<00:03:10.500> floatation

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
it more rugged have better floatation

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.910 
it more rugged have better floatation
more<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.390> better<00:03:12.690> traction<00:03:13.050> on<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.440> truck<00:03:13.680> and

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
more a better traction on the truck and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.650 
more a better traction on the truck and
it<00:03:14.070> actually<00:03:14.280> did<00:03:14.700> work<00:03:14.880> too<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.240> was<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.420> very

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
it actually did work too it was a very

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.600 
it actually did work too it was a very
good<00:03:15.870> designed<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.380> have<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.620> dual<00:03:17.130> wheels<00:03:17.430> in

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
good designed to have the dual wheels in

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.760 
good designed to have the dual wheels in
the<00:03:17.700> front<00:03:18.290> this<00:03:19.290> right<00:03:19.500> here<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:19.739> your

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
the front this right here is your

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.820 
the front this right here is your
hydraulic<00:03:19.980> fluid<00:03:20.670> tank<00:03:21.260> this<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.590> see

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
hydraulic fluid tank this that you see

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.800 
hydraulic fluid tank this that you see
coming<00:03:23.280> out<00:03:23.430> right<00:03:23.640> here<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.300> is<00:03:24.480> for<00:03:24.660> your

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
coming out right here this is for your

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.590 
coming out right here this is for your
tailgate<00:03:25.530> on<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.890> truck<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:27.120> one<00:03:27.300> on<00:03:27.420> this

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
tailgate on the truck the one on this

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.030 
tailgate on the truck the one on this
one's<00:03:27.780> been<00:03:27.959> removed<00:03:28.290> but<00:03:28.440> basically<00:03:28.800> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
one's been removed but basically the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.280 
one's been removed but basically the
tailgate<00:03:29.880> would<00:03:30.030> be<00:03:30.180> connected<00:03:30.690> there<00:03:31.080> and

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
tailgate would be connected there and

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.590 
tailgate would be connected there and
mount<00:03:31.800> on<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.070> end<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:32.700> would<00:03:33.000> support<00:03:33.270> the

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
mount on the end this would support the

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.280 
mount on the end this would support the
chain<00:03:34.250> on<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:36.180> end<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.660> tailgate<00:03:37.110> so

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
chain on the the end of the tailgate so

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.810 
chain on the the end of the tailgate so
basically<00:03:37.680> when<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.920> dump<00:03:38.130> body<00:03:38.280> lifted<00:03:38.700> up

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
basically when the dump body lifted up

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.310 
basically when the dump body lifted up
it<00:03:39.060> would<00:03:39.209> pull<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.510> tailgate<00:03:39.959> up<00:03:40.080> so<00:03:40.230> it

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
it would pull the tailgate up so it

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.130 
it would pull the tailgate up so it
could<00:03:40.500> dump<00:03:41.040> its<00:03:41.250> load

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.210 

there's<00:03:45.140> a<00:03:45.319> view<00:03:45.500> from<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.680> back<00:03:45.920> of<00:03:46.159> the

there's a view from the back of the

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.110 
there's a view from the back of the
truck<00:03:49.840> right<00:03:50.840> over<00:03:50.900> here<00:03:51.580> you'll<00:03:52.580> see<00:03:52.879> your

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
truck right over here you'll see your

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.930 
truck right over here you'll see your

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
your air filter right up here got up on

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.260 
your air filter right up here got up on
that<00:04:12.830> side<00:04:13.490> the<00:04:13.640> truck<00:04:13.960> is<00:04:14.960> basically<00:04:15.410> your

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
that side the truck is basically your

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.000 
that side the truck is basically your
one<00:04:17.270> of<00:04:17.390> your<00:04:17.570> air<00:04:17.780> intakes<00:04:18.260> right<00:04:18.530> here<00:04:18.860> and

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
one of your air intakes right here and

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.000 
one of your air intakes right here and

the other air cleaner there your engine

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.570 
the other air cleaner there your engine
right<00:04:22.190> down<00:04:22.370> in<00:04:22.550> there<00:04:22.700> and<00:04:24.280> this<00:04:25.280> is<00:04:25.340> a

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
right down in there and this is a

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.820 
right down in there and this is a
Detroit<00:04:26.120> in<00:04:26.270> this<00:04:26.390> one<00:04:26.570> here<00:04:26.810> like<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:27.740> said

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
Detroit in this one here like I said

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.380 
Detroit in this one here like I said
some<00:04:28.160> of<00:04:28.250> them<00:04:28.340> had<00:04:28.460> come<00:04:28.670> in<00:04:28.850> some<00:04:29.180> of<00:04:29.270> them

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
some of them had come in some of them

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.790 
some of them had come in some of them
were<00:04:29.480> Detroit's<00:04:32.260> now<00:04:33.260> we'll<00:04:33.380> take<00:04:33.470> a<00:04:33.530> look<00:04:33.620> up

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
were Detroit's now we'll take a look up

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.310 
were Detroit's now we'll take a look up
inside<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.220> cab<00:04:37.690> this<00:04:38.690> is<00:04:38.840> probably<00:04:39.140> one<00:04:39.290> of

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
inside the cab this is probably one of

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.400 
inside the cab this is probably one of
the<00:04:39.440> things<00:04:39.500> that<00:04:39.830> most<00:04:40.010> people<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:41.290> lot<00:04:42.290> of

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
the things that most people a lot of

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.140 
the things that most people a lot of
quarries<00:04:42.800> like<00:04:43.040> to<00:04:43.190> run<00:04:43.340> these<00:04:43.520> pay<00:04:43.790> haulers

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
quarries like to run these pay haulers

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.050 
quarries like to run these pay haulers
because<00:04:44.480> they're<00:04:44.660> very<00:04:44.870> very<00:04:45.610> good<00:04:46.610> for<00:04:46.820> off

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
because they're very very good for off

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.700 
because they're very very good for off
highway<00:04:47.390> but<00:04:47.930> this<00:04:48.080> is<00:04:48.200> probably<00:04:48.440> one<00:04:48.590> of<00:04:48.620> the

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
highway but this is probably one of the

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.230 
highway but this is probably one of the
things<00:04:48.950> a<00:04:49.040> lot<00:04:49.280> of<00:04:49.340> operators<00:04:49.670> hated<00:04:50.060> about

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
things a lot of operators hated about

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.640 
things a lot of operators hated about
them<00:04:50.390> that<00:04:50.480> the<00:04:50.600> cabs<00:04:50.870> as<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.170> can<00:04:51.290> see<00:04:51.470> we're

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
them that the cabs as you can see we're

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.060 
them that the cabs as you can see we're
very<00:04:51.680> narrow<00:04:52.190> on<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.520> truck<00:04:53.740> so<00:04:54.740> here's<00:04:54.920> an

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
very narrow on the truck so here's an

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.530 
very narrow on the truck so here's an
inside<00:04:55.340> view<00:04:55.580> from<00:04:55.790> the<00:04:55.880> pay<00:04:56.030> hauler<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.360> this

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
inside view from the pay hauler and this

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.910 
inside view from the pay hauler and this
is<00:04:56.660> basically<00:04:56.840> what<00:04:57.230> you'd<00:04:57.380> see<00:04:57.530> if<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:57.710> were

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
is basically what you'd see if you were

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.020 
is basically what you'd see if you were
looking<00:04:58.190> at<00:04:58.310> when<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:58.520> were<00:04:58.610> driving<00:04:58.820> the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
looking at when you were driving the

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.290 
looking at when you were driving the
truck<00:04:59.860> as<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:00.950> can<00:05:01.070> see<00:05:01.250> this<00:05:01.430> is<00:05:01.640> to<00:05:02.150> work

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
truck as you can see this is to work

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.810 
truck as you can see this is to work
your<00:05:02.450> dump<00:05:02.660> body<00:05:02.870> this<00:05:03.110> lever<00:05:03.350> right<00:05:03.560> here

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
your dump body this lever right here

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.300 
your dump body this lever right here
basically<00:05:04.820> to<00:05:05.690> raise<00:05:05.960> and<00:05:06.200> lower<00:05:06.230> it<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:06.770> hold

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
basically to raise and lower it and hold

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.690 
basically to raise and lower it and hold
it

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
it

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.990 
it
here's<00:05:08.660> your<00:05:08.840> gears<00:05:09.110> right<00:05:09.410> here<00:05:09.800> your<00:05:10.790> on/off

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
here's your gears right here your on/off

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.270 
here's your gears right here your on/off
switch<00:05:11.480> for<00:05:11.720> the<00:05:11.780> truck<00:05:12.050> your<00:05:12.740> pedals<00:05:13.130> the

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
switch for the truck your pedals the

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.100 
switch for the truck your pedals the
steering<00:05:13.640> wheel<00:05:13.820> that's<00:05:14.450> basically<00:05:14.900> the

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
steering wheel that's basically the

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:24.070 
steering wheel that's basically the
whole<00:05:15.140> setup<00:05:15.530> on<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:15.770> truck<00:05:15.980> right<00:05:16.130> there

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.779 

now<00:05:24.590> these<00:05:24.770> trucks<00:05:25.069> are<00:05:25.190> really<00:05:25.370> unique

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
now these trucks are really unique

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.430 
now these trucks are really unique
because<00:05:26.090> as<00:05:26.449> I<00:05:26.660> said<00:05:26.900> being<00:05:27.199> that<00:05:27.319> they're

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
because as I said being that they're

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.740 
because as I said being that they're
four-wheel<00:05:27.860> drive<00:05:28.160> you<00:05:28.759> can<00:05:28.940> easily<00:05:29.210> maneuver

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
four-wheel drive you can easily maneuver

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.930 
four-wheel drive you can easily maneuver
them<00:05:30.080> on<00:05:30.229> quarries<00:05:30.680> you<00:05:31.310> don't<00:05:31.520> see<00:05:31.669> a<00:05:31.699> lot<00:05:31.910> of

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
them on quarries you don't see a lot of

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.640 
them on quarries you don't see a lot of
these<00:05:32.030> on<00:05:32.210> mining<00:05:32.539> operations<00:05:33.050> but<00:05:33.289> quarries

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
these on mining operations but quarries

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.860 
these on mining operations but quarries
do<00:05:33.830> like<00:05:34.009> to<00:05:34.190> run<00:05:34.340> them<00:05:34.490> because<00:05:34.849> they're<00:05:35.629> good

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
do like to run them because they're good

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.200 
do like to run them because they're good
offroad<00:05:36.379> trucks<00:05:36.409> and<00:05:37.069> what's<00:05:37.819> really<00:05:38.000> nice

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
offroad trucks and what's really nice

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.670 
offroad trucks and what's really nice
about<00:05:38.270> these<00:05:38.659> trucks<00:05:38.930> is<00:05:39.050> the<00:05:39.199> fact<00:05:39.409> that<00:05:39.500> they

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
about these trucks is the fact that they

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.740 
about these trucks is the fact that they
can<00:05:39.860> go<00:05:39.979> through<00:05:40.159> practically<00:05:40.699> anything<00:05:41.000> as

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
can go through practically anything as

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.050 
can go through practically anything as
far<00:05:42.080> as<00:05:42.139> going<00:05:42.470> up<00:05:42.710> steep<00:05:43.069> inclines<00:05:43.580> or<00:05:43.789> grades

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
far as going up steep inclines or grades

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.930 
far as going up steep inclines or grades
these<00:05:44.900> trucks<00:05:45.259> have<00:05:45.500> no<00:05:46.069> problem<00:05:46.550> going<00:05:46.759> up

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
these trucks have no problem going up

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.550 
these trucks have no problem going up
steep<00:05:47.240> slopes<00:05:47.599> or<00:05:47.780> anything<00:05:48.050> because<00:05:48.349> of<00:05:48.379> the

steep slopes or anything because of the

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.490 
steep slopes or anything because of the
dual<00:05:49.400> tires<00:05:49.819> on<00:05:50.150> them<00:05:50.389> and<00:05:50.539> the<00:05:50.629> way<00:05:50.750> the<00:05:50.960> truck

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.089 
dual tires on them and the way the truck
is<00:05:51.650> built<00:05:51.919> and<00:05:53.139> they<00:05:54.139> can<00:05:54.440> be<00:05:54.650> however<00:05:54.860> a
