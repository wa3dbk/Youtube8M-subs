00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.870
 Now it's six times with pride 112 balls 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:14.840
 6 strikes 6 hits 4 strikeouts 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:23.360
 Kedomo conceded that there were two four-ball is I was to say turn 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:27.160
 Well when I saw the pitching in the first half of the installation loss, that side was a long time on the board 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.110
 But yeah very control 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.329
 But it is the very end 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:37.280
 Now it's 2nd place and it's Chika Daidai. 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:44.420
 Line drawing has been wearing is, however force 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:46.420
 Really so is by Hey hue cracking 153 kilometers from the other first pitch but it is in sale 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.280
 I'm sorry. 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.280
 I think you a great No. 150 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:59.360
 You're from a blue frame, right? 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:02.410
 It would be envious from the perspective of the other team 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.410
 Hey fast ball 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.189
 Just or 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.200
 It's been blazing now, it's cheese now, but it's gradually getting better 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:17.640
 Enemy squalane 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.810
 I will analyze in various ways If I think that there is a challenge in the future, I will do analysis 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.159
 Not even 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:29.440
 Yes do you because you do not strike quite of this after all was the Tteyuu fast ball 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:31.760
 It is from now on I'm there is a fast ball and fork distress 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.970
 Really 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.590
 3 days 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:44.700
 When you are this kind of pitching in Ne'll take Mount Aso 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.700
 Mon I do not know want focused on Which I think you puzzled batter in 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.950
 It is guts after having learned the argument 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.140
 4 th 5 th pitched as a pitcher pitcher 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.700
 Hmm 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:01.190
 Really perfectly suppressed aa 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:06.570
 I hit a single hit, and the second hit is an upper bound 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:12.180
 Uemoto is going to butter normally It changes catcher 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:17.720
 Hey again I Kai earlier not even say I lead of the pre-investment 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:22.580
 I had a lead that twisted my neck a little 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:29.020
 I think I had pressed in too straight in 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.020
 I felt like I got a pitcher and got a catcher too. 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.970
 I was waiting and fm 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:47.520
 It was a confrontation of today's starter aces, but now the third pitcher is the one to drink now 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.220
 Is up 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.100
 It does Mase No. 2 Hand Hawks hill 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.030
 This straight phone 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.030
 150 kg 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:07.400
 And so the ball is coming really up to the first-th attractive to pitcher that fast 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.400
 The 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.850
 It is the point 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.690
 Well that 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.950
 The ball is high 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.910
 Hey Because it is Toka does not matter 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.060
 Is 0 by ball 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.060
 Oh by the way the frozen one is still the ball is strong 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:37.100
 As it takes a mania and the straight also really gets the ball speed a 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:40.060
 Uemoto was registered on April 27th at 1st Army 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.060
 On April 2 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.840
 I was injured and killed. This is 3 locality evolution 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:54.790
 It is a first year 33 year old couple 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.830
 Batting is one window but another 302 on top of the strong 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.420
 It is the rise of Ooba 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:04.400
 Hey, it is 23 land of sweet straight Atonan 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.209
 After all the hot water one-bound distribution ball 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.209
 I'm shake 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.860
 Uemoto Sansha strikes the 3rd person Kaneko who goes for the butter offering 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:34.400
 Though the soul of the loose ball but this Kaneko book has been working hard since the opening day 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.950
 Money 0 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.580
 It's almost time for you to get tired, though 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.830
 Well 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.830
 There is also a sexual force, yes 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:55.570
 My body is late but I think my physical fitness name is fine for me Oh yes 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:58.740
 I have various weapons, but the speed of my feet is also a weapon. 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.789
 Very I think this is the meat force 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.789
 Good 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.500
 It is this Kaneko who was really paid attention from the camp 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.660
 Now 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:17.100
 Protecting the outrageous outfield collection and Maa true present 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:23.360
 I keep the short, but it is 4 c 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.360
 There is no doubt that the defensive is a good player even if there is a ne yes problem 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:32.540
 There are no two outrunners, but even when the table becomes painfully developed, along Seibu 4th 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.720
 If you lose today 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.260
 It will be 1 card 3 consecutive defeats of 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.260
 Battle against Hawk 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.660
 Good good 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:47.360
 Three-party strikeout great large 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.360
 This was to show a superb pitching Kodai Senga 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:56.700
 No, I just put in the soul movement 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.770
 It fell 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.770
 Naka Naka it's not subject to Well then this
