every<00:00:12.540> time<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.719> bought<00:00:12.900> heels<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.440> would<00:00:13.590> go

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
every time I bought heels I would go

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.090 
every time I bought heels I would go
half<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.460> size<00:00:14.639> smaller<00:00:15.509> just<00:00:16.320> because<00:00:16.859> I

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
half a size smaller just because I

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.370 
half a size smaller just because I
didn't<00:00:17.670> like<00:00:17.850> my<00:00:18.090> foot<00:00:18.449> sliding<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.289> out

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.660 
didn't like my foot sliding in and out
because<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.800> would<00:00:19.920> either<00:00:20.039> get<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.310> blister

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
because I would either get a blister

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.400 
because I would either get a blister
back<00:00:21.330> at<00:00:22.279> back<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.430> my<00:00:23.550> foot<00:00:23.820> or<00:00:24.140> it<00:00:25.140> would<00:00:25.380> just

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
back at back of my foot or it would just

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.380 
back at back of my foot or it would just
be<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:25.920> tight<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.609> front<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.119> like<00:00:27.269> the

stuck in something way too tight and

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.040 
stuck in something way too tight and
always<00:00:32.520> that's<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:32.820> comfortable<00:00:33.300> but<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.870> felt

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.510 
always that's not comfortable but I felt
like<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.230> was<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> only<00:00:34.620> way<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.890> not<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.219> my

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.580 
like it was the only way to not have my
foot<00:00:35.760> slide<00:00:36.030> out<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:36.960> years<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.469> was

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
like boots or something that I would

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.850 
like boots or something that I would
wear<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> sock<00:00:42.239> with<00:00:42.480> then<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.230> would<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.559> you

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
know like a six and a half but then any

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.110 
know like a six and a half but then any
time<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.620> did<00:00:46.800> heels<00:00:47.070> don't<00:00:47.250> get<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> six<00:00:47.820> just

time I did heels don't get a six just

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.430 
time I did heels don't get a six just
because<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.570> felt<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.020> was<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.320> only

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
because I felt that that was the only

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.650 
because I felt that that was the only
way<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.860> could<00:00:50.399> keep<00:00:50.550> my<00:00:50.700> foot<00:00:50.969> from<00:00:51.210> sliding<00:00:51.360> in

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
way I could keep my foot from sliding in

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.920 
way I could keep my foot from sliding in
and<00:00:51.809> out<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> shoe<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.070> what<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.690> one

and out of the shoe so what then one

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.540 
and out of the shoe so what then one

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
they would start to slip out so I was

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.600 
they would start to slip out so I was
like<00:01:13.049> there<00:01:13.409> was<00:01:13.500> no<00:01:13.680> way<00:01:13.830> I'm<00:01:14.100> leaving<00:01:14.490> these

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
like there was no way I'm leaving these

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.039 
like there was no way I'm leaving these
shoes<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.090> they<00:01:15.180> were<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> great<00:01:15.780> price

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
shoes and they were like a great price

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.320 
shoes and they were like a great price
and<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.369> will<00:01:17.580> make<00:01:17.759> these<00:01:18.000> shoes

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and I was like I will make these shoes

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.100 
and I was like I will make these shoes
work<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:20.009> got<00:01:20.310> these<00:01:20.970> little<00:01:21.330> inserts<00:01:21.810> that

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
work so I got these little inserts that

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.740 
work so I got these little inserts that
you<00:01:22.229> could<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:23.009> shoes<00:01:23.330> just<00:01:24.330> back<00:01:24.509> here

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
you could get for shoes just back here

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.780 
you could get for shoes just back here
in<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.930> heel<00:01:24.960> part<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.549> kind<00:01:26.759> of

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
in the heel part and it just kind of

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.420 
in the heel part and it just kind of
adds<00:01:26.970> cushion<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.630> then<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.710> area<00:01:28.770> here

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
adds cushion and then in this area here

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.580 
adds cushion and then in this area here
because<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:29.939> pretty<00:01:30.150> small<00:01:30.840> thin<00:01:31.259> feet

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
because they have pretty small thin feet

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.910 
because they have pretty small thin feet
I<00:01:31.619> guess<00:01:32.000> this<00:01:33.000> area<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:34.140> also<00:01:34.380> kind<00:01:34.799> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
I guess this area here was also kind of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.609 
I guess this area here was also kind of
loose<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.909> put<00:01:36.450> an<00:01:36.600> insole<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> bottom

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
loose so I put an insole on the bottom

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.440 
loose so I put an insole on the bottom
too<00:01:37.950> after<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.880> realized<00:01:39.329> how

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
too after that I realized how

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330 
too after that I realized how
comfortable<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.350> shoes<00:01:40.560> were<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.100> felt

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
comfortable this shoes were and I felt

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.550 
comfortable this shoes were and I felt
like<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.579> could<00:01:41.790> wear<00:01:41.939> them<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.509> long<00:01:42.720> nights<00:01:43.290> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
like I could wear them for long nights I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.490 
like I could wear them for long nights I
can<00:01:43.740> walk<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.460> them<00:01:44.670> even<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.840> city<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.320> could

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
can walk in them even the city it could

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.679 
can walk in them even the city it could
like<00:01:46.680> walk<00:01:47.009> downtown<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.759> walk<00:01:48.030> back<00:01:48.240> home<00:01:48.420> in

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
like walk downtown and walk back home in

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.499 
like walk downtown and walk back home in
them<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:50.430> course<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.850> might<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:51.149> probably

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
them and of course it might be probably

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.819 
them and of course it might be probably
a<00:01:51.570> little<00:01:51.689> more<00:01:51.840> exhausted<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.560> was<00:01:52.710> wearing

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
a little more exhausted if I was wearing

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.310 
a little more exhausted if I was wearing
flats<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:53.939> still<00:01:54.090> doable<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.810> I

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
flats but it was still doable and I

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.319 
flats but it was still doable and I
couldn't<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:55.920> over<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.549> why<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.180> then<00:01:57.299> I

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
couldn't get over like why and then I

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.690 
couldn't get over like why and then I
just<00:01:57.570> realized<00:01:57.990> like<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:59.040> because<00:01:59.520> this

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
just realized like it's because this

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.120 
just realized like it's because this
shoe<00:01:59.909> actually<00:02:00.210> fits<00:02:00.810> me<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.740> pushing

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
shoe actually fits me and I have pushing

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.789 
shoe actually fits me and I have pushing
in<00:02:02.250> all<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.640> right<00:02:02.759> areas<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.799> just

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
in all the right areas so I just

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.570 
in all the right areas so I just
realized<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.369> buying<00:02:05.610> half

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
realized that buying half

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.240 
realized that buying half
or<00:02:06.790> even<00:02:07.060> size<00:02:07.450> up<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.290> putting<00:02:08.680> more<00:02:08.920> cushion

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
or even size up and putting more cushion

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.220 
or even size up and putting more cushion
inside<00:02:09.610> then<00:02:10.180> your<00:02:10.390> shoe<00:02:10.600> actually<00:02:10.810> feels

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
inside then your shoe actually feels

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.750 
inside then your shoe actually feels
almost<00:02:11.560> kind<00:02:11.710> of<00:02:11.740> like<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.920> tennis<00:02:12.130> shoe<00:02:12.430> where

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
almost kind of like a tennis shoe where

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.300 
almost kind of like a tennis shoe where
it<00:02:13.060> has<00:02:13.720> space<00:02:14.170> where<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:14.530> need<00:02:14.740> space<00:02:15.040> and

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
it has space where you need space and

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.130 
it has space where you need space and
then<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.790> hugs<00:02:16.060> your<00:02:16.210> foot<00:02:16.390> where<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.660> needs<00:02:16.990> to

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
then it hugs your foot where it needs to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.550 
then it hugs your foot where it needs to
be<00:02:17.380> just<00:02:17.590> hugged<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.310> kept<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.450> place<00:02:19.720> so<00:02:20.380> when

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
be just hugged and kept in place so when

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.410 
be just hugged and kept in place so when
your<00:02:20.680> foot<00:02:20.920> is<00:02:20.950> kept<00:02:21.340> in<00:02:21.460> place<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:22.030> feel<00:02:22.240> like

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
your foot is kept in place I feel like

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.940 
your foot is kept in place I feel like
the<00:02:22.570> heel<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.930> your<00:02:22.960> foot<00:02:23.260> just<00:02:23.500> sits<00:02:23.770> exactly

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
the heel of your foot just sits exactly

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.950 
the heel of your foot just sits exactly
where<00:02:24.400> it's<00:02:24.520> supposed<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.210> having<00:02:25.840> that

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
where it's supposed to and having that

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.450 
where it's supposed to and having that
cushion<00:02:26.440> there<00:02:26.560> obviously<00:02:27.010> every<00:02:27.160> time<00:02:27.220> you

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
cushion there obviously every time you

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.120 
cushion there obviously every time you
like<00:02:27.610> step<00:02:27.910> that<00:02:28.090> feels<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.510> lot<00:02:28.660> better<00:02:28.930> but<00:02:29.920> to

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
like step that feels a lot better but to

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.460 
like step that feels a lot better but to
me<00:02:30.280> still<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.640> best<00:02:30.940> part<00:02:31.330> was<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:32.170> this

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
me still the best part was that this

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.700 
me still the best part was that this
part<00:02:32.800> just<00:02:32.950> kind<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.310> walking<00:02:33.580> in<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.150> foot<00:02:34.390> so

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
part just kind of walking in the foot so

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.970 
part just kind of walking in the foot so
if<00:02:35.710> any<00:02:36.190> of<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.550> are<00:02:37.030> having<00:02:37.360> that<00:02:37.600> problem

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
if any of you are having that problem

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.290 
if any of you are having that problem
maybe<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.100> was<00:02:39.190> just<00:02:39.220> stupid<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.760> me<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.120> get<00:02:40.240> a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
maybe it was just stupid to me to get a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.050 
maybe it was just stupid to me to get a
size<00:02:40.540> smaller<00:02:40.960> than<00:02:41.410> my<00:02:42.100> regular<00:02:42.310> shoes<00:02:42.820> but

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
size smaller than my regular shoes but

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.670 
size smaller than my regular shoes but
it<00:02:43.210> kind<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.570> just<00:02:43.750> made<00:02:43.900> more<00:02:44.050> sense<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.380> me<00:02:44.590> if

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
it kind of just made more sense to me if

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.380 
it kind of just made more sense to me if
I<00:02:44.740> wasn't<00:02:44.950> wearing<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.250> sock<00:02:45.460> that<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.060> was<00:02:46.240> going

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
I wasn't wearing a sock that I was going

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.060 
I wasn't wearing a sock that I was going
to<00:02:46.480> need<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.840> size<00:02:47.050> smaller<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:47.620> every<00:02:47.890> time<00:02:48.040> I

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
to need a size smaller so every time I

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.470 
to need a size smaller so every time I
buy<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.310> pair<00:02:48.580> of<00:02:48.610> shoe<00:02:48.820> that<00:02:48.850> just<00:02:49.240> stick<00:02:49.450> that

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
buy a pair of shoe that just stick that

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.130 
buy a pair of shoe that just stick that
in<00:02:49.780> just<00:02:50.080> before<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:51.180> read<00:02:52.180> them<00:02:52.330> out<00:02:52.420> ever<00:02:52.840> and

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
in just before I read them out ever and

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.170 
in just before I read them out ever and
that<00:02:53.980> was<00:02:54.130> another<00:02:54.370> thing<00:02:54.610> too<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:55.060> the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
that was another thing too that the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.580 
that was another thing too that the
first<00:02:55.360> time<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.540> wore<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.870> parachute<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.320> was

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
first time I wore a parachute that was

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.140 
first time I wore a parachute that was
always<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.980> worst<00:02:57.190> until<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.610> broke<00:02:57.820> them<00:02:58.000> in

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
always the worst until I broke them in

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.690 
always the worst until I broke them in
and<00:02:58.360> with<00:02:58.960> putting<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.620> in<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.310> never<00:03:00.460> have

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
and with putting that in you never have

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.340 
and with putting that in you never have
to<00:03:00.820> break<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:01.180> shoe<00:03:01.540> this<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.020> just<00:03:02.200> feels

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
to break it in shoe this it just feels

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.320 
to break it in shoe this it just feels
comfortable<00:03:02.530> from<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.100> first<00:03:03.310> day<00:03:03.490> so<00:03:04.120> that
