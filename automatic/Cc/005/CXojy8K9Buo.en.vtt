they should follow it so I would say the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.940 
they should follow it so I would say the
Zone<00:00:41.940> diet<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.510> probably<00:00:43.140> starting<00:00:43.620> out<00:00:43.739> for

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
Zone diet was probably starting out for

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.000 
Zone diet was probably starting out for
me<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.850> most<00:00:45.059> influential<00:00:46.010> diet

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
me one of the most influential diet

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.150 
me one of the most influential diet
books<00:00:47.340> or<00:00:47.610> diets<00:00:48.260> nutritional<00:00:49.260> approaches

books or diets nutritional approaches

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.910 
books or diets nutritional approaches
that<00:00:50.579> I'd<00:00:50.730> ever<00:00:50.910> come<00:00:51.120> across<00:00:51.379> it's<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.500> shame<00:00:52.770> I

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
that I'd ever come across it's a shame I

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.160 
that I'd ever come across it's a shame I
think<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.219> they<00:00:53.340> don't<00:00:53.460> write<00:00:53.899> such<00:00:54.899> good

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
think that they don't write such good

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.069 
think that they don't write such good
diet<00:00:55.410> books<00:00:55.710> anymore<00:00:56.180> like<00:00:57.180> dr.<00:00:57.600> Sears<00:00:57.809> wrote

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
diet books anymore like dr. Sears wrote

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.680 
diet books anymore like dr. Sears wrote
for<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> zone<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> think<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> zone<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
for the zone so I think the zone is a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.820 
for the zone so I think the zone is a
great<00:01:01.050> diet<00:01:01.289> plan<00:01:01.910> but<00:01:02.910> over<00:01:03.270> time<00:01:03.739> you<00:01:04.739> know

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
great diet plan but over time you know

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.950 
great diet plan but over time you know
I've<00:01:04.949> come<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.280> find<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:06.150> there<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:06.810> some

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
I've come to find that there are some

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.410 
I've come to find that there are some
things<00:01:07.200> about<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.890> also<00:01:08.640> some<00:01:08.850> strategies

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
things about it and also some strategies

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.330 
things about it and also some strategies
that<00:01:09.450> could<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.960> changed<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.979> could<00:01:11.130> make<00:01:11.310> it

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that could be changed that could make it

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.039 
that could be changed that could make it
a<00:01:11.490> little<00:01:11.760> bit<00:01:11.939> better<00:01:12.090> kind<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.810> kind<00:01:12.990> of

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
a little bit better kind of and kind of

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.020 
a little bit better kind of and kind of
supercharge<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.880> definitely

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
supercharge it but it's definitely

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.700 
supercharge it but it's definitely
foundational<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:15.990> you're<00:01:16.140> familiar<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.619> the

with<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> zone<00:01:25.290> as<00:01:25.439> well<00:01:25.590> you'll<00:01:25.799> see<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.130> a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
with the zone as well you'll see that a

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.920 
with the zone as well you'll see that a
lot<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.610> dr.<00:01:26.880> Sears<00:01:27.060> principles<00:01:27.689> are

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
lot of dr. Sears principles are

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.140 
lot of dr. Sears principles are
foundational<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.340> lot<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.729> things<00:01:29.970> that

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
foundational to a lot of the things that

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.170 
foundational to a lot of the things that
I<00:01:30.180> find<00:01:30.509> foundational<00:01:31.409> as<00:01:31.530> well<00:01:31.909> but<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.030> let's

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
I find foundational as well but so let's

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.749 
I find foundational as well but so let's
get<00:01:33.270> into<00:01:33.509> some<00:01:33.540> keys<00:01:33.900> about<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> Zone<00:01:34.470> diet

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
get into some keys about the Zone diet

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.969 
get into some keys about the Zone diet
so<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.939> Zone<00:01:36.150> diet<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.900> forty<00:01:37.619> thirty

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
so the Zone diet is a forty thirty

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.520 
so the Zone diet is a forty thirty

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
is a great place to start but then you

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.090 
is a great place to start but then you

omega-3 supplement that I used for years

and<00:02:32.230> at<00:02:32.739> one<00:02:32.920> point<00:02:32.950> was<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> distributor<00:02:33.910> for

and at one point was a distributor for
as<00:02:34.269> well<00:02:34.450> so<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.750> think<00:02:34.780> it's<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.110> great<00:02:35.380> it's<00:02:36.250> a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
omega-3s in the zone is wonderful now

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
one of the things that in the zone that

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.750 
one of the things that in the zone that
dr.<00:02:44.440> Sears<00:02:44.620> talks<00:02:44.890> about<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:47.549> excuse<00:02:48.549> me

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
dr. Sears talks about is the excuse me

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.479 
dr. Sears talks about is the excuse me
the<00:02:49.330> EPA<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.519> ratio<00:02:52.799> so<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:54.010> Zone<00:02:54.190> diet<00:02:54.220> is

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
the EPA to a a ratio so the Zone diet is

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.610 
the EPA to a a ratio so the Zone diet is
all<00:02:54.640> about<00:02:54.819> increasing<00:02:55.180> omega-3s<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.170> then

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
all about increasing omega-3s and then

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.100 
all about increasing omega-3s and then
decreasing<00:02:57.610> arachidonic<00:02:58.150> acid<00:02:58.209> as<00:02:58.810> much<00:02:58.989> as

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
decreasing arachidonic acid as much as

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.470 
decreasing arachidonic acid as much as
possible<00:02:59.319> he<00:03:00.069> talks<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.459> lot<00:03:00.549> about<00:03:00.610> this<00:03:00.970> EPA<00:03:01.390> a

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
possible he talks a lot about this EPA a

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.220 
possible he talks a lot about this EPA a
to<00:03:01.750> arachidonic<00:03:02.319> acid<00:03:02.380> ratio<00:03:03.630> but<00:03:04.630> what<00:03:05.200> I

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
to arachidonic acid ratio but what I

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.690 
to arachidonic acid ratio but what I
really<00:03:05.530> think<00:03:05.709> in<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.160> zone<00:03:06.310> kind<00:03:06.489> of<00:03:06.549> gets

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
really think in the zone kind of gets

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.850 
really think in the zone kind of gets
into<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.030> omega-3<00:03:07.480> omega-6<00:03:07.810> ratio<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.680> we've

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
into the omega-3 omega-6 ratio and we've

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.550 
into the omega-3 omega-6 ratio and we've
talked<00:03:09.099> about<00:03:09.220> this<00:03:09.459> before<00:03:09.610> as<00:03:09.940> well<00:03:10.290> this<00:03:11.290> I

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
talked about this before as well this I

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.620 
talked about this before as well this I
just<00:03:12.160> don't<00:03:12.340> see<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.640> research<00:03:12.940> supporting

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
just don't see the research supporting

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.920 
just don't see the research supporting
that<00:03:13.900> ratio<00:03:14.200> either<00:03:14.739> this<00:03:15.040> one<00:03:15.310> or<00:03:15.480> an<00:03:16.480> overall

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
that ratio either this one or an overall

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.870 
that ratio either this one or an overall
omega-3<00:03:17.530> omega-6<00:03:17.859> ratio<00:03:18.400> I<00:03:18.430> don't<00:03:18.640> see<00:03:18.760> the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
omega-3 omega-6 ratio I don't see the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.910 
omega-3 omega-6 ratio I don't see the
research<00:03:19.180> supporting<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:19.930> as<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.739> way<00:03:20.859> to

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
research supporting that as the way to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.129 
research supporting that as the way to
go<00:03:21.160> but<00:03:21.819> instead<00:03:22.299> more<00:03:23.170> just<00:03:23.620> about<00:03:25.049> epa<00:03:26.049> and

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
go but instead more just about epa and

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:31.259 
go but instead more just about epa and
DHA<00:03:26.380> and<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:28.560> total<00:03:29.560> amount<00:03:29.829> and<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.459> that

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
DHA and the total amount and so that

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.150 
DHA and the total amount and so that
would<00:03:31.389> be<00:03:31.480> your<00:03:31.600> omega-3<00:03:32.139> index<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.920> you<00:03:33.010> can

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
would be your omega-3 index and you can

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.530 
would be your omega-3 index and you can
look<00:03:33.310> at<00:03:33.489> some<00:03:33.670> other<00:03:33.730> videos<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.150> I've<00:03:34.389> done

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
look at some other videos that I've done

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.770 
look at some other videos that I've done
on<00:03:34.840> omega-3<00:03:36.030> index<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.269> fish<00:03:37.540> oil

supplementation<00:03:38.290> that<00:03:38.889> kind<00:03:39.100> of<00:03:39.130> talks<00:03:39.370> about

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
supplementation that kind of talks about

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.340 
supplementation that kind of talks about
that<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.090> that<00:03:40.329> really<00:03:40.600> stresses<00:03:41.200> an

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
that and that really stresses an

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.340 
that and that really stresses an
increase<00:03:42.310> in<00:03:42.459> overall<00:03:42.819> omega-3s<00:03:43.600> whereas

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
increase in overall omega-3s whereas

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.080 
increase in overall omega-3s whereas
Omega<00:03:44.470> 6s<00:03:45.040> don't<00:03:45.280> necessarily<00:03:45.730> matter<00:03:45.880> as

Omega 6s don't necessarily matter as

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.530 
Omega 6s don't necessarily matter as
much

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
much

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.059 
much
especially<00:03:47.200> because<00:03:47.440> research<00:03:47.739> kind<00:03:47.920> of

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
especially because research kind of

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.250 
especially because research kind of
shows<00:03:48.310> that<00:03:48.700> your<00:03:49.420> body<00:03:49.600> can<00:03:49.840> serve<00:03:50.079> as<00:03:50.230> a

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
shows that your body can serve as a

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
rakha donek acid levels so this AAA

keep it at a consistent level but that

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.410

a<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.750> DHA<00:04:02.200> those<00:04:02.680> are<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:02.829> two<00:04:02.980> fatty<00:04:03.220> acids

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
a and DHA those are the two fatty acids

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.099 
a and DHA those are the two fatty acids
and<00:04:03.700> fish<00:04:03.819> oil<00:04:04.090> those<00:04:04.569> can<00:04:04.840> change

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
and fish oil those can change

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.890 
and fish oil those can change
dramatically<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:06.160> focus<00:04:06.549> on<00:04:06.700> just<00:04:07.540> eating<00:04:07.840> a

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
dramatically so focus on just eating a

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.410 
dramatically so focus on just eating a
lot<00:04:08.079> more<00:04:08.489> fatty<00:04:09.489> fish<00:04:09.730> or<00:04:10.090> fish<00:04:10.299> oil

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
lot more fatty fish or fish oil

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.270 
lot more fatty fish or fish oil

another<00:04:14.920> component<00:04:15.310> of<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.760> zone<00:04:15.970> diets<00:04:16.299> very

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
another component of the zone diets very

another component of the zone diets very
low<00:04:16.900> almost<00:04:17.500> you<00:04:18.310> know<00:04:18.400> depending<00:04:18.850> this<00:04:19.000> could

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
low almost you know depending this could

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.740 
low almost you know depending this could
say<00:04:19.709> no<00:04:20.709> starch<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:21.970> it's<00:04:22.300> very<00:04:22.480> rich<00:04:22.720> in

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
say no starch so it's very rich in

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.510 
say no starch so it's very rich in
fruits<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.110> vegetables<00:04:23.200> not<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:23.980> kind<00:04:24.460> of

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
fruits and vegetables not and kind of

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.159 
fruits and vegetables not and kind of
eliminate<00:04:24.940> starches<00:04:25.419> almost<00:04:25.720> completely

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
eliminate starches almost completely

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.740 
eliminate starches almost completely
a<00:04:26.260> little<00:04:26.710> bit<00:04:26.800> of<00:04:26.889> oatmeal<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:27.400> such<00:04:27.639> um<00:04:27.940> and

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
a little bit of oatmeal and such um and

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.990 
a little bit of oatmeal and such um and
I<00:04:29.290> think<00:04:29.380> that<00:04:29.680> well<00:04:29.980> this<00:04:30.220> is<00:04:30.280> great<00:04:30.639> for<00:04:30.970> a

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
I think that well this is great for a

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.879 
I think that well this is great for a
lot<00:04:31.120> of<00:04:31.300> people<00:04:31.630> if<00:04:32.050> you're<00:04:32.290> very<00:04:32.470> active

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
lot of people if you're very active

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.800 
lot of people if you're very active
which<00:04:33.070> I<00:04:33.190> think<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:33.460> should<00:04:33.730> be<00:04:33.910> that<00:04:34.540> you<00:04:34.630> can

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
which I think you should be that you can

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.330 
which I think you should be that you can
actually<00:04:35.139> handle<00:04:35.500> starters<00:04:35.919> at<00:04:36.070> different

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
actually handle starters at different

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.460 
actually handle starters at different
times<00:04:36.610> so<00:04:37.389> specifically<00:04:40.200> we're<00:04:41.200> talking

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
times so specifically we're talking

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.900 
times so specifically we're talking
about<00:04:41.530> nutrient<00:04:42.130> timing<00:04:44.669> and<00:04:45.669> this<00:04:45.790> is

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
about nutrient timing and this is

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.219 
about nutrient timing and this is
something<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.210> we've<00:04:46.419> talked<00:04:46.720> about<00:04:46.870> videos

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
something that we've talked about videos

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.190 
something that we've talked about videos
before<00:04:48.030> excuse<00:04:49.030> me<00:04:49.240> nutrient<00:04:49.780> timing<00:04:49.900> is

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
before excuse me nutrient timing is

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.840 
before excuse me nutrient timing is
basically<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.650> idea<00:04:50.919> that<00:04:51.520> your<00:04:51.669> body

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
basically the idea that your body

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.180 
basically the idea that your body
handles<00:04:52.180> different<00:04:52.540> nutrients<00:04:53.080> better<00:04:53.919> or

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
handles different nutrients better or

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.500 
handles different nutrients better or
worse<00:04:54.340> at<00:04:54.610> different<00:04:54.910> times<00:04:55.090> a<00:04:55.180> day

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
worse at different times a day

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.020 
worse at different times a day
so<00:04:55.720> specifically<00:04:56.380> following<00:04:57.220> exercise<00:04:57.669> you

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
so specifically following exercise you

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.960 
so specifically following exercise you
have<00:04:58.210> an<00:04:58.300> increase<00:04:58.600> in<00:04:58.630> insulin<00:04:59.080> sensitivity

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
have an increase in insulin sensitivity

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.150 
have an increase in insulin sensitivity
excuse<00:05:00.970> me<00:05:01.150> so<00:05:01.570> your<00:05:01.690> body<00:05:01.870> can<00:05:01.960> handle<00:05:02.160> those

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
excuse me so your body can handle those

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.159 
excuse me so your body can handle those
higher<00:05:03.430> starch<00:05:03.880> carbohydrates<00:05:04.360> those<00:05:04.930> more

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
higher starch carbohydrates those more

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.680 
higher starch carbohydrates those more
carbohydrate<00:05:05.740> dense<00:05:05.950> foods<00:05:06.310> directly<00:05:07.150> after

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
carbohydrate dense foods directly after

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.719 
carbohydrate dense foods directly after
exercise<00:05:08.139> so<00:05:08.590> if<00:05:08.680> you're<00:05:08.800> very<00:05:09.070> active<00:05:09.340> I

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
exercise so if you're very active I

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.879 
exercise so if you're very active I
think<00:05:09.970> that<00:05:10.389> cutting<00:05:10.900> out<00:05:11.020> starches<00:05:11.440> entirely

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
think that cutting out starches entirely

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.100 
think that cutting out starches entirely
is<00:05:12.280> not<00:05:12.490> something<00:05:12.940> that<00:05:13.120> everyone<00:05:13.750> has<00:05:13.780> to<00:05:13.990> do

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
is not something that everyone has to do

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.140 
is not something that everyone has to do
you<00:05:14.320> can<00:05:14.500> do<00:05:14.590> really<00:05:14.770> well<00:05:14.889> on<00:05:15.310> very<00:05:15.820> low<00:05:16.030> and

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
you can do really well on very low and

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.200 
you can do really well on very low and
no<00:05:16.270> starches<00:05:16.720> and<00:05:16.870> I'm<00:05:17.229> a<00:05:17.260> fan<00:05:17.950> of<00:05:18.210> ketogenic

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
no starches and I'm a fan of ketogenic

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.270 
no starches and I'm a fan of ketogenic
very<00:05:19.450> low<00:05:19.630> carbohydrate<00:05:19.960> diets<00:05:20.470> as<00:05:20.560> well<00:05:20.590> but

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
very low carbohydrate diets as well but

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.650 
very low carbohydrate diets as well but
I<00:05:21.310> think<00:05:21.520> for<00:05:21.640> the<00:05:21.700> average<00:05:21.880> person<00:05:22.210> going

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
I think for the average person going

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.680 
I think for the average person going
completely<00:05:22.930> no<00:05:23.410> starch<00:05:23.910> might<00:05:24.910> be<00:05:25.090> a<00:05:25.360> little

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
completely no starch might be a little

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.960 
completely no starch might be a little
extreme<00:05:25.870> for<00:05:26.169> no<00:05:26.260> reason<00:05:26.620> at<00:05:27.310> least<00:05:27.580> starting

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
extreme for no reason at least starting

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.430 
extreme for no reason at least starting
out<00:05:28.090> just<00:05:28.450> to<00:05:28.510> see<00:05:28.570> how<00:05:28.720> your<00:05:28.870> body<00:05:29.020> responds

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
out just to see how your body responds

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.110 
out just to see how your body responds
and<00:05:29.979> then<00:05:30.070> you<00:05:30.160> can<00:05:30.280> take<00:05:30.460> advantage<00:05:30.970> of

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
and then you can take advantage of

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.790 
and then you can take advantage of
nutrient<00:05:31.510> timing<00:05:31.690> if<00:05:32.080> you're<00:05:32.289> looking<00:05:32.590> from

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
nutrient timing if you're looking from

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.920 
nutrient timing if you're looking from
an<00:05:33.310> athletic<00:05:33.700> and<00:05:34.060> performance<00:05:34.600> standpoint

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
an athletic and performance standpoint

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.159 
an athletic and performance standpoint
that<00:05:35.830> you<00:05:36.310> know<00:05:36.570> packing<00:05:37.570> in<00:05:37.720> those<00:05:37.870> higher

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
that you know packing in those higher

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.590 
that you know packing in those higher
starch<00:05:38.530> carbohydrates<00:05:39.150> during<00:05:40.150> and<00:05:40.330> directly

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
starch carbohydrates during and directly

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.690 
starch carbohydrates during and directly
after<00:05:40.990> exercise<00:05:41.410> I<00:05:41.710> think<00:05:42.280> is<00:05:42.370> also<00:05:42.550> very

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
after exercise I think is also very

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.260 
after exercise I think is also very
beneficial<00:05:44.130> so<00:05:45.130> the<00:05:45.310> last<00:05:45.520> piece<00:05:45.850> is<00:05:46.030> that

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
beneficial so the last piece is that

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.969 
beneficial so the last piece is that
it's<00:05:46.450> it's<00:05:46.690> very<00:05:46.960> low<00:05:47.110> calorie<00:05:47.530> if<00:05:47.680> you<00:05:47.770> go

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
it's it's very low calorie if you go

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.100 
it's it's very low calorie if you go
through<00:05:48.280> which<00:05:49.000> is<00:05:49.180> good<00:05:49.450> because<00:05:49.600> you<00:05:49.960> know

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
through which is good because you know

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.659 
through which is good because you know
pretty<00:05:50.410> much<00:05:50.500> everybody<00:05:50.800> could<00:05:51.100> benefit<00:05:51.610> from

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
pretty much everybody could benefit from

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.550 
pretty much everybody could benefit from
eating<00:05:52.030> less<00:05:52.210> calories<00:05:52.660> but<00:05:53.229> if<00:05:53.380> you<00:05:53.440> go

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
eating less calories but if you go

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.779

physically active but I don't think you

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.249 
physically active but I don't think you
need<00:06:29.560> to<00:06:29.590> be<00:06:29.940> so<00:06:30.940> low-calorie<00:06:31.449> if<00:06:31.750> you<00:06:31.840> can<00:06:32.020> eat

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:32.259 
need to be so low-calorie if you can eat

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:34.350 
need to be so low-calorie if you can eat
you<00:06:32.830> can<00:06:32.949> exercise<00:06:33.069> more<00:06:33.699> and<00:06:33.970> you<00:06:34.090> can<00:06:34.240> eat

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
you can exercise more and you can eat

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.540 
you can exercise more and you can eat
more<00:06:34.629> food<00:06:34.690> you<00:06:35.199> can<00:06:35.620> still<00:06:35.949> if<00:06:36.190> your<00:06:36.310> goal<00:06:36.520> is

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
more food you can still if your goal is

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:37.980 
more food you can still if your goal is
to<00:06:36.699> get<00:06:36.909> lean<00:06:37.120> you<00:06:37.300> can<00:06:37.330> still<00:06:37.659> get<00:06:37.840> really

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
to get lean you can still get really

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.839 
to get lean you can still get really
lean<00:06:38.259> but<00:06:38.680> kind<00:06:38.830> of<00:06:38.860> ramping<00:06:39.310> up<00:06:39.400> your<00:06:39.550> overall

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849 
lean but kind of ramping up your overall

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:42.330 
lean but kind of ramping up your overall
metabolic<00:06:40.479> engine<00:06:40.900> so<00:06:41.349> while<00:06:41.800> it's<00:06:42.129> low

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
metabolic engine so while it's low

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.200 
metabolic engine so while it's low
calorie<00:06:42.550> which<00:06:42.970> is<00:06:43.120> good<00:06:43.330> for<00:06:43.680> most<00:06:44.680> people

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
calorie which is good for most people

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.820 
calorie which is good for most people
you<00:06:46.210> can<00:06:46.240> actually<00:06:46.509> you<00:06:46.930> know<00:06:47.080> after<00:06:47.590> a<00:06:47.620> while

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
you can actually you know after a while

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.790 
you can actually you know after a while
you're<00:06:48.460> going<00:06:48.550> to<00:06:48.610> need<00:06:48.819> more<00:06:49.090> calories

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
you're going to need more calories

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.809 
you're going to need more calories
specifically<00:06:50.800> if<00:06:50.919> you're<00:06:51.039> restricting

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
specifically if you're restricting

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:53.790 
specifically if you're restricting
starches<00:06:52.330> it<00:06:52.810> makes<00:06:53.020> it<00:06:53.139> really<00:06:53.259> hard<00:06:53.470> to<00:06:53.590> get

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
starches it makes it really hard to get

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.890 
starches it makes it really hard to get
to<00:06:53.949> those<00:06:54.099> higher<00:06:54.129> calorie<00:06:55.060> in<00:06:55.150> takes<00:06:55.389> to

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
to those higher calorie in takes to

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.209 
to those higher calorie in takes to
support<00:06:56.110> more<00:06:56.500> aggressive<00:06:56.830> exercise

00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:57.219 
support more aggressive exercise

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:59.969 
support more aggressive exercise
programs<00:06:57.669> so<00:06:58.449> I<00:06:58.780> think<00:06:59.259> the<00:06:59.469> Zone<00:06:59.650> diet<00:06:59.800> is

00:06:59.969 --> 00:06:59.979 
programs so I think the Zone diet is

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:01.680 
programs so I think the Zone diet is
great<00:07:00.250> I<00:07:00.370> think<00:07:00.550> these<00:07:00.639> four<00:07:00.969> principles<00:07:01.180> are

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 
great I think these four principles are

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.839 
great I think these four principles are
really<00:07:01.719> great<00:07:02.259> but<00:07:02.860> you<00:07:03.069> could<00:07:03.190> also<00:07:03.340> tweak

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:03.849 
really great but you could also tweak

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:05.369 
really great but you could also tweak
them<00:07:04.090> a<00:07:04.120> little<00:07:04.479> bit<00:07:04.599> based<00:07:04.870> on<00:07:05.080> your<00:07:05.199> own

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:05.379 
them a little bit based on your own

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:07.439 
them a little bit based on your own
needs<00:07:05.590> to<00:07:06.159> kind<00:07:06.280> of<00:07:06.370> supercharge<00:07:06.909> the<00:07:07.090> program

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:07.449 
needs to kind of supercharge the program

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:09.779 
needs to kind of supercharge the program
for<00:07:07.719> you<00:07:07.870> okay<00:07:08.560> so<00:07:09.039> hopefully<00:07:09.340> that<00:07:09.490> answered

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:09.789
