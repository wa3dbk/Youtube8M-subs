00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 basically I'm here to talk to you 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.710
 of a very poignant thing that is of 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.150
 norm presents itself a bit inside everyone 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.650
 those who want to pull content 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.429
 creatives precisely so of 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.840
 this platform 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.210
 I speak of that category which unfortunately 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.839
 I belong or, fortunately, i 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.520
 musicians 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.050
 today in fact I want to talk to you a little bit 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.220
 of what represents the poignant 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.670
 moment when inspiration comes 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.670
 to miss 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.920
 in short, let's face the musicians 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.340
 born with an ear that is that of 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.840
 ideas 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.309
 in short, the best ideas come to you 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.360
 less opportune moments when you are going to 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.789
 go to sleep when dressed for 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.289
 wake up when I don't want to make you is 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.149
 returned the rest of the day 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.219
 practically nothing happens 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.260
 those rare exceptions are when you are 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.760
 practically stoned and I don't use 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.230
 drugs so this is a problem for 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.390
 everything else there is one thing 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.300
 compensates for creativity and technique 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.370
 and it is something sick because 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.260
 technique that imposes rules that you 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.610
 make those type one jobs more 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.530
 one equals two then the public 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.720
 will like things take place more or less 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.159
 so we always have many ideas for many 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.869
 ideas that then perhaps lead back to 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.430
 that sequence of chords played more or 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.259
 less in the same position as the handle 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.640
 in different positions but there 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.740
 refer to the end of the melody league 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.790
 that makes us say wow that stuff 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.080
 very cool but actually we have it 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.880
 already played about 3 million times per 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.619
 every time we like it because it owes us 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.689
 go well in the sense we are playing 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.490
 we are using our tea so it must 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.500
 go well for strength as you do to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.049
 to overcome all this, they are simple 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.759
 of the tele stratagems of the things that there 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.380
 they can come as an example 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.009
 ask for help from friends in need 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.009
 of an idea 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.130
 watch me have a line right now 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.369
 but rather than tell you I prefer 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.049
 die in the flames of hell 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:02:00.600
 ok to ask for help on social networks a 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.520
 Internet 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.710
 definitely asking in social networks 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.940
 he will not dwell on useless things for years 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.860
 I give a fuck they will give me 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.340
 definitely an answer for me 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.340
 needs 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.450
 ask for help from the manuals you what 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.520
 he is making of my life 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.830
 obviously we have to weigh things up there 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.450
 is the technique there are the manuals yes 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.310
 there are also marketing manuals 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.840
 viral because it also makes you think 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.459
 but fuck if there is a song I put it 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.140
 on youtube then I want the public there 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.330
 see and when the public in the end are 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.420
 23 viruses which means that 23 view 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.430
 They are probably 22 because it has well 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.900
 arrange video publish it cover it 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.590
 if it's all right or not at least one 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.660
 twenty are two 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.940
 so three visits are probably from 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.250
 your mother therefore 23 total visits the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.780
 nothing wow elite breaks even a little 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.519
 fuck also because then over all 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.610
 this also gets in the way 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:59.910
 typical program that never wants to give you 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:01.860
 straight line and this is one of the reasons why 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.840
 the world sucks 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.120
 then obviously the poignant dilemma of 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.100
 use guitar brands but who cares there is 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.750
 here too I have a guitar and nibali mi 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.040
 this fuck off is fine 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.720
 the important thing is not having the guitar from 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.640
 million euros but the important thing is 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.959
 play it because I know how to play it 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.269
 guitar can still be inter 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.370
 $ 20,000 but will always sound of 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.140
 shit because you from pigs deserve it 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.299
 just you looking at this 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.340
 moment a little like me the sound of shit 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.140
 however ok, sticazzi no then the question 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.540
 is what we are doing in the 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.959
 our life, nothing we like to do these 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.459
 things the next time you put yourself 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.350
 to be must write something 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.970
 idiot in the comments of youtube stop 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.739
 to think how much time and how many 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.030
 difficulties therefore as we are found to 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.450
 deal with and all the questions there 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.400
 we place 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.720
 yes in short, given a calm down maybe 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.609
 designed all together then maybe 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.560
 comment with an opinion a little 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.269
 different from the usual but the one that 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.650
 guitar and what programs do you use for 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.810
 mount which programs you use for 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.799
 register because they are mothers who have 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.510
 widely beaten the fuck maybe the 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.910
 world zero will be a better place where 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.970
 make music especially youtube italy 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.739
 any where in general therefore now sorry 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.900
 but I have to go organize the funeral 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.560
 of Francesca because I believe she is dead 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.390
 burned 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.519
 but if in the end all this does not 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.049
 it is your duty and only interested in enjoying the 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.650
 life the only thing left to do 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.049
 and zoom francesca while at work 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.440
 turn them into a horse and put them on 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.440
 to dance 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.979
 I feel like an ambulance now to feel 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:44.259
 someone hurt right now but 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.509
 perfect wait for coming here one 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.199
 good time 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.199
 stop
