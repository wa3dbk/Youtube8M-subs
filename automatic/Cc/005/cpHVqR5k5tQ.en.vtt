00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:35.540
 please come pass have 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.540
 pace jump jump 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.010
 to friends and today i would like to tell 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.739
 about nanotechnology technology that 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.020
 allow us to work with very 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.540
 small objects for no one 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.020
 the secret is that everything around consists of 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.020
 tiny atoms including us 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.390
 no need to try to see them friends 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.009
 my atoms can't be seen 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.100
 they are as much smaller than mine 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.710
 excusable hooves as far as hooves 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:21.210
 smaller than our planet and I saw 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.929
 made out about you sorry so here's the world 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.030
 adym 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:27.390
 keeps a phenomenal amount 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.149
 technical ideas and discoveries you are not 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.539
 believe but there are ways to work 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:36.660
 with atoms directly moving them collect 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.220
 various devices like from cubes to all 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:45.110
 doing this 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:51.140
 on technology says something tells 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:54.840
 What kind of nanotechnology? 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.080
 nanotechnology cheek promise rocket 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.819
 show individuals about some not 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.819
 technology chanting I wonder 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.819
 technology 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:34.069
 crumble and don't push buttons suddenly 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.530
 rocket you launch what's the truth you think what 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.530
 I can accidentally launch a rocket 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:56.439
 connects i'm somewhere nearby so 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:03:03.409
 way nano technology is our future 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:06.109
 and now the spin will show us its 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:10.150
 new spaceship on this 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.150
 pin ship tomorrow 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.900
 come on gold I know perfectly well that 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.920
 krosh somewhere nearby on chip i'm nothing 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.920
 do not turn off 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.050
 and given to fly away I do not refuel 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.050
 fuel 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:44.790
 night will remain on Earth's orbit somewhere 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.790
 at a height of 300 lumen 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.799
 land 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:11.590
 Illuminati needles 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:16.090
 we are in space hedgehog to the situation 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:19.169
 and the other rocket we have no war too 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.919
 long build their oxygen left 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:41.060
 hours to five 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:44.440
 and then they will suffocate may we shall 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.340
 husband immediately to mars can 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:57.410
 home there must be some way 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:59.990
 get them out there good idea son but 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.460
 you do not have enough power to drag 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.400
 rocket from orbit 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.400
 silence seems i found their wave 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:34.280
 i don't understand what that means we don't 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:37.419
 we can fly to mars it means that we 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:51.800
 we can not go home and soon here 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:54.710
 suffocate aerial rope nyusha 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.280
 Well, where, pray tell, we will take 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.880
 rope length of 300 kilometers from Kopatycha 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.100
 steel ordinary rope of such length will burst 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.250
 from own weight we need 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:12.250
 fundamentally new rope is very light 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.250
 and very strong and I will keep it 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.129
 tie this rope 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.129
 rocket
