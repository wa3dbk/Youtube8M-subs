00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.380 
show you how to draw very simple animal
cartoons<00:00:03.980> so<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.430> first<00:00:05.670> thing<00:00:05.910> we<00:00:06.060> do<00:00:06.210> is

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
cartoons so the first thing we do is

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.790 
cartoons so the first thing we do is
basically<00:00:06.620> the<00:00:07.620> cheeks<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:09.080> then<00:00:10.080> we<00:00:10.320> add<00:00:10.530> a

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
basically the cheeks and then we add a

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.360 
basically the cheeks and then we add a
nose<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.969> as<00:00:12.599> we<00:00:12.719> got<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.110> we<00:00:13.559> could<00:00:13.769> add<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
nose and as we got that we could add the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.400 
nose and as we got that we could add the
eyes<00:00:16.160> as<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.369> see<00:00:17.580> I'm<00:00:17.789> not<00:00:17.970> trying<00:00:18.330> too<00:00:19.230> much

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
eyes as you see I'm not trying too much

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.920 
eyes as you see I'm not trying too much
to<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.710> very<00:00:19.890> precise<00:00:20.340> because<00:00:20.939> that's<00:00:21.330> kind

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
to be very precise because that's kind

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.480 
to be very precise because that's kind
of<00:00:22.020> necessary<00:00:22.730> right<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.140> we've<00:00:25.140> got<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.949> mouth

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
of necessary right and we've got a mouth

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.750 
of necessary right and we've got a mouth
and<00:00:26.990> a<00:00:27.990> top<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.410> head<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:28.740> at<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.460> point

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
and a top of the head so at this point

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.780 
and a top of the head so at this point
you<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.359> choose<00:00:30.990> which<00:00:31.380> animal<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.920> want<00:00:32.099> for

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
you can choose which animal you want for

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.630 
you can choose which animal you want for
example<00:00:33.239> if<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.870> want<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.140> cat<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:35.250> could<00:00:35.430> make

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
example if you want a cat you could make

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:44.920 
example if you want a cat you could make
the<00:00:36.270> ears<00:00:37.100> like<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:40.969> like<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.800> make

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
the ears like this like that and make

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.540 
the ears like this like that and make
it's<00:00:45.930> very<00:00:46.230> simple<00:00:46.620> right<00:00:46.739> let's<00:00:47.309> say<00:00:47.489> you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
it's very simple right let's say you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.119 
it's very simple right let's say you
want<00:00:47.879> another<00:00:48.570> animal<00:00:49.050> let's<00:00:49.620> say<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.829> want

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
want another animal let's say you want

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.500 
want another animal let's say you want
to<00:00:50.190> rabbit<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:52.050> would<00:00:52.230> go<00:00:52.410> something<00:00:52.860> like

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.670 

and<00:00:59.030> at<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.149> point<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.050> choose<00:01:01.440> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
and at this point you just choose to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:15.440 
and at this point you just choose to
make<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.520> rabbit<00:01:02.850> ears<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.640> main<00:01:14.850> idea<00:01:14.880> is

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
make the rabbit ears so the main idea is

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.270 
make the rabbit ears so the main idea is
the<00:01:15.479> same<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.200> only<00:01:16.409> difference<00:01:16.979> is

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the same the only difference is

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.420 
the same the only difference is
basically<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.000> other<00:01:18.240> ears<00:01:19.189> but<00:01:20.189> let's<00:01:20.340> say

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
basically the other ears but let's say

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
basically the other ears but let's say
you<00:01:20.490> want<00:01:21.259> another<00:01:22.259> character<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:23.100> example

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
you want another character for example

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.640 
you want another character for example
perhaps<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.600> want<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.810> Mouse<00:01:25.049> or<00:01:25.320> something

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
perhaps you want to Mouse or something

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:44.560 
perhaps you want to Mouse or something
so<00:01:26.100> let's<00:01:26.250> draw<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> mouse

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.010 

so<00:01:45.530> there<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:45.800> go<00:01:46.010> a<00:01:46.190> mouse<00:01:46.780> though<00:01:47.780> the

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
so there you go a mouse though the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.900 
so there you go a mouse though the
method<00:01:48.350> is<00:01:48.500> still<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.830> same<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:49.340> could<00:01:49.700> make

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
method is still the same you could make

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.630 
method is still the same you could make
lots<00:01:50.420> of<00:01:50.570> different<00:01:50.720> characters<00:01:51.140> for<00:01:52.100> example

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
lots of different characters for example

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.090 
lots of different characters for example
let's<00:01:53.030> say<00:01:53.180> you<00:01:53.240> want<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.630> rabbit<00:01:54.440> that's<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.890> bit

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
let's say you want a rabbit that's a bit

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.210 
let's say you want a rabbit that's a bit
fatter<00:01:55.370> than<00:01:55.790> this<00:01:56.030> one<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:57.620> make<00:01:58.040> the

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
fatter than this one so you make the

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.000 
fatter than this one so you make the
cheeks<00:01:58.550> bigger<00:01:59.380> you<00:02:00.380> keep<00:02:00.620> the<00:02:00.770> nose

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
cheeks bigger you keep the nose

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.120 
cheeks bigger you keep the nose
approximately<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.090> same<00:02:02.270> size<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.990> make<00:02:03.979> the

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
approximately the same size you make the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.630 
approximately the same size you make the
eyes<00:02:04.310> smaller<00:02:05.500> so<00:02:06.500> it<00:02:06.710> so<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.160> rabbit<00:02:07.430> seems

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
eyes smaller so it so the rabbit seems

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:16.630 
eyes smaller so it so the rabbit seems
fatter

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.520 

like<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.940> it's<00:02:18.660> basically<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.290> same<00:02:19.470> thing

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
like that it's basically the same thing

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.070 
like that it's basically the same thing
you<00:02:20.190> choose<00:02:20.400> different<00:02:20.790> proportions<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.570> a

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
you choose different proportions and a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.560 
you choose different proportions and a
chapter<00:02:22.320> already<00:02:22.830> looks<00:02:23.310> different<00:02:23.940> let's<00:02:24.420> do

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
chapter already looks different let's do

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.410 
chapter already looks different let's do
one<00:02:24.690> more<00:02:24.840> animal<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.920> dog<00:02:26.670> or<00:02:26.910> something<00:02:26.940> okay

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
one more animal a dog or something okay

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.720 
one more animal a dog or something okay
let's<00:02:27.720> do<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> dog<00:02:28.200> over<00:02:28.500> here<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.950> dog<00:02:29.520> has<00:02:29.700> a

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
let's do a dog over here a dog has a

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:40.510 
let's do a dog over here a dog has a
little<00:02:30.060> bit<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.240> a<00:02:30.840> rounder<00:02:31.320> nose<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:38.520> then

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
little bit of a rounder nose and then

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.780 
little bit of a rounder nose and then
face<00:02:41.520> so<00:02:42.240> there<00:02:42.540> we<00:02:42.720> got<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> dog<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.460> is<00:02:44.610> it

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
face so there we got a dog so this is it

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.420 
face so there we got a dog so this is it
I've<00:02:45.450> tried<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.140> keep<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.800> characters<00:02:47.250> as

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
I've tried to keep the characters as

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.790 
I've tried to keep the characters as
simple<00:02:47.820> as<00:02:47.880> possible<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:49.200> think<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.620> pretty

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
simple as possible and I think I pretty

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.520 
simple as possible and I think I pretty
much<00:02:49.920> succeeded<00:02:50.460> in<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.290> try<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.350> out

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
much succeeded in that and try it out

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.370 
much succeeded in that and try it out
like<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.700> could<00:02:53.880> add<00:02:54.000> tons<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.630> details<00:02:54.930> to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
like you could add tons of details to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.740 
like you could add tons of details to
the<00:02:56.340> characters<00:02:56.970> but<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.330> is<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.570> main

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the characters but this is the main

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.830 
the characters but this is the main
concept<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.770> could<00:02:58.980> use<00:02:59.250> good<00:03:00.030> luck<00:03:00.210> and<00:03:00.510> I

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
concept you could use good luck and I

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.180 
concept you could use good luck and I
wish<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.380> very<00:03:01.590> nice<00:03:02.130> day<00:03:02.190> bye
