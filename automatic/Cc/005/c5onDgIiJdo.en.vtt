the time and to be honest what year you

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.080 
the time and to be honest what year you
want<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.080> request<00:02:00.680> them<00:02:00.980> this<00:02:01.670> is<00:02:01.820> my<00:02:01.940> own

want to request them this is my own

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.170 
want to request them this is my own
personal<00:02:02.360> opinion<00:02:03.050> I<00:02:03.370> with<00:02:04.370> an<00:02:04.490> MMO<00:02:04.790> I<00:02:04.820> don't

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
personal opinion I with an MMO I don't

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.420 
personal opinion I with an MMO I don't
really<00:02:05.420> read<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.810> quest<00:02:06.050> but<00:02:07.010> I<00:02:07.070> know<00:02:07.190> that's

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
really read the quest but I know that's

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.770 
really read the quest but I know that's
an<00:02:07.610> important<00:02:08.090> part<00:02:08.269> of<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.509> Elder<00:02:08.750> Scrolls

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
an important part of the Elder Scrolls

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.670 
an important part of the Elder Scrolls
online<00:02:09.140> because<00:02:09.709> it's<00:02:09.860> a<00:02:09.979> lot<00:02:10.129> of<00:02:10.220> law

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
online because it's a lot of law

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.740 
online because it's a lot of law
so<00:02:12.489> I'm<00:02:12.579> hoping<00:02:12.909> that<00:02:13.060> they<00:02:13.180> have<00:02:13.269> escaped<00:02:13.599> as

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
so I'm hoping that they have escaped as

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.300 
so I'm hoping that they have escaped as
well<00:02:13.959> I'm<00:02:14.379> hoping<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:14.859> doesn't<00:02:14.890> go<00:02:15.159> into

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
well I'm hoping that it doesn't go into

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.360 
well I'm hoping that it doesn't go into
like<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:15.579> good<00:02:15.790> scene<00:02:16.000> like<00:02:16.180> your<00:02:16.329> fix<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:17.370> and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
like a good scene like your fix to and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.729 
like a good scene like your fix to and
what<00:02:18.579> else<00:02:18.670> would<00:02:18.819> we<00:02:18.939> go<00:02:19.319> yes<00:02:20.319> so<00:02:20.469> they<00:02:20.590> also

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
what else would we go yes so they also

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.250 
what else would we go yes so they also
said<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.099> there<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:21.609> going<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.849> be<00:02:21.879> healers

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
said that there is going to be healers

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.259 
said that there is going to be healers
so<00:02:23.260> if<00:02:23.409> you<00:02:23.620> want<00:02:23.859> to<00:02:24.010> basically<00:02:24.879> play<00:02:25.239> a

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
so if you want to basically play a

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.110 
so if you want to basically play a
healer<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:26.319> can<00:02:26.469> go<00:02:26.620> for<00:02:26.859> a<00:02:26.920> full<00:02:27.159> heal<00:02:27.700> spec

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
healer you can go for a full heal spec

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.879 
healer you can go for a full heal spec
rather<00:02:28.540> than<00:02:28.780> having<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.139> branch<00:02:29.469> out<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.709> a

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:29.889 
rather than having to branch out to a

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.849 
rather than having to branch out to a
hybrid<00:02:30.310> class<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:32.260> they've<00:02:32.439> actually<00:02:32.590> said

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
hybrid class and they've actually said

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.099 
hybrid class and they've actually said
you<00:02:32.980> could<00:02:33.129> use<00:02:33.280> like<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.519> Templar<00:02:34.060> with<00:02:34.959> their

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
you could use like a Templar with their

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.220 
you could use like a Templar with their
restoration<00:02:36.069> staff<00:02:36.639> lines<00:02:36.939> so<00:02:37.629> you<00:02:38.049> know<00:02:38.170> you

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
restoration staff lines so you know you

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.229 
restoration staff lines so you know you
can<00:02:38.409> it's<00:02:39.250> definitely<00:02:39.430> going<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.790> be<00:02:39.849> a<00:02:39.939> healer

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
can it's definitely going to be a healer

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.209 
can it's definitely going to be a healer
in<00:02:40.450> place<00:02:40.689> I<00:02:41.019> know<00:02:41.379> that<00:02:41.530> in<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.709> previous<00:02:41.889> video

they're not not a name integral role

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.080

own ability to heal and that kind of
thing<00:03:09.299> where<00:03:10.299> else<00:03:10.450> would<00:03:10.599> we<00:03:10.659> go<00:03:10.780> yes<00:03:11.620> of

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
thing where else would we go yes of

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.770 
thing where else would we go yes of
starting<00:03:12.189> zones<00:03:12.430> apparently<00:03:13.329> each<00:03:13.510> alliance

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
starting zones apparently each alliance

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.020 
starting zones apparently each alliance
is<00:03:14.560> going<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.799> have<00:03:14.919> its<00:03:14.950> own<00:03:15.189> start<00:03:15.609> and<00:03:15.819> zone

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
is going to have its own start and zone

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.449 
is going to have its own start and zone
so<00:03:16.329> it's<00:03:16.510> not<00:03:16.599> going<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.930> be<00:03:17.099> each<00:03:18.099> different

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
so it's not going to be each different

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.180 
so it's not going to be each different
race<00:03:19.030> has<00:03:19.329> its<00:03:19.479> own<00:03:19.629> starting<00:03:20.139> zone<00:03:20.349> like<00:03:20.889> in

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
race has its own starting zone like in

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.780 
race has its own starting zone like in
lineage<00:03:21.609> 2<00:03:21.879> or<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.599> know<00:03:22.720> well<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.229> Warcraft

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
apparently they all start in one place

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.449 
apparently they all start in one place

different races of each alliance will

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.220 
different races of each alliance will
have<00:03:32.049> their<00:03:32.199> own<00:03:32.229> standpoint<00:03:32.590> basically

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230
