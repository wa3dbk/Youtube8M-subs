00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.350

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.029
 the emo is a musical genre that started in the late 80's 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.329
 In the early 90's this music is characterized by the lyrics of its 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.529
 songs that are usually emotional themes but good now I'll talk 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.839
 of emo as an urban tribe 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:36.100
 The people who call themselves memo are people who say they live their best 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.550
 emotions whether sadness joy and so on 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.180

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.530
 the visual is a movement that occurred within the Japanese rock the visual 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.820

 each of these divisions dress different ones happier others arrive 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.240
 to make up in such a way that they lose human form and come to seem 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.870
 monstrous androgens 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.160
