00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 blur details also use 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.519
 systems with which they handle 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.099
 digitally those pictures for 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.530
 angular in them sensitive information 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.930
 an information that could show us or 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.820
 could you make us 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.090
 could incubate us to do many 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.430
 uncomfortable questions eliminate the background of 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.390
 the stars in many of his shots 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.580
 also clone scenes are duplicated 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.000
 the copies and paste them back into another 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.330
 part to hide information and in 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.559
 sometimes he does something curious he picks 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:43.170
 an image and it rotates 180 degrees so that 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.940
 we lose all perspective in that way 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.020
 we are not able to perceive what there 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.510
 We're seeing 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.190
 silence the astronauts the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.740
 astronauts know much more than what 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.220
 they count but they are obliged to 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.810
 remain in the most absolute silence 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.880
 in many of the visions that are being 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.910
 the vast majority of missions that are 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.320
 are taking effect in space 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.700
 they are of origin 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.800
 before top secret all those visions 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.080
 some of them 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.810
 in some of them are 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.000
 doing things that go way beyond 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.380
 what we could think or could we 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.680
 understand as the authentic museum 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.510
 realism modify the colors in the 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.450
 photographs what they do is modify 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.730
 the colors that for them is important 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.310
 because color stores a wealth 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.620
 important information and they what 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.100
 modify in such a way that what there 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.750
 we see in no case is it really 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.710
 there should be 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.460
 and then especially lose missions of 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.890
 absolutely stupid way we have a 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.440
 very clear example in the year 1993 when 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.270
 the most phlegm george herbert was lost 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.440
 because there was an error in the conversion of 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.890
 data 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.080
 Anglo-Saxons with the metric data that 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.630
 it's totally absurd and yet 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.210
 it's anna from when after being released 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.610
 after crossing all that space to 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.100
 get to Mars when they try to put it 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.900
 in orbit the distances are confused and 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.550
 the ship crashes against the planet 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.550
 for supposedly that's what they tell us 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:25.329
 as I said before nasa has posted 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.739
 160,000 photographs maybe more on high 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.069
 resolution within your website 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.079
 thanks to the information act that is not 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.480
 is the European company that of course 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.819
 all of us here are here 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.040
 financing in a small amount but 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.470
 we are financing it also publishes 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.260
 photographs but the dehesa is a 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:49.959
 much more much more rake company 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:54.940
 they have their website 260 pictures no 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:57.099
 260 thousand 260 photographs and those 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.470
 Most photographs are the 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.870
 astronauts giving us giving by greeting 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.819
 executives executives giving the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.799
 hand to the engineers the engineers to 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.870
 observing the area not the area when 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.480
 all the audience takes off 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.790
 applauding the takeoff of the plane and there 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.219
 very few photos 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.560
 who have been able to offer us through the 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.969
 express marching a probe that is now 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.629
 same circulating around Mars 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:25.659
 about what they are observing there 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.879
 they are hiding it I made a request 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.650
 to that to increase the amount 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.350
 of information and the answer that I 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.010
 gave was the most absolute silence 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.600
 they use the same tactics as the Nasa 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.950
 silent silence modify the data 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.080
 they change the colors they turn the 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.150
 perspectives and even they now what 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.250
 that they do in a little more way 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.670
 artistic is to convert those photographs 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.680
 in 3d when you turn them into 3d all 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.310
 the valuable information that in those 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.380
 photographs may exist disappear 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.540
 they automatically stop being pictures 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.970
 with scientific character and they become 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.970
 photographs show nothing more 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.550
 the international consortium as I have already 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.140
 said it works with public funds I think 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.870
 that European societies should 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.030
 request the one to the juve and space 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.680
 agency that would give us much more 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.680
 information that you are talking about 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.680
 talking about the Americans there are 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.390
 a very dark part a very 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.360
 dark of which surely many of 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.450
 you talk and it's about the arrival of 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.360
 apollo 11 the filming of the apollo 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.650
 those tapes which can be seen there 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.400
 of them 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:43.750
 in theory there were some I think remember that 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.389
 800 of those tapes that ink picked up 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.940
 with great quality everything that was 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.190
 mission for the arrival of man to the 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.729
 moon when those tapes went to 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.340
 capture and digitize stops of some 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.080
 way to move to immortality 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.440
 they found that there were only four all 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.750
 the others yes has disappeared 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.210
 very little has been found 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.370
 the inks in australia nobody knows how 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.260
 they have arrived there the nasa has 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.569
 committed to digitally convert 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.520
 all that information 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:18.020
 but I 'm convinced from here 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.020
 that they will never 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.750
 when we talk about the moon maybe 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.210
 we are talking about the universe more 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.410
 close that we have the universe more 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:37.930
 next the moon carries in us much 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:40.840
 time the moon is a very strange orb not 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.370
 I will enter debate if the man wants or not 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.110
 to the moon 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.350
 there are many photographs that maybe 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:51.070
 reveal that the arrival of man to the 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:54.540
 moon in the year 1969 was very strange here 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.270
 we have a picture we see 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.020
 the transport module of the 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.780
 astronauts 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.169
 we see the wheel and yet we do not see 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:08.199
 the marks of that wheel both in one 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:13.090
 as in another direction as it has arrived 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:15.520
 there found flying no one knows for 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.400
 what then there are so many 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.280
 photographs that maybe with them we can 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.129
 reveal that the exploration of the moon 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.440
 in the year 1969 and throughout the 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:29.270
 various apollo missions may have 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.040
 been imparted double frau behind 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.510
 but as I said before I do not want 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.220
 get into this topic that maybe you 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.220
 point temporary that brings us here today 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:43.329
 as I said before is the moon is a 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:48.439
 very strange network the moon is a satellite 

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:51.499
 that is older than your planet 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:54.079
 on which orbits is one more child 

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:56.959
 old that his father a very thing 

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:59.419
 strange but not too little no no no 

00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:03.289
 let's think that the moon is a little 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:05.569
 million years older than the earth 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:07.580
 there are interesting things in 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:09.589
 translations of the old change by 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.749
 part of their areas and jim that effected 

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:15.800
 on the tablets found in 

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:18.740
 Sumerian in them speaks of a time in 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.759
 which there was no moon the moon was not 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.919
 in heaven 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:24.439
 they explain it in those tablets 

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:28.899
 Sumerians the Sumerians said it to good 

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:28.899
 sure they would have their reasons to do it
