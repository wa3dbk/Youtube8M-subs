00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.280 
today was really good though he was
intense<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.700> that's<00:01:45.659> what<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:45.869> need<00:01:46.020> really

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
intense and that's what we need really

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.230 
intense and that's what we need really
at<00:01:46.470> least<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.130> an<00:01:47.250> intensity<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.939> put<00:01:48.119> some

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
at least to be an intensity and put some

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.210 
at least to be an intensity and put some
intensity<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> games<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.979> make<00:01:50.189> it

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
intensity in the games and just make it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.859 
intensity in the games and just make it
hard<00:01:50.490> for<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> opposition<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.270> then<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
hard for the opposition and then the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.270 
hard for the opposition and then the
quality<00:01:52.259> will<00:01:52.350> shine<00:01:52.560> through<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.950> think

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
quality will shine through I think

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.850 
quality will shine through I think
there's<00:01:53.520> there's<00:01:53.820> some<00:01:53.939> quality<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.360> squad

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
there's there's some quality in squad

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.749 
there's there's some quality in squad
Francois<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.009> was<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.250> first<00:01:56.460> training

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
Francois I was the first training

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.819 
Francois I was the first training
session<00:01:56.820> small<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.689> lid<00:01:57.840> off<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.649> was<00:01:58.799> very

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
session small on the lid off it was very

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.060 
session small on the lid off it was very
good<00:01:59.189> lot<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.880> intensity<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.829> like

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
good lot of intensity and this is like

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.850 
good lot of intensity and this is like
Chandra<00:02:02.280> say<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:03.210> needed<00:02:03.420> actually<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.619> this

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
Chandra say we needed actually and this

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.600 
Chandra say we needed actually and this
good<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.340> another<00:02:05.820> approach<00:02:06.299> but<00:02:07.310> we<00:02:08.310> believe

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
good is another approach but we believe

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.440 
good is another approach but we believe
in<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:09.750> SS<00:02:10.110> Saturday's<00:02:10.590> a

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
in like SS Saturday's a

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.839 
in like SS Saturday's a
fresh<00:02:11.840> stuff<00:02:12.050> for<00:02:12.230> everybody<00:02:12.560> not<00:02:13.520> even<00:02:13.730> how

fresh stuff for everybody not even how

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.309 
fresh stuff for everybody not even how

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
important is it to get those three

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.050 
important is it to get those three
