 how to cheat sausages from this recipe 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.410
 it's a bit more complicated but it's not 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.929
 nothing extraordinary 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.450

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:41.210

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:54.530
 I admire she's a little focused but 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.530
 any one serves wheat flour 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:04.789
 a bit of iron yeast 2 eggs and a 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.789
 little milk 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.460
 To start, we'll do what we can. 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.460
 will mix maize flour 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.640
 wheat flour to 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:37.830
 the last time a little here just to 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:41.160
 stay with the little one stirred until you 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:50.430
 so now we're going to mess with 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:52.790
 yete mexico was and is with both 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.790
 eggs 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.850
 I leave it here on the side 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.450
 now stir tube 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:19.610
 So when are you going to do the only one? 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.020
 You already put your hand on the fire. 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.000
 fry 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:34.850
 Now we know a little about 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:37.610
 milk puts only a little more stirring 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.320
 I could not if we're going to make it good. 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.989
 stirred the dough has to be so is 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.540
 liquid okamoto pasty will not 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:55.130
 to function 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:55.940
 will shake a glass 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.380

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:04.750
 I got it here has to cml everything right 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.750

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.780
 I realized I was not 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:48.400
 Now Argentine sausage 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:54.190
 taking the smart sausage she 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:58.569
 I spit on respect because it does this 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:06.430
 It gives a little bit goes well. 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:11.769
 plunged one more spin because it 's just 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:16.019
 six have to be covered with no sauce 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.019
 there is mass to stick 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.979
 I already'll ever go back to fry 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:30.910

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:37.210
 Only when it's time to eat will you see what it 's like 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.840

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.000
 here o 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:47.550
 It was somewhat unusual but is so in fifth 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.550
 getting in 1 to 1 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.680
 but now the main thing that is 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.110
 eat 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:16.490
