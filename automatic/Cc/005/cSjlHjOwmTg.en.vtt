and it's OHV has this quo to protect
that<00:00:32.009> because<00:00:32.340> if<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:33.149> hit<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.360> real<00:00:33.780> bad

the<00:00:35.280> engine<00:00:35.640> won't<00:00:35.760> start<00:00:36.410> because<00:00:37.410> it'll

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
the engine won't start because it'll

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.490 
the engine won't start because it'll
bend<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:39.329> valves<00:00:39.719> or<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> vows<00:00:40.110> don't<00:00:40.260> get
