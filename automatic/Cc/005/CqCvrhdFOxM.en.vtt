00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.580
 hi guys here again with one more video 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.480
 You look like marketing talks. 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.210
 but it 's not because I'm going now 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.019
 of the acting status that watched the video 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.419
 about the 50 fable I knew there that I 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.079
 I regretted having done 12,000 state 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:34.420
 and it was the last one here in Brazil that there 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:38.449
 a little camera and so I regretted it 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.860
 because I rushed to the truth to 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.789
 to tattoo 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:47.030
 I did not think he was not sure or 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.519
 the design and the site and that is what 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.340
 did I regret I always took 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.989
 a lot to do years tattoo thinking 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.179
 and this time I did not do it in xvii but 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.449
 The good news that I have covered her 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:07.790
 now it 's very initial but I'm cool 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:10.100
 and that but it was not cool for me 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.170
 tended and was no problem with 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.360
 tattoo artist who did nothing 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.730
 it was really me that could not get me 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.270
 fall in love with her then cover her again 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:27.170
 and I hope everything goes well this time 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.170
 The tip is I thought long before making a 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.020
 tattoo and I'm sure of the place and 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.800
 drawing conversation in contact with the anti 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.040
 because it's forever and really can give 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.830
 Shit, but then it's these people, let's go. 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.250
 I've been coming here for eight years. 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:50.260
 That's strange, but it's morning. 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:54.640
 and I decided to take you with fear 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:02:01.810
 No one can accompany me and I'm 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:06.310
 coming into place and now was the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:09.190
 everybody, I'll try to record there 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.540
 I do not know how it's going to be but let's see my 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.540
 with me it comes good 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:31.889
 russell it was hour after an hour of 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:35.569
 suffering it the beautiful balloon 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:39.989
 if it was in the beginning it was too co 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.000
 seriously, it was not super nanny but the 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.019
 problem is how time passes 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.620
 huh 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.299
 and there will hurt upon where ever 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.970
 it's more expensive 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:55.079
 there begins the sick but was calm 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.959
 for one hour seriously and that's clear now 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.389
 I have a new balloon tatoo that 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.430
 means a lot to me thank you very much 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.290
 for you guys accompanying me this video 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.450
 was very different from what happens 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.109
 usually on the channel here, I hope 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:14.329
 You liked it and until the next 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.329
 He has the noise in the arm.
