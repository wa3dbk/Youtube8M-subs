00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello guys or girls that are so welcome 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.250
 to a new video how much desire I had of 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.629
 to be back here with you I 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.069
 boils the blood every time I can not 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.160
 connect 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.200
 with a thousand fingers and be there plugged into 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.199
 you and be able to share and deliver 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.240
 all my experience and there is nothing else 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.699
 united the world to share and that's why 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.820
 I have decided to think about my beginnings 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.449
 when I started in this world of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.480
 dumbbells 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.449
 I go back a few years ago and I remember 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.260
 when I started training at home when 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.940
 I decided to start me in this process this 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.329
 process that is a process when 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.969
 you start adapting the muscles to 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.969
 the trainings and I started on his 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.480
 day from home training with dumbbells 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.950
 with very simple very basic exercises 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.730
 but that were the basis of what I am 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.860
 nowadays so if that is your case this 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.860
 is your video we start 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.869
 we started and I will imagine that it has 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.729
 of few economic resources as only 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.640
 that virtual when you have between 16 20 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.189
 years therefore it will not reduce to a 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.250
 house a couple of dumbbells for example 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.049
 up to 20 kilos and in this case a chair 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.659
 also taking advantage of the advances of the 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.850
 science and although years ago no 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.470
 we had it more nutritionally so 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.600
 spectacular as we do it today 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.119
 we are going to take advantage of it and so that you advance 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.850
 more quickly I will recommend a 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.310
 supplement that will accompany you in this 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.590
 series of eight training videos 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.869
 for beginners from home with few 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.000
 economic resources that is how I started 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.470
 I in each of the videos I'm going to 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.270
 recommend a different supplement that 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.850
 You can combine according to your 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.619
 needs the proportions of ironman 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.840
 professional of the great neutral brand 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.700
 limit are ideal for the profile 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.340
 of the user who starts training by 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.630
 your account from home for your 40 grams 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.179
 of whey protein mixture 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.399
 concentrate and milk protein with their 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.289
 96 grams of carbohydrates from 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.730
 different glycemic index besides 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.220
 about 10 grams 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.360
 8 grams of glutamine is the protein of 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.370
 will provide development and growth 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.020
 muscle the carbohydrates energy and 

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.360
 strength to train properly and 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.890
 intensify muscle volume and 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.690
 bc so glutamine will favor the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.700
 protein synthesis and the elimination of 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.740
 fat and recovery respectively 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.420
 inside it has a picador of 60 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.710
 grams and it is recommended that 15 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.890
 minutes before this training 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.140
 Take half doser of 30 grams with 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.820
 about 150,000 liters of water and just at 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.130
 finish take one complete one 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.590
 doser of 60 grams with about 250 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.170
 milliliters of water and both the seiquer 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.240
 as the approximate aroma of water and 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.620
 nutra limit that you just see you can 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.770
 get already in the big exclusive store 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.590
 www.puntomio.com www.ull.es strong point 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.440
 with this series of videos will cost 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.030
 8 videos in which we will train the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.980
 different muscle groups around 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.930
 body and each of the videos is going to 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.260
 compose with my selection by three 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.120
 exercises of three series with 13 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.110
 repetitions and in which you will employ 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.830
 85% of your maximum strength otherwise 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.950
 I think 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.710
 I just have to show you what they are 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.200
 the exercises of this video in which 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.900
 we train today shoulders 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.180
 we started lifting front with a 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.230
 dumbbell with this exercise 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.240
 We mainly develop the 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.770
 deltoid, which also has a 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.470
 small effect on the pectoral 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.090
 sit on a chair supports 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.830
 well the back on the back of the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.300
 it grabs strongly with both 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.220
 hands the dumbbell by the handle 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.140
 we begin the journey at the height of 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.850
 the waist and we slowly raise the 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.640
 dumbbell up to shoulder height 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.100
 with semi-flexed elbows 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.930
 in that position a second and let's go down 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.540
 slowly to the starting position 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.700
 we repeat the route exactly the same 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.950
 remember that there are three repetitions in 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.920
 each of the three series and rest 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.600
 one minute between series series the 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.510
 next exercise that we are going to perform 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.150
 they are lateral elevations sitting where 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.100
 we develop the middle deltoids and 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.080
 part of the back again sitting 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.180
 to avoid arching the back the 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.400
 we fully support the support of 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.270
 the chair picks up the dumbbells placing 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.190
 the palms 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.620
 hands looking towards each other 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.110
 faced is the hammer grip or 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.850
 neutral arms parallel to the body 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.370
 keeping the elbows slightly 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.410
 flexed we raise our arms to the 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.050
 horizontal and we return to the position 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.800
 initial we made three series of 13 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.750
 repetitions each without varying the weight 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.000
 we are still sitting with our back straight 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.220
 looking forward with the chest towards 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.720
 out and shoulders back this 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.060
 exercise is called shrinkage 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.980
 shoulders and it's excellent to develop 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.350
 the trapezoids with hammer grip or 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.780
 neutral again and arms stretched and 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.730
 glued to the body we raise to the same 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.430
 time the dumbbells exercising the 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.750
 strength from the trapezoids we maintain 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.030
 two seconds with the trapezoids 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.190
 contracted trying to paste them as 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.140
 possible to the neck and we return to the 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.090
 initial position we repeat again the 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.190
 move until completing the three 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.470
 series you have seen that simple and 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.510
 functional are these exercises that you 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.300
 I show for all those who 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.180
 begin in this world of the weights of 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.340
 simple and functional economic way by 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.660
 Of course I will not forget to subscribe 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.130
 subscribe to the channel 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.800
 I like it and we see ourselves as 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:27.060
 you already know it, little guys in the 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.060
 next video chao 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.310
 if not 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.420
 look
