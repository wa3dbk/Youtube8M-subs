 [Music] 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.040
 to pull his feet 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.720
 I do not know exactly why we do 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.140
 I do not want to know that 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.460
 pull 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.010
 so I do not think that anyone 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.110
 absolutely would like to wear socks almost 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.580
 say can really be very helpful 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.450
 keep your feet warm when it's cold 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.880
 is in the winters 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.980
 i mean i wish i could care 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.510
 but bear that's okay is 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.510
 you can plug yourself with your finger 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.370
 just think it's flowing in 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.890
 young holy shit I think so 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.610
 should slow me down 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.660
 I will help you with the homework 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.550
 help 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.550
 that would be great 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.220
 Are you satisfied that this is harder than 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.170
 the dead unborn photos of my 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.370
 sister do not worry with my help 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.930
 we are faster with the homework 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.930
 finished faster than you can say 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:10.500
 Okay, okay, let's see if it's 46 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.979
 ticks at 780 y through the square 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.479
 mean value of new woltmann in minute 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.940
 46 780 x2 y 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.710
 it was really for a shit the 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.200
 is only appropriate if he decreed 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.770
 she could do it 46 times 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.080
 makes y by the by the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.420
 the square median mark of 90 that is 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.520
 it is impossible to say then calms down 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.520
 is available - what to do 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.600
 This is really a tough task 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.430
 the paper wanted because with 46 780 y 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.750
 by the catholic mean of 90 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.640
 there we only need the upper value 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.910
 calculate and often only gives one 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.400
 meaning there you see 74 x 9 thus results 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.400
 a result of 666 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:38.060
