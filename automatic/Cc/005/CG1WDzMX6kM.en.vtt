00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:02.730
 do not 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.599
 the I have and oh well 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:19.529
 all maths 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.199
 and we count it is important that you give the exact outcome with you go 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.929
 don't estimate the outcome 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.269
 and yet have precise calculations and estimate a lot with each other 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.220
 to make 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.150
 an example 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.660
 I show such a picture and the question is are and more red dots or are there 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.100
 more blue dot 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.830
 here comes attention 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.980
 was easier there were more red dots 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.700
 now the next 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.700
 a bit different 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.870
 and where a now more blue dot 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.210
 but what matters is actually the following 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.990
 what just happened 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.260
 in our brains 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.810
 here have the cerebral cortex 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.640
 the two halves of the brain 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.890
 when estimating numbers 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.450
 small area 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.530
 It lies in the parietal lobe and it is called the intra pares to the seekers 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.040
 that ps 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.260
 and in that small active area 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.619
 sit hns 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.310
 the shortage of another system 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.700
 and that is the system for the rough determination of numbers 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.450
 well this is important 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.380
 it is alone and located exactly in the brain that I am best 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.300
 involved with almost all calculation tasks and the processing of numbers 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.170
 it forms as it were 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.690
 the boss is in charge 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.649
 there are 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.020
 there are major differences in how the value works between people 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.800
 is 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.130
 and if it is knowledge 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.020
 is less well developed 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.799
 gives that with every next step in the calculation 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.430
 issues 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.490
 people with serious calculation problems people with dyscalculia 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.939
 thereby 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.930
 it appears that does in ps 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.170
 less extensive and less active 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.229
 the knsf is therefore much less accurate 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.380
 Research seems to show that you can improve the functioning of the aan s 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.210
 training the ns increase your heart's brain activity and yes 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.209
 as a result, the calculation skills improve 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.699
 this was the purpose of the investigation 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.949
 different groups of test subjects determined how well they scored 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:21.819
 compare 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.899
 of t numbers of dots 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:26.559
 the same tests that have just been done genk 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:28.280
 some against training 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.280
 the other is not waiting, put it in the graph 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:33.789
 on the vertical axis 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:38.009
 state how good you are at estimating numbers the higher the better 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.959
 time course on the horizontal axis 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.569
 the start of the investigation 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.370
 the end after five days 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.649
 and sixteen weeks 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:50.969
 the first test group received training in estimating for five days 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:51.889
 number 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.670
 at the start of the investigation 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.459
 they were at this level 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.730
 and during the five days they scored better so it works 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.889
 and so after five days, this level ends at this level 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:06.579
 after that five days damme scored something that was finished 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.659
 after sixteen weeks they were still at this level 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:11.539
 higher 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.169
 that's the start 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.169
 why is it that this goalkeeper training 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.469
 our brains remain our entire life 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:20.529
 all studies 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:24.329
 that is, they can adapt to new skills 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.769
 and situations 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.500
 and changes can be brought about by that plasticity 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:31.129
 the brain that are permanent 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.040
 especially in those parts of the brain that tire those skills are involved 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:36.900
 so good news 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.199
 it becomes even more beautiful 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:40.349
 it looks like it 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.029
 that there is another way to make our brains more plastic and the 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.100
 function of the end and syntus of the calculation skills 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.709
 positively 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.809
 that is with the help of trends credion brendan the noor is stimulus 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.759
 yes you can immediately forget that period 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.040
 but it is a technique 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.120
 wherein with the electrodes certain parts of the brain 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.309
 with small in lectrice pulse 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:06.709
 be encouraged 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.799
 don't worry it's totally endless 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.549
 during the same investigation 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.840
 did another test well only on this form of brain stimulation 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.500
 they did not receive any training 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.500
 but with them only hetty ds was stimulated 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:22.909
 and what it was to see 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.909
 after five days 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:27.909
 a score improved slightly 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:30.210
 the most beautiful continuously 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.780
 a combination 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.909
 of training 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:34.840
 and hersi stimulation 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.259
 gives even better results 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.870
 and score of this test well 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.160
 was the highest of all sizes after the training period and it was 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.390
 real expert henk 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.930
 until the sixteen weeks after the training 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.789
 is that nice news? 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.449
 so soon all students with dyscalculia in stimulation helmet 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.159
 things are not going that fast yet 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:05.409
 the effect of training in combination with stimulation is only added 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.039
 adults tested 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.039
 it is still unclear whether it works that way for children 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.599
 but suppose brain stimulation is also effective and lasting in children 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.199
 then we have a cure for dyscalculia 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.199
 soon we can all learn to count well and easily 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.639
 much food for thought 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.610
 you can count on that 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.289
 last 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:29.139
 the do 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.139
 what thought 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.250
 every group it
