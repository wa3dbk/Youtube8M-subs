programming a couple of prerequisites
you<00:00:11.559> might<00:00:11.679> want<00:00:11.830> to<00:00:11.860> look<00:00:11.980> at<00:00:12.160> before<00:00:12.519> you

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
you might want to look at before you

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.220 
you might want to look at before you
actually<00:00:12.730> start<00:00:12.940> dive<00:00:13.480> into<00:00:13.660> this<00:00:13.870> are<00:00:14.110> going

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
actually start dive into this are going

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.440 
actually start dive into this are going
to<00:00:14.379> be<00:00:14.559> a<00:00:14.940> basic<00:00:15.940> understanding<00:00:16.030> of

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
to be a basic understanding of

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.380 
to be a basic understanding of
objective-c<00:00:17.160> along<00:00:18.160> with<00:00:18.490> some<00:00:19.180> experience

objective-c along with some experience
with<00:00:19.690> Xcode<00:00:20.140> so<00:00:20.440> I<00:00:20.470> will<00:00:20.680> link<00:00:20.860> to<00:00:21.190> a<00:00:21.220> tutorial

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
with Xcode so I will link to a tutorial

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.000 
with Xcode so I will link to a tutorial

explaining programming concepts and he's

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.950 
explaining programming concepts and he's
just<00:00:30.340> a<00:00:30.400> fun<00:00:30.550> guy<00:00:30.580> to<00:00:30.730> listen<00:00:30.910> to<00:00:31.150> so<00:00:31.480> check

just a fun guy to listen to so check

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.029 
just a fun guy to listen to so check
that<00:00:31.990> out<00:00:32.169> if<00:00:32.469> you<00:00:32.589> need<00:00:32.679> a<00:00:32.739> better

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
that out if you need a better

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:35.840 
that out if you need a better
understanding<00:00:33.699> of<00:00:33.879> those<00:00:34.120> two<00:00:34.359> things<00:00:34.570> um

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
understanding of those two things um

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.650 
understanding of those two things um
this<00:00:36.850> is<00:00:36.940> going<00:00:37.120> to<00:00:37.179> be<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.300> game<00:00:37.420> we're<00:00:37.570> going

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
this is going to be the game we're going

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.040 
this is going to be the game we're going
to<00:00:37.719> be<00:00:37.809> making<00:00:37.929> right<00:00:38.890> here<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.839> what<00:00:40.839> it<00:00:40.929> is

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
to be making right here and what it is

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.599 
to be making right here and what it is
is<00:00:41.350> you're<00:00:41.499> just<00:00:41.620> this<00:00:41.829> little<00:00:42.100> block<00:00:42.309> block

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
is you're just this little block block

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.299 
is you're just this little block block
and<00:00:42.969> you<00:00:43.839> tap<00:00:44.019> to<00:00:44.050> start<00:00:44.379> and<00:00:44.589> then<00:00:44.949> from<00:00:45.159> there

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
and you tap to start and then from there

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.160 
and you tap to start and then from there
on<00:00:45.429> out<00:00:45.550> you<00:00:45.730> tap<00:00:45.969> to<00:00:46.120> jump<00:00:46.300> over<00:00:46.510> these<00:00:46.690> blocks

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
on out you tap to jump over these blocks

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.009 
on out you tap to jump over these blocks
here<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:48.190> if<00:00:49.120> you<00:00:49.420> hit<00:00:49.539> one<00:00:49.600> of<00:00:49.749> the<00:00:49.839> blocks

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
here and if you hit one of the blocks

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:51.389 
here and if you hit one of the blocks
it's<00:00:50.260> game<00:00:50.440> over<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:50.859> you<00:00:50.949> can<00:00:51.069> tap<00:00:51.370> to

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
it's game over and you can tap to

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.899 
it's game over and you can tap to
restart<00:00:51.909> and<00:00:52.179> all<00:00:52.780> that<00:00:53.019> jazz<00:00:53.199> so<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:54.789> a

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
restart and all that jazz so it's a

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.939 
restart and all that jazz so it's a
really<00:00:55.059> basic<00:00:55.300> game<00:00:55.719> but<00:00:56.019> it<00:00:56.229> should<00:00:56.559> cover<00:00:56.800> a

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
really basic game but it should cover a

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.869 
really basic game but it should cover a
lot<00:00:57.190> of<00:00:57.309> basic<00:00:57.729> game<00:00:58.179> mechanics<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:59.760> things<00:01:00.760> I

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
lot of basic game mechanics and things I

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:01.979 
lot of basic game mechanics and things I
should<00:01:00.999> just<00:01:01.120> get<00:01:01.239> you<00:01:01.329> started<00:01:01.389> like<00:01:01.870> the

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
should just get you started like the

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.740 
should just get you started like the
points<00:01:02.319> label<00:01:02.649> here<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.550> high<00:01:04.030> score<00:01:04.360> label

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
points label here the high score label

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.929 
points label here the high score label
it'll<00:01:05.259> work<00:01:05.469> with<00:01:05.619> basic<00:01:06.009> physics<00:01:06.340> along<00:01:06.700> with

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
it'll work with basic physics along with

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.880 
it'll work with basic physics along with
the<00:01:07.119> world<00:01:07.329> generation<00:01:07.930> so<00:01:08.229> you<00:01:08.290> can<00:01:08.649> see<00:01:08.770> this

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
the world generation so you can see this

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.819 
the world generation so you can see this
world<00:01:09.159> going<00:01:09.340> by<00:01:09.579> we'll<00:01:10.360> cover<00:01:10.540> that<00:01:10.780> as<00:01:10.960> well

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.679 

so<00:01:14.829> one<00:01:15.640> more<00:01:15.820> thing<00:01:15.850> before<00:01:16.030> we<00:01:16.299> actually<00:01:16.420> get

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
so one more thing before we actually get

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.980 
so one more thing before we actually get
started<00:01:16.960> is<00:01:17.820> I'm<00:01:18.820> running<00:01:19.000> this<00:01:19.240> on<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.509> iOS

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
started is I'm running this on the iOS

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.190 
started is I'm running this on the iOS
simulator<00:01:20.409> I<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:22.030> run<00:01:22.270> this<00:01:22.360> on<00:01:22.539> my<00:01:22.600> iphone<00:01:22.780> if

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
simulator I can run this on my iphone if

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.350 
simulator I can run this on my iphone if
I<00:01:23.289> want<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:24.610> to<00:01:24.700> do<00:01:24.850> that<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.149> need<00:01:25.299> a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
I want but to do that you need a

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.230 
I want but to do that you need a
developer<00:01:25.810> license<00:01:26.200> it's<00:01:26.500> $99<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.520> year<00:01:27.670> I<00:01:27.880> can

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
developer license it's $99 a year I can

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.319 
developer license it's $99 a year I can
link<00:01:28.450> to<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:30.189> if<00:01:30.609> you'd<00:01:30.789> like<00:01:30.969> to<00:01:31.180> actually

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
link to that if you'd like to actually

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.359 
link to that if you'd like to actually
get<00:01:31.750> that<00:01:31.960> in<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.649> description<00:01:32.890> below

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
get that in the description below

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.520 
get that in the description below
I<00:01:33.579> don't<00:01:34.000> list<00:01:34.119> just<00:01:34.299> getting<00:01:34.659> it<00:01:34.810> if<00:01:34.990> you

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
I don't list just getting it if you

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.999 
I don't list just getting it if you
actually<00:01:35.710> plan<00:01:36.219> on<00:01:37.469> publishing<00:01:38.469> your<00:01:38.619> app<00:01:38.680> on

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
actually plan on publishing your app on

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.399 
actually plan on publishing your app on
the<00:01:39.250> App<00:01:39.399> Store<00:01:39.759> because<00:01:40.240> because<00:01:40.479> it<00:01:40.600> is<00:01:40.719> $99

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
the App Store because because it is $99

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.859 
the App Store because because it is $99
a<00:01:41.439> year<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.590> can<00:01:44.799> run<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:46.210> simulator<00:01:46.630> for

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
a year you can run the simulator for

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.020 
a year you can run the simulator for
free<00:01:47.020> though<00:01:47.200> just<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.799> make<00:01:48.789> sure<00:01:48.820> that's

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
free though just to make sure that's

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.109 
free though just to make sure that's
clear<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:50.409> with<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:50.799> I<00:01:50.829> think<00:01:51.070> we<00:01:51.429> can<00:01:51.729> just

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
clear and with that I think we can just

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.010 
clear and with that I think we can just
get<00:01:52.689> started<00:01:53.229> so<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.729> want<00:01:54.939> to<00:01:55.179> open<00:01:55.600> up<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:55.899> new

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
get started so you want to open up a new

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.080 
get started so you want to open up a new
project<00:01:56.229> in<00:01:56.530> Xcode<00:01:56.679> I<00:01:57.219> have<00:01:57.579> another<00:01:57.820> monitor

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
project in Xcode I have another monitor

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.690 
project in Xcode I have another monitor
over<00:01:58.329> here<00:01:58.539> so<00:01:58.749> I'll<00:01:58.840> just<00:01:58.899> drag<00:01:59.460> let's<00:02:00.460> drag

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
over here so I'll just drag let's drag

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.690 
over here so I'll just drag let's drag
it<00:02:00.729> over<00:02:01.679> it's<00:02:02.679> going<00:02:02.829> to<00:02:02.920> do<00:02:02.979> new<00:02:03.189> projects

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
it over it's going to do new projects

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.050 
it over it's going to do new projects
and<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.890> is<00:02:06.039> what<00:02:06.159> we<00:02:06.249> have<00:02:06.369> let<00:02:06.969> me<00:02:07.030> just

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
and this is what we have let me just

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.699 
and this is what we have let me just
close<00:02:07.299> out<00:02:07.509> of<00:02:07.539> that<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.759> in<00:02:10.509> this<00:02:11.200> new<00:02:11.349> project

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
close out of that so in this new project

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.170 
close out of that so in this new project
when<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:11.860> want<00:02:12.129> in<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.430> sidebar<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.970> want<00:02:13.120> to

when you want in the sidebar you want to

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.160 
when you want in the sidebar you want to

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
and then sprite kit game for the icons

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.070 
and then sprite kit game for the icons
and<00:02:18.550> what<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:18.880> does<00:02:19.060> is<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.450> just<00:02:19.480> sets<00:02:19.870> up

bundle identifier and this actually

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.550 
bundle identifier and this actually
isn't<00:02:48.700> super<00:02:49.330> important<00:02:49.780> oh<00:02:49.870> it's<00:02:50.230> like<00:02:50.410> the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
isn't super important oh it's like the

only important thing about this is it

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.830 
only important thing about this is it
needs<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.690> be<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:53.430> unique<00:02:54.430> identifier<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.239> all

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
needs to be a unique identifier to all

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.539 
needs to be a unique identifier to all
your<00:02:56.140> apps<00:02:56.319> because<00:02:56.799> what<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.280> bundle

your apps because what the bundle
identifier<00:02:57.670> is<00:02:58.239> is<00:02:58.540> it's<00:02:59.380> how<00:02:59.620> Apple

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
identifier is is it's how Apple

for the class prefix generally people

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.070 
for the class prefix generally people
put<00:03:13.900> in<00:03:13.989> their<00:03:14.080> initials<00:03:14.530> what<00:03:14.920> this<00:03:15.100> does<00:03:15.310> is

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
put in their initials what this does is

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.360 
put in their initials what this does is
with<00:03:17.080> every<00:03:17.380> new<00:03:17.500> class<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:17.980> make<00:03:18.190> it's

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
with every new class that you make it's

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.190 
with every new class that you make it's
going<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.609> put<00:03:18.820> those<00:03:19.000> initials<00:03:19.480> before<00:03:20.079> the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
going to put those initials before the

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.410 
going to put those initials before the
class<00:03:20.440> name<00:03:20.709> this<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.489> way<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.790> distinguish

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
class name this is a way to distinguish

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.780 
class name this is a way to distinguish
your<00:03:22.750> classes<00:03:23.230> from<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:24.100> classes<00:03:24.519> that<00:03:24.549> are

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
your classes from the classes that are

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.449 
your classes from the classes that are
in<00:03:24.820> Apple's<00:03:25.540> framework<00:03:26.200> so<00:03:27.160> I'm<00:03:27.250> just<00:03:27.340> gonna

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
in Apple's framework so I'm just gonna

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.530 
in Apple's framework so I'm just gonna
leave<00:03:27.549> this<00:03:27.670> blank<00:03:27.880> because<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.329> can

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
leave this blank because you can

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.569 
leave this blank because you can
manually<00:03:28.930> put<00:03:29.019> you<00:03:29.380> can<00:03:29.560> manually<00:03:29.980> put<00:03:30.400> those

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
manually put you can manually put those

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.039 
manually put you can manually put those
initials<00:03:31.000> in<00:03:31.209> when<00:03:31.510> you're<00:03:31.660> creating<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:32.019> new

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
initials in when you're creating a new

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.940 
initials in when you're creating a new
class<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:33.370> um<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:34.170> just<00:03:35.170> like<00:03:35.440> doing<00:03:35.620> that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
class so um I just like doing that

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.560 
class so um I just like doing that
because<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.730> don't<00:03:36.910> always<00:03:37.030> like<00:03:37.299> putting

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
because I don't always like putting

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.449 
because I don't always like putting
those<00:03:37.630> initials<00:03:38.019> in<00:03:38.140> there<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.980> then<00:03:39.310> for

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
those initials in there and then for

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.670 
those initials in there and then for
devices<00:03:39.850> just<00:03:40.000> like<00:03:40.120> iPhone<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.380> should

these videos between like five and eight

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.360 
these videos between like five and eight
minutes<00:03:50.049> because<00:03:50.230> I<00:03:50.829> don't<00:03:51.010> like<00:03:51.160> watching

projects right here you can see the

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.660 
projects right here you can see the
sprite<00:03:58.840> kit<00:03:58.989> template<00:03:59.440> um<00:03:59.590> kind<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.310> created

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
sprite kit template um kind of created

sprite kit template um kind of created
all<00:04:00.760> these<00:04:00.880> classes<00:04:01.269> right<00:04:01.390> here<00:04:01.660> I'll<00:04:01.780> go

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
all these classes right here I'll go

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.599 
all these classes right here I'll go
over<00:04:02.079> a<00:04:02.230> little<00:04:02.709> bit<00:04:02.920> of<00:04:03.130> what<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.430> actually

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
over a little bit of what it actually

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.110 
over a little bit of what it actually
did<00:04:04.350> so<00:04:05.350> in<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.650> storyboard<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.730> first<00:04:06.970> thing

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
did so in the storyboard the first thing

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.309 
did so in the storyboard the first thing
that<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:07.359> did<00:04:07.480> is<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:10.510> have<00:04:10.660> this<00:04:10.810> initial

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
that it did is you have this initial

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.840 
that it did is you have this initial
view<00:04:11.500> controller<00:04:11.889> for<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.340> storyboard<00:04:12.790> you

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
view controller for the storyboard you

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.289 
view controller for the storyboard you
don't<00:04:13.060> actually<00:04:13.269> use<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.620> storyboard<00:04:15.220> at<00:04:15.639> all

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
don't actually use the storyboard at all

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.330 
don't actually use the storyboard at all
when<00:04:16.930> you're<00:04:17.019> using<00:04:17.169> sprite<00:04:17.590> kit<00:04:17.799> at<00:04:17.979> least<00:04:18.160> I

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
when you're using sprite kit at least I

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.659 
when you're using sprite kit at least I
haven't<00:04:18.579> in<00:04:19.030> any<00:04:19.180> way<00:04:19.359> so<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:21.280> can<00:04:21.400> just<00:04:21.519> get<00:04:21.639> a

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
haven't in any way so you can just get a

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.010 
haven't in any way so you can just get a
really<00:04:21.910> basic<00:04:22.060> understanding<00:04:22.599> of<00:04:22.690> this<00:04:22.810> and

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
really basic understanding of this and

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.270 
really basic understanding of this and
then<00:04:23.110> move<00:04:23.289> on<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:23.650> never<00:04:23.800> worry<00:04:24.039> about<00:04:24.159> it

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
then move on and never worry about it

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.670 
then move on and never worry about it
again<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:25.390> for<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.750> view<00:04:25.900> controller<00:04:26.229> you

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
again so for the view controller you

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.750 
again so for the view controller you
click<00:04:26.860> on<00:04:26.979> it

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
click on it

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.280 
click on it
it's<00:04:27.880> set<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.330> view<00:04:28.660> of<00:04:28.900> this<00:04:29.020> view

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
it's set the view of this view

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.560 
it's set the view of this view
controller<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.860> an<00:04:30.010> s<00:04:30.250> cave<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.850> instead<00:04:31.360> of<00:04:31.420> a

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
controller to an s cave you instead of a

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.810 
controller to an s cave you instead of a
uiview<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:33.390> sk<00:04:34.390> view<00:04:34.630> is<00:04:34.840> essentially<00:04:35.410> the

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
uiview and sk view is essentially the

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.870 
uiview and sk view is essentially the
sprite<00:04:36.820> kit<00:04:37.000> equivalent<00:04:37.570> of<00:04:37.780> UI<00:04:38.500> view<00:04:38.920> it's

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
sprite kit equivalent of UI view it's

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.020 
sprite kit equivalent of UI view it's
what<00:04:40.440> it's<00:04:41.440> what<00:04:41.650> you<00:04:41.740> load<00:04:41.980> in<00:04:42.190> classes

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
what it's what you load in classes

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.690 
what it's what you load in classes
called<00:04:43.240> scenes<00:04:43.750> into<00:04:44.290> scenes<00:04:45.220> are<00:04:45.400> where<00:04:45.550> all

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
called scenes into scenes are where all

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.090 
called scenes into scenes are where all
the<00:04:46.170> interesting<00:04:47.170> stuff<00:04:47.200> happens<00:04:47.830> in<00:04:48.010> Xcode

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
the interesting stuff happens in Xcode

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.500 
the interesting stuff happens in Xcode
so<00:04:51.100> that's<00:04:51.820> really<00:04:51.940> all<00:04:52.090> you<00:04:52.180> need<00:04:52.210> to<00:04:52.360> know

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
so that's really all you need to know

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.360 
so that's really all you need to know
all<00:04:52.810> you<00:04:53.080> need<00:04:53.200> to<00:04:53.320> eat<00:04:53.410> all<00:04:53.560> you<00:04:53.860> need<00:04:54.070> to<00:04:54.220> know

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
all you need to eat all you need to know

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.480 
all you need to eat all you need to know
um<00:04:54.670> is<00:04:54.970> it's<00:04:55.960> an<00:04:56.170> escape<00:04:56.380> you<00:04:56.710> instead<00:04:57.130> of<00:04:57.220> a<00:04:57.280> UI

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
um is it's an escape you instead of a UI

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.910 
um is it's an escape you instead of a UI
view<00:04:57.930> so<00:04:58.930> then<00:04:59.290> you<00:04:59.380> go<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.740> view

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
view so then you go to the view

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.820 
view so then you go to the view
controller<00:05:00.250> here<00:05:01.290> in<00:05:02.290> the<00:05:02.560> viewdidload

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
controller here in the viewdidload

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.620 
controller here in the viewdidload
method<00:05:03.040> this<00:05:03.400> is<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.670> code<00:05:03.850> that<00:05:03.970> I<00:05:04.030> added<00:05:04.210> so

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
method this is the code that I added so

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.580 
method this is the code that I added so
it<00:05:04.750> grabbed<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.260> SK<00:05:05.620> view<00:05:05.860> that<00:05:06.160> we<00:05:06.250> just<00:05:06.460> saw

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
it grabbed the SK view that we just saw

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.770 
it grabbed the SK view that we just saw
in<00:05:08.590> that<00:05:08.650> view<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.640> shows<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.390> frames<00:05:10.600> per

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
in that view it shows the frames per

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.380 
in that view it shows the frames per
second<00:05:11.140> and<00:05:11.260> shows<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.740> note<00:05:11.920> counts<00:05:12.340> this<00:05:13.240> is

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
second and shows the note counts this is

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.210 
second and shows the note counts this is
just<00:05:13.570> for<00:05:13.690> testing<00:05:13.990> purposes<00:05:14.470> you<00:05:14.890> actually

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
just for testing purposes you actually

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.560 
just for testing purposes you actually
turn<00:05:15.370> this<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:15.700> always<00:05:16.060> turn<00:05:16.210> this<00:05:16.360> off

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
turn this you always turn this off

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.970 
turn this you always turn this off
before<00:05:16.750> you<00:05:16.960> actually<00:05:17.170> submit<00:05:17.530> your<00:05:17.770> app<00:05:17.860> to

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
before you actually submit your app to

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.700 
before you actually submit your app to
the<00:05:18.070> App<00:05:18.100> Store<00:05:18.630> the<00:05:19.630> note<00:05:19.840> count<00:05:20.140> as<00:05:20.320> it<00:05:20.470> shows

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
the App Store the note count as it shows

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.130 
the App Store the note count as it shows
how<00:05:21.100> many<00:05:21.300> things<00:05:22.300> basically<00:05:22.870> are<00:05:23.050> getting

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
how many things basically are getting

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.540 
how many things basically are getting
drawn<00:05:23.590> within<00:05:23.860> that<00:05:24.130> view<00:05:24.460> at<00:05:24.700> that<00:05:25.090> moment

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
drawn within that view at that moment

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.820 
drawn within that view at that moment
then<00:05:27.550> after<00:05:27.790> it<00:05:27.880> grabs<00:05:28.090> that<00:05:28.270> SK<00:05:28.870> view<00:05:29.110> it

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
then after it grabs that SK view it

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.350 
then after it grabs that SK view it
creates<00:05:30.130> a<00:05:30.220> new<00:05:30.340> scene<00:05:30.610> from<00:05:30.820> the<00:05:30.940> my<00:05:31.090> scene

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
creates a new scene from the my scene

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.670 
creates a new scene from the my scene
class<00:05:31.600> as<00:05:31.810> you<00:05:31.900> can<00:05:32.020> see<00:05:32.170> in<00:05:32.260> the<00:05:32.320> side<00:05:32.500> bar

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
class as you can see in the side bar

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.270 
class as you can see in the side bar
over<00:05:32.890> here<00:05:33.100> and<00:05:34.470> then<00:05:35.470> it<00:05:35.590> presents<00:05:35.800> that

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
over here and then it presents that

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.240 
over here and then it presents that
scene<00:05:36.580> to<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.300> view<00:05:37.650> so<00:05:38.650> with<00:05:38.800> scenes<00:05:39.040> you<00:05:39.220> can

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
scene to the view so with scenes you can

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.680 
scene to the view so with scenes you can
have<00:05:39.520> a<00:05:39.550> lot<00:05:39.790> of<00:05:39.820> different<00:05:40.150> scenes<00:05:40.330> you<00:05:40.570> can

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
have a lot of different scenes you can

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.240 
have a lot of different scenes you can
have<00:05:40.810> like<00:05:40.990> a<00:05:41.020> menu<00:05:41.290> scene<00:05:41.680> you<00:05:41.950> can<00:05:42.100> have<00:05:42.220> a

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
have like a menu scene you can have a

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.040 
have like a menu scene you can have a
play<00:05:42.520> scene<00:05:42.880> you<00:05:43.120> can<00:05:43.240> have<00:05:43.390> different<00:05:43.780> level

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
play scene you can have different level

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.600 
play scene you can have different level
scenes<00:05:44.350> um<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.950> only<00:05:48.100> time<00:05:48.310> you<00:05:48.400> really<00:05:48.430> need

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
scenes um the only time you really need

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.430 
scenes um the only time you really need
to<00:05:48.760> worry<00:05:48.970> about<00:05:49.090> the<00:05:49.450> view<00:05:49.750> is<00:05:49.990> when<00:05:50.320> you're

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
to worry about the view is when you're

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.730 
to worry about the view is when you're
presenting<00:05:50.920> those<00:05:51.070> scenes<00:05:52.170> to<00:05:53.170> the<00:05:53.200> view<00:05:53.560> is

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
presenting those scenes to the view is

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.300 
presenting those scenes to the view is
when<00:05:53.890> you're<00:05:54.010> switching<00:05:54.190> between<00:05:54.430> them<00:05:56.040> so<00:05:57.040> um

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
when you're switching between them so um

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.990 
when you're switching between them so um
now<00:05:57.760> we<00:05:57.820> can<00:05:58.180> go<00:05:58.360> to<00:05:58.420> the<00:05:58.660> actual<00:05:58.990> scene<00:05:59.350> class

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
now we can go to the actual scene class

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.270 
now we can go to the actual scene class
I'll<00:06:01.000> just<00:06:01.330> run<00:06:01.690> this<00:06:01.870> really<00:06:02.170> fast<00:06:02.410> to<00:06:02.770> UM

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.540 

show<00:06:06.280> you<00:06:06.340> kind<00:06:06.850> of<00:06:06.910> like<00:06:07.090> what's<00:06:08.370> going<00:06:09.370> on

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
show you kind of like what's going on

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.540 
show you kind of like what's going on
I'm<00:06:09.940> also<00:06:10.090> gonna<00:06:10.800> because<00:06:11.800> the<00:06:11.890> simulator<00:06:12.400> is

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
I'm also gonna because the simulator is

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.240 
I'm also gonna because the simulator is
already<00:06:12.940> in<00:06:13.060> use<00:06:15.780> I'm<00:06:16.780> not<00:06:17.100> seeing<00:06:18.100> the

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
already in use I'm not seeing the

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:25.370 
already in use I'm not seeing the
simulator<00:06:19.000> here<00:06:23.340> okay<00:06:24.340> I<00:06:24.370> might<00:06:24.670> have<00:06:24.850> to<00:06:25.000> um

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
simulator here okay I might have to um

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.840 
simulator here okay I might have to um
I'm<00:06:26.380> I'm<00:06:26.560> to<00:06:26.740> cut<00:06:26.950> this<00:06:27.100> video<00:06:27.310> and<00:06:27.580> figure<00:06:27.730> out

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
I'm I'm to cut this video and figure out

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.210 
I'm I'm to cut this video and figure out
what's<00:06:28.060> going<00:06:28.120> on<00:06:28.390> here<00:06:28.720> but<00:06:29.100> actually<00:06:30.100> I'm

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:43.409 
err like that so try running it again

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:51.809 
err like that so try running it again
and<00:06:44.970> here<00:06:45.970> we<00:06:46.060> go<00:06:46.180> okay<00:06:47.789> so<00:06:50.189> the<00:06:51.189> sprite<00:06:51.610> kit

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
and here we go okay so the sprite kit

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:54.629 
and here we go okay so the sprite kit
template<00:06:52.270> just<00:06:52.569> creates<00:06:52.960> something<00:06:53.620> this<00:06:54.490> is

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 
template just creates something this is

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.040 
template just creates something this is
something<00:06:54.909> really<00:06:55.060> simple<00:06:55.449> thing<00:06:55.629> hello

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
something really simple thing hello

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.450 
something really simple thing hello
world<00:06:56.319> like<00:06:56.590> this<00:06:56.770> and<00:06:57.009> if<00:06:57.069> you<00:06:57.129> click<00:06:57.250> on<00:06:57.370> the

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460 
world like this and if you click on the

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.129 
world like this and if you click on the
screen<00:06:57.550> it<00:06:57.879> creates<00:06:58.210> this<00:06:58.360> like<00:06:58.539> circling

00:06:59.129 --> 00:06:59.139 
screen it creates this like circling

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:00.809 
screen it creates this like circling
ship<00:06:59.409> we're<00:07:00.159> actually<00:07:00.250> going<00:07:00.460> to<00:07:00.520> delete<00:07:00.759> all

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:00.819 
ship we're actually going to delete all

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:02.909 
ship we're actually going to delete all
the<00:07:01.030> code<00:07:01.270> for<00:07:01.719> all<00:07:01.930> this<00:07:02.139> stuff<00:07:02.289> because<00:07:02.770> we

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 
the code for all this stuff because we

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:05.450 
the code for all this stuff because we
want<00:07:03.189> to<00:07:03.250> replace<00:07:03.669> that<00:07:03.969> with<00:07:04.180> our<00:07:04.419> own<00:07:04.659> game

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 
want to replace that with our own game

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.679 
want to replace that with our own game
so<00:07:06.460> um<00:07:06.639> you<00:07:06.819> can<00:07:06.939> see<00:07:07.060> right<00:07:07.180> here<00:07:07.240> the<00:07:07.539> code

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:07.689 
so um you can see right here the code

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:08.999 
so um you can see right here the code
that's<00:07:07.870> doing<00:07:08.139> this<00:07:08.319> it<00:07:08.500> sets<00:07:08.770> the<00:07:08.830> background

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:09.009 
that's doing this it sets the background

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:12.450 
that's doing this it sets the background
color<00:07:09.490> to<00:07:09.580> this<00:07:09.789> like<00:07:10.150> purplish<00:07:10.659> shade<00:07:10.689> um<00:07:11.460> and

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
color to this like purplish shade um and

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.779 
color to this like purplish shade um and
then<00:07:13.620> right<00:07:14.620> here<00:07:14.860> you<00:07:15.069> can<00:07:15.190> see<00:07:15.340> that<00:07:15.520> it<00:07:15.610> sets

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:15.789 
then right here you can see that it sets

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:18.360 
then right here you can see that it sets
the<00:07:15.849> background<00:07:15.969> color<00:07:16.419> then<00:07:17.319> all<00:07:17.590> this<00:07:18.039> is

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.370 
the background color then all this is

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.309 
the background color then all this is
the<00:07:18.729> code<00:07:18.969> that<00:07:19.000> creates<00:07:19.569> that<00:07:19.690> hello<00:07:19.990> world

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 
the code that creates that hello world

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:23.459 
the code that creates that hello world
label<00:07:20.590> and<00:07:21.009> then<00:07:22.000> this<00:07:22.419> right<00:07:22.629> here<00:07:22.690> is<00:07:23.199> going

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:23.469 
label and then this right here is going

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:28.379 
label and then this right here is going
to<00:07:23.590> be<00:07:23.860> the<00:07:24.250> code<00:07:24.490> that<00:07:24.789> um<00:07:27.000> did<00:07:28.000> like<00:07:28.240> this

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:28.389 
to be the code that um did like this

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:31.170 
to be the code that um did like this
control<00:07:29.349> that<00:07:29.710> control<00:07:30.219> the<00:07:30.340> circling<00:07:30.940> ship

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:31.180 
control that control the circling ship

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.969 
control that control the circling ship
when<00:07:31.360> you<00:07:31.449> clicked<00:07:31.659> on<00:07:31.750> the<00:07:31.870> screen<00:07:32.139> so<00:07:32.949> you

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:32.979 
when you clicked on the screen so you

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:34.409 
when you clicked on the screen so you
can<00:07:33.099> actually<00:07:33.460> delete<00:07:33.759> this<00:07:33.969> right<00:07:34.150> here

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:34.419 
can actually delete this right here

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.659 
can actually delete this right here
we'll<00:07:34.599> get<00:07:34.810> back<00:07:35.020> to<00:07:35.259> the<00:07:36.009> touches<00:07:36.340> began

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:36.669 
we'll get back to the touches began

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:38.369 
we'll get back to the touches began
method<00:07:37.029> because<00:07:37.389> this<00:07:37.509> is<00:07:37.629> a<00:07:37.659> very<00:07:37.930> important

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:38.379 
method because this is a very important

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:40.830 
method because this is a very important
method<00:07:38.529> for<00:07:38.979> sprite<00:07:39.400> kick<00:07:39.580> games<00:07:39.789> for<00:07:40.599> user

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 
method for sprite kick games for user

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.890 
method for sprite kick games for user
interaction<00:07:42.210> you<00:07:43.210> can<00:07:43.240> just<00:07:43.479> delete<00:07:43.629> all<00:07:43.779> that

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:43.900 
interaction you can just delete all that

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.369 
interaction you can just delete all that
and<00:07:44.349> you<00:07:44.830> can<00:07:44.979> delete<00:07:45.300> the<00:07:46.300> label<00:07:46.629> as<00:07:46.779> well<00:07:46.810> so

00:07:47.369 --> 00:07:47.379 
and you can delete the label as well so

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:50.070 
and you can delete the label as well so
now<00:07:47.529> we<00:07:47.590> just<00:07:47.710> have<00:07:47.919> a<00:07:47.949> blank<00:07:48.219> template<00:07:48.610> and<00:07:49.080> we

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080
