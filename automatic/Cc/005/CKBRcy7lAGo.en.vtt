00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:03.179
Hi there, so I just came back from Vidcon
which is like a YouTuber's dream come true,

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.740
and it's also like a shipper's dream come
true cause every YouTuber gets it on.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.599
I'm just kidding, however, there's a lot of
gossip that happens about which YouTubers

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.419
are doing which YouTubers, and I just find
that really weird because I'm now in a position

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.350
where people that I've never met and people
that have never met me are talking about me

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.320
in that way, and that makes me feel really
uncomfortable.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.320
That other people are like: aww man I bet
Evan and that person were like "rayrrrr"

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.050
And I'm like... no???

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.880
Do you even know me?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.880
Wow.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.880
No.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.610
Either way, it got me thinking about other
times when this actually happened for normal

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.610
reasons.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.610
High school.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.610
Gossip happens in high school.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.630
It's high school gossip for a reason.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.640
Don't know why it's happening now.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.640
I'm a lot older than that.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.110
Just had my birthday last week.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.220
Anyway, so in high school, I remember one
of the biggest events in my life was prom.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.680
Why was it the most biggest event?

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.140
Because my parents told me it would be.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.152
Because the media told me it would be.

00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:54.690
Because cartoons and other tv shows told me
that prom was really important.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.223
But when I was 16 I didn't have a girlfriend.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.870
I didn't even know if I was attracted to anyone
at that point.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.040
However someone was like Evan!

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.040
You have to go to prom!

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.360
Even if you go alone!

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.409
You'll find someone there.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.409
So I said, fine.

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.060
If it's such a big deal, I'll go.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.770
So I went to my high school prom.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.110
And if you've never been to a prom in high
school.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.980
If you're not American, if you don't understand
the culture, I'll explain it really quickly.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.780
It happens in a couple different parts.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.780
1.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.780
You rent an overpriced tux.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.180
I don't know why I did that.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.530
Every year I went to prom I rented a tux.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.869
I could've BOUGHT a suit.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.250
However, I wouldn't have fit in it now.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.450
Either way, I could've bought a suit.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.890
So you rent an overpriced tux.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.210
You rent a limo with some friends.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.439
And then you buy the prom ticket and then
you go to prom.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.500
And then that's it!

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.510
Except you feel like you're missing out on
a lot of money.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.510
So you go to prom.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.000
You eat the very nice food in the buffet.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.170
You dance a little.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.170
You eat some more food.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.380
They announce the prom king and queen.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.640
You cry because you're not the prom king or
queen.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.640
Or both.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.640
And then you dance some more.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.049
Do one of those slow dances.

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.170
Chocolate fondue fountain.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.820
And then you head off in a limo back home.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.820
Great!

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.020
Where'd my money go?

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.020
To the prom.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.710
I hope I had a good experience!

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.380
Now how was my experience you might ask?

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.659
It was actually pretty good.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.040
Like I like to make the most of things, so
I go to this prom alone.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.470
I enjoy the amazing food because that's what
I'm really there for.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.689
That punch bowl and those cheetos.

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.640
And the really gourmet like bacon-wrapped
salmon.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.010
So I'm going, and if you've ever been to the
dance floor at a prom or most dance floors,

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.600
they're split up into basically 3 sections.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.050
Ours was a rectangle, and you have the DJ
and the huge speakers pumping out some house

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.330
music at one end, and at that third is the
cool kids.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.930
The cool kids are just dancing.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.480
They're grinding away having their "vertical
sex" as I called it as a naive 16 year old

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.610
who was too afraid of mentioning anything
referring to sex.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.700
Anyway, that's where they would do the do.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.110
And then the middle half was just people kinda
cool, kinda dancing like "yeah I could do

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.170
that if I wanted to, but I'm just here to
have a fun time."

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.860
And then at the last half, the furthest you
can get from the speakers.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.440
There's not that many people, and there's
some people doing some weird dancing.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.360
Ya know, basically you know where I'm gonna
be.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.360
That's where I'm gonna be.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.360
I'm at the end.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.360
I'm doing the sprinkler.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.360
Tellin' the girls "that's what I'm talkin'
about!"

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.370
Doing the shopping cart.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.390
Gonna pick that up, ooo gonna... too many
trans fats.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.390
Gonna put that back.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.390
I'm doing the cool dancing.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.390
Okay?

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.019
And I'm happy dancing with some people I know.

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.650
It's an okay time.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.080
However... which is a word I say a lot in
vlogs.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080
However!

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.400
It's a good transition!

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.819
However, at some point during the night, they
announce the prom king and queen.

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.519
I'm like okay cool.

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.069
Didn't really expect it to be me anyway.

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.060
It was ya know, a quarterback and a cheerleader.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.060
No lie!

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.940
It is very stereotypical (veryotypical).

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.120
So, throughout the night, I'm doing my cool
dancing.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.120
I'm having a nice time with friends.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.560
It doesn't matter that I'm alone because I'm
not really thinking about it.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.910
That's not really on the top of my mind.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.910
But then!

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.910
Out of nowhere.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.769
A hand grabs my arm while I'm mid-sprinkler.

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.239
Okay, I'm doing this...

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.239
Haha!

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.239
Boom!

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.239
What's happening??

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.020
I am now pulled through the dance floor by
this mystery woman.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.880
She turns around and I recognise her.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.840
She's the girl that is in my English class,
and I don't think I've ever even said 1 word

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.840
to her?

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.159
Maybe except..."hey."

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.159
Like that's it.

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.159
That's it.

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.130
But she's pulling me through, and at this
point I have tunnel vision because I have

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.130
no clue what is going on.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.959
I'm saying good bye to my friends as I enter
this new world going through closer and closer

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.710
to the house speakers.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.470
Eventually, we pull through.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.800
I cool guy dance through the dance floor while
holding onto this girl's arm, and we get right

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.030
next to the DJ.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.480
I could fondle his beard if I wanted to.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.480
His shoes were right there.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.700
The speakers are blasting my ears.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.319
I can't hear a thing except for bom ba bom
bom ba bom.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:22.879
And then this girl... she turns around and
sticks her rumplestiltskin on my stiltskin.

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:24.050
It was grind time.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.349
I didn't even bring my pokemon game, but there
was grinding happening.

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.770
The guy next to me, I turn to my right, and
it's Mikey!

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.770
The quarterback!

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.259
And he looks at me like "Yeah!

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.659
Scooter!"
which makes this situation a bit worse because

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.580
my nickname was scooter in high school.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.050
How am I supposed to be the cool kid if my
name is scooter.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.050
So he was like yeah!

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.050
He's looking at me like yeah man!

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.050
You're doin' it!

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.050
And I was like yeah!

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.669
And so I try and blend in, and I'm like immediately
groupthink on.

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.400
I go from this is really awkward to... pssh
yeah... a normal day, man.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.520
I look at him like yeah man.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.520
Yeah this is what's up.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.139
And I start... goin' down.

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.319
I am grinding okay.

00:04:58.319 --> 00:04:59.599
I am like yeah.

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:00.699
This is high school.

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.879
And in my mind there's a billion things happening
every minute, and there's also nothing happening

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.229
because I'm dead inside.

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.680
So I'm going like "yeah uh... gonna keep it
up.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.680
Uh.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.439
This is the beat"
Now most of my body was really excited at

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:15.319
this time because I'm so happy that this is
happening in my life.

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.020
This thing that I was totally against, and
now I'm like yeah I'm totally cool.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.229
Except one part of my body may have been,
a bit more excited than the rest.

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.039
And he definitely wanted to tell everybody
that he was excited.

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.809
That rumpelstiltskin was happening.

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:31.270
So I was like Ahh!

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.270
Whoah!!

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.870
And I continued to dance while also beginning
to realise this dance might get slightly awkward.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.389
So I then in mid-dance, we're like getting
down.

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.060
I'm realising that maybe I should work out
my knees more.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.060
Do some squats.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:52.331
I literally stand up straight from the dance,
lean over into her ear and whisper: Thanks

00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:53.331
for this.

00:05:53.331 --> 00:05:54.439
*laughs*
And then I leave!

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:55.679
And then I leave!

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:56.929
I just walk away!

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:59.860
I shimmied my way back from the cool kid's
dance.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.210
I get some chocolate fondue.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.119
Because that's all that I'm thinkin' of.

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:07.930
I was so, SO... even if that didn't happen
with my John Hancock, even if that wasn't

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:08.930
a thing.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.539
To just... she pulled me, I don't know if
she was interested in me or what that was

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:14.539
about.

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.960
Maybe she felt bad for me and was like let's
just grab this really nerdy kid and pull him

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.210
up and he can be cool and grind with us.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.919
I don't know what was gonna happen there.

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.410
Maybe that could've been a different life
path for me.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.789
However, "Thanks for this" happened.

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:29.469
Thanks for this.

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:33.000
*laughs*
And then, we get in our limo, we go home,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.520
and I tell NO ONE.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.610
I hope she didn't tell anyone, but I've now
told all of you.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.050
I just remembered this incredibly awkward
story while I was in the shower the other

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.849
day, and I felt like sharing it with you.

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:44.629
So, if you wanna say thanks for this, please
be sure to subscribe!

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:46.050
I make new videos every Sunday.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.050
Thank you so much for watching.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.429
If you did like it, give it a like below.

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:50.319
I will see you guys next week.

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.789
Hopefully with another awkward story.

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:56.539
Good bye!

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:05.909
*cue catchy whistling outro*
*swoosh*

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:10.979
*screams outside*
People are being murdered outside my house.

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:12.400
Alright.
*car loudly passes by*

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.400
Thank you car.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.379
It's like you don't car at all!

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:17.860
I'm just trying to film an outro!

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.919
Hello post outro people!

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:21.889
As a reward for watching past the outro here
are some really terrible pictures of me from

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:23.219
prom when I was 16.

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:24.219
Hope you like that.

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:25.219
That's why I was single.

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:26.219
Am I right?

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:28.479
Other than that, I did daily vlog my whole
Vidcon adventure so if you wanna check out

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:30.569
all those videos, I've put them into a playlist
for you!

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:32.889
So click that and hopefully you like it!

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:34.080
Thanks so much for the support!

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.080
I'll see you guys next week.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.210
Good bye.
