here<00:02:44.769> for<00:02:44.950> 18<00:02:45.280> hours<00:02:45.430> so<00:02:47.580> everything<00:02:48.580> looks

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
here for 18 hours so everything looks

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.490 
here for 18 hours so everything looks
like<00:02:48.910> it's<00:02:49.090> still<00:02:49.330> alive<00:02:51.900> they're<00:02:52.900> active<00:02:53.380> and

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
like it's still alive they're active and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.350 
like it's still alive they're active and
moving<00:02:53.709> around<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:54.400> think<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:54.849> can<00:02:55.030> see<00:02:55.269> them

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
moving around I think you can see them

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.589 
moving around I think you can see them
here<00:02:56.099> swimming<00:02:57.099> around<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.390> guess

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
here swimming around so I guess

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.569 
here swimming around so I guess
everything<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.019> okay<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.410> thought<00:03:02.980> they<00:03:03.430> would

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
everything is okay I thought they would

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.460 
everything is okay I thought they would
be<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:04.000> lot<00:03:04.299> warmer<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.599> don't<00:03:08.230> know<00:03:08.290> the

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
be a lot warmer but I don't know the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.839 
be a lot warmer but I don't know the

20<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.150> them<00:03:16.359> in<00:03:16.450> here<00:03:16.569> so<00:03:16.630> I'll<00:03:16.840> do<00:03:16.959> my<00:03:17.109> count

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
20 of them in here so I'll do my count

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.460 
20 of them in here so I'll do my count
and<00:03:17.650> see<00:03:18.370> if<00:03:18.489> I<00:03:18.609> got<00:03:18.819> what<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.720> paid<00:03:19.810> for<00:03:20.230> and

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
and see if I got what I paid for and

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.590 
and see if I got what I paid for and
hopefully<00:03:21.190> everything<00:03:21.730> is<00:03:21.850> alive<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.420> well

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
hopefully everything is alive and well

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.970 
hopefully everything is alive and well
and<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:23.650> don't<00:03:25.230> have<00:03:26.230> any<00:03:26.410> problems<00:03:26.829> they're<00:03:26.950> a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
and I don't have any problems they're a

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.220 
and I don't have any problems they're a
little<00:03:27.160> smaller<00:03:27.459> than<00:03:27.549> I<00:03:27.730> thought<00:03:27.760> they'd<00:03:28.120> be

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
little smaller than I thought they'd be

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.330 
little smaller than I thought they'd be
I'm<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.319> little<00:03:29.530> concerned<00:03:29.709> that<00:03:30.069> they're

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
I'm a little concerned that they're

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.949 
I'm a little concerned that they're
gonna<00:03:30.519> get<00:03:30.700> sucked<00:03:31.480> up<00:03:31.660> into<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:32.609> into<00:03:33.609> that

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
gonna get sucked up into that into that

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.860 
gonna get sucked up into that into that
intake<00:03:34.959> therefore<00:03:35.590> my<00:03:35.680> filter<00:03:36.660> but<00:03:37.660> boy

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
intake therefore my filter but boy

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.479 
intake therefore my filter but boy
they're<00:03:38.079> they're<00:03:38.620> really<00:03:38.829> moving<00:03:38.950> around<00:03:39.280> in

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
they're they're really moving around in

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.699 
they're they're really moving around in
there<00:03:39.609> so<00:03:39.910> that's<00:03:40.630> pretty<00:03:40.870> cool

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
there so that's pretty cool

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.539

I'm<00:03:41.980> excited<00:03:42.340> my<00:03:42.790> first<00:03:43.769> my<00:03:44.769> first<00:03:44.799> live<00:03:45.220> fish

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
I'm excited my first my first live fish

I'm excited my first my first live fish
here<00:03:45.850> live<00:03:47.310> animals<00:03:48.310> here<00:03:48.489> in<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.639> tank<00:03:48.880> and

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
here live animals here in the tank and

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.569 
here live animals here in the tank and
I'll<00:03:49.120> see<00:03:49.299> how<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.480> goes<00:03:50.100> let<00:03:51.100> them<00:03:51.190> warm<00:03:51.370> up

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
I'll see how it goes let them warm up

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.949 
I'll see how it goes let them warm up
here<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.000> I'll<00:03:52.560> update<00:03:53.560> later<00:03:53.680> on

now okay mission accomplished with the

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.020 
now okay mission accomplished with the
phase<00:04:00.260> one<00:04:00.590> of<00:04:00.620> introducing<00:04:01.609> these<00:04:01.730> fish<00:04:02.000> to

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
phase one of introducing these fish to

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.459 
phase one of introducing these fish to
early<00:04:02.569> shrimp<00:04:02.989> my<00:04:03.230> aquarium<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:05.290> don't<00:04:06.290> know<00:04:06.379> if

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:06.469 
early shrimp my aquarium I don't know if

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:10.259 
early shrimp my aquarium I don't know if
you<00:04:06.590> guys<00:04:06.709> can<00:04:06.950> count<00:04:07.689> better<00:04:08.689> than<00:04:08.900> I<00:04:08.989> can<00:04:09.049> but

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
you guys can count better than I can but

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.849 
you guys can count better than I can but
there<00:04:11.269> should<00:04:11.450> be<00:04:11.480> an<00:04:11.659> 18<00:04:12.079> in<00:04:12.230> there<00:04:12.349> I<00:04:12.379> think<00:04:12.469> I

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
there should be an 18 in there I think I

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.449 
there should be an 18 in there I think I
was<00:04:13.040> short<00:04:13.340> one<00:04:14.109> shrimp<00:04:15.109> in<00:04:15.379> one<00:04:16.130> of<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.280> bags

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
was short one shrimp in one of the bags

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.960 
was short one shrimp in one of the bags
and<00:04:17.350> another<00:04:18.350> one<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:18.829> think<00:04:19.039> became<00:04:19.340> lunch<00:04:19.639> for

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
and another one I think became lunch for

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.670 
and another one I think became lunch for
the<00:04:20.419> rest<00:04:20.600> of<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.810> shrimp<00:04:21.049> so<00:04:21.229> I<00:04:21.259> should<00:04:21.470> have

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
the rest of the shrimp so I should have

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.800 
the rest of the shrimp so I should have
18<00:04:22.190> shrimp<00:04:22.639> in<00:04:22.789> total<00:04:25.300> double<00:04:26.300> check<00:04:26.479> my<00:04:26.600> math

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
18 shrimp in total double check my math

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.310 
18 shrimp in total double check my math
if<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.139> can<00:04:27.490> my<00:04:28.490> eyes<00:04:28.720> have<00:04:29.720> gone<00:04:29.930> cross

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
if you can my eyes have gone cross

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.129 
if you can my eyes have gone cross
trying<00:04:30.680> to<00:04:30.770> count<00:04:30.949> these<00:04:31.130> things<00:04:31.370> so<00:04:32.139> I'm

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
trying to count these things so I'm

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.570 
trying to count these things so I'm
going<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.770> introduce<00:04:34.400> some<00:04:34.580> water<00:04:34.940> into<00:04:35.240> these

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
going to introduce some water into these

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.510 
going to introduce some water into these
here<00:04:37.580> to<00:04:38.240> see<00:04:38.449> if<00:04:38.710> see<00:04:39.710> if<00:04:39.740> I<00:04:39.889> can't<00:04:40.099> acclimate

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
here to see if see if I can't acclimate

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.249 
here to see if see if I can't acclimate
them<00:04:40.639> a<00:04:40.669> little<00:04:40.849> bit<00:04:40.970> more<00:04:41.000> before<00:04:41.539> I<00:04:41.570> dump

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
them a little bit more before I dump

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.230 
them a little bit more before I dump
them<00:04:42.440> in<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.620> net<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:42.979> then<00:04:43.310> into<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:44.060> tank

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
them in the net and then into the tank

00:04:44.240 --> 00:05:10.629 
them in the net and then into the tank
so<00:04:44.750> here<00:04:45.380> we<00:04:45.470> go
