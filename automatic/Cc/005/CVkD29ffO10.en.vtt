00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
it's going to format the drive that's

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.070 
it's going to format the drive that's
the<00:01:26.670> second<00:01:27.060> stage<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.360> preparing<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> drive

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
up into virtual drives formatting it's

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.200 
up into virtual drives formatting it's
like<00:01:34.590> writing<00:01:34.890> lines<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> pad<00:01:35.909> it's

like writing lines on a pad it's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.030
