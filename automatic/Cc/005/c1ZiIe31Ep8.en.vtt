00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
is the ghetto wiring job that I do

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.280 
is the ghetto wiring job that I do
basically<00:00:38.129> we<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:38.640> here<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.480> female<00:00:39.629> end<00:00:39.930> to

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
basically we have here the female end to

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.569 
basically we have here the female end to
the<00:00:40.379> tip<00:00:40.559> sensor<00:00:41.059> right<00:00:42.059> here<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:43.399> you<00:00:44.399> have

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the tip sensor right here and you have

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.650 
the tip sensor right here and you have
the<00:00:44.850> harness<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:46.289> i<00:00:46.950> spliced<00:00:47.489> into<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the harness that i spliced into the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.340 
the harness that i spliced into the
other<00:00:48.870> end<00:00:49.110> which<00:00:49.739> goes<00:00:49.950> down<00:00:50.160> here<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:51.350> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
other end which goes down here to the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.459 
other end which goes down here to the
actual<00:00:53.219> map<00:00:53.489> sensor<00:00:53.940> what<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.170> I

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
actual map sensor what I like to do I

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.830 
actual map sensor what I like to do I
just<00:00:55.949> put<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.370> there<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.820> right<00:00:56.940> now<00:00:57.000> what

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
just put it on there for right now what

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.389 
just put it on there for right now what
I<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.559> get<00:00:59.039> a<00:01:01.129> flat<00:01:02.129> screwdriver

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
I like to do is get a flat screwdriver

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.280 
I like to do is get a flat screwdriver
push<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:03.840> tight<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.229> can

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
push it on there as tight as you can

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.990 
push it on there as tight as you can
just<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.369> make<00:01:05.519> sure<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> good

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
just to make sure you have a good

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.810 
just to make sure you have a good
connection<00:01:07.220> if<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.340> don't<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> good

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
connection if you don't have a good

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.300 
connection if you don't have a good
connection<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.750> will<00:01:09.990> obviously<00:01:10.560> throw<00:01:11.040> a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
connection you will obviously throw a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.980 
connection you will obviously throw a
couple<00:01:11.520> codes<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:13.890> know<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.850> love<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
couple codes and we all know we love the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.289 
couple codes and we all know we love the
dreaded<00:01:16.259> codes<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:17.759> what<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> went<00:01:18.119> ahead<00:01:18.180> and

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
dreaded codes so what I went ahead and

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.950 
dreaded codes so what I went ahead and
did<00:01:19.159> went<00:01:20.159> ahead<00:01:20.250> put<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.790> there<00:01:21.030> we're

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
did went ahead put that in there we're

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.929 
did went ahead put that in there we're
on<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> other<00:01:22.290> end<00:01:22.530> which<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.369> pretty<00:01:23.820> much

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
on the other end which is pretty much

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.210 
on the other end which is pretty much
the<00:01:24.119> same<00:01:24.270> thing<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:25.500> ran<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.740> down<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.920> between

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the same thing we ran it down in between

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.410 
the same thing we ran it down in between
the<00:01:27.110> coolant<00:01:28.110> pipe<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.150> down<00:01:30.150> by<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the coolant pipe and down by the

sure it's on nice and tight make sure

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.000 
sure it's on nice and tight make sure
you<00:03:01.650> wiggle<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:06.530> ensure<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.620> got<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.830> good

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
you wiggle it ensure you got a good

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.220 
you wiggle it ensure you got a good
connection<00:03:10.850> take<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.000> other<00:03:12.150> end<00:03:12.239> which<00:03:12.989> is

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
connection take the other end which is

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.570 
connection take the other end which is
the<00:03:13.590> female<00:03:14.190> end<00:03:15.140> plug<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:17.000> into<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:20.430> other

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
the female end plug that into the other

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:29.630 
the female end plug that into the other
end<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:20.940> harness<00:03:28.130> make<00:03:29.130> sure<00:03:29.310> that's<00:03:29.430> all

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
end of the harness make sure that's all

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.509 
end of the harness make sure that's all
nice<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.120> tight<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:33.769> then<00:03:34.769> basically<00:03:35.130> with

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
nice and tight and then basically with

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.780 
nice and tight and then basically with
the<00:03:35.550> excess<00:03:35.970> wire<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:37.140> can<00:03:37.440> zip<00:03:38.190> tie<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.489> to

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
the excess wire you can zip tie it to

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.140 
the excess wire you can zip tie it to
whatever<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.690> deem<00:03:40.130> be<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.160> good<00:03:41.370> spot<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.640> zip

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
whatever you deem be a good spot to zip

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.900 
whatever you deem be a good spot to zip
tie<00:03:43.160> and<00:03:46.100> like<00:03:47.100> I<00:03:47.220> said<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.550> can<00:03:47.580> basically

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
tie and like I said you can basically

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.690 
tie and like I said you can basically
have<00:03:48.600> enough<00:03:49.080> slack<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:49.380> mount<00:03:50.100> it<00:03:50.310> somewhere

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
have enough slack to mount it somewhere

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.280 
have enough slack to mount it somewhere
up<00:03:50.850> in<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.090> engine<00:03:51.269> bay<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:53.840> keep<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:54.989> from

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
up in the engine bay to keep it from

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.380 
up in the engine bay to keep it from
just<00:03:55.860> kind<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.070> hang<00:03:56.579> in<00:03:56.730> there<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.060> wobbling

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
just kind of hang in there and wobbling

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.090 
just kind of hang in there and wobbling
around<00:03:58.100> so<00:03:59.100> what<00:03:59.430> we'll<00:03:59.579> do<00:03:59.700> next<00:03:59.880> is<00:04:00.299> go<00:04:01.260> in

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
around so what we'll do next is go in

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:12.420 
around so what we'll do next is go in
and<00:04:02.660> see<00:04:03.660> if<00:04:03.690> we<00:04:04.110> get<00:04:04.260> any<00:04:04.730> cells

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.250 

now<00:04:13.450> you<00:04:14.450> want<00:04:14.629> the<00:04:14.719> key<00:04:14.870> in<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.079> on<00:04:15.230> position

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
now you want the key in the on position

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.570 
now you want the key in the on position
but<00:04:16.039> the<00:04:16.130> engine<00:04:16.459> not<00:04:16.639> running<00:04:21.370> gave<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:22.520> a

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
but the engine not running gave it a

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.370 
but the engine not running gave it a
quick<00:04:22.729> minute<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.240> see<00:04:23.660> see<00:04:24.470> if<00:04:24.560> these<00:04:24.680> go<00:04:24.949> out

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
quick minute to see see if these go out

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.480 
quick minute to see see if these go out
cannot<00:04:27.380> remember<00:04:27.500> off<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.770> top<00:04:27.889> my<00:04:28.070> head<00:04:28.250> if

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
cannot remember off the top my head if

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:35.310 
cannot remember off the top my head if
they<00:04:28.580> go<00:04:28.729> out<00:04:28.880> or<00:04:29.030> not<00:04:33.699> okay<00:04:34.699> that<00:04:34.910> went<00:04:35.090> out

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
they go out or not okay that went out

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.730 
they go out or not okay that went out
and<00:04:36.320> obviously<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.889> check<00:04:37.070> engine<00:04:37.220> light<00:04:37.550> is

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
and obviously the check engine light is

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.810 
and obviously the check engine light is
still<00:04:39.740> on<00:04:39.800> due<00:04:40.669> to<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.360> engine<00:04:41.960> not<00:04:42.080> running<00:04:42.110> I

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
still on due to the engine not running I

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
still on due to the engine not running I
normally<00:04:43.820> check<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:44.090> because<00:04:44.449> i<00:04:44.539> have<00:04:44.690> my

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
normally check this because i have my

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.790 
normally check this because i have my
own<00:04:45.759> code<00:04:46.759> scanner<00:04:47.199> just<00:04:48.199> to<00:04:48.320> hit<00:04:48.440> the<00:04:48.530> button

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
own code scanner just to hit the button

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.860 
own code scanner just to hit the button
and<00:04:48.979> c0<00:04:49.669> codes<00:04:49.970> so<00:04:50.360> what<00:04:50.479> i'll<00:04:50.570> go<00:04:50.690> ahead<00:04:50.720> and

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
and c0 codes so what i'll go ahead and

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.430 
and c0 codes so what i'll go ahead and
do<00:04:51.020> is<00:04:52.810> if<00:04:53.810> you<00:04:53.930> hear<00:04:54.050> my<00:04:54.110> dog<00:04:54.169> in<00:04:54.410> the

the<00:04:58.400> car<00:04:58.580> make<00:04:59.000> sure<00:04:59.030> it's<00:04:59.300> a<00:04:59.330> neutral<00:04:59.750> ebrake

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
the car make sure it's a neutral ebrake

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.850 
the car make sure it's a neutral ebrake
on<00:05:00.520> let's<00:05:01.520> start<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:02.030> car

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:15.890 

and<00:05:05.860> look<00:05:06.820> at<00:05:06.940> that<00:05:09.840> no<00:05:10.840> check<00:05:11.560> engine<00:05:11.770> light

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.000 

well<00:05:16.900> there<00:05:17.080> you<00:05:17.110> know<00:05:17.470> you<00:05:17.530> have<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:17.800> good

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
well there you know you have a good

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.640 
well there you know you have a good
connection

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.159 

and<00:05:22.100> then<00:05:22.220> obviously<00:05:22.570> with<00:05:23.570> the<00:05:23.600> directions

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
and then obviously with the directions

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.520 
and then obviously with the directions
of<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:24.530> PTP<00:05:24.889> map<00:05:25.310> clamp<00:05:25.780> it<00:05:26.780> tells<00:05:27.199> you<00:05:27.350> how<00:05:27.470> to

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
of the PTP map clamp it tells you how to

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.790 
of the PTP map clamp it tells you how to
tune<00:05:27.800> it<00:05:28.030> the<00:05:29.320> bolts<00:05:31.509> I<00:05:32.530> think<00:05:33.530> that's<00:05:33.710> just

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
tune it the bolts I think that's just

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.060 
tune it the bolts I think that's just
about<00:05:34.039> it<00:05:35.350> basically<00:05:36.350> what<00:05:36.530> you'll<00:05:36.680> do<00:05:36.800> like<00:05:36.979> I

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
about it basically what you'll do like I

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.129 
about it basically what you'll do like I
said<00:05:37.310> is<00:05:37.430> mount<00:05:37.759> the

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.860 

the<00:05:40.710> clamp<00:05:41.219> anywhere<00:05:41.729> that<00:05:41.879> you<00:05:41.909> really<00:05:42.240> want

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
the clamp anywhere that you really want

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.790 
the clamp anywhere that you really want
to<00:05:42.930> put<00:05:43.139> it

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
to put it

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.460 
to put it
and<00:05:45.330> then<00:05:46.330> put<00:05:46.810> everything<00:05:47.020> back<00:05:47.289> together

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
and then put everything back together

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.659 
and then put everything back together
and<00:05:50.400> I<00:05:51.400> hope<00:05:51.580> this<00:05:51.699> is<00:05:51.849> a<00:05:51.879> good<00:05:51.940> enough<00:05:52.470> how-to

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
and I hope this is a good enough how-to

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.330 
and I hope this is a good enough how-to
