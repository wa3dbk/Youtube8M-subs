how can an interview we tell if the
interview<00:02:48.819> went<00:02:49.000> well<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.450> think<00:02:50.260> if<00:02:50.530> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
interview went well I think if the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.259 
interview went well I think if the
person<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:51.040> really<00:02:51.280> relaxed<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.060> you're

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
person is really relaxed and you're

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.550 
person is really relaxed and you're
having<00:02:52.420> just<00:02:52.629> you<00:02:52.870> know<00:02:52.989> more<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.500> a

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.259 
conversation than like question answer
question<00:02:55.870> answer<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:57.190> think<00:02:57.760> that's<00:02:58.030> how<00:02:58.209> you

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
question answer I think that's how you

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.750 
question answer I think that's how you
can<00:02:58.480> tell<00:02:58.629> it's<00:02:58.780> going<00:02:58.930> well<00:02:59.430> some<00:03:00.430> people<00:03:00.579> are

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
can tell it's going well some people are

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.990 
can tell it's going well some people are
very<00:03:01.379> nervous<00:03:02.379> and<00:03:02.739> tense<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.310> then<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.670> it

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
very nervous and tense and then it it

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.960 
very nervous and tense and then it it
gets<00:03:04.329> kind<00:03:04.569> of<00:03:04.629> awkward<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:05.319> if<00:03:05.620> if<00:03:06.579> someone's

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
gets kind of awkward so if if someone's

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.210 
gets kind of awkward so if if someone's
relaxed<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:08.319> can<00:03:08.349> tell<00:03:08.650> they're<00:03:08.799> being<00:03:08.950> just

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
relaxed you can tell they're being just

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.030 
relaxed you can tell they're being just
truthful<00:03:09.660> conversation<00:03:10.660> coming<00:03:11.049> off<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.859> top

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
truthful conversation coming off the top

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.949 
truthful conversation coming off the top
that's<00:03:12.400> good<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.700> if<00:03:15.700> they<00:03:15.940> ask<00:03:16.120> questions<00:03:16.450> at

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
that's good and if they ask questions at

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.470 
that's good and if they ask questions at
the<00:03:17.079> end<00:03:17.230> that's<00:03:17.590> always<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.980> plus<00:03:18.239> if<00:03:19.239> they

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480
