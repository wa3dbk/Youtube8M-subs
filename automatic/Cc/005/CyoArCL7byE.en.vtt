this would be covered in clay and the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.860 
this would be covered in clay and the
molding<00:01:14.070> process<00:01:14.100> tends<00:01:14.940> to<00:01:15.210> affect<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
original because the sheer force you

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.190 
original because the sheer force you
know<00:01:17.790> physically<00:01:18.300> ripping<00:01:18.690> it<00:01:18.810> off<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.080> the

know physically ripping it off of the
original<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.800> plastiline<00:01:20.310> clay<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:20.820> rip

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
original that plastiline clay will rip

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.170 
original that plastiline clay will rip
some<00:01:21.690> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.870> foam<00:01:22.080> will<00:01:22.290> tear<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.180> Paul

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
some of the foam will tear and Paul

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.450 
some of the foam will tear and Paul
really<00:01:25.140> likes<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.530> effect<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.310> has<00:01:26.430> on

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
really likes that effect that it has on

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.040 
really likes that effect that it has on
the<00:01:26.700> sculpture<00:01:27.120> and<00:01:27.210> he<00:01:27.270> kind<00:01:27.480> of<00:01:27.510> works<00:01:27.780> with

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
the sculpture and he kind of works with

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.220 
the sculpture and he kind of works with
it<00:01:28.260> and<00:01:29.090> he<00:01:30.090> kind<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.330> pushes<00:01:30.660> it<00:01:30.780> even<00:01:30.990> further

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
it and he kind of pushes it even further

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.710 
it and he kind of pushes it even further
in<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.190> way<00:01:32.340> he's<00:01:32.730> always<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.210> adding<00:01:33.570> more

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
in a way he's always kind of adding more

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.140 
in a way he's always kind of adding more
and<00:01:33.870> more<00:01:34.050> and<00:01:34.260> it<00:01:35.100> seems<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.940> never

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and more and it seems it's it's never

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:45.380 
and more and it seems it's it's never
big<00:01:36.360> enough

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.880 

like<00:01:46.390> I'm<00:01:46.540> really<00:01:46.840> interested<00:01:47.110> like<00:01:47.649> where

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
like I'm really interested like where

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.999 
like I'm really interested like where
the<00:01:48.520> moles<00:01:48.820> goes<00:01:49.780> around<00:01:50.200> something<00:01:50.590> then<00:01:50.890> you

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
the moles goes around something then you

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.100 
the moles goes around something then you
pull<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.640> mold<00:01:51.909> off<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:53.020> then<00:01:53.290> it<00:01:53.439> just

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
pull the mold off and then it just

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.490 
pull the mold off and then it just
begins<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.270> by<00:01:57.270> pulling<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.810> mold<00:01:58.050> off<00:01:58.260> here

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
begins to by pulling the mold off here

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.240 
begins to by pulling the mold off here
you're<00:01:59.070> affecting<00:01:59.730> the<00:01:59.910> object<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.250> it's

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
you're affecting the object and it's

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.940 
you're affecting the object and it's
sculpting<00:02:03.060> again<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.870> so<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.560> sculpture

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
sculpting again and so this sculpture

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.160 
sculpting again and so this sculpture
has<00:02:05.040> been<00:02:05.250> worked<00:02:06.180> on<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.390> worked<00:02:06.690> on<00:02:06.870> for

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
has been worked on and worked on for

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.859 
has been worked on and worked on for
probably<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:08.039> couple<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.429> years<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.970> he's

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
probably a couple of years and he's

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.170 
probably a couple of years and he's
continuing<00:02:10.320> to<00:02:10.410> work<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:12.030> will

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
continuing to work on it and it will

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.550 
continuing to work on it and it will
probably<00:02:12.630> involve<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.110> chair<00:02:13.320> being

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
probably involve the chair being

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.960 
probably involve the chair being
strapped<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.160> top<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.640> when<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.850> is

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
strapped to the top of it when it is

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:30.020 
strapped to the top of it when it is
finally<00:02:15.330> installed<00:02:21.800> inverted<00:02:22.800> chair<00:02:29.030> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
finally installed inverted chair the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.660 
finally installed inverted chair the
legs<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.630> stick<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.350> he's<00:02:32.190> been<00:02:32.459> talking

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
legs of stick and he's been talking

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.850 
legs of stick and he's been talking
about<00:02:33.120> applying<00:02:33.480> more<00:02:33.720> fibreglass<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.350> also

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
about applying more fibreglass and also

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.940 
about applying more fibreglass and also
ripping<00:02:35.250> out<00:02:35.340> its<00:02:35.520> guts<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.720> already<00:02:37.410> with

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
ripping out its guts and already with

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.690 
ripping out its guts and already with
you<00:02:38.400> know<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:40.200> weight<00:02:40.410> how<00:02:40.890> precarious<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.610> is

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
you know the weight how precarious it is

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.340 
you know the weight how precarious it is
on<00:02:41.850> top<00:02:42.090> with<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.360> armature<00:02:42.630> it's<00:02:42.959> gonna<00:02:43.140> be

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
on top with the armature it's gonna be

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.210 
on top with the armature it's gonna be
kind<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.709> interesting<00:02:44.190> how<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:46.709> turns<00:02:47.040> out

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
kind of interesting how that turns out

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.040 
kind of interesting how that turns out
you<00:02:47.730> know<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.270> really<00:02:48.360> an<00:02:48.690> organic

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
you know and it's really an organic

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.560 
you know and it's really an organic
process<00:02:49.260> for<00:02:49.709> him<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.489> I've<00:02:50.640> witnessed<00:02:51.030> I

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
process for him that I've witnessed I

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.820 
process for him that I've witnessed I
keep<00:02:52.500> letting<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:54.320> process<00:02:56.360> in<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.570> way

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
keep letting this process in a way

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.620 
keep letting this process in a way
a<00:02:59.150> classical<00:03:00.150> process<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:01.050> sculpture<00:03:01.860> play
