00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:15.500
 hello my love yes it's time again 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:20.599
 to model and your gameplay is yes with 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.880
 he passed through the c64 and then I got myself 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.019
 I also think of everyone 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.390
 third person I have to go there 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.699
 thought what could be the ever so 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.640
 moths yes to classical one can have yes 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.930
 some at home and I have in 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.610
 background already the whole time one 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:41.149
 music that someone has recognized and 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.120
 Although has block 2 on the mega 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.390
 drive and drive in mega drive already 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.520
 murdered and that's where we start 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:55.489
 just only once a beautiful picture and 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.469
 while over comes cable 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.489
 we're doing the same motti here 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:04.940
 the c64 he looks so a mega drive 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.960
 from them we are doing there, so to speak 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.490
 the same mods as the two c64 years 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.490
 far from our three cables 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.130
 name the av occupancy I show you 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.160
 right on the mega drive on the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.650
 mega drive itself I have it all 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.150
 Soldered what you need I can 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.520
 already tell you and one 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.470
 soldering iron not much skill that 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.810
 Solder that it is actually quite easy 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.570
 again, what else do you need? 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.570
 turned off, yes, nonsense 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:46.620
 By the way penis i have nonsense me 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.240
 ordered extra cable very fine cable 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.640
 Of course we also need one 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.000
 Soldering a screwdriver around the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.080
 also to make mega drive 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.770
 yes and I have ordered extra now 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.900
 Such connections in white in yellow in red 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.820
 I fetched some of them because of me 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.740
 I have other projects where I am a woman 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.510
 as key to want to do because you 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.970
 knows yes this problem with the whole 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:16.950
 old things that same as the c64 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.720
 he yes that you then suddenly the 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.860
 channel can not adjust should 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.050
 you do not want the antenna cable 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.760
 I connect everywhere with me 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.230
 These connections now because then 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.880
 is that just a cable that lies there 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.250
 you can choose any console I want 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.530
 This is followed by a huge advantage 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.180
 Okay, let's take a look at the mega 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.850
 drive which I soldered inside the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.709
 so have my love i bet now 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.110
 just before you know that you have a console 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.590
 I can screw that apart 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.700
 not show here in detail 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.650
 always unscrew it 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.860
 just unscrew all screws but 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.530
 are you in there like that and then we have 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.110
 stop here for a guide and see 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.510
 the pin assignment that's the mega drive 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.360
 place now just once flipped 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.060
 here are the connections for the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.140
 controller that's her right to its 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.100
 go to the other end 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.850
 in the ideal case, you have that way too 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.519
 Capacitor is that I believe 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.010
 well, that's not how it should be 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.410
 necessarily look at you that's just 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.269
 different from megatrucks omega-3 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.670
 sometimes as you can see on the picture 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.290
 for example, this is not yes and we are 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.310
 have here 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.959
 Lego is almost the bottom of these 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.659
 stupid connection because the soul 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.739
 has come up with and the pin is reviving 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:37.620
 as follows then we need the 4 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.750
 this is the complete video that is 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.959
 the yellow connection of the three connections 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.540
 and we need stereo he fetches that are 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.680
 here the nine and eight 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.810
 and they are also arranged on the 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.030
 board as you can see here then 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.829
 I soldered this as well 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.269
 I have the oranges in caracas myself 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.799
 injured animal we get the reason 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:01.470
 her in ground the earth that it directly 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:05.099
 next to all these connections then is 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:09.689
 the next cable is here, so to speak 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:13.709
 it video then here are the two stereo 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:17.269
 we solder the left and the right the whole 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:21.479
 of course, to our beautiful connections 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.410
 and if ordered very important 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.810
 here 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.849
 hereof the signal in and ground 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.400
 or earth comes then this 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.139
 outboard pin and you have to do it now 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.840
 do a thing you do not want there 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.430
 33 more cables from the earth 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.470
 pull out then just do it now 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.530
 again to one of the connections to it 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:45.389
 and from there it just bridges that 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.740
 continue to the other connections that 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.080
 it's enough you do not have to 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.370
 if you have your own cable for everyone 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.500
 you've done that, you're still looking for each other 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.500
 a nice place in your mega drive 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.380
 a nice place in your mega drive 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.990
 where you wanted to attach the connections 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.300
 the best with adhesive film 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.889
 fix as well as the solder joints 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.570
 you have seen now even if the 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.310
 glue pistol is best to go over it 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.590
 So that's not where your contact 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.440
 and then yes, your mega drive 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.740
 fashion already finished so easy 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.840
 it is a console but something further in 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.310
 direction to bring new 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.099
 yes I hope that has you again 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.849
 because it is a short guide 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:31.200
 I set a referencing to the image 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.980
 still below the video you can 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:38.670
 then look 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:40.620
 and also to a yes to one I can 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.850
 yes say to conrad electronics as can 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.250
 For example, it is very good for 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.210
 order things 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.710
 then you can do it all 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.540
 Looking for what you need when you are together 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.920
 ask what have ordered the best 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.050
 should then just write me 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.670
 once but did not please the 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.930
 Write comments in the comments 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.520
 I can not keep up afterwards 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.780
 meanwhile there are so many comments 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.850
 if you have a personal message 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.940
 write about youtube or mine 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.620
 facebook-side gameplay 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.790
 I answer in any case but 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.040
 Comments I will not come back 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.670
 after that, that's just okay 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.660
 do it for a minute yes ok otherwise wish 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.880
 Have a wonderful morning 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:21.390
 good evening good players with you 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:23.520
 its like stay tuned your gameplay like that 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.990
 again a little tip on the edge 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.660
 I 've put it back together now 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:31.050
 and left at the side is actually 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.850
 optimal to bring on the whole because 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.420
 you as much space also says inward 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.370
 purely 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.830
 you just have to be careful that the cables 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:42.240
 well laid those are not with the 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:45.800
 module subsequently gets wedged or 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.690
 but so you can fix that well 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.630
 just such a small one's tip at the end 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:55.320
 ok so and now again a small picture 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:59.390
 sample stop connected 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.390
 I already know today to be over 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:06.310
 but the picture is not sharp 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:11.050
 do not strip anything 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:13.330
 the sound is great so you can really 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.060
 do not complain if you still mega drive 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.980
 in why you fly that makes it on 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:21.540
 every case qualitatively also a mega 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:24.540
 improvement to normal 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.540
 antenna cable
