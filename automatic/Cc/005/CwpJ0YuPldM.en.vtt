behind is behind it so so here's the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.550 
behind is behind it so so here's the
epiglottis<00:00:14.089> the<00:00:15.089> epiglottis<00:00:15.480> when<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.170> closes

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
epiglottis the epiglottis when it closes

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.670 
epiglottis the epiglottis when it closes
this<00:00:17.490> area<00:00:18.000> right<00:00:18.210> behind<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.710> glottis

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
this area right behind it is the glottis

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:39.190 
this area right behind it is the glottis
the<00:00:28.099> not<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.160> great<00:00:29.369> picture<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.970> here<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.730> then

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.040 

what's<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:41.000> there's<00:00:42.000> one<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
what's that there's one out of the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.139 
what's that there's one out of the
bucket<00:00:43.350> over<00:00:43.410> there<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.890> bit<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> other

bucket over there a bit on the other

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.979 
bucket over there a bit on the other
side<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:47.329> sink<00:00:48.329> there's<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> bucket<00:00:48.809> on

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
side of the sink there's a bucket on

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.330 
side of the sink there's a bucket on
should<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.410> bucket<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.860> floor<00:00:50.129> with<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
should be a bucket on the floor with a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.549 
should be a bucket on the floor with a
minute

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.619 

so<00:00:59.160> here's<00:00:59.789> your<00:00:59.879> question<00:01:00.300> here's<00:01:00.480> your

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
so here's your question here's your

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.430 
so here's your question here's your
trachea<00:01:01.309> esophagus<00:01:02.309> behind<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:06.440> area

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
trachea esophagus behind it the area

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.990 
trachea esophagus behind it the area
right<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:08.430> where<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.450> vocal<00:01:09.780> cords<00:01:10.140> are

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
right in here where the vocal cords are

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.649 
right in here where the vocal cords are
this<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.210> your<00:01:12.240> larynx<00:01:14.479> okay

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
this is your larynx okay

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.899 
this is your larynx okay
so<00:01:16.200> sound<00:01:16.470> productions<00:01:17.009> houses<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.550> true<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
so sound productions houses the true and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.840 
so sound productions houses the true and
false<00:01:18.090> vocal<00:01:18.300> cords<00:01:18.869> vocal<00:01:19.740> cords<00:01:20.220> false

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
false vocal cords vocal cords false

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.310 
false vocal cords vocal cords false
vocal<00:01:21.030> cords<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.250> epiglottis<00:01:23.250> glottis<00:01:24.320> this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
vocal cords so epiglottis glottis this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.389 
vocal cords so epiglottis glottis this
area<00:01:25.649> is<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> larynx<00:01:27.530> with<00:01:28.530> trachea<00:01:29.009> has<00:01:29.220> that

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
area is the larynx with trachea has that

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.680 
area is the larynx with trachea has that
you<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.580> see<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> rate<00:01:29.940> that<00:01:30.180> rings<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
you can see the rate that rings of the

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.650 
you can see the rate that rings of the
trachea<00:01:31.520> which<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.149> that<00:01:33.330> has

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
trachea which one is the one that has

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.070 
trachea which one is the one that has
the<00:01:33.690> strength<00:01:34.259> when<00:01:34.619> when<00:01:35.160> you<00:01:35.340> look<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.640> me

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
the strength when when you look at me

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.469 
the strength when when you look at me
that's<00:01:37.080> your<00:01:37.229> trachea<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:38.000> trachea<00:01:39.000> what

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
that's your trachea the trachea what

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.940 
that's your trachea the trachea what
you're<00:01:39.630> seeing<00:01:39.869> see<00:01:40.080> these<00:01:40.229> Carla<00:01:40.590> beef<00:01:40.770> with

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
you're seeing see these Carla beef with

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.830 
you're seeing see these Carla beef with
reams<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.280> cartilage<00:01:41.640> that's<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.570> thing<00:01:42.750> in

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
reams of cartilage that's your thing in

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840 
reams of cartilage that's your thing in
the<00:01:42.899> Tracy<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.319> soft<00:01:43.590> esophagus<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.429> the<00:01:44.580> smooth

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the Tracy a soft esophagus is the smooth

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:54.889 
the Tracy a soft esophagus is the smooth
muscle<00:01:52.729> that's<00:01:53.729> why<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.300> your

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
muscle that's why you have your

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.779 
muscle that's why you have your
epiglottis<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.649> epiglottis<00:01:56.039> can<00:01:56.460> close<00:01:56.759> your

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
epiglottis the epiglottis can close your

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.590 
epiglottis the epiglottis can close your
trachea<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:58.319> you<00:01:58.409> swallow<00:01:58.740> two<00:01:59.250> goes

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
trachea so when you swallow two goes

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.940 
trachea so when you swallow two goes
down<00:02:00.600> there<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.050> food<00:02:01.200> goes<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.649> way<00:02:01.890> you

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
down there and food goes this way you

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.200 
down there and food goes this way you
get<00:02:02.220> hind<00:02:02.460> legs<00:02:02.640> right

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
get hind legs right

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:14.980 
get hind legs right
okay<00:02:12.819> it's<00:02:13.819> on<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.030> handout<00:02:14.390> it's<00:02:14.569> fair<00:02:14.959> game

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
okay it's on the handout it's fair game

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.880 
okay it's on the handout it's fair game
right<00:02:16.330> go<00:02:17.330> through<00:02:17.569> these<00:02:17.690> what's<00:02:18.470> up<00:02:18.620> can<00:02:18.860> we
