00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:10.349
 Good day to everyone, I want to show the principle 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.809
 opening the trunk on daos lanos in 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.100
 There are a lot of videos on the Internet, but everything is like 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:22.170
 I do not know, so I suffered terribly 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:26.599
 will be helpful my video more here 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:31.590
 It means that you make sure that 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:36.260
 there is no one in the trunk that opens on 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:41.580
 alarm press the button channel 3 and 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:43.980
 the trunk opens successfully here 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.280
 naturally waiting for us a surprise after 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.850
 the work done here means what 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.200
 the system is installed i have it father 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.320
 dots and spring as shown on others 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.180
 videos they have either spring or 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.140
 shock absorbers and everything is just fine 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:08.780
 rises but I could achieve it 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:12.150
 just installing both means 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.680
 retro castle stands here in this hole here 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:22.380
 there you are far away I can again 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:24.270
 push you see movement stuff 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.620
 it is very difficult for this to unscrew 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.159
 compliance this plastic mask 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.640
 and the castle itself then more or less through 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.110
 hole 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.510
 it will turn out here that is where 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.560
 fastened a man here to respectively to 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.400
 torsion she so here is attached here in 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.400
 this place is attached 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:55.570
 so here it all looks here we show 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.880
 now closes with such an effort 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:08.210
 strong that 's what stayed the same 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:15.310
 open key function and just the same i 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:15.310
 I can open from the salon 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.560
 so here it looks I do not remember 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.140
 said no even on the main road 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:34.040
 even on my old sharif button 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.040
 member 3 opens the trunk 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.330
