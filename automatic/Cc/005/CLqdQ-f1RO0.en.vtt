I'm going to make a bunny ear then I'm
going<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.930> take<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.500> loop<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.100> put<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.910> under

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
going to take this loop and put it under

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.840 
going to take this loop and put it under
this<00:00:46.170> piece<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:47.059> just<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.270> this

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
this piece right here just like this

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.840 
this piece right here just like this
once<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.239> under<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:53.070> string<00:00:53.640> I'm

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
once I have it under the string I'm

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.600 
once I have it under the string I'm
holding<00:00:54.300> with<00:00:54.570> my<00:00:54.780> other<00:00:54.989> foot<00:00:55.350> I'm<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.520> to

holding with my other foot I'm going to
go<00:00:56.730> back<00:00:57.000> through<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.570> hole<00:00:57.899> right<00:00:58.410> here

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
go back through this hole right here

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.060 
go back through this hole right here
just<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:01.710> then<00:01:02.100> pull<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.550> tight

just like this and then pull it tight
after<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.610> loop<00:01:05.850> I'm<00:01:06.180> going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.720> take

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
after I have one loop I'm going to take

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.270 
after I have one loop I'm going to take
my<00:01:07.200> loose<00:01:07.500> string<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:09.380> I'm<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.890> circle

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
my loose string and I'm going to circle

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.240 
my loose string and I'm going to circle
around<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:12.000> loop<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.450> I've<00:01:12.570> already<00:01:12.990> made

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
around the loop that I've already made

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.730 
around the loop that I've already made
so<00:01:14.250> I'm<00:01:14.430> going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.760> take<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> loose<00:01:15.240> string

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
so I'm going to take the loose string

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.620 
so I'm going to take the loose string
makes<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.950> second<00:01:17.460> bunny<00:01:17.610> ear<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.330> then<00:01:18.479> go

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
makes a second bunny ear and then go

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.859 
makes a second bunny ear and then go
around<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.259> first<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.390> hole

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
around the first one and then this hole

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.170 
around the first one and then this hole
right<00:01:22.140> here<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.250> created<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.939> run

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
right here so I created when I run

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.929 
right here so I created when I run
around<00:01:24.299> I'm<00:01:25.080> going<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.380> take<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.770> right<00:01:26.520> back

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
around I'm going to take this right back

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.999 
around I'm going to take this right back
through<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:28.400> like<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.470> then<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.740> can

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
through it just like this and then I can

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.580 
through it just like this and then I can
tighten<00:01:32.340> up<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.909> knot<00:01:33.060> using<00:01:33.750> one<00:01:34.140> hand<00:01:34.170> to

tighten up the knot using one hand to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.910 
tighten up the knot using one hand to
create<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.610> normal-looking<00:01:36.119> bow<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.590> only

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.780 

okay<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:47.080> start<00:01:47.320> from<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.590> beginning<00:01:47.790> let's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
okay to start from the beginning let's

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.270 
okay to start from the beginning let's
start<00:01:48.940> with<00:01:49.060> my<00:01:49.180> shoe<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.540> tied<00:01:49.770> across<00:01:50.770> one

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
start with my shoe and tied across one

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
leg over the other and go underneath and

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.700 
leg over the other and go underneath and
then<00:01:57.190> I<00:01:57.220> pull<00:01:57.460> it<00:01:57.580> tight<00:01:57.790> and<00:01:58.320> then<00:01:59.320> I<00:01:59.500> use<00:01:59.680> my

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
then I pull it tight and then I use my

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.450 
then I pull it tight and then I use my
other<00:01:59.860> foot<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:01.320> hold<00:02:02.320> this<00:02:02.530> string<00:02:02.830> down<00:02:03.010> and

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
over here and then I go under and then I

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.890 
over here and then I go under and then I
go<00:02:17.470> back<00:02:17.500> through<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.220> loop<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:19.480> create<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
go back through this loop to create the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.990 
go back through this loop to create the
first<00:02:21.150> part<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.300> my<00:02:22.510> shoe<00:02:22.690> time<00:02:22.950> then<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.280> get

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
first part of my shoe time then I get

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.020 
first part of my shoe time then I get
the<00:02:25.150> other<00:02:25.330> one<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.950> make<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.190> second<00:02:27.850> bunny

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
the other one and make a second bunny

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.729 
the other one and make a second bunny
ear<00:02:28.950> just<00:02:29.950> like<00:02:30.100> this<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.900> then<00:02:32.230> I'm<00:02:32.500> going<00:02:32.650> to

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
ear just like this and then I'm going to

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.970 
ear just like this and then I'm going to
go<00:02:32.860> around<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.400> first<00:02:33.610> one<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:33.820> made<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.890> then

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
go around the first one I made and then

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.320 
go around the first one I made and then
back<00:02:36.220> through<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.910> hole<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.890> then<00:02:39.330> just

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
back through the hole and then just

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.590 
back through the hole and then just
tighten<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.870> up<00:02:41.019> using<00:02:41.650> one<00:02:42.010> hand<00:02:44.940> set<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.090> one

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
tighten it up using one hand set on one

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.110 
tighten it up using one hand set on one
hand<00:02:46.840> at<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.080> time
