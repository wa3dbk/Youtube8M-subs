one of the odd things about anime is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.730 
one of the odd things about anime is
that<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:29.490> will<00:01:29.670> get<00:01:30.500> overlap<00:01:31.500> from<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> bangs

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
that you will get overlap from the bangs

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.039 
that you will get overlap from the bangs
that<00:01:34.740> are<00:01:34.860> very<00:01:35.009> commonly<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.850> said<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that are very commonly as I said in the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.190 
that are very commonly as I said in the
face

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
face

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.710 
face
and<00:01:38.400> they<00:01:39.400> will<00:01:39.909> get<00:01:39.970> overlap<00:01:40.330> between<00:01:40.450> that

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
and they will get overlap between that

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.190 
and they will get overlap between that
in<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.930> eyes<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:41.440> eyebrows<00:01:42.690> now<00:01:43.690> these<00:01:43.870> side
