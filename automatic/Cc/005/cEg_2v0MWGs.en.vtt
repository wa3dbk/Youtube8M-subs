00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.040
G'day. I'm Matt Cornell from Cornell
Engineers.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.040
Today I'm answering a question about slab heave.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.500
Before a house is built
on a site

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.340
soil moisture conditions are fairly uniform across the site.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.000
That changes when a house is built.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.480
The uniform soil moisture conditions are interrupted by the house.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.740
Slab heave occurs in clay soils

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.260
when the soil moisture conditions under the house are no longer uniform.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.840
When the soil around the outside of the house becomes wet the

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.780
clay soils absorb moisture and expand.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.560
The expansive forces are large enough to lift a house.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.240
Under the house stays relatively dry.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.520
There is a transition zone

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.200
between the wet and dry soils

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.800
as soil moisture transfers sideways.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.060
When the soil around the outside of the house becomes dry

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.160
the clay soils release moisture and shrink.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.640
The ground surface
moves down

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.680
and the soil under the house

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.280
is relatively wetter compared to the dry
soils around the outside of the house.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.900
Again there's the transition zone
between dry soils and wetter soils as

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.060
moisture transitions from under the
house towards the dry zone.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.560
Soil moisture conditions aren't only affected by changing seasons.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.620
Other sources of soil moisture changes are garden irrigation,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:02:03.000
broken pipes, poor drainage and tree
roots.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.920
This has been Matt Cornell from

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.200
Cornell Engineers talking about slab
heave.
