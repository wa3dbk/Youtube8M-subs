00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.070
 certainly today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.390
 new tutorial to crack windows 8 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.460
 so since the king methods they 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.920
 walk more well yeah that methods 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.900
 had been long awaited apparently 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.820
 so sorry for the delay so there I 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.289
 removed my I uninstalled my cd key 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.760
 so we can see that it was raining guy 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.050
 reactive and so the drass of 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.159
 notification they ask me to 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.749
 activated here and not available so 

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:36.370
 it's pretty simple again 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:38.109
 you will download this on the link I 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.479
 will put in the inscription you see 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.289
 already downloaded a cup at the office you 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:42.729
 run it that rights 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.019
 of administrator so there you will be 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.019
 videos are not showing but me 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.579
 appears to patrol 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:52.420
 so you 've been resting that you're going 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:57.280
 click on the small windows logo you 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.449
 wait a little bit here is there 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.239
 you have you see windows 8 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:10.330
 you are going to do active z wrongly you 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:12.930
 go wait so there you already see 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.930
 that it's gone 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.410
 so we come back and ask him 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.070
 so here if you click on computer 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:27.310
 right and and we 've already forgotten that the 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.720
 libya product was put and so where 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:35.550
 alex has expired so not on the 11th of april 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.550
 2015 '2014 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.230
 finally rather a guy what I say so 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.450
 here you see that yes you have left 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.590
 basically here is me though six months more 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.210
 late 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.710
 and so down there in six months by a 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.219
 leave to redo the method and that's it 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.369
 it's very simple it's not more 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.899
 simple moncla weeks both are gone 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.030
 started hooper will not be restrictive and 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.460
 so that's if it's a pretty good guy 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.380
 simple and very fast who will be what 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.380
 debate now here it is
