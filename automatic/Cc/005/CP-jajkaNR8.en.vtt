00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.020 
it in one hour so as as it says it's 0.6
so<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.180> just<00:02:40.450> come<00:02:40.599> down<00:02:40.629> 2.6<00:02:41.409> old<00:02:42.030> start

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
so you just come down 2.6 old start

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.509 
so you just come down 2.6 old start
button<00:02:44.129> and<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:47.290> charges<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.769> same<00:02:48.220> thing

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
button and it charges it same thing

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.119 
button and it charges it same thing
which<00:02:49.390> was<00:02:49.569> the<00:02:49.659> voltage<00:02:50.019> what<00:02:51.010> you're

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
which was the voltage what you're

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.569 
which was the voltage what you're
charging<00:02:51.609> at<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.709> amount<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:54.069> milliamps

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
charging at the the amount of milliamps

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.099 
charging at the the amount of milliamps
that<00:02:54.639> are<00:02:54.849> being<00:02:55.060> put<00:02:55.299> into<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.690> battery<00:02:55.810> in

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
minutes as just the counter so you it

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.069 
minutes as just the counter so you it
just<00:03:02.560> times<00:03:03.159> it<00:03:03.430> for<00:03:03.609> you<00:03:03.730> so<00:03:04.420> if<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.870> want<00:03:05.019> to

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
just times it for you so if you want to

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.920 
just times it for you so if you want to
cancel<00:03:05.260> out<00:03:05.440> of<00:03:05.500> that<00:03:06.389> now<00:03:07.389> if<00:03:07.540> we<00:03:07.720> come<00:03:07.900> over

each list has the same options to charge
discharge<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.540> then<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:54.400> can't<00:03:54.730> you

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
discharge and then to you can't you

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.990 
discharge and then to you can't you
can't<00:03:55.359> do<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.510> lipo<00:03:55.900> consecutively<00:03:56.590> with<00:03:57.129> the

cycle of battery just the night heads

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.780 
cycle of battery just the night heads
and<00:04:01.659> the<00:04:01.780> nickel<00:04:02.319> metal<00:04:02.349> hydrides<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.609> come

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
and the nickel metal hydrides to come

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.809 
and the nickel metal hydrides to come
across<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.419> then<00:04:04.510> we've<00:04:04.629> got<00:04:04.720> PB<00:04:04.989> and<00:04:05.819> then

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
across and then we've got PB and then

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.479 
across and then we've got PB and then
we're<00:04:06.940> back<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.120> night<00:04:07.419> cap<00:04:07.659> so<00:04:08.650> if<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.190> wanted

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
we're back to night cap so if I wanted

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.539 
we're back to night cap so if I wanted
to<00:04:09.549> cycle<00:04:10.359> this<00:04:10.480> battery<00:04:10.900> this<00:04:11.409> charger<00:04:12.370> has<00:04:12.519> a

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
to cycle this battery this charger has a

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.899 
to cycle this battery this charger has a
little<00:04:12.909> a<00:04:13.090> neat<00:04:13.329> feature<00:04:13.599> I<00:04:14.129> just<00:04:15.129> come<00:04:15.879> down

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
little a neat feature I just come down

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.509 
little a neat feature I just come down
to<00:04:16.180> discharge<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:17.049> charge<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.829> discharge

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
to discharge the charge and discharge

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.089 
to discharge the charge and discharge
now<00:04:18.909> this<00:04:19.060> battery<00:04:19.419> is<00:04:19.539> pretty<00:04:19.930> much<00:04:20.109> depleted

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
now this battery is pretty much depleted

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.159 
now this battery is pretty much depleted
so<00:04:21.340> I<00:04:21.579> would<00:04:22.060> like<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.300> charge<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:22.690> first<00:04:22.930> and

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
so I would like to charge it first and

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.969 
so I would like to charge it first and
then<00:04:23.680> to<00:04:23.919> discharge<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.940> cycle<00:04:25.330> so<00:04:26.169> you<00:04:26.710> hit

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
then to discharge the cycle so you hit

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.320 
then to discharge the cycle so you hit
start<00:04:27.310> once

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
start once

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.240 
start once
this<00:04:29.139> one<00:04:29.319> starts<00:04:29.560> blinking<00:04:29.680> this<00:04:29.979> is<00:04:30.129> how

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
this one starts blinking this is how

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.610 
this one starts blinking this is how
much<00:04:30.370> you<00:04:30.550> want<00:04:30.729> to<00:04:30.849> charge<00:04:31.060> at<00:04:31.389> so<00:04:31.720> I'm<00:04:32.409> going

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
much you want to charge at so I'm going

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.510 
much you want to charge at so I'm going
to<00:04:32.680> charge<00:04:32.919> that<00:04:33.069> point<00:04:33.340> six<00:04:33.580> for<00:04:33.789> an<00:04:33.879> hour<00:04:34.199> and

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
to charge that point six for an hour and

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.170 
to charge that point six for an hour and
then<00:04:36.520> to<00:04:36.849> discharge<00:04:38.280> if<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.460> wanted<00:04:39.789> to<00:04:39.879> do<00:04:40.030> it

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
then to discharge if I wanted to do it

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.779 
then to discharge if I wanted to do it
in<00:04:40.300> one<00:04:40.629> hour<00:04:40.659> just<00:04:41.169> bring<00:04:41.889> it<00:04:41.979> down<00:04:42.009> to<00:04:42.280> 0.6

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
in one hour just bring it down to 0.6

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.010 
in one hour just bring it down to 0.6
and<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.389> know<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:44.759> you<00:04:45.759> come<00:04:45.939> across<00:04:46.060> then<00:04:46.900> we

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
and you know and you come across then we

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.339 
and you know and you come across then we
have<00:04:47.169> a<00:04:47.219> 5x<00:04:48.219> here<00:04:48.490> that's<00:04:48.699> five<00:04:48.969> times<00:04:49.349> so

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
have a 5x here that's five times so

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.629 
have a 5x here that's five times so
basically<00:04:51.250> this<00:04:52.150> charger<00:04:52.569> can<00:04:53.009> charge<00:04:54.009> and<00:04:54.370> D

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
basically this charger can charge and D

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.820 
basically this charger can charge and D
charge<00:04:54.909> the<00:04:55.060> battery<00:04:55.419> cycle<00:04:56.349> it<00:04:56.469> and<00:04:56.620> five

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
charge the battery cycle it and five

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.409 
charge the battery cycle it and five
times<00:04:57.099> consecutively<00:04:57.639> and<00:04:58.090> you<00:04:58.180> wouldn't

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
times consecutively and you wouldn't

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.749 
times consecutively and you wouldn't
have<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:58.629> do<00:04:58.810> a<00:04:58.840> thing<00:04:59.110> so<00:04:59.919> you<00:05:00.189> just<00:05:00.370> hold<00:05:00.550> it

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
have to do a thing so you just hold it

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.320 
have to do a thing so you just hold it
like<00:05:00.789> that<00:05:00.909> and<00:05:01.419> it<00:05:01.990> checks<00:05:02.169> your<00:05:02.319> battery<00:05:03.330> and

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
like that and it checks your battery and

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.100 
like that and it checks your battery and
you<00:05:05.050> can<00:05:05.169> see<00:05:05.409> here<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:06.490> C<00:05:06.759> is<00:05:06.969> blinking<00:05:07.419> that

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
you can see here the C is blinking that

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.709 
you can see here the C is blinking that
means<00:05:08.289> it's<00:05:08.469> charging<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:09.129> the<00:05:09.580> arrow<00:05:09.789> to<00:05:10.180> D

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:10.719 
means it's charging and the arrow to D

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.080 
means it's charging and the arrow to D
which<00:05:11.110> would<00:05:11.500> be<00:05:11.650> D<00:05:11.830> charge<00:05:12.129> so<00:05:12.759> once<00:05:12.969> this

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
which would be D charge so once this

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.499 
which would be D charge so once this
battery<00:05:13.770> once<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:14.919> charger<00:05:15.389> charges<00:05:16.389> the

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
battery once the charger charges the

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.439 
battery once the charger charges the
battery<00:05:17.099> to<00:05:18.099> its<00:05:18.219> full<00:05:18.430> capacity<00:05:18.460> usually

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
battery to its full capacity usually

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.180 
battery to its full capacity usually
it's<00:05:19.659> within<00:05:20.080> ten<00:05:20.440> percent<00:05:20.919> of<00:05:21.750> its<00:05:23.190> its

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
it's within ten percent of its its

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.300 
it's within ten percent of its its
capacity<00:05:24.849> which<00:05:24.969> is<00:05:25.000> six<00:05:25.300> hundred<00:05:25.439> so<00:05:26.439> you

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
capacity which is six hundred so you

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.939 
capacity which is six hundred so you
just<00:05:27.490> leave<00:05:28.060> her<00:05:28.210> alone<00:05:28.270> and<00:05:28.810> let<00:05:29.680> it<00:05:29.710> do<00:05:29.919> its

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
just leave her alone and let it do its

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:33.240 
just leave her alone and let it do its
thing<00:05:30.129> and<00:05:30.689> you'll<00:05:31.689> see<00:05:32.020> then<00:05:32.919> it'll

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
thing and you'll see then it'll

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.010 
thing and you'll see then it'll
automatically<00:05:33.789> start<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.150> D<00:05:34.389> charge<00:05:34.629> and

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
automatically start the D charge and

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.510 
automatically start the D charge and
it'll<00:05:35.379> drain<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.830> battery<00:05:36.340> back<00:05:36.699> down<00:05:37.000> and

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
it'll drain the battery back down and

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.040 
it'll drain the battery back down and
again<00:05:39.520> it<00:05:39.789> will<00:05:39.879> charge<00:05:40.180> it<00:05:40.419> it'll<00:05:40.779> do<00:05:40.900> that

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
again it will charge it it'll do that

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.769 
again it will charge it it'll do that
