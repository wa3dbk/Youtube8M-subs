you wire this thing up gps module in the
front<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.780> actually<00:00:34.110> works<00:00:34.290> great<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
front it actually works great with the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.069 
front it actually works great with the
multi<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.940> um<00:00:37.790> software<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.000> GUI<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.899> can

with the wires facing this way just

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.750 
with the wires facing this way just
because<00:00:47.489> i<00:00:48.950> didn't<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.070> enough<00:00:50.309> room

all programmed in so let's see Oh with
my<00:01:17.429> firmware<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:18.090> arm<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.509> motors<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.289> have

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
my firmware to arm the motors you have

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:35.100 
my firmware to arm the motors you have
to<00:01:19.619> hold<00:01:21.020> this<00:01:23.060> now<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.119> should<00:01:24.329> be<00:01:24.420> armed

alright everything seems to be working
fine<00:02:21.500> another<00:02:21.980> GPS<00:02:22.370> is<00:02:22.549> working<00:02:22.579> fine<00:02:22.969> I<00:02:23.030> got

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
fine another GPS is working fine I got

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.839 
fine another GPS is working fine I got
uh<00:02:24.159> everything's<00:02:25.159> good<00:02:25.370> tell<00:02:25.579> me<00:02:25.670> what<00:02:25.760> you

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
guys think ended up mounting the multi

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.740 
guys think ended up mounting the multi
way<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:30.500> point<00:02:30.709> aboard<00:02:31.040> on<00:02:31.189> these<00:02:31.370> foam<00:02:31.760> little

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
way to point aboard on these foam little

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.619 
way to point aboard on these foam little
pads<00:02:32.930> but<00:02:33.200> then<00:02:33.349> I<00:02:33.439> use<00:02:33.590> some<00:02:33.769> hot<00:02:33.920> glue<00:02:34.629> right

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
pads but then I use some hot glue right

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.920 
pads but then I use some hot glue right
here<00:02:36.230> if<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.769> see<00:02:37.569> instead<00:02:38.569> of<00:02:38.719> using<00:02:38.870> the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
here if you see instead of using the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.379 
here if you see instead of using the
screw<00:02:39.349> because<00:02:39.709> i<00:02:39.829> mounted<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.389> power

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
screw because i mounted the power

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.990 
screw because i mounted the power
distribution<00:02:41.719> board<00:02:42.109> in<00:02:42.200> between<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.819> put<00:02:43.819> hot

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
distribution board in between I put hot

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.500 
distribution board in between I put hot
glue<00:02:45.189> on<00:02:46.189> this<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.609> this<00:02:46.790> hole<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.269> it<00:02:47.359> goes

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
glue on this in this hole and it goes

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.099 
glue on this in this hole and it goes
down<00:02:47.689> to<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.959> UH<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:49.000> nylon<00:02:50.000> nut<00:02:50.599> there<00:02:50.900> and
