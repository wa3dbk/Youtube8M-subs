00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
doing a 7 pool so let's first talk about

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.349 
doing a 7 pool so let's first talk about
the<00:00:27.390> matchup<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.650> technically<00:00:29.130> possible

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
the matchup it is technically possible

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.060 
the matchup it is technically possible
to<00:00:30.359> do<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.840> surf<00:00:31.080> vs<00:00:31.349> protoss<00:00:31.590> as<00:00:31.800> well<00:00:31.980> in

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
to do it in surf vs protoss as well in

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.220 
to do it in surf vs protoss as well in
the<00:00:32.219> desert<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:32.610> dessert<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.630> general<00:00:33.840> I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the desert for dessert but in general I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.049 
the desert for dessert but in general I
would<00:00:34.260> advise<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.950> mostly<00:00:35.430> do<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.880> zerg

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
would advise you to mostly do it in zerg

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.959 
would advise you to mostly do it in zerg
vs<00:00:36.390> protoss<00:00:36.690> just<00:00:37.380> because<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.250> lot

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
vs protoss just because it's a lot

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.459 
vs protoss just because it's a lot
stronger<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:39.660> actually<00:00:39.809> give<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.290> some

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
stronger and can actually give you some

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.440 
stronger and can actually give you some
easy<00:00:40.680> wins<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.910> Cirque<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.270> need<00:00:42.420> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
easy wins it for the Cirque you need a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.450 
easy wins it for the Cirque you need a
lot<00:00:42.690> more<00:00:42.750> luck<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.739> know<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.010> surfaces

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
lot more luck and you know in surfaces

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.979 
lot more luck and you know in surfaces
products<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.879> basically<00:00:45.300> always<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.960> a

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
products you basically always have a

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.709 
products you basically always have a
chance<00:00:46.820> doesn't<00:00:47.820> really<00:00:47.910> depend<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.539> what

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
chance doesn't really depend on what

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.930 
chance doesn't really depend on what
your<00:00:48.899> opponent<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.410> doing<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:49.800> first<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.820> all

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
your opponent is doing but first of all

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.869 
your opponent is doing but first of all
before<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.420> actually<00:00:51.600> go<00:00:51.930> into<00:00:52.140> details<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.340> want

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
before I actually go into details I want

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.340 
before I actually go into details I want
to<00:00:53.969> let<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.270> know<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.930> not<00:00:55.110> like

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
to let you know that I do not like

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.500 
to let you know that I do not like
cheese<00:00:55.680> strategies<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.460> even<00:00:57.059> though<00:00:57.329> this

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
cheese strategies and even though this

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.029 
cheese strategies and even though this
is<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> seven<00:00:58.140> pool<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.559> technically

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
is a seven pool and it's technically

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
is a seven pool and it's technically
considered<00:00:59.280> cheese<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.149> do<00:01:00.780> actually<00:01:01.109> not

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
considered cheese I do actually not

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.139 
considered cheese I do actually not
enjoy<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.100> don't<00:01:02.520> think<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:02.879> really

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
enjoy it I I don't think it's really

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.969 
enjoy it I I don't think it's really
good<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.350> something<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.949> you

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
good to do but it's something that you

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.890 
good to do but it's something that you
have<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.790> your<00:01:05.939> arsenal<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.630> build

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
have to have in your arsenal of build

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.660 
have to have in your arsenal of build
orders<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.619> important<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.070> for

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
orders it's really important that for

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.620 
orders it's really important that for
example<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:09.119> you're<00:01:09.270> playing<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
example if you're playing a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.960 
example if you're playing a
best-of-three<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.409> all<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.159> sudden<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.580> map

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
best-of-three and all of a sudden a map

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.640 
best-of-three and all of a sudden a map
like<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.210> while<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.689> discuss<00:01:12.990> maps<00:01:13.380> after

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
like this while we discuss maps after

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.399 
like this while we discuss maps after
this<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:15.180> map<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:16.080> seven

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
this but if a map that you can seven

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.899 
this but if a map that you can seven
pull<00:01:16.560> up<00:01:16.710> all<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.130> sudden<00:01:17.400> pops<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
pull up all of a sudden pops up and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.490 
pull up all of a sudden pops up and
you're<00:01:18.060> playing<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.450> best-of-five<00:01:18.840> well<00:01:19.320> if

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
you're playing a best-of-five well if

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.950 
you're playing a best-of-five well if
you<00:01:20.130> are<00:01:20.250> doing<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:21.150> macro<00:01:21.540> games<00:01:21.750> and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
you are doing like for macro games and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.539 
you are doing like for macro games and
you<00:01:22.020> throw<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.409> one<00:01:22.619> cheese<00:01:22.920> game<00:01:23.159> or<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.400> do

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
you throw in one cheese game or you do

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.090 
you throw in one cheese game or you do
like<00:01:24.060> 22<00:01:24.900> macro<00:01:25.259> games<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.650> don't<00:01:25.740> throw<00:01:25.979> in

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
like 22 macro games that don't throw in

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.370 
like 22 macro games that don't throw in
one<00:01:26.280> cheese<00:01:26.520> game<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.720> important<00:01:28.200> and

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
one cheese game that is so important and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.810 
one cheese game that is so important and
at<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.680> point<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.009> time<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.340> actually<00:01:29.520> have

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
at that point in time you actually have

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.950 
at that point in time you actually have
to<00:01:29.939> know<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.240> you're<00:01:30.270> doing<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.810> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
to know what you're doing you have to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.810 
to know what you're doing you have to
practice<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:32.100> actually<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.610> to

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
practice it and you actually have to

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.200 
practice it and you actually have to
know<00:01:33.659> how<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.619> properly<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.939> course

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
know how to do it properly and of course

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.240 
know how to do it properly and of course
even<00:01:36.479> though<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.990> relatively<00:01:37.470> easy<00:01:37.890> build

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
even though it's a relatively easy build

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.830 
even though it's a relatively easy build
order<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.729> there's<00:01:38.939> not<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.240> much<00:01:39.390> thought<00:01:39.630> as

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
order and there's not as much thought as

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.899 
order and there's not as much thought as
for<00:01:40.110> example<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.590> 30-minute<00:01:41.220> long<00:01:41.340> macro<00:01:41.729> game

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
for example a 30-minute long macro game

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.880 
for example a 30-minute long macro game
it's<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.570> important<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.380> know<00:01:43.590> what

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
it's so important that you know what

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.190 
it's so important that you know what
you're<00:01:44.070> doing<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:45.329> another<00:01:45.540> important<00:01:46.079> thing

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you're doing so another important thing

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.480 
you're doing so another important thing
that<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.619> keep<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.040> mind<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.399> that

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
that you have to keep in mind is that

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.240 
that you have to keep in mind is that
it's<00:01:47.909> really<00:01:48.659> important<00:01:49.259> what<00:01:49.500> map<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.100> are

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
it's really important what map you are

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.249 
it's really important what map you are
going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:50.759> your<00:01:50.939> cheese<00:01:51.180> build<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.570> so

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
going to do your cheese build on so

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.810 
going to do your cheese build on so
that's<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> few<00:01:52.860> maps<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.369> would<00:01:53.579> really

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
that's a few maps that I would really

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.490 
that's a few maps that I would really
advise<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.479> do<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.990> surface<00:01:55.200> as

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
advise you to do it on a surface as

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.920 
advise you to do it on a surface as
problems<00:01:55.860> especially<00:01:56.040> Oh<00:01:56.520> Hannah<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> great

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
problems especially Oh Hannah is a great

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.510 
problems especially Oh Hannah is a great
map<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.290> map<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.860> are<00:01:59.009> watching<00:01:59.219> a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
map the map that we are watching a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.520 
map the map that we are watching a
replay<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.880> today<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.079> are<00:02:01.110> going<00:02:01.380> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
replay of today and that we are going to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.429 
replay of today and that we are going to
watch<00:02:01.710> shortly<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.430> i<00:02:03.000> also<00:02:03.299> find<00:02:03.750> cloud<00:02:04.170> king

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
watch shortly and i also find cloud king

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.530 
watch shortly and i also find cloud king
and<00:02:04.619> we're<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.070> really<00:02:05.250> good<00:02:05.520> map<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.450> do

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and we're really a really good map to do

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.169 
and we're really a really good map to do
a<00:02:06.570> seven<00:02:06.990> pull<00:02:07.200> off<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:07.640> mainly<00:02:08.640> because<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.940> lot

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
a seven pull off on mainly because a lot

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.639 
a seven pull off on mainly because a lot
of<00:02:09.209> produce<00:02:09.450> players<00:02:09.780> will<00:02:09.989> get<00:02:10.170> greedy<00:02:10.440> and

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
of produce players will get greedy and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.120 
of produce players will get greedy and
go<00:02:11.160> for<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> nexus<00:02:11.790> first<00:02:12.030> right<00:02:12.270> away<00:02:12.540> or

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
go for a nexus first right away or

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.300 
go for a nexus first right away or
go<00:02:13.280> for<00:02:13.520> like<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.850> pilum<00:02:14.840> den<00:02:15.320> forged<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.010> scout

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
go for like a pilum den forged and scout

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.180 
go for like a pilum den forged and scout
or<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:17.090> just<00:02:17.300> scout<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.690> just<00:02:18.500> just<00:02:18.860> too<00:02:19.010> late

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
or that just scout it just just too late

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.220 
or that just scout it just just too late
and<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.760> just<00:02:20.000> works<00:02:20.270> really<00:02:20.510> efficiently<00:02:21.050> on

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
and it just works really efficiently on

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.650 
and it just works really efficiently on
a<00:02:21.260> two<00:02:21.500> player<00:02:21.710> map<00:02:21.980> that's<00:02:22.490> relatively<00:02:23.210> small

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
a two player map that's relatively small

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.660 
a two player map that's relatively small
ish<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:25.700> let's<00:02:26.120> just<00:02:26.180> start<00:02:26.630> off<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.840> game

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
ish so let's just start off the game

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.010 
ish so let's just start off the game
there<00:02:28.670> we<00:02:28.760> go<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.060> going<00:02:29.270> to<00:02:29.360> be<00:02:29.480> me<00:02:29.690> spawning

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
there we go it's going to be me spawning

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.630 
there we go it's going to be me spawning
as<00:02:30.260> to-read<00:02:30.590> serkan<00:02:31.070> a<00:02:31.130> bottom<00:02:31.430> right<00:02:31.610> corner

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
as to-read serkan a bottom right corner

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.150 
as to-read serkan a bottom right corner
of<00:02:32.240> our<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:32.960> my<00:02:33.140> opponent<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.680> going<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:34.010> be

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
of our and I my opponent is going to be

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.490 
of our and I my opponent is going to be
the<00:02:35.000> blue<00:02:35.210> produce<00:02:35.690> in<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.020> top<00:02:36.200> left<00:02:36.440> corner

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
the blue produce in the top left corner

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.890 
the blue produce in the top left corner
so<00:02:36.830> once<00:02:37.010> again<00:02:37.130> you<00:02:37.490> will<00:02:38.090> not<00:02:38.150> gain<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.570> lot<00:02:38.780> of

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
so once again you will not gain a lot of

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.630 
so once again you will not gain a lot of
respective<00:02:39.470> increase<00:02:39.800> bills<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.220> just<00:02:40.460> think

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
respective increase bills I just think

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.950 
respective increase bills I just think
it's<00:02:40.820> really<00:02:40.940> important<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.540> have<00:02:41.660> at<00:02:41.900> least

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
it's really important to have at least

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.260 
it's really important to have at least
one<00:02:42.800> cheese<00:02:43.280> built<00:02:43.520> in<00:02:43.670> your<00:02:43.850> arsenal<00:02:44.120> of

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
one cheese built in your arsenal of

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.170 
one cheese built in your arsenal of
builds<00:02:44.860> maybe<00:02:45.860> even<00:02:45.950> some<00:02:46.430> more<00:02:46.640> maybe<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.970> no

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
builds maybe even some more maybe a no

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.390 
builds maybe even some more maybe a no
end<00:02:47.390> with<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.570> lot<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.840> circlings<00:02:48.470> in<00:02:48.710> surfaces

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
end with a lot of circlings in surfaces

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.540 
end with a lot of circlings in surfaces
or<00:02:49.550> I<00:02:50.480> don't<00:02:50.870> know<00:02:51.050> really<00:02:51.290> just<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.190> roach

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
or I don't know really just a roach

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.550 
or I don't know really just a roach
busting<00:02:53.120> surfaces<00:02:53.600> produce<00:02:53.900> anything<00:02:54.200> just

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
busting surfaces produce anything just

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.770 
busting surfaces produce anything just
any<00:02:55.100> kind<00:02:55.370> of<00:02:55.550> cheese<00:02:55.790> will<00:02:56.210> actually<00:02:56.630> make

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
any kind of cheese will actually make

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.350 
any kind of cheese will actually make
your<00:02:56.960> overall<00:02:57.440> plan<00:02:57.770> or<00:02:58.010> your<00:02:58.430> overall<00:02:58.850> game<00:02:59.180> a

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
your overall plan or your overall game a

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.270 
your overall plan or your overall game a
lot<00:02:59.600> lot<00:02:59.840> stronger<00:03:00.050> and<00:03:00.320> it's<00:03:00.770> actually

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
lot lot stronger and it's actually

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.070 
lot lot stronger and it's actually
really<00:03:01.520> viable<00:03:01.850> it's<00:03:02.210> not<00:03:02.420> actually<00:03:02.840> annoying

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
really viable it's not actually annoying

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.770 
really viable it's not actually annoying
especially<00:03:04.010> in<00:03:04.760> zerg<00:03:05.000> vs<00:03:05.270> products<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:05.660> can

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
especially in zerg vs products you can

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.170 
especially in zerg vs products you can
easily<00:03:06.110> macro<00:03:06.680> out<00:03:06.830> of<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.100> so<00:03:07.280> we're<00:03:07.820> going<00:03:08.030> to

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
easily macro out of it so we're going to

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.110 
easily macro out of it so we're going to
open<00:03:08.300> up<00:03:08.510> with<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.750> seven<00:03:09.230> pool<00:03:09.440> right<00:03:09.710> here<00:03:10.120> and

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
open up with a seven pool right here and

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.900 
open up with a seven pool right here and
he<00:03:11.960> is<00:03:11.990> going<00:03:12.530> for<00:03:12.650> a<00:03:12.860> pretty<00:03:13.220> standard<00:03:13.670> play

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
he is going for a pretty standard play

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.120 
he is going for a pretty standard play
he<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:14.720> going<00:03:14.810> for<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.320> most<00:03:15.590> risk<00:03:15.920> free

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
he is going for the most risk free

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.790 
he is going for the most risk free
strategy<00:03:16.970> that<00:03:17.510> that<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.050> can<00:03:18.200> possibly<00:03:18.380> do

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
strategy that that you can possibly do

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.460 
strategy that that you can possibly do
and<00:03:19.100> I'm<00:03:19.400> going<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.820> still<00:03:20.330> be<00:03:20.870> able<00:03:20.990> to<00:03:21.260> beat

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
and I'm going to still be able to beat

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.380 
and I'm going to still be able to beat
him<00:03:21.650> in<00:03:21.770> this<00:03:21.890> game<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.370> simply<00:03:23.090> because<00:03:23.360> of

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
him in this game and simply because of

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.720 
him in this game and simply because of
just<00:03:24.170> doing<00:03:24.350> it<00:03:24.620> properly<00:03:24.830> I<00:03:25.100> guess<00:03:25.310> up<00:03:25.490> it's

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
just doing it properly I guess up it's

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.210 
just doing it properly I guess up it's
going<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.240> be<00:03:26.330> a<00:03:26.360> 7-pole<00:03:26.930> one<00:03:27.290> drone<00:03:27.590> then<00:03:28.130> I'm

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
going to be a 7-pole one drone then I'm

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.770 
going to be a 7-pole one drone then I'm
going<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.460> follow<00:03:28.730> up<00:03:28.880> with<00:03:28.910> an<00:03:29.150> overlord<00:03:29.570> and

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
going to follow up with an overlord and

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.300 
going to follow up with an overlord and
he<00:03:29.960> is<00:03:30.080> scouting<00:03:30.320> across<00:03:30.740> the<00:03:30.860> map<00:03:31.010> right<00:03:31.160> now

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
circling so the first six circlings all

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.199 
circling so the first six circlings all
go<00:04:03.620> together<00:04:03.860> then<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.730> next<00:04:04.910> set<00:04:05.180> of

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
go together then the next set of

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.640 
go together then the next set of
zerglings<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.840> then<00:04:05.930> there's<00:04:06.110> another<00:04:06.170> set

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
zerglings and then there's another set

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.620 
zerglings and then there's another set
of<00:04:06.770> circling<00:04:07.100> is<00:04:07.160> going<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.459> right<00:04:07.580> after<00:04:08.120> the

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
of circling is going to right after the

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.910 
of circling is going to right after the
important<00:04:09.110> thing<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.380> have<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.590> keep<00:04:09.740> in

important thing that you have to keep in

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.170 
important thing that you have to keep in
mind<00:04:09.950> is<00:04:10.130> that<00:04:10.190> you<00:04:10.370> do<00:04:10.520> not<00:04:10.640> want<00:04:10.880> to<00:04:10.910> just

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
mind is that you do not want to just

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.720 
mind is that you do not want to just
politely<00:04:11.870> keep<00:04:12.290> producing<00:04:12.730> circlings

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
politely keep producing circlings

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.310 
politely keep producing circlings
because<00:04:14.000> well<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:14.630> do<00:04:14.870> want<00:04:15.080> to<00:04:15.140> have

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
because well you do want to have

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.990 
because well you do want to have
something<00:04:15.740> to<00:04:15.920> fall<00:04:16.040> back<00:04:16.250> on<00:04:16.430> even<00:04:16.880> though

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
something to fall back on even though

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.510 
something to fall back on even though
it's<00:04:17.209> supposed<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.660> do<00:04:17.840> damage<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:19.130> has<00:04:19.280> some

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
it's supposed to do damage it has some

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.190 
it's supposed to do damage it has some
guaranteed<00:04:20.060> damage<00:04:20.420> in<00:04:20.570> there<00:04:20.720> as<00:04:20.840> well<00:04:20.870> but<00:04:21.049> I

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
guaranteed damage in there as well but I

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.050 
guaranteed damage in there as well but I
think<00:04:21.260> it's<00:04:21.590> important<00:04:22.100> to<00:04:22.250> also<00:04:22.640> put<00:04:22.880> some

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
think it's important to also put some

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.250 
think it's important to also put some
thought<00:04:23.210> in<00:04:23.419> there<00:04:23.540> and<00:04:23.660> do<00:04:23.750> it<00:04:23.810> properly<00:04:23.960> so

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
thought in there and do it properly so

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.290 
thought in there and do it properly so
what<00:04:24.950> I've<00:04:25.070> done<00:04:25.100> next<00:04:25.580> is<00:04:25.760> actually<00:04:26.120> getting

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
what I've done next is actually getting

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
tenth circling are about to spawn right

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.350 
tenth circling are about to spawn right
now<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:33.830> my<00:04:34.160> queen<00:04:34.490> is<00:04:34.669> already<00:04:35.030> on<00:04:35.180> its<00:04:35.240> way

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
now and my queen is already on its way

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.090 
now and my queen is already on its way
and<00:04:35.539> what<00:04:35.690> I'm<00:04:35.780> going<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.050> do<00:04:36.229> right<00:04:36.259> now<00:04:36.770> it's

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
and what I'm going to do right now it's

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.070 
and what I'm going to do right now it's
actually<00:04:37.820> just<00:04:38.090> make<00:04:38.360> drones<00:04:38.660> I'm<00:04:38.840> going<00:04:38.870> to

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
actually just make drones I'm going to

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.469 
actually just make drones I'm going to
drone<00:04:39.380> drone<00:04:39.530> drone<00:04:39.680> drone<00:04:39.860> until<00:04:40.580> 18<00:04:41.030> supply

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
drone drone drone drone until 18 supply

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.420 
drone drone drone drone until 18 supply
so<00:04:42.050> I'm<00:04:42.139> just<00:04:42.320> gonna<00:04:42.470> make<00:04:42.680> no<00:04:42.800> stop<00:04:43.009> rounds<00:04:43.310> as

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
so I'm just gonna make no stop rounds as

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.249 
so I'm just gonna make no stop rounds as
many<00:04:43.639> as<00:04:43.820> again<00:04:44.090> going<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.389> use<00:04:44.600> injects<00:04:45.110> and

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
many as again going to use injects and

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:46.900 
many as again going to use injects and
I'm<00:04:45.320> gonna<00:04:45.500> make<00:04:45.590> an<00:04:45.830> overloaded<00:04:46.340> 18

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
I'm gonna make an overloaded 18

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.540 
I'm gonna make an overloaded 18
suppliers<00:04:47.360> well<00:04:47.780> so<00:04:48.500> my<00:04:48.650> circles<00:04:49.070> are<00:04:49.220> already

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
suppliers well so my circles are already

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.100 
suppliers well so my circles are already
across<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:50.030> map<00:04:50.180> and<00:04:50.330> he<00:04:50.389> actually<00:04:50.539> went<00:04:50.840> for

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
across the map and he actually went for

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.620 
across the map and he actually went for
a<00:04:51.139> forge<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.770> before<00:04:52.580> going<00:04:52.789> for<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.120> nexus<00:04:53.449> so

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
a forge and before going for a nexus so

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.320 
a forge and before going for a nexus so
it<00:04:54.080> should<00:04:54.380> be<00:04:54.410> relatively<00:04:54.979> relatively<00:04:55.880> safe

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
it should be relatively relatively safe

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.990 
it should be relatively relatively safe
right<00:04:56.539> now<00:04:56.570> and<00:04:57.280> let's<00:04:58.280> actually<00:04:58.430> speed<00:04:58.820> it<00:04:58.910> up

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
right now and let's actually speed it up

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000 
right now and let's actually speed it up
just<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.330> little<00:04:59.479> bit<00:04:59.660> so<00:05:00.350> that's<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:00.740> few

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
just a little bit so that's a few

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.529 
just a little bit so that's a few
priorities<00:05:01.669> that<00:05:01.789> you<00:05:01.940> want<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.150> be<00:05:02.240> attacking

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
priorities that you want to be attacking

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.240 
priorities that you want to be attacking
so<00:05:02.780> first<00:05:03.050> of<00:05:03.199> all<00:05:03.289> you<00:05:03.440> want<00:05:03.620> to<00:05:03.680> get<00:05:03.830> into<00:05:04.010> his

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
so first of all you want to get into his

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.070 
so first of all you want to get into his
main<00:05:04.520> course<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.270> want<00:05:05.449> to<00:05:05.510> get<00:05:05.630> into<00:05:05.870> that

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
main course you want to get into that

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.510 
main course you want to get into that
middle<00:05:06.229> of<00:05:06.410> line<00:05:06.530> and<00:05:06.800> of<00:05:06.979> course<00:05:07.010> he's<00:05:07.340> going

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
middle of line and of course he's going

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.210 
middle of line and of course he's going
to<00:05:07.669> try<00:05:07.880> and<00:05:07.910> actually<00:05:08.150> get<00:05:08.419> a<00:05:08.479> cannon<00:05:08.810> up<00:05:09.220> he's

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
to try and actually get a cannon up he's

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.920 
to try and actually get a cannon up he's
going<00:05:10.430> to<00:05:10.550> try<00:05:10.820> his<00:05:10.970> best<00:05:11.000> but<00:05:11.389> circles<00:05:11.780> do<00:05:11.900> a

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
going to try his best but circles do a

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.779 
going to try his best but circles do a
lot<00:05:12.169> of<00:05:12.199> DPS<00:05:12.650> even<00:05:13.010> if<00:05:13.100> it's<00:05:13.250> only<00:05:13.400> three

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
lot of DPS even if it's only three

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.480 
lot of DPS even if it's only three
attacking<00:05:14.210> one<00:05:14.360> cannon<00:05:14.780> I<00:05:15.650> think<00:05:16.190> you<00:05:16.310> should

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
attacking one cannon I think you should

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.040 
attacking one cannon I think you should
just<00:05:16.520> target<00:05:17.180> down<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.449> cannon<00:05:17.690> with<00:05:17.810> as<00:05:17.930> many

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
just target down the cannon with as many

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.260 
just target down the cannon with as many
circles<00:05:18.470> you<00:05:18.740> can<00:05:18.800> and<00:05:19.099> just<00:05:19.490> use<00:05:19.699> the<00:05:19.880> rest<00:05:20.120> to

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
circles you can and just use the rest to

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.779 
circles you can and just use the rest to
attack<00:05:21.020> whatever<00:05:21.260> but<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:22.039> most<00:05:22.220> important

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
attack whatever but the most important

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.189 
attack whatever but the most important
part<00:05:23.000> here<00:05:23.060> is<00:05:23.300> that<00:05:23.419> you<00:05:23.570> don't<00:05:23.870> want<00:05:24.110> to

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
part here is that you don't want to

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.260 
part here is that you don't want to
waste<00:05:24.349> any<00:05:24.590> zerglings<00:05:25.190> unless<00:05:25.910> you<00:05:26.060> get<00:05:26.210> a

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
waste any zerglings unless you get a

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.390 
waste any zerglings unless you get a
really<00:05:26.630> good<00:05:26.750> trade-off<00:05:27.139> for<00:05:27.320> it<00:05:27.620> so<00:05:27.800> here<00:05:28.280> I'm

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
really good trade-off for it so here I'm

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.010 
really good trade-off for it so here I'm
just<00:05:28.430> going<00:05:28.669> to<00:05:28.910> try<00:05:29.090> and<00:05:29.120> snipe<00:05:29.449> of<00:05:29.630> all<00:05:29.840> the

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
just going to try and snipe of all the

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.200 
just going to try and snipe of all the
photon<00:05:30.440> cannons<00:05:30.800> and<00:05:30.949> as<00:05:31.370> you<00:05:31.490> can<00:05:31.639> see<00:05:31.669> and<00:05:32.000> my

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
photon cannons and as you can see and my

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.029 
photon cannons and as you can see and my
bass<00:05:32.449> me<00:05:32.690> while<00:05:32.900> I'm<00:05:33.050> just<00:05:33.349> getting<00:05:33.650> more<00:05:33.889> and

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
bass me while I'm just getting more and

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:36.010 
bass me while I'm just getting more and
more<00:05:34.130> drones<00:05:35.060> up<00:05:35.240> but<00:05:35.360> already<00:05:35.570> of<00:05:35.750> a<00:05:35.810> bunch

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
more drones up but already of a bunch

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.050 
more drones up but already of a bunch
more<00:05:36.229> and<00:05:36.470> what<00:05:36.919> I<00:05:36.949> am<00:05:37.190> doing<00:05:37.370> right<00:05:37.669> now<00:05:37.849> is

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
more and what I am doing right now is

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.760 
more and what I am doing right now is
something<00:05:38.449> that<00:05:38.570> is<00:05:38.750> really<00:05:39.050> important<00:05:39.650> what

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
something that is really important what

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.920 
something that is really important what
a<00:05:39.800> lot<00:05:40.070> of<00:05:40.190> zurk<00:05:40.430> players<00:05:40.699> will<00:05:40.910> do<00:05:41.150> in<00:05:41.360> this

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
a lot of zurk players will do in this

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.899 
a lot of zurk players will do in this
situation<00:05:42.229> is<00:05:42.740> just<00:05:42.800> blindly<00:05:43.460> go<00:05:43.669> for<00:05:43.849> the

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
situation is just blindly go for the

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.270 
situation is just blindly go for the
probes<00:05:44.210> and<00:05:44.419> go<00:05:45.020> like<00:05:45.229> I<00:05:45.409> killed<00:05:45.949> a<00:05:46.070> lot<00:05:46.220> of

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
probes and go like I killed a lot of

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.219 
probes and go like I killed a lot of
probes<00:05:46.639> this<00:05:46.880> is<00:05:47.000> definitely<00:05:47.630> going<00:05:47.810> to<00:05:48.050> give

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
probes this is definitely going to give

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.589 
probes this is definitely going to give
me<00:05:48.409> a<00:05:48.440> win<00:05:48.650> well<00:05:48.800> that's<00:05:49.520> partly<00:05:49.909> true<00:05:50.030> but<00:05:50.300> you

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
me a win well that's partly true but you

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:52.060 
me a win well that's partly true but you
don't<00:05:50.870> really<00:05:51.050> want<00:05:51.289> to<00:05:51.380> risk<00:05:51.470> it<00:05:51.710> why<00:05:51.860> would

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
don't really want to risk it why would

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.560 
don't really want to risk it why would
you<00:05:52.159> want<00:05:52.340> to<00:05:52.400> risk<00:05:52.550> it<00:05:52.729> why<00:05:52.880> not<00:05:52.909> just<00:05:53.300> run

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
you want to risk it why not just run

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.899 
you want to risk it why not just run
around<00:05:53.690> this<00:05:53.960> base<00:05:54.169> and<00:05:54.470> deny<00:05:55.190> all<00:05:55.550> mining

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909 
around this base and deny all mining

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:57.460 
around this base and deny all mining
time<00:05:56.210> because<00:05:56.510> we're<00:05:56.720> all<00:05:56.870> this<00:05:57.110> time<00:05:57.349> he

ahead<00:06:03.440> an<00:06:03.740> income<00:06:04.070> simply<00:06:04.430> because<00:06:04.699> as<00:06:04.849> you

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
ahead an income simply because as you

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.210 
ahead an income simply because as you
can<00:06:05.030> see<00:06:05.180> is<00:06:05.449> not<00:06:05.659> mining<00:06:06.080> anything<00:06:06.590> so<00:06:07.070> what

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
can see is not mining anything so what

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
kind of photon cannon to go up and what

I'm going to do is just engage every now
and<00:06:17.030> then<00:06:17.150> pick<00:06:17.389> up<00:06:17.510> a<00:06:17.630> few<00:06:17.870> and<00:06:18.080> I'm<00:06:18.139> going<00:06:18.320> to

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:18.409 
and then pick up a few and I'm going to

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:21.640 
and then pick up a few and I'm going to
try<00:06:18.620> and<00:06:18.650> micro<00:06:19.130> my<00:06:19.280> weak<00:06:19.550> circles<00:06:20.030> back<00:06:20.650> here

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
try and micro my weak circles back here

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.200 
try and micro my weak circles back here
see<00:06:21.860> another<00:06:22.039> photon<00:06:22.490> cannon<00:06:22.760> going<00:06:23.000> up<00:06:23.120> I

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
see another photon cannon going up I

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.189 
see another photon cannon going up I
don't<00:06:23.389> want<00:06:23.510> to<00:06:23.570> risk<00:06:23.659> it<00:06:23.870> so<00:06:23.960> I'm<00:06:24.050> just

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
don't want to risk it so I'm just

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.450 
don't want to risk it so I'm just
putting<00:06:24.380> back<00:06:24.560> actually<00:06:24.889> making<00:06:25.070> a<00:06:25.250> little

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
putting back actually making a little

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.159 
putting back actually making a little
mistake<00:06:25.699> right<00:06:25.909> there<00:06:25.970> losing<00:06:26.750> is<00:06:26.840> circling

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
mistake right there losing is circling

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.020 
mistake right there losing is circling
but<00:06:27.349> I'm<00:06:27.440> getting<00:06:27.710> two<00:06:27.919> probes<00:06:28.430> or<00:06:28.639> one<00:06:28.789> probe

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
but I'm getting two probes or one probe

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.730 
but I'm getting two probes or one probe
for<00:06:29.270> it<00:06:29.360> back<00:06:29.539> and<00:06:29.750> I<00:06:29.900> actually<00:06:30.289> managed<00:06:30.710> to

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
for it back and I actually managed to

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.439 
for it back and I actually managed to
get<00:06:30.919> this<00:06:31.070> around<00:06:31.370> once<00:06:31.639> more<00:06:31.729> on<00:06:31.970> that<00:06:32.090> photon

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
get this around once more on that photon

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.959 
get this around once more on that photon
cannon<00:06:32.780> if<00:06:33.590> you<00:06:33.710> can<00:06:33.860> see<00:06:34.010> what<00:06:34.460> do<00:06:34.580> I<00:06:34.639> do<00:06:34.729> next

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:34.969 
cannon if you can see what do I do next

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:36.580 
cannon if you can see what do I do next
well<00:06:35.180> I<00:06:35.210> just<00:06:35.270> run<00:06:35.599> around<00:06:35.719> a<00:06:35.990> bit<00:06:36.139> and<00:06:36.169> attack

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
well I just run around a bit and attack

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.469 
well I just run around a bit and attack
him<00:06:36.740> and<00:06:36.950> of<00:06:37.340> course<00:06:37.370> circlings<00:06:38.090> actually

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 
him and of course circlings actually

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:39.490 
him and of course circlings actually
every<00:06:38.719> generate

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
every generate

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.260 
every generate
a<00:06:39.530> little<00:06:40.160> bit<00:06:40.280> so<00:06:40.430> I'm<00:06:40.550> actually<00:06:40.670> safe<00:06:41.030> to<00:06:41.180> do

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
a little bit so I'm actually safe to do

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.210 
a little bit so I'm actually safe to do
that<00:06:41.390> and<00:06:41.570> right<00:06:42.230> now<00:06:42.410> well<00:06:42.620> what<00:06:42.800> is<00:06:42.920> he<00:06:42.950> going

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
that and right now well what is he going

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.040 
that and right now well what is he going
to<00:06:43.340> be<00:06:43.520> doing<00:06:43.670> my<00:06:43.940> queen<00:06:44.210> is<00:06:44.330> already<00:06:44.660> at<00:06:44.780> my

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
to be doing my queen is already at my

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.020 
to be doing my queen is already at my
next<00:06:45.320> show<00:06:45.410> is<00:06:45.650> already<00:06:45.830> going<00:06:46.190> up<00:06:46.430> and<00:06:46.580> I

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
next show is already going up and I

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.610 
next show is already going up and I
basically<00:06:47.270> got<00:06:47.720> everything<00:06:48.260> going<00:06:48.290> for

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
basically got everything going for

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.860 
basically got everything going for
myself<00:06:49.130> even<00:06:49.640> though<00:06:49.880> I<00:06:49.970> went<00:06:50.270> for<00:06:50.450> a<00:06:50.510> seven

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
myself even though I went for a seven

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.750 
myself even though I went for a seven
pool<00:06:51.080> at<00:06:51.260> this<00:06:51.650> point<00:06:51.920> in<00:06:52.040> time<00:06:52.160> are<00:06:52.340> already

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:52.760 
pool at this point in time are already

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.550 
pool at this point in time are already
far<00:06:53.000> ahead<00:06:53.120> and<00:06:53.510> I<00:06:53.570> still<00:06:53.810> possibility<00:06:54.410> that

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
far ahead and I still possibility that

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.890 
far ahead and I still possibility that
he<00:06:54.650> would've<00:06:54.920> held<00:06:55.100> it<00:06:55.310> in<00:06:56.150> the<00:06:56.540> best-case

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 
he would've held it in the best-case

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.300 
he would've held it in the best-case
scenario<00:06:57.500> for<00:06:57.530> him<00:06:57.800> he<00:06:57.920> would<00:06:58.040> have<00:06:58.130> made<00:06:58.280> a

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 
scenario for him he would have made a

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.520 
scenario for him he would have made a
pylon<00:06:58.730> and<00:06:58.850> a<00:06:59.120> cannon<00:06:59.690> in<00:06:59.810> his<00:06:59.930> minute<00:07:00.230> online

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
pylon and a cannon in his minute online

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.440 
pylon and a cannon in his minute online
and<00:07:00.710> even<00:07:01.370> at<00:07:01.520> that<00:07:01.550> point<00:07:01.880> in<00:07:02.000> time<00:07:02.030> I<00:07:02.180> would

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.450 
and even at that point in time I would

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.910 
and even at that point in time I would
have<00:07:02.480> been<00:07:02.690> able<00:07:02.840> to<00:07:02.990> snipe<00:07:03.320> off<00:07:03.530> all<00:07:03.710> those

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:03.920 
have been able to snipe off all those

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.530 
have been able to snipe off all those
points<00:07:04.220> and<00:07:04.670> all<00:07:04.730> those<00:07:04.850> cannons<00:07:05.300> and<00:07:05.450> all

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.540 
points and all those cannons and all

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.780 
points and all those cannons and all
those<00:07:05.660> fortunes<00:07:06.290> well<00:07:06.740> 14<00:07:07.190> technically<00:07:07.640> only

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:07.790 
those fortunes well 14 technically only

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.090 
those fortunes well 14 technically only
a<00:07:07.940> nun<00:07:08.210> yeah<00:07:08.960> at<00:07:09.170> this<00:07:09.350> point<00:07:09.410> in<00:07:09.740> time<00:07:09.770> I<00:07:09.920> can

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 
a nun yeah at this point in time I can

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.130 
a nun yeah at this point in time I can
just<00:07:10.520> sacrifice<00:07:11.120> my<00:07:11.300> circuits<00:07:11.660> I<00:07:11.750> know<00:07:11.840> I'm

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:12.140 
just sacrifice my circuits I know I'm

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.290 
just sacrifice my circuits I know I'm
going<00:07:12.320> far<00:07:12.650> ahead<00:07:12.770> and<00:07:12.980> as<00:07:13.070> you<00:07:13.160> can<00:07:13.310> see<00:07:13.340> 15

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300 
going far ahead and as you can see 15

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.540 
going far ahead and as you can see 15
harvesters<00:07:15.020> first<00:07:15.260> is<00:07:15.410> only<00:07:15.650> five<00:07:16.160> right<00:07:16.430> now

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:16.550 
harvesters first is only five right now

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.540 
harvesters first is only five right now
and<00:07:17.050> like<00:07:18.050> I<00:07:18.140> said<00:07:18.200> it's<00:07:18.590> a<00:07:18.710> cheesy<00:07:18.950> strategy

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.550 
and like I said it's a cheesy strategy

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.860 
and like I said it's a cheesy strategy
but<00:07:19.669> I<00:07:19.730> think<00:07:20.000> it's<00:07:20.150> important<00:07:20.630> to<00:07:20.660> practice

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
but I think it's important to practice

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.110 
but I think it's important to practice
it<00:07:21.230> every<00:07:21.350> now<00:07:21.650> and<00:07:21.830> then<00:07:21.950> just<00:07:22.130> get<00:07:22.850> it<00:07:22.970> into

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 
it every now and then just get it into
