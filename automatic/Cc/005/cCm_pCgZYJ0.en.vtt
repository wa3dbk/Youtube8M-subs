00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 during change now we will launch 9 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.290
 John Voyte 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.830
 Solex founder is a crash it comes 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.090
 delight whenever shows on 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.700
 what is his new 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.969
 experimental aircraft in x 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.960
 but the threat is noted rector driving force 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.869
 start 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.810
 this is nasa from one panel 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.859
 he looks like a small plane 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.669
 seeker is not as if it is 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.329
 small plane but the noise is not at all 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.369
 such as a small plane 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.939
 it's because you nix doesn't work 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.770
 conventional fuel it uses 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.860
 batteries of war he is with them lari we 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.300
 wanted to give impetus to development and rector 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.239
 missile planes she's the biggest 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.019
 achievement he is ready to fly it completely 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.019
 autonomous aircraft on electricity that is 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.579
 he has his own battery 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.350
 interesting news 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.899
 however in order to no one 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.010
 the result of the project Solex on development 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.499
 flying on electricity 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:56.570
 the company started working on the project 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.670
 two thousand and sixth year to bring 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.589
 contribution to the development of alternative 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.890
 energy sources for aircraft in 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.640
 principle yes and it seems to me today 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.340
 there comes a turning point whether he cut 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.549
 the board engineer he carefully followed 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.310
 creating an airplane for electric motors 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.600
 water withdrawal 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.650
 uah that gives us the engine on 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.520
 electricity not only on earth but also in 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.869
 great opportunities open up in the air 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.070
 net renewable 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.130
 high performance for mac driving soft with 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.290
 this agrees aircraft engineer 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.710
 sikorsky corporation 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.160
 Jonathan Khartoum 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.310
 samaralaktovo got caught on the forward 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.110
 although in the camp the bearer has 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.540
 many advantages over 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.040
 internal combustion engines 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.050
 he is quieter less on the radio and 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.080
 let's arrange it easier which reduces its cost 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.829
 they are easier to manage 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.819
 how do you work steel project from 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.799
 of the Most Holy Sikorsky Corporation 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.240
 this is a single engine helicopter working 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.600
 on battery production 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.090
 companies but based on alanya 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.830
 this glaring example of the death of an airplane two 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.990
 the batteries you see with each 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.700
 sides are lithium ion batteries 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.100
 similar to those that have laptops can 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.280
 specially assembled for our purposes 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.170
 Khartoum he says that fuel price hikes 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.340
 made sikorski think about 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.719
 alternative 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.739
 talk briefly about your summer bout 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.479
 play an important role for the military 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.409
 commercial companies and this role 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.509
 may undermine the fuel shortage and 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.229
 inflated prices 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:25.109
 but what feeds the engines 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.379
 critical flying 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.349
 devices creates for them not the greatest 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.219
 the problem 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.239
 batteries are bulky and heavy 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.089
 and for cars that should be light 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:35.579
 need to do to the batteries weighed 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.589
 smaller and were compact 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.189
 Khartoum believes Well Sikorsky already found 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.199
 solution and although firefly so far 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.319
 is on itself hartman expects that 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.819
 test flights will begin soon 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.689
 malafeev organize it not 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.569
 can fly and he will fly we hope 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.569
 confirm this at the end of ground 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:54.349
 test 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.499
 what will be closer to the end of the year 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:58.070
 40 kursk list 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.320
 two examples of new directions projects 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.830
 flying on electric 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.190
 however, these technologies are still under test 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.280
 personally able to use them in 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.780
 commercial air travel 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.110
 Experts believe remains a dream 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.230
 far future
