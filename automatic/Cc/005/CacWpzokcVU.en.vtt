go through a very very rigorous process

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.959 
go through a very very rigorous process
one<00:00:57.079> big<00:00:57.289> piece<00:00:57.559> of<00:00:57.589> that<00:00:57.799> is<00:00:58.309> fuel<00:00:58.819> efficiency

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
one big piece of that is fuel efficiency

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.930 
one big piece of that is fuel efficiency
when<00:00:59.929> the<00:01:00.289> vehicle<00:01:00.769> is<00:01:00.799> in<00:01:01.459> a<00:01:01.549> much<00:01:01.729> more

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
when the vehicle is in a much more

when the vehicle is in a much more
fuel-efficient<00:01:02.899> status<00:01:03.469> than<00:01:04.159> we<00:01:04.519> all<00:01:04.699> win<00:01:05.000> in

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
fuel-efficient status than we all win in

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.039 
fuel-efficient status than we all win in
this<00:01:05.780> particular<00:01:06.140> case<00:01:06.649> we<00:01:07.460> were<00:01:07.610> reviewing

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
this particular case we were reviewing

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.319 
this particular case we were reviewing
powertrains<00:01:09.049> engine<00:01:09.890> transmission<00:01:10.759> drive

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.800 
powertrains engine transmission drive
line<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.530> we<00:01:13.100> did<00:01:13.579> a<00:01:13.820> runoff<00:01:14.240> between

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
line and so we did a runoff between

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.929 
line and so we did a runoff between
engine<00:01:15.740> manufacturers<00:01:16.490> as<00:01:16.729> well<00:01:16.759> as

transmission<00:01:17.509> manufacturers<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.560> during

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
transmission manufacturers and during

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.779 
transmission manufacturers and during
the<00:01:19.310> runoff<00:01:19.670> we<00:01:20.000> realized<00:01:20.659> that<00:01:21.079> there<00:01:21.259> was

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
the runoff we realized that there was

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.020 
the runoff we realized that there was
opportunity<00:01:22.789> to<00:01:23.600> fine<00:01:24.049> tune<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:24.740> tweak<00:01:25.490> the

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
opportunity to fine tune and tweak the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.830 
opportunity to fine tune and tweak the
allison<00:01:26.659> package<00:01:27.320> our<00:01:27.619> goal<00:01:28.430> is<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:29.119> try<00:01:29.509> and

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
allison package our goal is to try and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.950 
allison package our goal is to try and
make<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.409> engine<00:01:30.920> run<00:01:30.950> in<00:01:31.640> its<00:01:32.329> sweet<00:01:32.659> spot

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
make the engine run in its sweet spot

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.499 
make the engine run in its sweet spot
the<00:01:33.770> way<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.100> we<00:01:34.189> do<00:01:34.369> that<00:01:34.609> is<00:01:34.909> through<00:01:35.149> a

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
the way that we do that is through a

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.349 
the way that we do that is through a
shift<00:01:36.079> schedule<00:01:36.920> from<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.280> transmission<00:01:37.820> we

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
shift schedule from the transmission we

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.050 
shift schedule from the transmission we
try<00:01:38.719> and<00:01:38.899> shift<00:01:39.289> around<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.250> sweet<00:01:40.520> spot<00:01:40.820> of

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
try and shift around the sweet spot of

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.139 
try and shift around the sweet spot of
the<00:01:41.149> engine<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.259> then<00:01:43.009> how<00:01:43.219> do<00:01:43.280> we<00:01:43.429> continue

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
the engine and then how do we continue

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.209 
the engine and then how do we continue
to<00:01:44.270> maintain<00:01:44.450> that<00:01:44.719> sweet<00:01:45.140> spot<00:01:45.439> of<00:01:45.920> the

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
to maintain that sweet spot of the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.700

so the power of application engineering

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.650 
so the power of application engineering
is<00:02:45.700> very<00:02:45.940> profound<00:02:46.780> here<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.350> group<00:02:48.070> of

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.050 
vehicle as well as us is very very
powerful<00:02:57.880> now<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.990> will<00:02:59.860> say<00:03:00.100> that<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.820> is

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
powerful now I will say that it is

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.470 
powerful now I will say that it is
always<00:03:01.360> a<00:03:01.540> trade-off<00:03:02.260> between<00:03:03.480> efficiency

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
always a trade-off between efficiency

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.979 
always a trade-off between efficiency
and<00:03:04.690> drivability<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.850> as<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:08.680> start<00:03:09.190> to

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
and drivability so as you start to

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.780 
and drivability so as you start to
typically<00:03:10.989> increase<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.040> efficiency<00:03:12.670> of<00:03:12.700> the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
typically increase the efficiency of the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.740 
typically increase the efficiency of the
vehicle<00:03:14.220> drivability<00:03:15.220> has<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.670> tendency<00:03:16.330> to

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
vehicle drivability has a tendency to

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.100 
vehicle drivability has a tendency to
suffer<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:18.090> feel<00:03:19.090> very<00:03:19.390> good<00:03:19.750> about<00:03:19.810> the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
suffer I feel very good about the

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.530 
suffer I feel very good about the
process<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:20.680> we<00:03:21.040> just<00:03:21.070> went<00:03:21.520> through<00:03:21.940> with

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
process that we just went through with

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.890 
process that we just went through with
Allison<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:24.040> rest<00:03:24.310> of<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:25.060> partners<00:03:25.660> in

Allison and the rest of the partners in
this<00:03:26.170> venture<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:27.330> there<00:03:28.330> was<00:03:28.510> no

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
this venture that there was no

detrimental impact to drivability and
yet<00:03:33.250> our<00:03:33.520> efficiency<00:03:34.450> of<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.810> overall

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
yet our efficiency of the overall

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.430 
yet our efficiency of the overall
package<00:03:35.550> was<00:03:36.550> increased<00:03:37.150> substantially<00:03:37.440> so

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
package was increased substantially so

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.170
