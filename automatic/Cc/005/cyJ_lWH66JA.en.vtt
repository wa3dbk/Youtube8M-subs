00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.900
 hi i'm still i'm in the company of 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.809
 ara shaded which reigning champion 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:18.010
 as for the pokÃ©mon videogame 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:20.199
 and we'll do a brief interview for per 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.880
 you the house and then we'll let it go 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.650
 hydro then arash meanwhile let's start that 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.869
 what it takes to win one 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.240
 competition like the world championship 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.869
 I think that to do well in these 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.780
 tournaments 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.539
 you have to have two things you have to be a 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.340
 smart minimum and you have to work hard but 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.789
 the second thing matters much more than 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.430
 first I want to say I always am 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.990
 engaged in this game 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.520
 I think I won only for that 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.080
 I think there's a lot more people 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.489
 clever of me though but in the end when 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.980
 when you give yourself to do the results yes 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.630
 they always see so in everything even in 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.010
 pokemon game that are based enough 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.320
 on luck 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.629
 well yes but fortunately you always 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.210
 however, admire a certain technique one 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.940
 some skill and more intelligence than 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.180
 cunning fifth Monday on youtube 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.130
 and instead how you deal with it and what you think about it 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.550
 of the difference between the competitions 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.710
 national and European ones that 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.720
 provide for a dry batch oversight a 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.450
 unlike those of the world championships that 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.040
 instead they are played completely on 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.610
 fact that it is the best of three 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.440
 surely it ensures that there are fewer cases 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.140
 where the meetings are decided by 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.130
 luck that that is a pretty thing 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.600
 smart to do and worldwide 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.810
 disputed the importance of 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.810
 competition 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.580
 in short, I think in the world championships for that 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.280
 say there is more chance than the best 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.360
 but well ahead gives more space to the 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.740
 in short, technical is what you think of it 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.990
 in general of the competitive level 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:09.040
 of the other countries on the world scene 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.899
 this year I think that Europe and America 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.180
 have teams 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.180
 in short, a little below the standards 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.130
 general for hosts on both sides 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.070
 there are very good players though in the 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.770
 complex nothing exceptional instead a 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.430
 additional invitation to Korea and four screws 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.020
 instead of 2 to japan are they doing 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.850
 think that these two nations have 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.680
 more chances than others to win 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.020
 so a level is generally expected 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.110
 highest technician lower than the 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.480
 Yesterday's speech every higher and higher 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.060
 year was higher than the first one is 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.340
 one last question as you think it is 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.400
 changed this game half with 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.410
 the introduction let's say medium 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.020
 evolutions compared to the year 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.060
 last in the sense if you think it is 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.070
 served to make half more gay 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.620
 technical or who has a little bit 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.290
 shuffled the cards on the table and have 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.209
 made it predictable you understand with the 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.340
 what of medium evolutions can I say 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.170
 first of all mega scale tango 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.560
 very centralized 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.260
 each team must be mainly 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.900
 suitable for getting rid of media kanga scan 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.510
 then 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.849
 then this is fine but you know famous ones 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.890
 vestas that are ugly teams that alone 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:31.530
 dedicates huntelaar is the same to win 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:33.090
 because in short, you must have not can not 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.599
 it's too much freedom to do the 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.420
 team to be of knowing how to beat 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.629
 all these strategies and ready for anything 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.280
 and then maybe you catch that team too 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.010
 a bit unpredictable component that 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.109
 maybe you don't expect risotto instead 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.510
 to be ready were so cranial and 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:54.060
 instead I wanted to ask you what what 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.109
 think of new developments that 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:01.799
 They were released by little ones 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:04.260
 of lesser zotti red the new ones 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.709
 are a bit has seen the preview abo 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.879
 they seem to be interesting mega hall 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.680
 canteen must be strong alloy slogans e 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.420
 gaudino also seem interesting 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.639
 in short, the fact that they introduced 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.639
 of the medium evolutions we say of 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.760
 support makes me think that next year 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:27.270
 the tricks will control a lot but how 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.729
 always early to say it well I will 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.860
 thank you obviously I wish you in the mouth 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.610
 wolf for the day after tomorrow 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.400
 however during the course of the event you 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.470
 I will ask something else about the 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.300
 your team that in the meantime we will have way 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.289
 of 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.319
 to see about the various challenges 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.940
 still good luck and see you 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:52.900
 soon 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.900
 thanks a lot, bye
