see if the voting actually matters like

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.540

a<00:00:51.660> VA<00:00:51.899> takes<00:00:52.230> into<00:00:52.530> consideration<00:00:52.559> or<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.430> they

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
a VA takes into consideration or if they

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.290 
a VA takes into consideration or if they
just<00:00:53.579> put<00:00:54.539> through<00:00:54.780> who<00:00:54.899> they<00:00:55.050> want<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:56.300> that

just put through who they want and that

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.510 
just put through who they want and that
really<00:00:57.629> made<00:00:58.109> me<00:00:58.140> think<00:00:58.289> because<00:00:58.800> he<00:00:59.370> has<00:00:59.489> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
really made me think because he has a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.150 
really made me think because he has a
pee<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.480> 50,000<00:01:01.230> subscribers<00:01:01.379> that's<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.010> big

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
pee like 50,000 subscribers that's a big

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.030 
pee like 50,000 subscribers that's a big
fan<00:01:02.370> base<00:01:02.579> especially<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.300> an<00:01:03.390> HL<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.799> Matt

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
fan base especially for an HL so if Matt

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.800 
fan base especially for an HL so if Matt
beleskey<00:01:05.339> does<00:01:05.790> not<00:01:06.030> go<00:01:06.270> through<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
beleskey does not go through to the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.330 
beleskey does not go through to the
second<00:01:07.140> round<00:01:07.170> I'm<00:01:07.500> pretty<00:01:07.770> sure<00:01:07.920> something's

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
second round I'm pretty sure something's

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.880 
second round I'm pretty sure something's
up<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.200> according<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.619> comments

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
up with it and according to the comments

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.469 
up with it and according to the comments
on<00:01:11.280> his<00:01:11.490> video<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.970> i<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.150> looking<00:01:12.390> at

on his video that i was looking at

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.230 
on his video that i was looking at
earlier<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.930> morning<00:01:13.490> he's<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.820> winning<00:01:15.000> as

of right now he's losing to andrew
cogliano<00:01:17.100> i<00:01:17.580> think<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:19.080> actually

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
cogliano i think so if that actually

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.679 
cogliano i think so if that actually
happens<00:01:19.740> that's<00:01:20.340> kind<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.759> definitive<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.570> me

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
happens that's kind of definitive for me

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.590 
happens that's kind of definitive for me
and<00:01:21.869> what<00:01:22.740> he<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.009> doing<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:23.880> it's

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
and what he is doing with this but it's

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.899 
and what he is doing with this but it's
not<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.520> convinces<00:01:26.520> me<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.820> is

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
not just that that convinces me this is

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.679 
not just that that convinces me this is
happening<00:01:27.710> this<00:01:28.710> every<00:01:29.430> year<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:29.939> they<00:01:30.390> do<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
happening this every year if they do the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.260 
happening this every year if they do the
cover<00:01:30.840> go<00:01:31.049> every<00:01:31.350> year<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.740> they<00:01:32.610> put<00:01:32.850> someone

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270

Twitter followers but they don't put
them<00:02:25.959> through<00:02:26.170> anyway<00:02:26.470> which<00:02:26.650> is

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
them through anyway which is

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.170 
them through anyway which is
understandable<00:02:27.010> but<00:02:27.550> at<00:02:27.670> least<00:02:27.760> they<00:02:27.970> show

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
understandable but at least they show

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.039 
understandable but at least they show
that<00:02:28.440> like<00:02:29.440> he's<00:02:30.250> getting<00:02:30.459> votes<00:02:30.849> so<00:02:31.810> what<00:02:31.959> I'm

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
that like he's getting votes so what I'm

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.920 
that like he's getting votes so what I'm
thinking<00:02:32.379> EA<00:02:32.590> should<00:02:32.920> do<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.310> put<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.060> like<00:02:34.720> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
thinking EA should do is put a like the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.309 
thinking EA should do is put a like the
number<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.319> votes<00:02:35.500> beside<00:02:35.860> each<00:02:35.890> player<00:02:36.310> and

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
number of votes beside each player and

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.589 
number of votes beside each player and
so<00:02:38.319> that<00:02:38.349> way<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.680> would<00:02:38.890> know<00:02:39.069> if<00:02:39.599> they're

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
so that way you would know if they're

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.089 
so that way you would know if they're
lying<00:02:40.840> or<00:02:41.019> not<00:02:41.049> well<00:02:41.379> I<00:02:41.410> guess<00:02:41.709> they're<00:02:42.010> not

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
lying or not well I guess they're not

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.800 
lying or not well I guess they're not
going<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.370> do<00:02:42.459> that<00:02:42.489> if<00:02:42.790> they're<00:02:43.030> fixing<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
going to do that if they're fixing the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.140 
going to do that if they're fixing the
vote<00:02:44.049> but<00:02:44.319> anyways<00:02:45.310> back<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.549> last<00:02:45.819> year's<00:02:46.060> I

cities<00:03:30.760> but<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.660> fact<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:31.989> he<00:03:32.079> made<00:03:32.319> it<00:03:32.410> to

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
cities but the fact that he made it to

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.729 
cities but the fact that he made it to
the<00:03:32.590> finals<00:03:32.980> last<00:03:33.099> year<00:03:33.359> it<00:03:34.359> kind<00:03:34.630> of<00:03:34.780> like

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
the finals last year it kind of like

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.339 
the finals last year it kind of like
gave<00:03:35.980> me<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.250> idea<00:03:36.370> about<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:37.720> voting<00:03:38.170> not

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
gave me the idea about the voting not

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.339 
gave me the idea about the voting not
really<00:03:38.650> being<00:03:38.859> based<00:03:39.519> on<00:03:39.730> fans<00:03:40.349> Giroux

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
really being based on fans Giroux

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.839 
really being based on fans Giroux
getting<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:41.889> the<00:03:41.980> finals<00:03:42.370> that's<00:03:42.519> kind<00:03:42.819> of

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
getting to the finals that's kind of

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.870 
getting to the finals that's kind of
debatable<00:03:43.389> I'm<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.739> Philadelphia<00:03:45.310> fan<00:03:45.519> so<00:03:45.700> this

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
debatable I'm a Philadelphia fan so this

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.220 
debatable I'm a Philadelphia fan so this
is<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.269> didn't<00:03:46.720> really<00:03:46.810> want<00:03:47.019> to<00:03:47.049> talk<00:03:47.109> about

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
is I didn't really want to talk about

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.819 
is I didn't really want to talk about
York<00:03:47.709> so<00:03:47.859> I'll<00:03:47.950> be<00:03:48.040> kind<00:03:48.190> of<00:03:48.340> biased<00:03:48.700> but<00:03:49.829> he's

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
York so I'll be kind of biased but he's

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.530 
York so I'll be kind of biased but he's
a<00:03:50.859> deserving<00:03:51.310> player<00:03:51.669> I<00:03:51.700> think<00:03:52.090> but<00:03:52.329> I<00:03:52.359> don't

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
a deserving player I think but I don't

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.409 
a deserving player I think but I don't
think<00:03:52.810> he'd<00:03:52.930> win<00:03:53.109> a<00:03:53.139> vote<00:03:53.349> against<00:03:53.859> Subban

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
think he'd win a vote against Subban

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:58.890 
think he'd win a vote against Subban
Castle<00:03:56.700> even<00:03:57.700> Carlson<00:03:58.329> someone<00:03:58.750> like<00:03:58.870> that

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
Castle even Carlson someone like that

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.300 
Castle even Carlson someone like that
because<00:03:59.260> they<00:03:59.440> just<00:03:59.590> have<00:03:59.739> more<00:03:59.950> fans<00:04:00.160> than

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
because they just have more fans than

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.759 
because they just have more fans than
flyer<00:04:00.669> like<00:04:01.329> more<00:04:02.109> fans<00:04:02.349> than<00:04:02.440> people<00:04:02.739> in

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
flyer like more fans than people in

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.520 
flyer like more fans than people in
Philadelphia<00:04:03.340> so<00:04:04.299> there's<00:04:04.840> nothing<00:04:05.019> I'll

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
Philadelphia so there's nothing I'll

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.550 
Philadelphia so there's nothing I'll
probably<00:04:05.950> make<00:04:06.190> a<00:04:06.250> follow-up<00:04:06.639> commentary

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
probably make a follow-up commentary

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.620 
probably make a follow-up commentary
once<00:04:08.560> they<00:04:09.250> reveal<00:04:09.609> who<00:04:09.790> went<00:04:09.970> goes<00:04:10.180> past<00:04:10.450> the

Bobby Ryan and I don't know why that is
in<00:05:18.580> might<00:05:18.730> just<00:05:18.970> because<00:05:19.300> they<00:05:19.450> don't<00:05:19.600> have
