00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
check engine light goes out when I

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.039 
check engine light goes out when I
attempt<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.010> crank<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.609> car<00:02:32.819> so<00:02:33.659> that<00:02:33.810> means

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
attempt to crank the car so that means

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.929 
attempt to crank the car so that means
that<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:35.180> crankshaft<00:02:36.180> sensor<00:02:36.719> is<00:02:37.230> good<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:38.250> am

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
that the crankshaft sensor is good I am

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:44.470 
that the crankshaft sensor is good I am
getting<00:02:39.180> smart<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.579> am

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.530 

both<00:02:44.660> tomorrow<00:02:45.489> see<00:02:46.489> if<00:02:46.520> I'm<00:02:46.730> still<00:02:47.000> in<00:02:47.209> class

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
both tomorrow see if I'm still in class

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.040 
both tomorrow see if I'm still in class
I<00:02:48.370> change<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.910> fuel<00:02:50.269> pressure<00:02:50.540> regulator

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
I change the fuel pressure regulator

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.170 
I change the fuel pressure regulator
back<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.739> his<00:02:51.830> original

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.009 

point<00:02:54.920> that's<00:02:55.920> an<00:02:56.129> original<00:02:56.840> not<00:02:57.840> be

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
point that's an original not be

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.349 
point that's an original not be
non-adjustable

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
non-adjustable

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.860 
non-adjustable
and<00:03:00.359> not<00:03:00.599> change<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.640> fuel<00:03:02.640> pump<00:03:02.909> back<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.540> the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
and not change the fuel pump back to the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.979 
and not change the fuel pump back to the
OEM<00:03:04.430> standard<00:03:05.510> 1:55<00:03:06.510> lph<00:03:07.349> from<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:08.129> 255<00:03:09.090> bitch

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
OEM standard 1:55 lph from the 255 bitch

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.780 
OEM standard 1:55 lph from the 255 bitch
and<00:03:11.689> when<00:03:12.689> I<00:03:12.719> pulled<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.530> out<00:03:13.709> I<00:03:14.099> was<00:03:14.430> getting

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
and when I pulled it out I was getting

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.759 
and when I pulled it out I was getting
pressured<00:03:15.389> to<00:03:15.629> the<00:03:15.930> rails<00:03:17.120> but<00:03:18.230> when<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.469> pulled

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
pressured to the rails but when I pulled

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:27.530 
pressured to the rails but when I pulled
the<00:03:19.950> plug<00:03:20.159> before<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:22.500> plugs<00:03:22.889> are<00:03:23.189> dry<00:03:26.299> so<00:03:27.299> I'm

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
the plug before the plugs are dry so I'm

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.869 
the plug before the plugs are dry so I'm
still<00:03:27.840> trying<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.169> figure<00:03:28.319> out<00:03:28.500> why<00:03:29.010> this<00:03:29.069> is

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
still trying to figure out why this is

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.729 
still trying to figure out why this is
not<00:03:30.180> starting<00:03:31.019> for<00:03:31.319> me

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
not starting for me

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.099 
not starting for me
I<00:03:31.769> replaced<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.579> current<00:03:33.030> shaft<00:03:33.329> sensor<00:03:33.870> I

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
I replaced the current shaft sensor I

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.979 
I replaced the current shaft sensor I
replaced<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.859> cam<00:03:35.250> shafts<00:03:35.579> in<00:03:35.879> here<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.359> will

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
replaced the cam shafts in here I will

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:37.520 
replaced the cam shafts in here I will
plant

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
plant

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.000 
plant
I<00:03:37.560> replaced<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.250> back<00:03:38.519> sensor<00:03:38.849> are<00:03:39.389> we<00:03:39.840> I

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
I replaced the back sensor are we I

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.229 
I replaced the back sensor are we I
replaced<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.159> spark<00:03:41.340> plugs

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
replaced the spark plugs

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.530 
replaced the spark plugs
I<00:03:43.069> replaced<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.310> ignition<00:03:45.269> module<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.959> ccrm

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
I replaced the ignition module the ccrm

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.729 
I replaced the ignition module the ccrm
so<00:03:49.430> this<00:03:50.430> is<00:03:50.579> another<00:03:50.790> thing<00:03:50.909> to<00:03:51.359> figure<00:03:51.569> out

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
so this is another thing to figure out

00:03:51.739 --> 00:04:00.500 
so this is another thing to figure out
why<00:03:52.739> this<00:03:52.799> isn't<00:03:53.400> working

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.309 

this<00:04:01.099> slight<00:04:02.099> rattle<00:04:02.489> that<00:04:02.909> you<00:04:03.090> hear<00:04:03.689> just

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
this slight rattle that you hear just

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.630 
this slight rattle that you hear just
came<00:04:04.620> probably<00:04:05.310> when<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:07.250> changed<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.310> fuel

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
came probably when I changed the fuel

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.910 
came probably when I changed the fuel
part<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:09.420> I<00:04:09.720> might<00:04:10.019> have<00:04:10.049> to<00:04:10.379> tighten<00:04:10.709> up<00:04:10.860> the

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
part so I might have to tighten up the

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.809 
part so I might have to tighten up the
tanks<00:04:11.340> tomorrow<00:04:11.670> or<00:04:12.319> the<00:04:13.319> exhausts<00:04:14.220> might<00:04:14.579> be

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
tanks tomorrow or the exhausts might be

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:21.370 
tanks tomorrow or the exhausts might be
loose<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:16.799> let's<00:04:17.519> see<00:04:17.669> what<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:17.850> is<00:04:19.699> probably

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
loose so let's see what that is probably

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.040 
loose so let's see what that is probably
where<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.410> can<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:23.150> if<00:04:24.150> you're<00:04:24.570> watching<00:04:24.840> this

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
where I can so if you're watching this

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:34.310 
where I can so if you're watching this
is<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.710> 93<00:04:26.310> for<00:04:26.610> tours<00:04:26.940> sh<00:04:27.510> o<00:04:29.449> MTX<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:33.110> just<00:04:34.110> let

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
is the 93 for tours sh o MTX so just let

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:45.950 
is the 93 for tours sh o MTX so just let
you<00:04:34.470> know<00:04:43.669> trying<00:04:44.669> to<00:04:44.880> figure<00:04:45.240> out<00:04:45.270> why<00:04:45.810> this

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
you know trying to figure out why this

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:53.900 
you know trying to figure out why this
isn't<00:04:46.669> I<00:04:49.400> have<00:04:50.400> no<00:04:50.699> gas<00:04:51.030> leak<00:04:52.520> nowhere<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.789> be

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
isn't I have no gas leak nowhere to be

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.060 
isn't I have no gas leak nowhere to be
found

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
found

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.129 
found
no<00:04:56.070> gas<00:04:56.340> leak<00:04:56.880> we're<00:04:57.889> so<00:04:59.510> placed<00:05:00.510> it<00:05:00.720> back<00:05:00.900> to

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
no gas leak we're so placed it back to

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:07.580 
no gas leak we're so placed it back to
its<00:05:01.260> original<00:05:02.539> original<00:05:04.820> regulator<00:05:05.820> I<00:05:06.590> do

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
its original original regulator I do

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.460 
its original original regulator I do
have<00:05:08.010> a<00:05:08.039> broken<00:05:08.370> boat<00:05:08.849> here<00:05:09.510> I<00:05:09.690> was<00:05:10.080> when<00:05:10.289> I<00:05:10.320> got

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
have a broken boat here I was when I got

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.219 
have a broken boat here I was when I got
it<00:05:10.919> so<00:05:11.280> I<00:05:11.310> don't<00:05:11.639> know<00:05:11.880> if<00:05:12.030> that's<00:05:12.419> that's<00:05:13.080> what

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
it so I don't know if that's that's what

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.159 
it so I don't know if that's that's what
I<00:05:13.260> have<00:05:13.560> this<00:05:13.830> one<00:05:14.070> grounded<00:05:14.610> to<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.169> ignition

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
I have this one grounded to the ignition

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.570 
I have this one grounded to the ignition
module<00:05:16.889> as<00:05:17.190> you<00:05:17.340> can<00:05:17.490> see<00:05:17.669> it<00:05:17.789> is<00:05:17.970> brand<00:05:18.510> new<00:05:18.720> so

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
module as you can see it is brand new so

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.420 
module as you can see it is brand new so
um<00:05:20.580> I<00:05:21.270> know<00:05:21.630> there's<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.050> wire<00:05:22.500> that<00:05:22.800> goes<00:05:22.860> back

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
um I know there's a wire that goes back

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.620 
um I know there's a wire that goes back
here<00:05:23.910> and<00:05:24.120> it<00:05:24.479> hooks<00:05:24.720> up<00:05:24.960> to<00:05:25.940> what<00:05:26.940> used<00:05:27.389> to<00:05:27.570> be

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
here and it hooks up to what used to be

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.540 
here and it hooks up to what used to be
where<00:05:28.110> they<00:05:28.349> got<00:05:28.530> had<00:05:28.860> the<00:05:29.990> Yoda<00:05:31.550> grounding

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
where they got had the Yoda grounding

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.629 
where they got had the Yoda grounding
bracket<00:05:33.060> and<00:05:33.270> I<00:05:34.110> can't<00:05:34.889> seem<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.220> find<00:05:35.490> that

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
bracket and I can't seem to find that

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.270 
bracket and I can't seem to find that
wire<00:05:35.910> nowhere<00:05:36.389> I<00:05:36.630> don't<00:05:37.440> know<00:05:37.560> if<00:05:37.770> he<00:05:37.889> grunted

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
wire nowhere I don't know if he grunted

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.930 
wire nowhere I don't know if he grunted
it<00:05:38.400> somewhere<00:05:38.820> else<00:05:38.880> or

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
it somewhere else or

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.480

the core pack so that's a sale core pad
with<00:05:58.790> the<00:05:59.020> matching<00:06:00.020> wires<00:06:00.350> I<00:06:00.800> know<00:06:00.920> that's

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
with the matching wires I know that's

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.980 
with the matching wires I know that's
grounded<00:06:01.670> off<00:06:01.820> pretty<00:06:02.090> well<00:06:02.180> there<00:06:02.890> so<00:06:04.990> if

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990

I<00:06:44.540> have<00:06:44.930> to<00:06:45.280> redo<00:06:46.280> the<00:06:46.430> timing<00:06:46.940> if<00:06:47.150> that<00:06:47.510> might

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
I have to redo the timing if that might

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.940 
I have to redo the timing if that might
be<00:06:47.900> the<00:06:48.350> problem<00:06:48.530> so<00:06:49.490> I<00:06:49.870> didn't<00:06:50.870> backfire<00:06:51.110> when
