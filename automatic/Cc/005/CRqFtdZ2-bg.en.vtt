00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
that's thrush Buster next we're using a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.410 
that's thrush Buster next we're using a
special<00:01:39.390> formula<00:01:40.229> or<00:01:40.560> an<00:01:41.369> equivalent<00:01:41.670> such<00:01:42.210> as

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
special formula or an equivalent such as

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.450 
special formula or an equivalent such as
neosporin<00:01:43.170> cream<00:01:43.439> which<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:43.979> actually

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
neosporin cream which is actually

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.149 
neosporin cream which is actually
cheaper<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.119> easier<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.780> get<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.469> recommend

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
cheaper and easier to get so I recommend

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.069 
cheaper and easier to get so I recommend
that<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.490> use<00:01:47.759> special<00:01:47.880> formula<00:01:48.479> only<00:01:48.750> because

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
that I use special formula only because

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.349 
that I use special formula only because
that's<00:01:49.679> what<00:01:49.890> I've<00:01:49.979> started<00:01:50.189> at<00:01:50.460> using<00:01:50.729> but

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
that's what I've started at using but

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.359 
that's what I've started at using but
neosporin<00:01:52.259> cream<00:01:52.499> apparently<00:01:53.070> does<00:01:53.219> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
neosporin cream apparently does the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.940 
neosporin cream apparently does the
exact<00:01:53.670> same<00:01:53.700> thing<00:01:53.990> now<00:01:54.990> we're<00:01:55.770> going<00:01:55.890> to

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
exact same thing now we're going to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.859 
exact same thing now we're going to
viewing<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.609> is<00:01:56.909> after<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:57.630> first

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
using that once a day and then the other

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.849 
cotton into the foot and then you can
just<00:03:59.239> leave<00:03:59.480> it<00:03:59.540> it<00:04:00.199> doesn't<00:04:00.530> really<00:04:00.620> matter

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
just leave it it doesn't really matter

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.890 
just leave it it doesn't really matter
if<00:04:01.040> your<00:04:01.489> horse<00:04:01.699> if<00:04:02.000> it<00:04:02.120> falls<00:04:02.359> out<00:04:02.599> overnight

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
if your horse if it falls out overnight

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.740 
if your horse if it falls out overnight
that's<00:04:03.440> fine<00:04:03.889> as<00:04:04.280> long<00:04:04.910> as<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.150> gets<00:04:05.269> some<00:04:05.510> time

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
that's fine as long as it gets some time

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.809 
that's fine as long as it gets some time
in<00:04:05.989> there<00:04:06.199> really<00:04:06.680> use<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.160> hoof<00:04:07.370> pick<00:04:07.609> to

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
in there really use the hoof pick to

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.520 
in there really use the hoof pick to
pack<00:04:08.329> it<00:04:08.510> down<00:04:08.660> in<00:04:08.840> there<00:04:08.989> make<00:04:09.169> sure<00:04:09.379> it's

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
pack it down in there make sure it's

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.619 
pack it down in there make sure it's
nice<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:09.739> secure<00:04:10.010> just<00:04:10.489> so<00:04:10.940> it<00:04:11.030> stays<00:04:11.299> in<00:04:11.329> as

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
nice and secure just so it stays in as

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.860 
nice and secure just so it stays in as
long<00:04:11.840> as<00:04:11.900> possible<00:04:12.139> and<00:04:13.540> then<00:04:14.540> you're<00:04:14.690> good

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
treatment really easy really quick and

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.629 
treatment really easy really quick and
then<00:04:20.060> we'll<00:04:20.239> move<00:04:20.359> on<00:04:21.070> now<00:04:22.070> we're<00:04:22.310> going<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:22.520> do

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
then we'll move on now we're going to do

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.450 
then we'll move on now we're going to do
the<00:04:22.849> special<00:04:23.570> formula<00:04:24.139> or<00:04:24.349> neosporin<00:04:25.159> cream

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
the special formula or neosporin cream

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.899 
the special formula or neosporin cream
if<00:04:25.760> that's<00:04:26.330> what<00:04:26.780> you<00:04:26.900> choose<00:04:27.139> to<00:04:27.199> do<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:27.909> it's

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:28.909 
if that's what you choose to do and it's

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.330 
if that's what you choose to do and it's
pretty<00:04:29.000> much<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.449> same<00:04:29.659> thing<00:04:30.080> except<00:04:30.740> we'll

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
pretty much the same thing except we'll

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.920 
pretty much the same thing except we'll
we'll<00:04:31.699> take<00:04:31.849> a<00:04:31.880> look<00:04:32.090> at<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.300> tube<00:04:32.510> first

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
we'll take a look at the tube first

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.890 
we'll take a look at the tube first
there's<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.650> special<00:04:34.280> formula<00:04:34.789> the<00:04:35.720> only

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
there's the special formula the only

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.629 
there's the special formula the only
difference<00:04:36.199> here<00:04:36.289> is<00:04:36.620> that<00:04:36.800> we're<00:04:37.310> going<00:04:37.490> to

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
difference here is that we're going to

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.930 
difference here is that we're going to
put<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:38.750> substance<00:04:39.260> on<00:04:39.440> first<00:04:40.280> before<00:04:40.669> we

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
put the substance on first before we

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.420 
put the substance on first before we
pack<00:04:41.240> it<00:04:41.270> with<00:04:41.419> cotton<00:04:41.900> so<00:04:42.229> really<00:04:42.860> just<00:04:43.099> put

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
pack it with cotton so really just put

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.550 
pack it with cotton so really just put
it<00:04:43.550> right<00:04:43.580> in<00:04:43.940> there<00:04:44.210> now<00:04:44.810> you'll<00:04:44.930> notice<00:04:45.229> here

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
it right in there now you'll notice here

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.510 
it right in there now you'll notice here
that<00:04:45.590> a<00:04:45.800> she

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
that a she

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.550 
that a she
moves<00:04:47.090> her<00:04:47.300> foot<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.930> horse<00:04:48.139> moves<00:04:48.349> her<00:04:48.530> foot

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
moves her foot the horse moves her foot

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.260 
moves her foot the horse moves her foot
it's<00:04:49.009> because<00:04:49.669> it's<00:04:49.819> a<00:04:49.910> little<00:04:50.150> bit

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
it's because it's a little bit

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.600 
it's because it's a little bit
uncomfortable<00:04:50.569> it<00:04:51.470> might<00:04:51.830> sting<00:04:52.250> a<00:04:52.400> little
