ten percent because if you make a

you have to get through the chicanes

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.650 
you have to get through the chicanes
really<00:02:18.100> quickly<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.670> keep<00:02:18.880> your<00:02:19.060> momentum<00:02:19.180> up

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.820 

it's<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.790> quite<00:02:51.480> dangerous<00:02:51.690> drug<00:02:52.200> because<00:02:52.650> the

it's a quite dangerous drug because the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.180 
it's a quite dangerous drug because the
world<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.280> very<00:02:53.430> close<00:02:53.909> to<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.209> street<00:02:54.659> and

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
that I mean you will remember this one

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.570 
that I mean you will remember this one

the<00:03:25.849> second<00:03:26.330> race<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.750> came<00:03:27.230> out<00:03:27.410> little<00:03:27.739> better

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
the second race I came out little better

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.610 
the second race I came out little better
for<00:03:28.610> me<00:03:28.700> chicane<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.300> purpose<00:03:29.989> at<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.319> end<00:03:30.470> of

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
for me chicane and purpose at the end of

for me chicane and purpose at the end of
the<00:03:30.739> straight<00:03:30.980> in<00:03:31.670> second<00:03:32.209> gear<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:33.170> I

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
the straight in second gear and I

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.320 
the straight in second gear and I
thought<00:03:34.010> that<00:03:34.220> there'd<00:03:34.430> be<00:03:34.549> room<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:34.940> pass<00:03:35.120> him

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
thought that there'd be room to pass him

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.809 
thought that there'd be room to pass him
on<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.450> outside<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.470> turn<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.459> in<00:03:37.580> front

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
on the outside and to turn it in front

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.449 
on the outside and to turn it in front
of<00:03:37.940> him<00:03:38.140> in<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.230> end<00:03:39.350> didn't<00:03:39.830> quite<00:03:39.980> work<00:03:40.190> out

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
of him in the end didn't quite work out

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.789 
of him in the end didn't quite work out
I<00:03:40.519> was<00:03:40.850> on<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.060> outside<00:03:41.420> should<00:03:42.170> have<00:03:42.260> been<00:03:42.350> ok

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
I was on the outside should have been ok

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.340 
I was on the outside should have been ok
but<00:03:43.310> he<00:03:44.209> decided<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.660> there<00:03:44.840> wasn't<00:03:45.019> enough

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
but he decided that there wasn't enough

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.850 
but he decided that there wasn't enough
space<00:03:45.760> cars<00:03:46.760> touched<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:48.380> hit<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.709> wall

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
space cars touched and I hit the wall

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.490 
space cars touched and I hit the wall
pretty<00:03:49.160> hard<00:03:49.250> been<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:50.810> car<00:03:51.019> was<00:03:51.170> totally

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
pretty hard been the car was totally

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.350 
pretty hard been the car was totally
destroyed<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:52.099> had<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.340> use<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.519> new<00:03:52.730> chassis<00:03:53.000> for

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
destroyed I had to use a new chassis for

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.880 
destroyed I had to use a new chassis for
the<00:03:53.420> rest<00:03:53.599> of<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.750> season<00:03:53.930> as<00:03:54.290> he<00:03:54.380> did<00:03:54.560> bump<00:03:54.739> it
