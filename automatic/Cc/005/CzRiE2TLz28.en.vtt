our<00:01:45.170> Yukon<00:01:45.470> he<00:01:45.680> kept<00:01:45.860> saying<00:01:46.040> no<00:01:46.159> no<00:01:46.550> no<00:01:46.880> no<00:01:47.180> so

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
our Yukon he kept saying no no no no so

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.420 
our Yukon he kept saying no no no no so
this<00:01:48.080> is<00:01:48.200> just<00:01:48.290> another<00:01:48.560> example<00:01:48.680> i<00:01:49.250> think

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
this is just another example i think

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.370 
this is just another example i think
he's<00:01:49.520> gonna<00:01:49.640> be<00:01:49.729> in<00:01:49.970> it<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.300> also<00:01:50.630> he<00:01:50.780> lives<00:01:51.170> in

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
he's gonna be in it and also he lives in

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.899 
he's gonna be in it and also he lives in
London<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:51.890> they're<00:01:52.010> shooting<00:01:52.370> in<00:01:52.520> England

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
London and they're shooting in England

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.600 
London and they're shooting in England
so<00:01:53.150> that's<00:01:53.570> I<00:01:53.870> think<00:01:54.590> he<00:01:55.100> can<00:01:55.250> get<00:01:55.370> away<00:01:55.520> with

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
so that's I think he can get away with

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.399 
so that's I think he can get away with
that<00:01:55.880> Queen<00:01:56.090> lives<00:01:56.390> in<00:01:56.510> London<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:57.049> don't
