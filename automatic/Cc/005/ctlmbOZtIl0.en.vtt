00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 this story began a creative crisis 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.069
 I know that you expect me to continue 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.900
 hero at dota school but my brain is flat 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.330
 refused to invent anything 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.490
 dota associated with the last cartoon on that 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.880
 The moment was released on February 7 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.789
 it was on the side of the world and before this idea 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.160
 from my old stock for a rainy day 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.109
 as everyone knows if yutuber is not long 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.960
 releases a video then he dies 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.840
 we popular youtubers call this 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.850
 prikolyuha u tuba shorter than international 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.250
 tops i found a guy named matthew 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.260
 Santoro he makes a video called 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.649
 fifty one fact that will blow your 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.450
 brain 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.660
 they are gaining a wild amount 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.420
 views and I decided to cut him 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.969
 this idea so appeared 19 brain 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.570
 enduring facts people kind of liked 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.670
 but somehow the soul did not lie like this 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.010
 the format seems to be a story I had 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.559
 once a slot spray some nights 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.480
 consecutive video for youtube and I do in 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.059
 mostly at night because there is a day 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.700
 other things so here are a few nights 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.340
 in a row I looked through popular cartoons 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.369
 on yu tuba who collected there more 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.340
 million views trying to understand with 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.110
 what help is which variable 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.650
 helped them achieve this 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.659
 and here once I remembered that I myself 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.270
 made a cartoon that gathered more 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.640
 million views yes first release 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.180
 the heroes of dota school so exceeded the bar 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.110
 in a million views and then I got it 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.750
 that's what i need to focus on 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.500
 myself as I said it was 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.549
 at night so I was vial and sleepy I 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.880
 went to the kitchen 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:49.250
 made myself a coffee drank it cheered up 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.250
 sat down at the script and nothing 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:59.930
 I sat on the couch and repeated myself dota 2 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:04.030
 dota 2 think dota 2 dota 2 dota 2 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.030
 and then a second 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:16.260
 need to do a cartoon about dota first damn 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.020
 it will be original and interesting let 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.970
 dota 1 heroes will be so grumbling 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.310
 old people who live in the house 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.989
 the elderly and they will be telling 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.440
 your opinion about dota 2 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.630
 damn yes it's a good idea inspired 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.510
 and i made myself coffee drank it 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.510
 cheered up sat down at the script and nothing 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.930
 the story was pretty bleak at first 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.820
 when i write some kind of script me 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.670
 quite often pulls on drama 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.130
 according to the original story the hero dota 1 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.610
 should be the all forgotten 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.570
 the old magin he is antimag finds 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.710
 camcorder and starts shooting their life 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.730
 even attempts to return the former 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.670
 popularity 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.460
 but this is not for youtube but you need it 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.390
 jokes and I began to think as if to me 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:14.170
 turn the plot into a comedy and here by 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.110
 one more insight i need jokes about 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:23.050
 toilets 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:26.740
 a lot of jokes about the toilet and i made myself 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.270
 coffee drank it cheered me is 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:33.720
 sometimes i call it a coffee break 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.790
 In short, I added such a script and 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:40.090
 began the most tedious process 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.090
 the animation itself a few hours behind the computer 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.450
 and here most of it is ready I am already 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:51.570
 plan so then finish tomorrow 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.570
 then installation and on Thursday I let out 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.040
 but here 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.470
 two thirds of the animation had flown away 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.669
 do it all over again and exit cartoon 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:32.150
 postpone for another week and glory alone 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:36.320
 no more incidents, I was not his 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:40.160
 finished and ofigel from the fact that it lasts 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:44.210
 six minutes after this story I did 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:47.330
 two pins 1 6 minutes for one person 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.850
 this is too much so now cartoons 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.449
 will be a half to two minutes on average 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.100
 you want will not more often the second 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:59.150
 my main problem is i'm not 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:02.120
 play dota think for the last time I'm 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.340
 she played will be a vannier for well now on 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.110
 she simply has no time therefore probably 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.660
 I can not do anything that pleases 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.910
