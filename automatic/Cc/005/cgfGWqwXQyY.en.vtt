that's the outbound of a series 9 min
again<00:00:57.860> and<00:00:58.160> you<00:00:58.910> can<00:00:59.090> hear<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.300> pump

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
again and you can hear the pump

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.229 
again and you can hear the pump
circulating<00:01:00.440> right<00:01:00.649> now<00:01:00.860> bringing<00:01:01.789> in<00:01:02.059> more

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
circulating right now bringing in more

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.530 
circulating right now bringing in more
water<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:03.759> she's<00:01:04.759> starting<00:01:05.059> to<00:01:05.089> pick<00:01:05.299> back<00:01:05.509> up

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
water and she's starting to pick back up

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.630 
water and she's starting to pick back up
again<00:01:06.049> because<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:06.380> just<00:01:06.560> put<00:01:06.770> water<00:01:07.009> into<00:01:07.310> it

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
again because you just put water into it

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.640 
again because you just put water into it
and<00:01:07.850> it<00:01:08.060> disturbs<00:01:08.420> everything<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.290> then<00:01:09.409> it

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
and it disturbs everything and then it

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.139 
and it disturbs everything and then it
has<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:09.860> come<00:01:10.159> back<00:01:10.310> up<00:01:10.550> and<00:01:10.700> start<00:01:10.909> running

has to come back up and start running

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.630 
has to come back up and start running
again<00:01:11.800> it'll<00:01:12.800> be<00:01:12.890> a<00:01:12.920> moment<00:01:13.190> or<00:01:13.340> two<00:01:13.399> and

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
again it'll be a moment or two and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.340 
again it'll be a moment or two and
she'll<00:01:13.820> be<00:01:13.970> buzzing<00:01:14.330> away<00:01:14.420> again<00:01:14.810> like<00:01:14.990> crazy

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
she'll be buzzing away again like crazy

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.620 
she'll be buzzing away again like crazy
but<00:01:16.070> even<00:01:16.280> with<00:01:16.460> just<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:17.000> little<00:01:17.240> bit<00:01:17.390> of<00:01:17.479> water

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
but even with just a little bit of water

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.649 
but even with just a little bit of water
being<00:01:17.960> added<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:22.280> can<00:01:22.430> see<00:01:22.640> there<00:01:23.509> you<00:01:23.630> go

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
being added you can see there you go

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.090 
being added you can see there you go
hydrogen<00:01:25.660> you<00:01:26.660> listen<00:01:27.020> carefully<00:01:27.200> you<00:01:27.740> can

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
hydrogen you listen carefully you can

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.380 
hydrogen you listen carefully you can
hear<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:28.460> start<00:01:28.729> to<00:01:28.820> pick<00:01:29.000> up<00:01:29.149> again<00:01:29.860> in<00:01:31.390> the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
hear it start to pick up again in the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.340 
hear it start to pick up again in the
meantime<00:01:33.640> here's<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.820> hose<00:01:35.030> comes<00:01:35.840> from<00:01:36.200> the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
meantime here's the hose comes from the

relay this again is the general a look
here<00:01:59.299> is<00:01:59.540> the<00:01:59.810> autofill<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:00.759> here<00:02:01.759> is<00:02:02.000> the

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
here is the autofill and here is the

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.450 
here is the autofill and here is the
liquid<00:02:02.659> level<00:02:02.689> sensor<00:02:03.469> switch<00:02:03.740> right<00:02:04.100> here

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
liquid level sensor switch right here

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.699 
liquid level sensor switch right here
that<00:02:05.149> turns<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.780> pump<00:02:06.020> on<00:02:06.460> over<00:02:07.460> there<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:09.530> of

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
that turns the pump on over there and of

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.500 
that turns the pump on over there and of
course<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:10.130> fill<00:02:10.340> in<00:02:10.489> viewport<00:02:10.910> right<00:02:11.209> there

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
course the fill in viewport right there

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.229 
course the fill in viewport right there
and<00:02:12.230> if<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.500> look<00:02:12.709> at<00:02:12.829> this<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.459> can<00:02:13.670> see<00:02:13.910> it

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
and if you look at this you can see it

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.490 
and if you look at this you can see it
is<00:02:14.540> rather<00:02:15.530> compact<00:02:16.250> as<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.910> matter<00:02:17.239> of<00:02:17.390> fact

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
is rather compact as a matter of fact

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.050 
is rather compact as a matter of fact
we're<00:02:18.500> going<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.709> get<00:02:18.799> a<00:02:18.860> tape<00:02:19.160> measure<00:02:19.430> out<00:02:19.760> so

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
we're going to get a tape measure out so

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.490 
we're going to get a tape measure out so
you<00:02:20.150> can<00:02:20.329> see<00:02:20.570> for<00:02:20.600> yourself<00:02:21.880> exactly<00:02:23.500> how

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
you can see for yourself exactly how

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.199 
you can see for yourself exactly how
wide<00:02:24.829> it<00:02:25.040> is<00:02:26.440> let<00:02:27.440> me<00:02:27.560> see<00:02:27.799> if<00:02:28.040> we<00:02:28.700> take<00:02:28.970> and

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
wide it is let me see if we take and

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.490 
wide it is let me see if we take and
hook<00:02:29.329> a<00:02:29.359> ruler<00:02:29.840> on<00:02:30.049> to<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.880> can<00:02:32.090> see

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.899 

it's<00:02:35.500> just<00:02:35.920> about<00:02:36.250> 7<00:02:37.090> inches<00:02:37.209> tall<00:02:37.719> and<00:02:38.909> from

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
it's just about 7 inches tall and from

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.690 
it's just about 7 inches tall and from
side<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.599> side<00:02:42.659> kind<00:02:43.659> of<00:02:43.719> hard<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:43.989> do<00:02:44.200> this

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
side to side kind of hard to do this

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.539 
side to side kind of hard to do this
cross-handed<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:46.750> look<00:02:46.959> here<00:02:47.409> you'll<00:02:47.769> see<00:02:47.859> it

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
cross-handed you look here you'll see it

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:54.119 
cross-handed you look here you'll see it
is<00:02:49.230> three<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.409> half<00:02:50.439> inches<00:02:50.859> wide<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.950> that

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
is three and a half inches wide and that

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.729 
is three and a half inches wide and that
will<00:02:54.250> give<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.519> a<00:02:54.549> general<00:02:54.730> idea<00:02:55.030> of<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:56.349> series

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
will give you a general idea of a series

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.250 
will give you a general idea of a series
9<00:02:57.299> mag<00:02:58.299> drive<00:02:59.099> mini<00:03:00.099> jack<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.840> we'll<00:03:02.109> follow

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
9 mag drive mini jack and we'll follow

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.569 
9 mag drive mini jack and we'll follow
the<00:03:02.530> hose<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.250> again<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.450> can<00:03:04.480> see<00:03:05.579> here's

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
the hose and again you can see here's
