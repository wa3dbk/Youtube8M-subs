hi<00:00:01.380> everyone<00:00:01.560> its<00:00:01.979> Jojo<00:00:02.429> and<00:00:02.780> today<00:00:03.780> I'm<00:00:03.990> going

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
hi everyone its Jojo and today I'm going

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.390 
hi everyone its Jojo and today I'm going
to<00:00:04.200> teach<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.680> little<00:00:04.830> trick<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:05.160> learned

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
to teach you a little trick I learned

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.900 
to teach you a little trick I learned
just<00:00:06.270> for<00:00:06.480> fun<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:07.250> I'm<00:00:08.250> going<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.490> teach<00:00:08.700> you

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
just for fun and I'm going to teach you

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.709 
just for fun and I'm going to teach you
how<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.510> make<00:00:10.380> right<00:00:10.830> spin<00:00:11.190> base<00:00:11.509> spin<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.660> the

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
how to make right spin base spin to the

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.340 
how to make right spin base spin to the
left<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.730> left<00:00:14.730> spin<00:00:15.059> base<00:00:15.299> spin<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
left and left spin base spin to the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.630 
left and left spin base spin to the
right<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:17.430> here<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.000> have<00:00:19.010> both<00:00:20.010> my<00:00:20.070> launchers

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
right so here I have both my launchers

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.599 
right so here I have both my launchers
and<00:00:20.930> I'm<00:00:21.930> still<00:00:22.470> have<00:00:23.660> poison<00:00:24.660> serpent<00:00:25.109> and

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
and I'm still have poison serpent and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.740 
and I'm still have poison serpent and
lightning<00:00:26.609> l-drago<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.420> use<00:00:27.570> those

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
lightning l-drago to use those

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.070 
lightning l-drago to use those
demonstrations<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.630> guys<00:00:30.750> already

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
demonstrations so as you guys already

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.680 
demonstrations so as you guys already
know<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:32.520> Bey's<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:34.050> these<00:00:34.350> spaces<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:35.040> them

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
know the Bey's have these spaces in them

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.080 
know the Bey's have these spaces in them
so<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.260> will<00:00:37.770> be<00:00:38.250> either<00:00:38.460> left<00:00:38.850> or<00:00:39.030> right

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
so that it will be either left or right

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.170 
so that it will be either left or right
spin<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> right<00:00:40.320> spin<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.760> this

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
spin so this is a right spin and this

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
spin so this is a right spin and this
one<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> left<00:00:43.260> spin<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:44.610> obviously<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:46.050> you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
one is a left spin so obviously if you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.950 
one is a left spin so obviously if you
put<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.770> left<00:00:47.550> spin<00:00:48.680> on<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.739> right<00:00:50.539> spin<00:00:51.539> launcher

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
put a left spin on a right spin launcher

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.959 
put a left spin on a right spin launcher
it's<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.680> going<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.360> stay<00:00:54.360> because<00:00:55.969> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it's not going to stay because it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.959 
it's not going to stay because it
doesn't<00:00:57.360> hook<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> right<00:00:58.320> spot<00:00:58.969> so

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
doesn't hook on to the right spot so

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.729 
doesn't hook on to the right spot so
anyway<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> make<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.109> spin<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> right<00:01:03.739> you

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
anyway to make it spin to the right you

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.480 
anyway to make it spin to the right you
hold<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.189> down<00:01:05.600> against<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.630> stadium<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> that

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
hold it down against the stadium so that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.719 
hold it down against the stadium so that
it<00:01:08.820> doesn't<00:01:09.270> fall<00:01:09.420> off<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.799> pull

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
it doesn't fall off and you just pull

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.830 
it doesn't fall off and you just pull
the<00:01:11.850> string

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.960 

and<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.410> same<00:01:20.620> thing<00:01:20.830> applies<00:01:21.130> for<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:23.290> too

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and the same thing applies for this too

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.290 
and the same thing applies for this too
here<00:01:24.970> is<00:01:25.120> my<00:01:25.270> left<00:01:25.480> spin<00:01:26.880> launcher<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.240> you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
here is my left spin launcher and you

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.390 
here is my left spin launcher and you
want<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.230> hold<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.530> down<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.890> quickly<00:01:32.890> release

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
want to hold it down and quickly release

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.810 
want to hold it down and quickly release
after<00:01:34.000> you<00:01:34.240> pull<00:01:34.660> the<00:01:34.750> string<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:36.640> is

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
after you pull the string and so it is

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.740 
after you pull the string and so it is
actually<00:01:37.060> spinning<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:38.110> left<00:01:38.320> now

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
actually spinning to the left now

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.340 
actually spinning to the left now
alright<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:41.400> let's<00:01:42.400> just<00:01:42.729> have<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.350> short

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
alright and let's just have a short

00:01:44.350 --> 00:02:02.020 
alright and let's just have a short
little<00:01:44.590> battle<00:01:45.070> between<00:01:45.250> them

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:16.990 

you

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.220 

okay<00:02:18.000> seems<00:02:18.989> like<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.410> was<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> draw<00:02:19.920> but<00:02:20.610> anyway

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
okay seems like it was a draw but anyway

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.000 
okay seems like it was a draw but anyway
that's<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.379> for<00:02:22.590> now

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
that's it for now

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.670 
that's it for now
it<00:02:24.000> was<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:24.480> something<00:02:24.810> for<00:02:25.019> fun<00:02:25.170> probably

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
it was just something for fun probably

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.000 
it was just something for fun probably
probably<00:02:26.040> not<00:02:26.430> legal<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.849> tournaments<00:02:27.330> but

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
probably not legal in tournaments but

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
probably not legal in tournaments but
it's<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.220> for<00:02:29.430> fun

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
it's just for fun

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.280 
it's just for fun
so<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:31.379> fun<00:02:31.530> guys<00:02:31.680> see<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.129> later
