00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
available for passes because once you

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.500 
available for passes because once you
have<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> ball<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.309> can't<00:00:56.550> move<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
have the ball you can't move with it and

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.510 
have the ball you can't move with it and
it's<00:00:57.660> very<00:00:57.870> much<00:00:57.960> team-oriented<00:00:58.500> sport<00:00:59.010> if

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
it's very much team-oriented sport if

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.099 
it's very much team-oriented sport if
possible<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.420> one<00:01:00.629> player<00:01:00.870> that

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
possible you can have one player that

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.360 
possible you can have one player that
takes<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.440> ball<00:01:01.559> from<00:01:01.620> one<00:01:01.920> end<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.160> court

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
takes the ball from one end of the court

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.549 
takes the ball from one end of the court
and<00:01:02.789> then<00:01:03.059> scores<00:01:03.329> at<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.539> other<00:01:03.719> end<00:01:03.930> never

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and then scores at the other end never

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.960 
and then scores at the other end never
you<00:01:04.769> can't<00:01:04.979> do<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.280> because<00:01:05.519> it's

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
you can't do that because it's

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.399 
you can't do that because it's
positional<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.659> really<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.080> rely<00:01:07.380> on

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
positional so you really have to rely on

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:18.230 
positional so you really have to rely on
your<00:01:07.619> teammates

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:30.109 

I<00:01:27.409> would<00:01:28.409> say<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.710> was<00:01:28.770> one<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.070> our<00:01:29.189> not<00:01:29.909> one

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
I would say that was one of our not one

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.260 
I would say that was one of our not one
of<00:01:30.149> our<00:01:30.299> better<00:01:30.420> game<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:30.810> put<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.080> way

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
of our better game it's put it that way

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:42.109 
of our better game it's put it that way
I<00:01:36.320> don't<00:01:37.320> think<00:01:37.409> we'd<00:01:37.649> win<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> game<00:01:41.090> what<00:01:42.090> I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
I don't think we'd win a game what I

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.370 
I don't think we'd win a game what I
always<00:01:42.270> point<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> people<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.229> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
always point out the people is that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.320 
always point out the people is that
netball<00:01:43.890> was<00:01:44.070> initially<00:01:44.369> formed<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
netball was initially formed in the

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.539 
netball was initially formed in the
united<00:01:45.720> states<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.289> was<00:01:47.009> exported

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
united states and was exported

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.490 
united states and was exported
everywhere<00:01:47.939> else<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:49.020> not<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.259> big<00:01:49.470> thing

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
everywhere else it's not a big thing

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.649 
everywhere else it's not a big thing
with<00:01:49.799> us<00:01:50.100> flares<00:01:50.429> we're<00:01:50.789> hoping<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> big<00:01:51.360> push

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
with us flares we're hoping the big push

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.779 
with us flares we're hoping the big push
is<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.319> get<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.740> American<00:01:53.100> players<00:01:53.369> involved

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
is to get the American players involved

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.480 
is to get the American players involved
so<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.140> largest<00:01:55.530> watch<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.920> grow<00:01:56.220> in

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
so that we can largest watch it grow in

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.179 
so that we can largest watch it grow in
a<00:01:56.819> proper<00:01:57.149> manner
