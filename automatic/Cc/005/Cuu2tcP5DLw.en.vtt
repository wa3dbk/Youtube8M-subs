00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
third exercise we're doing is what I

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.250 
third exercise we're doing is what I
call<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> Brazilian<00:00:32.610> butt<00:00:33.000> lift<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.840> squat

call the Brazilian butt lift this squat
is<00:00:34.469> really<00:00:35.219> good<00:00:35.399> because<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.300> work<00:00:36.480> through

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
is really good because we work through

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.270 
is really good because we work through
what<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> call<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> really<00:00:37.739> full<00:00:37.920> range<00:00:38.160> of

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
what I call a really full range of

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.990 
what I call a really full range of
movement<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.790> go<00:00:38.940> really<00:00:39.570> low<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.559> one<00:00:41.000> so

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
movement we go really low on this one so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.060 
movement we go really low on this one so
it<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.629> incredible<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:43.350> giving<00:00:43.829> you

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
it is just incredible for giving you

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.000 
it is just incredible for giving you
that<00:00:44.370> perfect<00:00:44.820> speech<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.710> three

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
that perfect speech so it is just three

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.119 
that perfect speech so it is just three
moves<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.300> hundred<00:00:48.899> reps<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.890> I

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
moves we do a hundred reps so I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.639 
moves we do a hundred reps so I
literally<00:00:50.610> count<00:00:51.059> through<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.289> so

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
literally count through it with you so

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.020 
literally count through it with you so
it's<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.890> you're<00:00:53.129> doing<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.670> me<00:00:53.850> in

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it's like you're doing it with me in

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.330 
it's like you're doing it with me in
real<00:00:54.270> time<00:00:54.600> I'm<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.110> gonna<00:00:55.199> run<00:00:55.530> through<00:00:55.559> all

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
real time I'm just gonna run through all

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.790 
real time I'm just gonna run through all
three<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> exercises<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> can

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
three of the exercises just so you can

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.650 
three of the exercises just so you can
sort<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.100> familiarize<00:00:59.520> yourself<00:01:00.359> with<00:01:00.420> them

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
sort of familiarize yourself with them

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.270 
sort of familiarize yourself with them
and<00:01:01.050> what<00:01:01.170> might<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.500> good<00:01:01.559> idea<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.250> you

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and what might be a good idea is if you

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.979 
and what might be a good idea is if you
just<00:01:02.550> start<00:01:02.820> marching<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> spot<00:01:03.690> whilst

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
just start marching on the spot whilst

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.539 
just start marching on the spot whilst
I'm<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.409> through<00:01:04.589> them<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.519> be

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
I'm going through them so that can be

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.250 
I'm going through them so that can be
your<00:01:05.729> warmup<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.330> then<00:01:06.750> when<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:06.930> get<00:01:07.049> ready

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
your warmup and then when we get ready

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.900 
your warmup and then when we get ready
to<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.680> 100<00:01:08.400> rep<00:01:08.729> workout

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.250 

so<00:01:12.910> for<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.120> first<00:01:13.300> exercise<00:01:13.660> with<00:01:13.960> you<00:01:14.110> this

amazing at turning heads in size so for

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.660 
amazing at turning heads in size so for
this<00:01:28.720> one<00:01:28.990> you<00:01:29.110> can<00:01:29.320> do<00:01:29.500> this<00:01:29.710> leaning<00:01:30.369> into

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
this one you can do this leaning into

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.190 
this one you can do this leaning into
the<00:01:30.850> wall<00:01:31.119> or<00:01:31.360> if<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:31.600> want<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.869> make<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.140> a

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
the wall or if you want to make it a

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.810 
the wall or if you want to make it a
little<00:01:32.320> bit<00:01:32.530> harder<00:01:32.830> you<00:01:32.860> come<00:01:33.250> down<00:01:33.400> onto<00:01:33.700> a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
little bit harder you come down onto a

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.900 
little bit harder you come down onto a
chair<00:01:34.210> or<00:01:34.540> a<00:01:34.570> firm<00:01:35.050> coffee<00:01:35.560> table<00:01:36.160> and<00:01:36.340> that

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
chair or a firm coffee table and that

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.400 
chair or a firm coffee table and that
obviously<00:01:37.090> just<00:01:37.510> makes<00:01:37.750> resistance<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.350> little

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
obviously just makes resistance a little

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.140 
obviously just makes resistance a little
bit<00:01:38.650> harder<00:01:38.950> instead<00:01:39.130> of<00:01:39.369> a<00:01:39.520> press<00:01:39.760> up<00:01:39.970> we're

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
bit harder instead of a press up we're

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.969 
bit harder instead of a press up we're
