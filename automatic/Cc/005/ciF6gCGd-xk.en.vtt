00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.530 

weld<00:00:41.320> it<00:00:41.560> unfreeze<00:00:42.250> and<00:00:42.640> freeze<00:00:43.270> the<00:00:43.420> other

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
weld it unfreeze and freeze the other

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.590 
weld it unfreeze and freeze the other
one<00:00:43.720> and<00:00:43.930> put<00:00:43.990> it<00:00:44.260> bit<00:00:45.100> higher<00:00:45.460> go<00:00:46.360> into<00:00:46.600> y<00:00:46.780> mode

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
one and put it bit higher go into y mode

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.680 
one and put it bit higher go into y mode
how<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.660> balls

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.720 

you<00:00:58.440> want<00:00:58.620> these<00:00:58.949> are<00:00:59.129> not<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.519> wired

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
you want these are not going to be wired

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.009 
you want these are not going to be wired
up<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> make<00:01:00.930> them<00:01:01.079> float<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
up it's just to make them float so and

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:10.450 
up it's just to make them float so and
now<00:01:04.019> go<00:01:04.470> into<00:01:04.619> frost

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.670 

500<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.730> bidirectional<00:01:12.480> so<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.650> go

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
500 and bidirectional so it can go

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.210 
500 and bidirectional so it can go
forwards<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.760> backwards<00:01:15.440> put<00:01:16.440> them<00:01:16.620> at<00:01:16.770> equal

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
forwards and backwards put them at equal

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.180 
forwards and backwards put them at equal
length<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.330> won't<00:01:18.630> go<00:01:18.870> in<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> circle<00:01:19.350> or<00:01:19.710> it

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
length so it won't go in a circle or it

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.870 
length so it won't go in a circle or it
won't<00:01:20.370> curve<00:01:21.950> go<00:01:22.950> up<00:01:23.220> into<00:01:24.980> gate<00:01:25.980> or<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.520> mithi

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
won't curve go up into gate or it mithi

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.350 
won't curve go up into gate or it mithi
and<00:01:27.150> here's<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.140> ad<00:01:28.260> chip<00:01:28.560> put<00:01:29.190> it<00:01:29.370> on<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and here's the ad chip put it on the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.469 
and here's the ad chip put it on the
plate<00:01:30.470> now<00:01:31.470> let's<00:01:31.680> go<00:01:31.860> down<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.070> button

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
plate now let's go down to button

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.320 
plate now let's go down to button
buttons<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:35.340> doesn't<00:01:35.610> really<00:01:35.760> matter<00:01:36.000> what

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
buttons it doesn't really matter what

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.140 
buttons it doesn't really matter what
they<00:01:36.450> look<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.660> it's<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.830> value<00:01:38.160> but<00:01:38.550> it's

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
they look like it's the value but it's

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.540 
they look like it's the value but it's
better<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.810> an<00:01:40.740> image<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.340> you

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
better to have an image so that you

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.670 
better to have an image so that you
remember<00:01:41.670> what<00:01:42.030> they<00:01:42.150> do<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.720> we're<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.560> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
remember what they do so we're going to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.810 
remember what they do so we're going to
do<00:01:43.890> down<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.840> value<00:01:46.050> on<00:01:46.490> value<00:01:47.490> has<00:01:47.790> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
do down and in the value on value has to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.780 
do down and in the value on value has to
be<00:01:48.090> minus<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.350> put<00:01:49.950> toggle<00:01:50.400> so<00:01:50.550> you<00:01:50.640> won't

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
be minus one and put toggle so you won't

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.020 
be minus one and put toggle so you won't
have<00:01:50.910> to<00:01:50.970> stay<00:01:51.300> e<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:52.500> don't<00:01:52.650> have<00:01:52.800> to<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
have to stay e you don't have to have a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.670 
have to stay e you don't have to have a
down<00:01:54.270> all<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> time<00:01:55.910> go<00:01:56.910> and<00:01:57.240> then<00:01:57.540> found<00:01:57.840> find

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
down all the time go and then found find

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.480 
down all the time go and then found find
up<00:01:59.060> and<00:02:00.080> put<00:02:01.080> one

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.830 

I<00:02:03.610> put<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.180> just<00:02:04.299> above<00:02:06.240> wires

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.040 

why<00:02:11.470> tool<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.780> put<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.830> value<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
why tool and put the a value to the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.880 
why tool and put the a value to the
button<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:18.550> B<00:02:18.760> value<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.129> other<00:02:21.280> one

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
button and the B value to the other one

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.199 
button and the B value to the other one
now<00:02:23.890> let's<00:02:24.400> link<00:02:24.700> up<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:27.129> a<00:02:27.160> value<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.700> one<00:02:27.910> of

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
now let's link up the a value of one of

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:37.619 
now let's link up the a value of one of
the<00:02:28.450> frost<00:02:29.170> seeeeee<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.319> other<00:02:35.500> one<00:02:36.629> you

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
the frost seeeeee and the other one you

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.340 
the frost seeeeee and the other one you
see

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.690 

so<00:02:42.000> what<00:02:43.000> their<00:02:43.210> ad<00:02:43.360> chip<00:02:44.170> does<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:44.710> it<00:02:45.460> takes

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
so what their ad chip does is it takes

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.340 
so what their ad chip does is it takes
the<00:02:46.740> boeuf<00:02:47.740> i'll<00:02:47.950> use<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.190> output<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.690> I'm

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
the boeuf i'll use that output it so I'm

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.550 
the boeuf i'll use that output it so I'm
out<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:50.890> button<00:02:51.190> is<00:02:51.280> outputting<00:02:51.730> one<00:02:51.910> and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
out this button is outputting one and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.500 
out this button is outputting one and
this<00:02:53.560> one's<00:02:53.800> outputting<00:02:54.400> minus<00:02:54.910> one<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.390> it'd

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
this one's outputting minus one so it'd

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.540 
this one's outputting minus one so it'd
be<00:02:55.570> 0<00:02:55.960> if<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.770> put<00:02:56.920> them<00:02:57.040> together<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.490> make

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
be 0 if you put them together and make

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.720 
be 0 if you put them together and make
Sarah<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.120> they<00:02:59.080> are<00:02:59.230> put<00:02:59.560> 0<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.070> both<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.580> them

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
Sarah and they are put 0 to both of them

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.710 
Sarah and they are put 0 to both of them
so<00:03:01.690> let's<00:03:02.080> say<00:03:02.740> we<00:03:02.770> want<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.130> go<00:03:03.250> backwards

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
so let's say we want to go backwards

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.350 
so let's say we want to go backwards
it's<00:03:04.720> outputting<00:03:05.110> minus<00:03:05.650> one<00:03:05.890> goes<00:03:06.880> into<00:03:07.240> the

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
it's outputting minus one goes into the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.920 
it's outputting minus one goes into the
can<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:07.810> on<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.680> sansa<00:03:09.100> as<00:03:09.280> putting<00:03:09.930> minus

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
can and on the sansa as putting minus

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.260 
can and on the sansa as putting minus
rust<00:03:11.230> so<00:03:11.800> minus<00:03:12.100> 500<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:15.040> let's<00:03:15.580> let<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.060> board

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
rust so minus 500 so let's let the board

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:23.870 
rust so minus 500 so let's let the board
go<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:17.200> plate<00:03:17.770> go<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:19.560> there<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.650> go<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:21.570> got

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
go the plate go and there you go you got

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.070 
go the plate go and there you go you got
you<00:03:24.880> got<00:03:25.030> a<00:03:25.090> little<00:03:25.210> flying<00:03:25.510> paid<00:03:28.080> more

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
you got a little flying paid more

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.880 
you got a little flying paid more
hovering<00:03:29.470> plate<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:30.700> let's<00:03:30.910> go<00:03:31.060> back<00:03:31.330> to<00:03:31.890> where

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
hovering plate so let's go back to where

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.410 
hovering plate so let's go back to where
we<00:03:33.040> were<00:03:33.070> i'm<00:03:33.640> going<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.820> show<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.210> water

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
we were i'm going to show you the water

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.750 
we were i'm going to show you the water
a<00:03:34.810> less<00:03:35.440> than<00:03:35.710> chip<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:37.060> for

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.030 

we're<00:03:41.330> going<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.540> do<00:03:41.659> it<00:03:41.750> here<00:03:44.170> so<00:03:45.170> now<00:03:45.470> go<00:03:45.769> up

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
we're going to do it here so now go up

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.290 
we're going to do it here so now go up
to

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.880 

to<00:03:51.870> Ranger<00:03:52.830> we're<00:03:53.250> going<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.430> put<00:03:53.550> 500<00:03:54.890> and

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
to Ranger we're going to put 500 and

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.480 
to Ranger we're going to put 500 and
value<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.460> show<00:03:57.210> beam<00:03:57.680> ignore<00:03:58.680> well<00:03:58.890> too<00:03:59.160> oh

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:08.660 

yeah<00:04:02.490> an<00:04:02.700> output<00:04:03.210> distance<00:04:04.700> but<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:05.910> now<00:04:07.670> so

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
yeah an output distance but that now so

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.140 
yeah an output distance but that now so
a<00:04:08.970> ranger<00:04:09.630> does<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> beam<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.790> value<00:04:12.060> you

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
a ranger does a beam of the value you

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.340 
a ranger does a beam of the value you
put<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:12.600> we've<00:04:12.780> put<00:04:12.960> 500<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.740> does<00:04:13.890> a<00:04:15.110> beam<00:04:16.110> of

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
put so we've put 500 it does a beam of

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.420 
put so we've put 500 it does a beam of
500<00:04:17.070> I<00:04:17.570> don't<00:04:18.570> know<00:04:18.720> what<00:04:18.930> 500<00:04:19.350> meters<00:04:20.010> since

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
500 I don't know what 500 meters since

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.840 
500 I don't know what 500 meters since
Peters<00:04:20.820> whatever<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:21.299> want<00:04:21.480> I<00:04:22.730> prefer<00:04:23.730> to

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
Peters whatever you want I prefer to

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.020 
Peters whatever you want I prefer to
think<00:04:24.390> of<00:04:25.320> them<00:04:25.380> of<00:04:25.620> meters<00:04:26.810> all<00:04:27.810> right<00:04:28.080> miss

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
think of them of meters all right miss

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.430 
think of them of meters all right miss
comparison<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.410> less<00:04:31.410> than<00:04:31.940> check<00:04:33.140> now<00:04:34.140> go

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
comparison and less than check now go

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.840 
comparison and less than check now go
down<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.830> constant<00:04:35.400> value<00:04:35.760> and<00:04:36.000> put<00:04:36.710> in<00:04:37.850> value

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
down to constant value and put in value

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.380 
down to constant value and put in value
1<00:04:39.120> 500<00:04:40.610> has<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.820> be<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.030> same<00:04:42.410> number<00:04:43.410> same<00:04:44.190> a

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
1 500 has to be the same number same a

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.170 
1 500 has to be the same number same a
distance<00:04:45.390> so<00:04:46.430> what<00:04:47.430> we're<00:04:47.550> going<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.760> do<00:04:47.910> is

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
distance so what we're going to do is

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.320 
distance so what we're going to do is
we're<00:04:48.480> going<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.630> link<00:04:48.870> them<00:04:49.020> both<00:04:49.230> up<00:04:50.030> so<00:04:51.030> a

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
we're going to link them both up so a

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.420 
we're going to link them both up so a
value<00:04:52.110> of<00:04:52.290> less<00:04:52.620> than<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.230> Ranger<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.010> the

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
value of less than to the Ranger and the

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.380 
value of less than to the Ranger and the
B<00:04:56.610> value<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:59.250> the<00:05:00.950> constant<00:05:01.950> value<00:05:02.280> so<00:05:02.790> what<00:05:03.300> it

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
B value to the constant value so what it

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.860 
B value to the constant value so what it
does<00:05:03.570> is<00:05:03.840> it<00:05:03.960> compares<00:05:04.530> takes<00:05:05.340> this<00:05:05.520> value<00:05:05.970> 500

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
does is it compares takes this value 500

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.350 
does is it compares takes this value 500
and<00:05:07.140> it<00:05:07.830> will<00:05:07.919> compare<00:05:08.250> it<00:05:08.340> to<00:05:08.460> this<00:05:08.610> one<00:05:08.820> so<00:05:09.180> if

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
and it will compare it to this one so if

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.030 
and it will compare it to this one so if
500<00:05:09.980> the<00:05:10.980> Ranger<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:12.419> Ranger<00:05:12.810> goes<00:05:12.990> down<00:05:13.350> so

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
500 the Ranger the Ranger goes down so

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.120 
500 the Ranger the Ranger goes down so
so<00:05:15.000> if<00:05:15.120> I<00:05:15.240> go<00:05:15.390> in<00:05:15.510> front<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:16.620> range<00:05:16.830> will<00:05:17.010> go

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
so if I go in front the range will go

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.710 
so if I go in front the range will go
down<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:18.260> on<00:05:19.260> and<00:05:19.890> all<00:05:20.250> put<00:05:21.090> out<00:05:21.240> a<00:05:21.270> value<00:05:21.690> of

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
down and on and all put out a value of

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.890 
down and on and all put out a value of
one<00:05:21.810> because<00:05:22.760> it's<00:05:23.760> not<00:05:23.970> 500<00:05:24.510> it's<00:05:24.660> not<00:05:24.810> the

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
one because it's not 500 it's not the

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.390 
one because it's not 500 it's not the
same<00:05:25.110> sort<00:05:25.860> same<00:05:26.100> value<00:05:26.630> ok<00:05:27.680> now<00:05:28.680> let's<00:05:28.980> go<00:05:29.340> to

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
same sort same value ok now let's go to

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.370 
same sort same value ok now let's go to
rear<00:05:29.610> up<00:05:29.700> to<00:05:29.940> tour<00:05:30.270> at<00:05:31.669> now<00:05:32.669> and<00:05:33.140> smelling<00:05:34.140> just

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
rear up to tour at now and smelling just

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.300 
rear up to tour at now and smelling just
over<00:05:34.710> it<00:05:35.000> now<00:05:36.000> let's<00:05:36.210> wire<00:05:36.419> up<00:05:36.660> fire<00:05:37.620> to<00:05:38.190> the

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
over it now let's wire up fire to the

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.060 
over it now let's wire up fire to the
chip<00:05:38.630> so<00:05:39.630> when<00:05:39.930> someone<00:05:40.110> passes<00:05:40.380> in<00:05:40.740> front<00:05:40.770> of

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
chip so when someone passes in front of

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.259 
chip so when someone passes in front of
it<00:05:41.220> it<00:05:41.640> shoots

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:43.269 
it it shoots

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:46.479 
it it shoots
thank<00:05:44.269> you<00:05:44.449> it's<00:05:44.869> that's<00:05:45.259> really<00:05:45.799> not<00:05:46.009> bad<00:05:46.069> for

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:46.489 
thank you it's that's really not bad for

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:50.109 
thank you it's that's really not bad for
deaf<00:05:46.669> matches<00:05:47.829> is<00:05:48.829> your<00:05:49.009> map<00:05:49.249> and<00:05:49.519> you<00:05:49.699> you

00:05:50.109 --> 00:05:50.119 
deaf matches is your map and you you

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:52.409 
deaf matches is your map and you you
make<00:05:50.269> a<00:05:50.299> little<00:05:50.599> fort<00:05:50.869> in<00:05:51.079> the<00:05:51.109> building<00:05:51.499> and

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
make a little fort in the building and

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:59.079 
make a little fort in the building and
you<00:05:53.419> salt<00:05:53.749> it<00:05:53.869> with<00:05:53.929> her<00:05:54.199> friends<00:05:56.829> and<00:05:57.969> you<00:05:58.969> can

00:05:59.079 --> 00:05:59.089 
you salt it with her friends and you can

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:05.409 
you salt it with her friends and you can
do<00:05:59.179> the<00:05:59.269> same<00:05:59.299> thing<00:05:59.749> but<00:05:59.959> with<00:06:00.129> explosives<00:06:04.419> so

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
do the same thing but with explosives so

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.839 
do the same thing but with explosives so
let's<00:06:05.989> take<00:06:06.379> off<00:06:06.559> the<00:06:06.589> wire<00:06:06.859> of<00:06:06.949> that<00:06:07.159> and<00:06:07.639> why

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
let's take off the wire of that and why

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:10.109 
let's take off the wire of that and why
not<00:06:07.909> detonator<00:06:08.539> to<00:06:09.049> the<00:06:09.259> less<00:06:09.529> than<00:06:09.739> chip

00:06:10.109 --> 00:06:10.119 
not detonator to the less than chip

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.989 
not detonator to the less than chip
that's<00:06:11.119> really<00:06:11.929> not<00:06:12.049> bad<00:06:12.109> for<00:06:12.589> four<00:06:13.579> if<00:06:13.699> it's<00:06:13.879> a

00:06:13.989 --> 00:06:13.999 
that's really not bad for four if it's a

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:16.209 
that's really not bad for four if it's a
big<00:06:14.209> passage<00:06:14.689> and<00:06:14.959> you're<00:06:15.109> not<00:06:15.199> sure<00:06:15.259> if<00:06:15.619> it<00:06:15.799> if

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:16.219 
big passage and you're not sure if it if

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:18.729 
big passage and you're not sure if it if
the<00:06:16.519> if<00:06:17.029> it<00:06:17.209> will<00:06:17.299> be<00:06:17.329> straight<00:06:17.779> or<00:06:18.049> something

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:18.739 
the if it will be straight or something

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:21.069 
the if it will be straight or something
like<00:06:18.860> that<00:06:18.919> or<00:06:19.309> if<00:06:19.429> there's<00:06:19.669> a<00:06:19.729> turn<00:06:20.479> you<00:06:20.869> think

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:21.079 
like that or if there's a turn you think

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:24.999 
like that or if there's a turn you think
people<00:06:21.289> can<00:06:21.619> like<00:06:22.249> jump<00:06:22.610> over<00:06:22.969> it<00:06:23.679> you<00:06:24.679> can<00:06:24.829> put

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.009 
people can like jump over it you can put

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:27.159 
people can like jump over it you can put
like<00:06:25.219> two<00:06:25.789> so<00:06:26.209> that<00:06:26.360> people<00:06:26.659> can't<00:06:26.869> go<00:06:26.989> under

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
like two so that people can't go under

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.549 
like two so that people can't go under
it<00:06:27.289> or<00:06:27.499> over<00:06:27.799> it<00:06:27.919> so<00:06:28.899> that<00:06:29.899> is<00:06:30.079> really<00:06:30.379> useful

00:06:30.549 --> 00:06:30.559 
it or over it so that is really useful

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:33.279 
it or over it so that is really useful
so<00:06:31.099> those<00:06:31.429> are<00:06:31.579> the<00:06:31.610> two<00:06:32.179> useful<00:06:32.659> things<00:06:33.110> that

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289
