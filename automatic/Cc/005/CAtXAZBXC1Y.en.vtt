for<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.290> v6<00:03:26.769> this<00:03:27.849> this<00:03:28.849> wasn't<00:03:29.150> such<00:03:29.449> a<00:03:29.479> great

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
for the v6 this this wasn't such a great

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.249 
for the v6 this this wasn't such a great
engine<00:03:30.109> from<00:03:30.349> what<00:03:30.530> I<00:03:30.560> understand<00:03:32.199> it<00:03:33.199> was

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:33.259 
engine from what I understand it was

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.249 
engine from what I understand it was
pretty<00:03:33.590> inefficient<00:03:34.479> pretty<00:03:35.479> gutless<00:03:35.959> and

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:36.259 
pretty inefficient pretty gutless and

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:39.909 
pretty inefficient pretty gutless and
I've<00:03:37.189> heard<00:03:37.909> head<00:03:38.540> gasket<00:03:39.019> issues<00:03:39.409> I<00:03:39.620> don't

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
I've heard head gasket issues I don't

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.129 
I've heard head gasket issues I don't
know<00:03:40.009> I've<00:03:40.189> never<00:03:40.340> actually<00:03:40.579> owned<00:03:41.000> one<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:42.079> I

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
know I've never actually owned one so I

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.399 
know I've never actually owned one so I
can't<00:03:42.409> make<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.650> fair<00:03:43.009> statement<00:03:43.400> but<00:03:43.759> I<00:03:44.409> can't

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
can't make a fair statement but I can't

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.479 
can't make a fair statement but I can't
say<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.949> 1kz<00:03:46.370> is<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.849> good<00:03:47.180> engine<00:03:47.599> and<00:03:47.840> it

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
say that the 1kz is a good engine and it

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.890 
say that the 1kz is a good engine and it
you<00:03:49.489> know<00:03:49.609> there's<00:03:50.150> a<00:03:50.209> reason<00:03:50.419> everybody

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
you know there's a reason everybody

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.629 
you know there's a reason everybody
talks<00:03:51.229> so<00:03:51.439> highly<00:03:51.769> of<00:03:51.799> it<00:03:52.040> it's<00:03:52.280> a<00:03:52.310> good<00:03:52.489> engine

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
talks so highly of it it's a good engine

00:03:52.639 --> 00:04:01.869 
talks so highly of it it's a good engine
they<00:03:53.150> still<00:03:53.419> use<00:03:53.629> it<00:03:53.780> today<00:04:00.639> that's<00:04:01.639> kind<00:04:01.849> of

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
they still use it today that's kind of

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.090 
they still use it today that's kind of
cool

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
cool

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.560

I don't know I've never actually seen

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.340 
I don't know I've never actually seen
that<00:04:04.600> that's<00:04:05.020> what<00:04:05.170> my<00:04:05.290> truck<00:04:05.530> looks<00:04:05.740> like<00:04:08.550> hmm

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
that that's what my truck looks like hmm

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.170 
that that's what my truck looks like hmm
maybe<00:04:11.350> that's<00:04:11.530> on<00:04:11.770> a<00:04:11.800> gas<00:04:12.010> one<00:04:12.430> maybe<00:04:12.940> that's

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
maybe that's on a gas one maybe that's

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.940 
maybe that's on a gas one maybe that's
what<00:04:13.330> that<00:04:13.360> is<00:04:14.220> I'm<00:04:15.220> not<00:04:15.370> sure<00:04:16.890> here's<00:04:17.890> a

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
what that is I'm not sure here's a

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.000 
what that is I'm not sure here's a
little<00:04:18.130> picture<00:04:18.340> of<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.520> chassis<00:04:19.800> so<00:04:20.800> you<00:04:20.890> got

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
little picture of the chassis so you got

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.830 
little picture of the chassis so you got
the<00:04:21.100> class<00:04:21.430> all<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:21.850> acts<00:04:22.030> on<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.300> back<00:04:22.450> coil

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
the class all the acts on the back coil

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.680 
the class all the acts on the back coil
sprung<00:04:23.170> not<00:04:23.440> leaf<00:04:23.680> springs<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.340> in<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.390> front

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
sprung not leaf springs and in the front

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.630 
sprung not leaf springs and in the front
you<00:04:25.990> have<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.200> double<00:04:26.560> wishbone<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:27.130> depending

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
you have a double wishbone and depending

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.360 
you have a double wishbone and depending
on<00:04:27.850> either<00:04:28.450> side<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:29.200> believe<00:04:29.950> they're<00:04:30.340> using

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
on either side I believe they're using

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.470 
on either side I believe they're using
torsion<00:04:31.090> bars<00:04:35.070> my<00:04:36.070> truck<00:04:36.340> has<00:04:36.550> this<00:04:36.880> I<00:04:37.180> don't

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
torsion bars my truck has this I don't

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.480 
torsion bars my truck has this I don't
think<00:04:37.570> it<00:04:37.780> works<00:04:37.960> anymore<00:04:38.260> not<00:04:38.590> not<00:04:39.070> once<00:04:39.250> all

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
think it works anymore not not once all

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.040 
think it works anymore not not once all
the<00:04:39.580> shocks<00:04:39.880> have<00:04:40.060> been<00:04:40.210> replaced<00:04:40.600> anyways

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
the shocks have been replaced anyways

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.440 
the shocks have been replaced anyways
right<00:04:41.520> here's<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.610> different<00:04:43.030> wheels<00:04:43.180> you

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
right here's the different wheels you

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.550 
right here's the different wheels you
could<00:04:43.570> get<00:04:43.780> that's<00:04:44.260> what<00:04:44.380> I've<00:04:44.470> got<00:04:46.560> mines

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
could get that's what I've got mines

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.030 
could get that's what I've got mines
operated<00:04:48.340> though<00:04:48.460> I've<00:04:48.580> got<00:04:48.730> a<00:04:48.760> 33<00:04:49.600> inch<00:04:50.040> by

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
operated though I've got a 33 inch by

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.990 
operated though I've got a 33 inch by
ten<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.460> a<00:04:51.550> half<00:04:51.730> on<00:04:52.030> that<00:04:56.670> yeah<00:04:57.670> here's<00:04:57.940> a

to turn the four-wheel drive on on these

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.360 
to turn the four-wheel drive on on these
there's<00:05:08.440> just<00:05:08.620> a<00:05:08.710> button<00:05:08.890> on<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.100> side<00:05:09.250> of

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
there's just a button on the side of

all the different models SS RG wide-body

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.670 
all the different models SS RG wide-body
that'd<00:06:18.580> be<00:06:18.700> the<00:06:18.820> top<00:06:19.090> of<00:06:19.120> the<00:06:19.330> line<00:06:19.680> with

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
that'd be the top of the line with

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.580 
that'd be the top of the line with
Recaros<00:06:21.190> and<00:06:21.400> cruise<00:06:21.580> control<00:06:22.030> and<00:06:22.470> then<00:06:23.470> you

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
Recaros and cruise control and then you

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.690 
Recaros and cruise control and then you
have<00:06:23.710> my<00:06:23.919> truck<00:06:24.220> SS<00:06:24.700> rx<00:06:25.120> wide-body

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
have my truck SS rx wide-body

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.440 
have my truck SS rx wide-body

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
which lacks Recaros and cruise control

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.600 
which lacks Recaros and cruise control
then<00:06:31.450> you<00:06:31.570> go<00:06:31.690> down<00:06:31.870> to<00:06:32.020> the<00:06:32.110> SS<00:06:32.470> RV<00:06:32.950> wide-body

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
then you go down to the SS RV wide-body

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.280 
then you go down to the SS RV wide-body
and<00:06:34.600> with<00:06:35.260> these<00:06:35.470> ones<00:06:35.830> I<00:06:36.600> think<00:06:37.600> they're<00:06:38.139> all

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
and with these ones I think they're all

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:44.280 
and with these ones I think they're all
gas<00:06:40.200> the<00:06:41.200> wheels<00:06:41.440> are<00:06:41.680> different<00:06:42.010> to<00:06:42.870> SSR<00:06:43.870> X<00:06:44.110> is

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
gas the wheels are different to SSR X is

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.840 
gas the wheels are different to SSR X is
normal<00:06:44.740> body<00:06:44.860> so<00:06:45.310> it<00:06:45.370> doesn't<00:06:45.580> have<00:06:45.669> the<00:06:45.760> big

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:45.850 
normal body so it doesn't have the big

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.840 
normal body so it doesn't have the big
fender<00:06:46.240> flairs<00:06:46.419> I<00:06:47.460> think<00:06:48.460> those<00:06:48.550> hundred

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850 
fender flairs I think those hundred

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
players look great too I love them it's

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.909 
players look great too I love them it's
what<00:06:52.300> makes<00:06:52.480> it<00:06:52.690> pop<00:06:52.870> stand<00:06:53.260> out<00:06:53.440> against<00:06:53.800> all

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
what makes it pop stand out against all

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:55.620 
what makes it pop stand out against all
the<00:06:54.040> forerunners<00:06:54.550> it's<00:06:54.790> just<00:06:55.000> like<00:06:55.180> whoa<00:06:55.360> that

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.990 
the forerunners it's just like whoa that

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.580 
I can't read their dimensions kind of
cool<00:07:19.419> to<00:07:19.570> have<00:07:19.720> this<00:07:19.900> kind<00:07:20.110> of<00:07:20.200> stuff<00:07:20.470> because
