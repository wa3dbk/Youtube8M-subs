00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.309
 The problem is not to drink too much. 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.580
 she does after she drinks a lot of it 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.770
 Then there's a woman with a baby to 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.439
 crazy silly amount of faith 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.990
 people to expose themselves in a negative way 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.720
 scream and things that bother 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.519
 Now the woman who drinks a lot think 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.320
 woman today has been drinking as a man 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.630
 so there's not much difference 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.040
 this problem is the man who drinks 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.980
 world also crawling on the floor 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.980
 problem is what you do when you drink a lot 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.719
 I think the woman who arrives provoking 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.230
 a subject to talk some 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.500
 anything whatever is an initiative 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.750
 I think it's good now it's sung. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.719
 vulgar does not 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.280
 mudalen shy Turin because man 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.160
 in a way if he takes a sung 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 per gal he is intimidated 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.760
 I already saw a woman ironing her hand and a man 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.760
 and the guys do not like not like movies 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.000
 in the ballad is the ballad is a little bit 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.130
 more complicated because not give to 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.550
 talking a lot in general already has a lot 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.120
 music is the other has a lot of confusion 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.080
 a lot of information happening but she has 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.150
 that draw attention in a way that 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.550
 positive face 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.400
 I think it's a lot with the way of 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.520
 expressing body would look at a 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.750
 smile and then why the guy if he 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.230
 corresponds 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.230
 I think it's this 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:58.920
 If he does not have to push me away, do not you? 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.620
 I think this logic has people who 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.230
 must be a handsome guy is not because the 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.840
 chicks does not give peace to him and he 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.429
 can not take the initiative 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.470
 Do you like that I do not have a person who 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.340
 has no initiative that is not there for 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.380
 I love you 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.610
 there was never one with a history 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.130
 so the person knows to impose even silver 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.600
 on your side do not have to know in 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.450
 powys is in the relationship 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.880
 careful you do not know if you impose or 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.410
 Is he liking it? I will not be there. 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.410
 causing this there 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.970
 with exercises can not do some 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:47.580
 thing on the dance floor specifically 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.340
 Our woman is very 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.520
 we want to draw attention to the action 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.650
 as soon as you mind because you want 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.880
 appear anyway is medium 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.710
 negative 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.100
 I have a rather negative impression 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.100
 of this
