00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 welcome all friends of 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.279
 cellphone magazine are andrea bocchetti 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.830
 and I'm here today with Stefano 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.050
 cavallaro hi guys we are in the stand 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.290
 by samsung mobile world congress because 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.130
 andrea because we are here to focus 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.430
 on the interface of the new samsung 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.990
 galaxy s a renewed touch wiz 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.230
 as you can see there are a lot less 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.689
 applications compared to the galaxy s 5 or ad 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.880
 example note four and are divided 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.470
 There are macro practitioners in the macro category 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.179
 standard applications then telephone 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.710
 phonebook internet messages 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.390
 then there are the applications instead 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.670
 samsung have not been remarkably 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.010
 in fact, there are only few 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.010
 four or five are these here and 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.870
 this for a reason of lightening 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.420
 of software in the sense that many users 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.770
 they complained that there was 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.329
 have been too much application 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.950
 within the old software e 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.480
 they had to be canceled 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.449
 having said that we also find the applications 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.789
 google inside android are fixed 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.350
 they are impossible to delete there are 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.239
 those microsoft applications that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.949
 I am the novelty of this 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.610
 guarantee if you are in fact we find one 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.070
 drive the microsoft one note cloud for 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.590
 take notes and skype to do the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.409
 calls via voip we also find the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.409
 social section where we find facebook 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.409
 instagram messenger and whatsapp like 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.020
 also on the lot with the other big one 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.509
 new in this galaxy s 6 and the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.630
 possibility to apply themes 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.780
 we have the one defined and then those of 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.450
 default as pink space is possible 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.070
 download more from the theme store 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.049
 so the developers yes 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.799
 they will worry about creating new themes 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.110
 and so you can beautify yours 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.730
 fantuz if we tell you that samsung 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.950
 from this point of view 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.360
 seeing greater freedom of choice with 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.140
 users to personalize their own 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.790
 phone 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.630
 absolutely yes there will be no more need 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.700
 to install driver or not go lancer 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.289
 other similar ones but if you can make a handyman from 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.850
 from the theme store and download those 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.890
 that we like the most without having to stay 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.450
 there to change both the icons and the menu 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.729
 both the animations among other things 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.310
 animations have changed slightly 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.980
 android 5.0 was obviously introduced 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.040
 lollipop some change from the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.849
 However, the drop-down menu remains similar 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.920
 so there are no big news 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.970
 here among other things I also see 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.370
 the more you are now playing with 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.530
 the user interface is one of the things 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.569
 that in short was often imputed to 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.549
 samsung is to make good phones 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.860
 however with some the apt and above all 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.230
 in early versions of software while 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.940
 here it seems to me that everything is reactive 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.260
 what do you say yes absolutely to 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.299
 moment it all seems reactive then 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.160
 obviously like every phone must be tried 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.900
 for a few weeks to be able to 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.060
 to judge the big problem of 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.069
 samsung phones the low end ones 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.519
 and the very fact that using it there 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.900
 maybe weeks we find ourselves again 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.299
 then dealing with ge 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.099
 jamming that still annoys 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.530
 to the user who buys the phones and there 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.910
 I try for you we say it to say the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.420
 truth that this is a problem 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.310
 shared some from all phones a 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.230
 all devices such as non- card 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.730
 and from home that I really want to 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.280
 format it these days because a 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.870
 sometimes it gives me problems can wait though 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.140
 in short, this is so loaded 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.510
 stuff that maybe better to give up 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.450
 absolute but we can say there is more 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.909
 other not at the moment no as focus on 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.610
 these are the main changes the 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.830
 app from microsoft are the most novelty 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.470
 important therefore samsung that yes yes 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.159
 moves more and more towards other partners 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.319
 almost to break away from google is the case 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.750
 the development of the 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.090
 operating system tyson off and that 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.299
 obviously not about the galaxy 6 but 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.190
 maybe other models coming in 2015 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.540
 and who knows maybe even some tops of 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.129
 In short, we do what we can 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.200
 also read some small signals 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:59.670
 strategic from the interface choices 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:02.700
 I would say absolutely good user for 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.440
 the moment is all thanks to andrea che 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.409
 It has done this always accurate video 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.590
 as usual we'll see each other 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.010
 deepening 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.010
 see you soon
