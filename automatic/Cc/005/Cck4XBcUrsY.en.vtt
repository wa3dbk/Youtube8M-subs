00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.429
 I get you from Silfhout last year 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.110
 shortly before the world equestrian games in room 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.980
 call from national coach wim ernes you 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.449
 must drive to it must be huge 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.970
 have had an impact on you 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.619
 who re fantastic enter but had and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.660
 also no pressure because you were the windows 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.760
 who had to go shortly before the event 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.199
 drive now things are very different to you 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.840
 have arrived have hope 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.180
 competition that wants to go to the ek in Aachen 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.250
 how are you going to handle that 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.930
 start to stay calm and i think 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.850
 it is very important to order 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.430
 look at your horse and your buildup whole 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.200
 quietly we deliberately opted for one 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.559
 after Amsterdam and Den Bosch a short one 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.170
 and to break for it again 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.250
 to get to the start first and yes me 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.140
 think very important to you 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.270
 very easy to do and to build up 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.949
 watching from match to match and 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.149
 step by step 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.579
 So you have a few high on puberty 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.870
 the list for this year 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.030
 absolutely the most important event 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.200
 for us this year but ultimately 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.260
 we look further to next year 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.060
 play left and what role does the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.220
 signal your rotterdam in that structure to 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.299
 make any 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.979
 no it is of course again for me 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.290
 first game after the short break and me 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.350
 think that collective bargaining is very important to me 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.780
 because of course it's a competition you 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.270
 high quality is a busy job with the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.409
 with a lot to do and a good time 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.020
 to see where you stand in you 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.549
 training and what needs to be changed 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.380
 now you have to deal with a lot 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.950
 competition this year is yes to as one 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.439
 bit around the same score with one 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.060
 combinations or three four how do you handle it 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.619
 with that pressure 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.970
 well i think you challenge yourself 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.020
 must impress because of another 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.430
 you can't do anything i think you should 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.820
 ensure that you yourself increase your percent 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.380
 just by driving better and 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.200
 tell something about the park avoided 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.939
 does arlando nh nop it's a few 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.229
 everyone says well what does it have 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.200
 in talent and that's that one 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.090

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.939
 for a push on you if you know that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.350
 horse can always take as much of course 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.550
 driving a certain pressure 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.690
 of course a horse for owners 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.850

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.560

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.610
 horse of course you have to train 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.440
 and om was measured 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.150
 to be able to come out it's a couple with 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.890
 with an incredible amount of talent for heavy 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.140
 work passage piaf a pirouette is that 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.660

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.210
 a couple with a lot of commitment 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.460
 and a cooperative nature and with that 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.570
 is also beautiful so what do we want 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.190
 more 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.770

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.560
