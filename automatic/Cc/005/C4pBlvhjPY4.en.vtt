 m 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.920
 2 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.720
 he passed 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.160
 with us I hope everything happens 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.140
 well I have not yet to follow the 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.850
 singer milow will be in interview and in 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.900
 acoustic performance but for everything from 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.160
 next I will tell you about an owl 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.200
 story that happened this week 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.279
 the french humorist gad elmaleh 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.529
 mentioning that they know vaguely 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.980
 especially something I always have 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.820
 thought you like gad elmaleh 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.110
 when I learned to read some 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.300
 big surprises to see who was called 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.920
 gad and he's going to play the olympia genre 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.480
 8000 date about 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.070
 and to give young people a chance 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.989
 comedians who did a contest for 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.879
 able to insure his first part having 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.220
 more than 1000 humorist who send him 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.500
 a video on youtube and all the 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.269
 comedians had necessarily only one winner 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.309
 is this a young stan of French ports 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.049
 which is called media saad and look at a 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.409
 extract of style and personality 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.280
 incidentally from this media the problem 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.479
 is that this is my grandmother like this 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.650
 from someone who grew up at the meeting 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.269
 okay for a few years every 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.710
 legends she knows all the myths and 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.820
 she believes in it and he will not try to 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.119
 lie to reassure you because you are 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.680
 a child 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.180
 I wake up in the morning I was scared 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.710
 I say granny I heard noises 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.729
 that night I 'm not going to sleep and the 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.220
 fight and did the normal dishes 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.340
 years it's nothing that it had to be the 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.340
 Devil 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.440
 okay abbas has nice name but it was 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.509
 the fact of not knowing actually a weapon 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:29.580
 and want nothing just your soul I 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.130
 it can give him nothing more than a 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.520
 soul in everyday life in 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.520
 the issue 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.630
 we did well to avoid guarding your 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.630
 square 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.470
 so how's it going so the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.820
 butterflies just learned it 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.380
 does that a few days no you know 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.940
 you will do that 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.380
 frankly I'm afraid would not you 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.459
 lie I hope even in my room I 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.709
 even train in my room I 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.990
 afraid because it's a chance 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.520
 amazing actually that makes me comfortable and gad 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.200
 elmaleh you see and how it was 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.459
 past you knew it so you have 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.150
 want the video you expect you 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.280
 live your life 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.680
 and then suddenly what kind of where 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.910
 receives an SMS from gad elmaleh and have it 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:39.640
 did or did not know that a sms can 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:40.600
 make it bleed in fact it was he 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.640
 was super cool 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.500
 he wrote to me truthfully bravo yields 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.330
 congratulations go to olympia 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.320
 look forward to meeting you there I redid 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.540
 geese and he was super nice because he 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.430
 he said he signed gad elmaleh 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.100
 you know in cash that traits two guys 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.269
 who do the Olympian in not long 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.709
 I could have confused avoiding the 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.260
 confusion and so that means because it's 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:08.860
 technically it's towards this sms to gad 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.970
 elmaleh you have and I admit I confess 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.560
 I laughed litigations to make 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.640
 jokes that's what I say but at 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.440
 every time I tell myself it's me 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.530
 you never forget that a great power 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.370
 involves great responsibilities and 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.180
 I want to make him say everything about 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.320
 same time what could I 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.690
 do I not send him a selphy 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.290
 in the bathroom 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.120
 we talk to each other at pia and then I'm even 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.770
 not sure whether it's really him who 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.420
 sent me the asm is it was a 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.610
 assistant you see and I am cowardly to 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.570
 background in gmail that's good and it's 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.560
 find on the other side it's a guy with 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.920
 a big beard that is there that makes 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.510
 tease 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.510
 what are we doing he answered this con 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.300
 but it's not me I know what 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.790
 would happen if I had the gad number 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.510
 elmaleh his students no no I'm not going 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.150
 use it 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:58.810
 and then she is we are in a party 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:04:10.210
 and then around 3 am on the call 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:13.500
 that families are hiding 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.500
 Pezenas and the waves 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:23.130
 did you sometimes drink 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.750
 alcohol 5 billion I do not drink 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.400
 of alcohol excellent decision is stopped 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.389
 since the gad elmaleh number and in 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.460
 the more I say it's young 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.720
 comedians who have a chance but you 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.430
 did you still have a few years 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.540
 that you do that I soon have 50 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.889
 years has already happened but it's 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.210
 always annoying that desire to someone 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.740
 I do it again you do that 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.130
 really makes rosette hams not known 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.780
 while you make samples 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.889
 about what it's because at the beginning when 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.860
 you start at the stand up it's like 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.840
 a year or two you say you grow your age 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.520
 you see it's been 5 years 6 years you see and 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.020
 then when it comes to 7 years 8 years you 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.550
 say you decrease shooting stand up 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.660
 when you know how shameful it is 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.700
 does seven years later I do that and 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.840
 no one yet knows you see them 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.720
 docks there if we ask the question that makes 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.410
 three years she next it will do 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.790
 six months and what can happen 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.169
 what are you hoping for the experience 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.250
 so by the yardstick of people that there are people 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.789
 in the room but it should go 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.830
 Normally we cross fingers gal 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.870
 elmaleh should fill the room that can 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.430
 really change career I do not know 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.960
 I know I do not want to put me 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.490
 hopes that are not coming to me I hope 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.110
 just that people discover to me that they 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.760
 discover my humor that they appreciate 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.930
 and here he let me know a little 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.180
 more to make my style known is my 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.680
 humor and thank you gad elmaleh what ben yes 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.760
 thanks to el maleh for choosing him from 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.760
 him while I had sent a video 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.810
 in slow and so is meanwhile 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.630
 I imagine that these workouts 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.220
 overtraining overtraining yeah I 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.720
 see I'm going to work a lot I'm going 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.039
 write valves we will do something 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.300
 square for him to be happy with 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.860
 decide to take me back 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.530
 or else I will participate in the next 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.210
 competition another group in my opinion that 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.500
 would be surprising if the profile compete 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.030
 second end what am I going to pick 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.590
 the first is the one found 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.000
 that they had not worked enough we are going to him 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.070
 give it a chance to really do that 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.090
 I'm not sure if I'll be happy to regain 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.280
 the same contest too would be shame 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.750
 you see buzz is simple if one day you 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.220
 succeed super strong what are you going 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.630
