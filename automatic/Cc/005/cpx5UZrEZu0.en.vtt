00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the nav card is at where how to find all

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560 
the nav card is at where how to find all
the<00:00:28.800> pieces<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.310> build<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.640> nav<00:00:29.820> card<00:00:30.150> machine

and then what my theory is or how the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.139 
and then what my theory is or how the
nav<00:00:33.899> cards<00:00:34.260> work<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.640> finally<00:00:36.090> start

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
nav cards work so we can finally start

card<00:01:07.110> machine<00:01:07.409> at<00:01:07.530> all<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.890> will<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.189> showing

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
card machine at all so I will be showing

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.190 
card machine at all so I will be showing
you<00:01:08.520> guys<00:01:08.700> how<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.330> build<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:09.990> basically

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you guys how to build it and basically

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.380 
you guys how to build it and basically
my<00:01:10.619> theory<00:01:11.010> behind<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.909> couple<00:01:12.119> of

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
my theory behind it and a couple of

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.130 
my theory behind it and a couple of
other<00:01:12.540> little<00:01:12.840> gameplay<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.250> background

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
other little gameplay in the background

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.749 
other little gameplay in the background
so<00:01:16.140> yeah<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.530> should<00:01:16.890> get<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.070> going<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:17.670> in

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
so yeah we should get that going here in

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.850 
so yeah we should get that going here in
a<00:01:17.850> second<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:18.930> another<00:01:19.229> thing<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.560> wanted<00:01:19.799> to

about now I'm gonna be moving on to my

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.560 
about now I'm gonna be moving on to my
theory<00:03:40.709> now<00:03:41.250> my<00:03:41.400> whole<00:03:41.610> nav<00:03:41.820> card<00:03:42.090> theory<00:03:42.420> is

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
theory now my whole nav card theory is

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.039 
theory now my whole nav card theory is
gonna<00:03:42.750> be<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:43.190> now<00:03:44.190> as<00:03:44.549> a<00:03:44.940> community<00:03:45.209> we<00:03:45.840> all

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
gonna be this now as a community we all

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.199 
gonna be this now as a community we all
thought<00:03:46.320> nav<00:03:46.650> card<00:03:46.980> meant<00:03:47.190> navigation<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.030> it

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
thought nav card meant navigation and it

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.350 
thought nav card meant navigation and it
does<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.690> certain<00:03:49.110> extent<00:03:49.500> now<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:50.220> know<00:03:51.060> this

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
does to a certain extent now I know this

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.720 
does to a certain extent now I know this
part<00:03:51.600> as<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.780> fact<00:03:52.079> navigation<00:03:52.890> card<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.610> know

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
part as a fact navigation card you know

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.460 
part as a fact navigation card you know
we<00:03:53.910> all<00:03:54.060> thought<00:03:54.299> maybe<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.750> led<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:55.049> second

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
we all thought maybe it led to a second

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.610 
we all thought maybe it led to a second
bus<00:03:55.680> maybe<00:03:56.579> it<00:03:56.790> was<00:03:56.910> another<00:03:57.180> route<00:03:57.510> we<00:03:58.200> had<00:03:58.320> no

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
bus maybe it was another route we had no

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.410 
bus maybe it was another route we had no
idea<00:03:58.650> what<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.370> nav<00:03:59.549> car<00:03:59.790> machine<00:04:00.090> builds

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
idea what the nav car machine builds

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.060 
idea what the nav car machine builds
because<00:04:00.570> we<00:04:00.930> all<00:04:01.079> know<00:04:01.290> when<00:04:01.500> we<00:04:01.590> build<00:04:01.829> an<00:04:01.950> app

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
because we all know when we build an app

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.069 
because we all know when we build an app
card<00:04:02.340> machine<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:03.269> we<00:04:03.390> try<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.720> put<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.900> nav

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
card machine and we try and put the nav

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.930 
card machine and we try and put the nav
card<00:04:04.350> into<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.860> says<00:04:05.040> wrong<00:04:05.340> nav<00:04:05.640> card

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
card into it it says wrong nav card

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.880 
card into it it says wrong nav card
please<00:04:06.180> like<00:04:06.780> please<00:04:06.810> insert<00:04:07.380> another<00:04:07.680> one

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
please like please insert another one

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.680 
please like please insert another one
incorrect<00:04:08.880> nav<00:04:09.060> card<00:04:09.329> so<00:04:09.480> then<00:04:09.600> we

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
incorrect nav card so then we

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.710 
incorrect nav card so then we
immediately<00:04:09.900> thought<00:04:10.650> that<00:04:10.950> well<00:04:11.940> you<00:04:12.690> know

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
immediately thought that well you know

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.120 
immediately thought that well you know
there<00:04:12.959> had<00:04:13.079> to<00:04:13.110> be<00:04:13.230> there<00:04:13.739> had<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:13.950> be<00:04:14.070> another

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
there had to be there had to be another

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.180 
there had to be there had to be another
nav<00:04:14.610> card<00:04:14.910> now<00:04:15.229> this<00:04:16.229> is<00:04:16.410> my<00:04:16.530> theory<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.130> I

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
nav card now this is my theory and I

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.159 
nav card now this is my theory and I
think<00:04:17.430> it's<00:04:17.579> a<00:04:17.640> very<00:04:17.880> very<00:04:18.150> amazing<00:04:18.750> theory

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
think it's a very very amazing theory

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.370 
think it's a very very amazing theory
that<00:04:19.709> you<00:04:19.919> guys<00:04:20.100> will<00:04:20.340> really<00:04:20.519> really<00:04:20.790> enjoy

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
that you guys will really really enjoy

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.010 
that you guys will really really enjoy
now<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.680> basically<00:04:23.190> had<00:04:24.060> no<00:04:24.270> idea<00:04:24.630> what<00:04:24.780> nav

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
now I basically had no idea what nav

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.730 
now I basically had no idea what nav
meant<00:04:25.320> so<00:04:25.710> I<00:04:25.740> just<00:04:26.070> typed<00:04:26.310> in

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
meant so I just typed in

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.800

Google<00:04:29.139> Chrome<00:04:29.380> and<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.860> first<00:04:30.069> thing<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:30.400> got

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
Google Chrome and the first thing I got

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.070 
Google Chrome and the first thing I got
was<00:04:31.289> nav<00:04:32.289> financial<00:04:33.039> term<00:04:33.419> net<00:04:34.419> assessed

was nav financial term net assessed

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.800 
was nav financial term net assessed
value<00:04:35.740> now<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.580> probably<00:04:37.030> thought<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:37.539> was<00:04:37.569> just

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
value now I probably thought I was just

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.240 
value now I probably thought I was just
thinking<00:04:38.139> well<00:04:38.259> this<00:04:38.410> is<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.560> financial<00:04:39.099> term

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
thinking well this is a financial term

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.309 
thinking well this is a financial term
has<00:04:39.400> nothing<00:04:39.789> to<00:04:39.910> relate<00:04:40.150> to<00:04:40.210> Cod<00:04:40.509> but<00:04:41.169> then<00:04:41.289> I

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
has nothing to relate to Cod but then I

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.770 
has nothing to relate to Cod but then I
took<00:04:41.500> a<00:04:41.650> look<00:04:41.949> where<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.250> nav<00:04:42.430> card<00:04:42.729> is<00:04:42.880> at<00:04:43.060> now

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
took a look where the nav card is at now

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.390 
took a look where the nav card is at now
when<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.080> guys<00:04:44.229> saw<00:04:44.500> when<00:04:44.710> I<00:04:44.740> was<00:04:44.919> playing<00:04:45.160> and

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
when you guys saw when I was playing and

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.980 
when you guys saw when I was playing and
I<00:04:45.460> picked<00:04:45.669> up<00:04:45.759> the<00:04:45.910> nav<00:04:46.090> card<00:04:46.389> you<00:04:46.599> guys<00:04:46.810> will

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
I picked up the nav card you guys will

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.020 
I picked up the nav card you guys will
see<00:04:47.199> right<00:04:47.830> where<00:04:48.099> it<00:04:48.250> was<00:04:48.370> located

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
see right where it was located

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.120 
see right where it was located
it<00:04:49.270> was<00:04:49.419> located<00:04:49.960> right<00:04:50.169> next<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:50.650> my<00:04:50.770> point

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
it was located right next to my point

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.279 
it was located right next to my point
value<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:51.759> then<00:04:52.300> they<00:04:52.360> got<00:04:52.509> me<00:04:52.660> thinking<00:04:53.020> net

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
value and then they got me thinking net

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.110 
value and then they got me thinking net
assessed<00:04:53.710> value<00:04:54.069> what's<00:04:54.340> that<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:54.580> hole<00:04:54.849> mean

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
assessed value what's that a hole mean

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.089 
assessed value what's that a hole mean
again<00:04:55.360> it's<00:04:55.840> a<00:04:55.990> certain<00:04:56.289> amount<00:04:56.530> of<00:04:56.620> money<00:04:56.979> or

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
again it's a certain amount of money or

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.879 
again it's a certain amount of money or
point<00:04:57.729> value<00:04:58.120> and<00:04:58.150> then<00:04:58.599> I'm<00:04:58.720> thinking<00:04:58.889> maybe

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
point value and then I'm thinking maybe

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.950 
point value and then I'm thinking maybe
that's<00:05:00.280> why<00:05:00.610> they<00:05:00.849> put<00:05:01.060> it<00:05:01.090> right<00:05:01.479> next<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:01.900> the

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
that's why they put it right next to the

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.270 
that's why they put it right next to the
points<00:05:02.289> and<00:05:02.440> then<00:05:02.500> when<00:05:02.770> you<00:05:02.860> guys<00:05:03.039> see<00:05:03.250> it

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
points and then when you guys see it

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.370 
points and then when you guys see it
like<00:05:03.819> the<00:05:03.940> little<00:05:04.180> bit<00:05:04.419> lines<00:05:04.659> the<00:05:04.960> low<00:05:05.139> red

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
like the little bit lines the low red

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.839 
like the little bit lines the low red
lines<00:05:05.620> next<00:05:05.889> to<00:05:06.009> the<00:05:06.099> point<00:05:06.370> they<00:05:06.490> can<00:05:06.669> like

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
lines next to the point they can like

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.029 
lines next to the point they can like
almost<00:05:07.180> they<00:05:07.330> go<00:05:07.720> like<00:05:07.990> flow<00:05:08.229> to<00:05:08.289> the<00:05:08.590> nav<00:05:08.740> cart

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
almost they go like flow to the nav cart

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.760 
almost they go like flow to the nav cart
so<00:05:09.880> in<00:05:10.090> my<00:05:10.270> opinion<00:05:10.720> what<00:05:10.900> I'm<00:05:11.050> thinking<00:05:11.470> is<00:05:11.590> is

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
so in my opinion what I'm thinking is is

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.529 
so in my opinion what I'm thinking is is
that<00:05:12.190> you<00:05:12.370> have<00:05:12.550> to<00:05:12.669> get<00:05:12.759> a<00:05:12.819> certain<00:05:13.240> amount<00:05:13.389> of

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
that you have to get a certain amount of

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.839 
that you have to get a certain amount of
points<00:05:13.750> not<00:05:14.080> another<00:05:14.590> nav<00:05:14.860> card<00:05:15.220> but<00:05:15.819> a

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
points not another nav card but a

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.640 
points not another nav card but a
certain<00:05:16.330> amount<00:05:16.509> of<00:05:16.690> points<00:05:16.960> before<00:05:17.259> you<00:05:17.530> can

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
certain amount of points before you can

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.200 
certain amount of points before you can
put<00:05:17.830> it<00:05:17.949> in<00:05:18.069> but<00:05:18.250> this<00:05:18.340> that<00:05:18.580> means<00:05:18.759> me<00:05:18.940> thank

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
put it in but this that means me thank

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.909 
put it in but this that means me thank

certain point value and you put into the

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.050 
certain point value and you put into the
machine<00:05:31.960> it<00:05:32.710> doesn't<00:05:33.219> make<00:05:33.460> earth<00:05:33.699> doesn't

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
machine it doesn't make earth doesn't

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.029 
machine it doesn't make earth doesn't
show<00:05:34.330> you<00:05:34.389> a<00:05:34.509> new<00:05:34.750> bus<00:05:34.990> the<00:05:35.380> poem<00:05:35.620> which<00:05:35.889> I

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
show you a new bus the poem which I

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.620 
show you a new bus the poem which I
figured<00:05:36.400> out<00:05:36.490> it<00:05:36.699> doesn't<00:05:37.030> show<00:05:37.150> you<00:05:37.180> guys<00:05:37.449> to

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
figured out it doesn't show you guys to

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.620 
figured out it doesn't show you guys to
a<00:05:37.659> new<00:05:37.840> bus<00:05:38.050> but<00:05:38.860> it<00:05:38.979> shows<00:05:39.280> you<00:05:39.490> -<00:05:39.699> it<00:05:39.909> creates

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
a new bus but it shows you - it creates

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.010 
a new bus but it shows you - it creates
a<00:05:40.780> GPS<00:05:41.500> -<00:05:41.919> the<00:05:42.009> second<00:05:42.400> bus<00:05:42.580> so<00:05:43.150> for<00:05:43.360> nav<00:05:43.810> you

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
a GPS - the second bus so for nav you

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.240 
a GPS - the second bus so for nav you
need<00:05:44.199> to<00:05:44.259> come<00:05:44.440> up<00:05:44.560> with<00:05:44.710> a<00:05:44.770> certain<00:05:44.919> point

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
need to come up with a certain point

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.520 
need to come up with a certain point
value<00:05:45.669> and<00:05:45.849> then<00:05:46.300> once<00:05:46.539> you<00:05:46.690> make<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.139> nav<00:05:47.289> car

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
value and then once you make the nav car

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.469 
value and then once you make the nav car
machine<00:05:47.800> it<00:05:47.949> turns<00:05:48.159> into<00:05:48.310> a<00:05:48.490> GPS<00:05:49.000> for<00:05:49.210> another

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
machine it turns into a GPS for another

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:50.969 
machine it turns into a GPS for another
route<00:05:49.719> which<00:05:49.960> maybe<00:05:50.139> leads<00:05:50.469> to<00:05:50.590> new<00:05:50.740> town

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
route which maybe leads to new town

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.249 
route which maybe leads to new town
anyway<00:05:51.909> guys<00:05:52.060> that's<00:05:52.360> it<00:05:52.570> for<00:05:52.690> this<00:05:52.780> video<00:05:53.110> I
