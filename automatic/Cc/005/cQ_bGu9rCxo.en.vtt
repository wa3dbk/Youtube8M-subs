shot<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:04.049> die<00:04:04.259> and<00:04:04.530> it's<00:04:05.159> often<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.579> way

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
shot you die and it's often that way

shot you die and it's often that way
with<00:04:05.849> 244<00:04:06.359> it's<00:04:06.540> so<00:04:06.659> hard<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:06.930> control<00:04:07.049> that

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
with 244 it's so hard to control that

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.530 
with 244 it's so hard to control that
recoil<00:04:07.769> unless<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.459> spam<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.030> get<00:04:09.150> lucky<00:04:09.449> in

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
recoil unless you spam and get lucky in

one<00:04:09.689> of<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.900> six<00:04:10.500> bullets<00:04:10.859> is<00:04:11.009> really<00:04:11.669> hard<00:04:11.879> to

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
one of the six bullets is really hard to

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.819 
one of the six bullets is really hard to
maintain<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:12.750> both<00:04:12.930> of<00:04:12.959> these<00:04:13.229> guns<00:04:13.470> have<00:04:13.650> slow

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
maintain so both of these guns have slow

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.259 
maintain so both of these guns have slow
rates<00:04:14.040> of<00:04:14.159> fire<00:04:14.189> to<00:04:14.909> where<00:04:15.060> they<00:04:15.239> are

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
rates of fire to where they are

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.620 
rates of fire to where they are
reasonable<00:04:16.250> so<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.280> like<00:04:17.699> that<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.299> know<00:04:18.329> that

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
reasonable so I like that you know that

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.949 
reasonable so I like that you know that
whole<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.799> know<00:04:19.919> put<00:04:20.130> them<00:04:20.220> up<00:04:20.400> cowboy<00:04:20.849> I<00:04:21.180> love
