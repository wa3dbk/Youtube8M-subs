00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.490
 for everyone this mission must read live from mexico but are made 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.319
 strong 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:16.299
 we had the pleasure of receiving his other stand christian top 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.850
 14 I have not seen since last November in France between 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.559
 ousted on this occasion what I will bring him the scene of the 

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:26.970
 weather maple this for a long time and others 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.999
 so I would like to know chris what do you think of this guitar 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.860
 she recommends since our last meeting to the pyrrhus and servicing 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.860
 work in your way of playing said m garmin 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.270
 the dahir aweys this is it happened for the first time that i played with the 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.230
 fire it was really amazing I had never played on a guitar 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.940
 like this is what you think is one of those rare guitars that 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.720
 you try is directly fumette at ease 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.580
 it sounds naturally with the perfect tone and sound 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.040
 with a great shot at the parents in excellent sleeve a profile really 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.530
 suited to corsairs I had never felt that before it gets closer 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.170
 roxane I slept roxane and it's still different it's really 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.490
 excellent for me it's a combination of all your know-how on 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.310
 the guitars 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.670
 here are the things that really struck me when I saw you playing 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.090
 in concert is that I have never been able to adjust the mechanical 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.310
 have to hope that these goods no no it's true tuning a mouth by 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.810
 therefore plastic I will not spend time with his guitar before 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.190
 to play 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.630
 when I go out my guitar his ritual I have no time to lose 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.530
 with this one it's great me learn on this branch that jack and 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.310
 it's gone the sound is good it rolls no need to regulate the other canucks 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.889
 thing even if it still remains very good ben laden body top 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.940
 I learned a lot by watching everything playing in a different order at 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.670
 opposite 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.930
 and I think that's why this new guitar and if 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.950
 close to what you are shaved heads I hope yes it's true it takes 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.720
 to say that you have not been able to get bored sometimes even with all 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.040
 types with which I played in the past the only second not the case but 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.070
 two editors have dimarzio pickups 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.220
 and also really super fantastic mr usually when I play on a 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.490
 guitar I change my microphone to put what we think is best it is 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.570
 obliged to make improvements with this one it is not necessary to change 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.570
 anything and sounds really very very good 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.189
