Here in France, the gastronomy goes hand-in-hand with the seasons of the year.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.760
Now, the Autumn is time of pumpkin, nuts and apples.
Near my house there is a farm where we can

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.870
pick our own fruits. I went there thinking
about a recipe very easy and delicious. Taking

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:29.870
advantage of the apples season, I'm going
to teach you how to make a classical french

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.730
recipe, the tarte tartin Let's go? We start
making the dough. We put 200g of flour, 50g

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.110
of sugar, 125g of butter and we mix all. When
the mix has this texture we add one egg. And

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.030
mix well. Until your dough is smooth, and
don't stick in your hands. If is necessary,

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:39.069
you can add more flour, till it gets this
consistency and you can make a ball. At this

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.549
time we leave the dough resting while we prepare
the apples. I'm going to use this apple called

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:59.549
Golden, it's not the Granny one, but if you
don't find it, you can use another one like

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.880
Fuji, just try to avoid using the granny cause
it is too sour for this recipe. 2kg of apple.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.290
We put 100g of butter in a cake pan, after
we cover use 200g of sugar. And then we add

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.290
the apples, with the outside part touching
the sugar. And you inset the rest in a second

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.740
layer. The full process is going to take 20-25
minutes. When the caramel is yellow, we can

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.000
turn off. The tart tatin is a classical french
dessert, the story tells that it was created

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.940
by the Sisters Tatin. They use to have a restaurant
in the centre of France, which was quite famous

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.700
for serving an apple pie, one day, one of
the sisters stay long time talking to clients

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.700
and forgot to add the dough to the pie. It
was too late, because the apples were already

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.250
cooking, So she decided to add the dough on
the top of the apples, and serve the pie up

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.540
side down. It worked very well, it was a sucess
and till now the tarte tatin is known as one

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:50.130
of the symbols of french gastronomy. Bake
it in a preheated oven (240ÂºC) for 25 minutes.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.600
And our tarte tatin is ready. We let it resting
for 10 minutes and after we warm it up a bit

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:24.380
in the stove before reversing and serving
up side down. I like serving it still warm,

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.870
let's see if it is good?
