 bringing more people to you sun today 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.890
 otherwise you'll hit a penalty kick too much 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.820
 very close and thought of a bag of 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.410
 folks 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.450
 first of all here we will enter 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.820
 within the area ee push flash 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.560
 to be the lack of the personal area the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.480
 first is when one leaves the logical 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.640
 left to top is an excellent keeper 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.859
 Never catches and you kick in Brazil with 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.590
 too much power up here or gone 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.300
 this technology - still unaware of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.439
 guys the same goalkeeper stay in the middle of it 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.480
 does not start 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.710
 just leave the button robert here until the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.710
 goalkeeper stands in the middle for you to see 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:45.000
 Oh how the lounge is in the middle of your 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.000
 body again becoming half goalkeeper 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.140
 damn it 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.300
 there in the middle you saw that the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.980
 goalkeeper does not catch hope of the sun 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.899
 Now I'm going to teach you how to beat the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.610
 penalty shoot-out 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.739
 first you hit well in the corner 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.809
 You 're starting the first one. 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.120
 I study you hit that dot there 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.100
 while the green where you're charged 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.240
 safe and sound if they have been 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.920
 appears to look 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.110
 Then you can knock on quietly. 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.299
 When it fell and you want until you have 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.159
 Cracker does not need to wear it anymore, it's okay. 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.780
 I do not need it here anymore 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.520
 I do not think anyone uses it but it's starting. 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.189
 and will use the staff 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.320
 a very important tip there I do not use 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.869
 much because I already know the time nor 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.060
 exact release but I'm going to hit well in 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.799
 in the village area it is bigger 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.000
 that his right leg by stepping on 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.130
 above the large area 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.280
 You only have the kick, beauty only has opa 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.860
 hit alone he hit only the minors 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.110
 with pm he was gone 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.149
 Come on guys, then you lose. 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.159
 occurring with the foot 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.570
 right over the line there you just 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.439
 have a kick button and the analog 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.689
 beauty 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.860
 there is no force no analogue the force goes 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.439
 very sorry 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.140
 the will to step on the right foot already dropped before 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.110
 Guys, it's going to hit the corner, let's go. 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.360
 there again and one more that was stepping foot 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.270
 Right, I let people go then 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.160
 This is a very good time for you to hit. 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.200
 the penalty in the personal corner now with 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.590
 stop is very simple you go 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.790
 tightening the football sometimes is for example 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.920
 I'll hit the kick button two 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.080
 times square here boy sang 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.810
 I hope he gets on the tight line. 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.150
 square again and he beats staff with 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.819
 Stop with the stop and I like it 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.400
 much to beat a low penalty 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.590
 beauty just for those who like to use this 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.510
 fish that I come here low 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.310
 now she reigns 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.709
 So come on, people, now, to hit. 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.660
 here at the angle 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.299
 the year is also very simple same 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.860
 thing you go here with your r29 hitting 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.430
 placed penalties that I think 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.099
 goalkeeper 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.470
 imagine if he takes company r2 here 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.910
 square same thing I hope player in 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.380
 time he will step on the line 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.180
 only this time the staff will not 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.590
 to release your analog at the time it 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.160
 is caught on top of the line will not 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.450
 back he will let him up 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.209
 will step on the line or pass 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.280
 I put it up and I loose the time it is 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.590
 more or less this personal do that 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.470
 slowly for you to see again 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.120
 r 2 is going to have at no angle 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.360
 he was baptized with his right foot 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.680
 he in the line of the great area you only the 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.319
 analog only when you 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.319
 leave it up and let go fast 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.630
 Oh, you're going to step on it, I just put it up and 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.209
 I already released this is the exact time of the 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.280
 player hit a fork there 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.040
 Beauty people can keep their feet. 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.079
 on the floor very well with that time there 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.040
 I explained to you, plus one more. 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:40.799
 penalty here and now so far the hard 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.200
 did not pick up any and did not pick up again 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.599
 personal beauty and train the fish with 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.639
 david luiz a monster from the galley 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:52.079
 let's remember the penalty kick the goalkeeper 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:54.060
 No way, it's in the middle for you. 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.489
 kick and when it was kick in the corner 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.560
 guys 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.389
 you will do that scheme and there 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.459
 hitting the blue whiting does not need much 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.470
 force and when it comes to stepping on 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.299
 your right foot in the large area you loose 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.430
 a little before stepping advises 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.530
 the ball was very close to the same beam 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.870
 She will pass close by so this is 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.560
 My tip is the time there you go. 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.459
 make you drop your anthology 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.650
 there 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.239
 willian on the left for you to quit 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.789
 debate hard when it is 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.729
 stepped on the line you see that the goalkeeper 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.420
 does not pick up because the green is in the 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.580
 with a stop 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.790
 you double- tap a 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.770
 kick him to and will hit again and 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.380
 you see that so far all penalties 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.720
 It's what I 've got out of it, but otherwise it was. 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.250
 all goals in the crowd and another foot not 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.400
 had the one with r 2 nÃ© 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.440
 You hit here in the loose corner at the time. 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.930
 that he is to step with his foot on top and 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.120
 you put the logic up and already let go 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.330
 he does not isolate the Brazilian ball 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.240
 Julius Caesar here brought another tutorial 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.970
 there for I not only had the 14 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.770
 but in the end 14 the only way was that 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.260
 you hit it in the middle up there you 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.110
