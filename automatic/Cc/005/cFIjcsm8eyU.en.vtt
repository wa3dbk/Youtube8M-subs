 expressing that yes yes you have it premium 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.920
 all you have to do is 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.590
 open the trunk launcher and once you 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.099
 I had so you would give here 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.300
 well me far this we are 3.2 and 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.310
 edit them paypal x would put a thing that 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.710
 puts in green that puts g1 voucher and this 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.170
 it would be deactivated so it would be 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.820
 everything like that and it's worth you're here you see that 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.300
 down a see arguments that will expose 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.100
 a g you give him and if you have four spill 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.260
 your nador student copies are worth 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.379
 for leaving in the description you have 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.570
 copy this you see good pectorals 6 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.660
 profile possibilities in minecraft rcp 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.710
 in playing 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:07.120
 it is loaded and now you will see that it is going to go 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.050
 with much more memory with which if 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.050
 we create a new world 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.410
 proof again would be generated to the world at 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.930
 principle was a bit less fps than 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.390
 normal why then because it is 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.810
 generating the world is worth training that is 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:33.869
 the genre is but we would not give 3 and 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.869
 beige up there to die 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.610
 I would put 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.090
 203 monkeys every time uses more because 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.939
 are avid for land items 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.119
 27 100 good everything we have put to 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.890
 law raises to 120 fps if we put the minus 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.530
 but more than anything because it is 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.030
 generating the world is worth then once 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.920
 that page is already generated now 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.340
 start to upload the agents 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.149
 to the maximum I would start stps is and well by 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.910
 example for a message to the world 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:14.410
 from before and good but enough pp 6 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.540
 with 114 class trick is fine 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.720
 by then to change now in what 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.970
 premium that we should do then 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.100
 we would open the largest non-premium there are 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.220
 OK 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.590
 up to date 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.710

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:40.790
 and here in memory, you would change 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.250
 comes with this then for 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.469
 put it in the maximum as it could go what 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.379
 same as I am constant but without putting 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:50.060
 x mx or you could only do this and 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.680
 this should change so I 'm going to 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.260
