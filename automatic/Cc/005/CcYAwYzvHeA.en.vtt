00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.110 
go well in our favor I think we had one
hundred<00:02:53.470> percent<00:02:53.500> cap<00:02:53.950> yeah<00:02:54.550> around<00:02:55.000> one

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
hundred percent cap yeah around one

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.870 
hundred percent cap yeah around one
hundred<00:02:55.150> percent<00:02:55.360> cap<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.049> I<00:02:56.860> guess<00:02:57.640> one<00:02:57.850> of

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
hundred percent cap and I guess one of

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.180 
hundred percent cap and I guess one of
us<00:02:58.060> got<00:02:58.269> shut<00:02:58.510> up<00:02:58.660> i'm<00:02:58.870> not<00:02:59.049> sure<00:02:59.230> too<00:02:59.860> sure

what happened there but they did end up
in<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.769> defeat<00:03:04.170> should<00:03:05.170> have<00:03:05.260> been<00:03:05.380> a<00:03:05.410> want<00:03:05.650> when
