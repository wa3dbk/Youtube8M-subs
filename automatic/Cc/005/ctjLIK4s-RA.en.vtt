00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
calibration system that I got it was by

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.299 
calibration system that I got it was by
data<00:00:42.239> color<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.260> was<00:00:43.379> called<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.770> spider

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
data color and it was called the spider

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.299 
data color and it was called the spider

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.160 
for pro and I'm sorry I liked you a
little<00:00:47.700> bit<00:00:47.879> after<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.480> filled<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.930> video

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
little bit after I filled in that video

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.619 
little bit after I filled in that video
I<00:00:49.350> had<00:00:49.710> tested<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.370> actually<00:00:51.180> had<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.449> get

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
I had tested it out actually had to get

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.630 
I had tested it out actually had to get
a<00:00:51.809> new<00:00:51.840> cinema<00:00:52.559> display<00:00:52.949> which<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> video

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
a new cinema display which was the video

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.430 
a new cinema display which was the video
afterwards<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.390> saw<00:00:54.570> me<00:00:54.719> unboxing<00:00:55.320> it

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
afterwards you saw me unboxing it

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.220 
afterwards you saw me unboxing it
because<00:00:55.860> my<00:00:56.399> old<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:56.879> broke<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.660> wasn't

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
because my old one broke and I wasn't

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.290 
because my old one broke and I wasn't
using<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.800> palio<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> week<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.090> two<00:01:00.270> so

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
using it for palio like a week or two so

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.910 
using it for palio like a week or two so
I<00:01:00.480> kind<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.809> forgot<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.379> had<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> dual

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
I kind of forgot that I had a dual

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.399 
I kind of forgot that I had a dual
monitor<00:01:02.399> system<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.480> spider<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:04.110> pro

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
monitor system so the spider for pro

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.800 
monitor system so the spider for pro
doesn't<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:04.979> dual<00:01:05.189> monitor<00:01:05.700> systems<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.780> I

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
doesn't do dual monitor systems so I

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.660 
doesn't do dual monitor systems so I
returned<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.619> one<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.010> got<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.250> part<00:01:08.549> of

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
returned that one and got this part of

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.399 
returned that one and got this part of
four<00:01:08.880> elite<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.479> basically<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.049> same<00:01:10.200> thing

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
four elite it's basically the same thing

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.960 
four elite it's basically the same thing
except<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.280> calibrate<00:01:11.520> two

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
except for you can calibrate two

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.780 
except for you can calibrate two
monitors<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.780> instead<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.110> one<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> what

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
monitors with it instead of one so what

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.460 
monitors with it instead of one so what
was<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.180> cool<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.810> data<00:01:16.200> color

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
was really cool is that data color

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.320 
was really cool is that data color
actually<00:01:16.710> reached<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.610> me<00:01:17.729> told<00:01:18.000> me<00:01:18.119> that
