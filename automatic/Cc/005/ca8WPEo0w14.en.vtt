00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.830
So now I am going to show you guys how to
make a banana mask.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:19.220
You are going to need a half a cup of warmed
oat meal, about 3 teaspoons of warmed honey,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:28.961
warmed only because it is easier to work with
when it is a little bit warmed up ? and 1

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:32.180
banana, all I need did was mush it with the
fork just like this.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.220
So it is pretty easy to work with.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.660
So I am going to add all of my ingredients
together.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:59.850
So we are going to do the half cup of oatmeal,
3 teaspoons of honey and the last ingredient

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.850
is going to be almond oil.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.750
We are going to do 1 tablespoon of almond
oil.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.570
Almond oil is really important for the skin
because it is super hydrating but it is also

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:24.300
anti-inflammatory which means that it is also
anti-agent.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.250
So all I am doing now is blending all four
ingredients together.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.610
The almond oil, the honey, the banana and
the oat meal.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.920
See it blends together really nicely.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.490
The honey is very hydrating for the skin and
you will just see an instant effect with it.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:53.230
The banana actually contains a lot of potassium
which is really good for your skin's lymphatic

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.230
system.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.780
And you guys know what that is.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.280
The lymphatic system cleans out waste and
delivers nutrients to your cell.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.850
So that is super important for a clean, clear
and glowing skin.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.500
And the oatmeal is just very soothing.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.510
Its very good for sensitive skin and I love
it as a base for any mask.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.819
So you just apply a thin layer of this mixture
to your skin.

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:37.290
Its going to be a little bit chunky but the
oat meal sits very nicely on the skin.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.709
You are going to leave this on for 15 minutes.

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.209
What's going to happen once you rinse it off
with warm water is your skin is going to really

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.209
look glowy.

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.080
It is very good like I said it is an anti-agent
treatment and it is just good for general

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.299
health of your skin.

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.910
So if you do this once a week you are really
going to have a perfect and glowing skin.
