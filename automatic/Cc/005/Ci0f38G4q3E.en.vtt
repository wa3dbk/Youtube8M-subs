absolute kitchen essentials because
coconuts<00:00:23.010> are<00:00:23.160> absolute<00:00:24.150> superfoods<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.560> this

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
coconuts are absolute superfoods so this

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.920 
coconuts are absolute superfoods so this
is<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.160> coconut<00:00:26.490> butter<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.570> difference

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
is the coconut butter and the difference

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.439 
is the coconut butter and the difference
between<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.439> butter<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.310> oil<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.970> that

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
between the butter and the oil is that

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.749 
between the butter and the oil is that
this<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.289> whole<00:00:31.529> flesh<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.369> whole<00:00:32.520> meat

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
this is the whole flesh the whole meat

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.720 
this is the whole flesh the whole meat
of<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.210> coconut<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.829> particular<00:00:35.430> brand

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
of the coconut so this particular brand

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.940 
of the coconut so this particular brand
what<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.420> they<00:00:36.570> dehydrate<00:00:36.950> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
what they do is they dehydrate the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.160 
what they do is they dehydrate the
coconut<00:00:38.460> meat<00:00:38.640> at<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> super<00:00:39.420> low<00:00:39.450> temperature

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
coconut meat at a super low temperature

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.979 
coconut meat at a super low temperature
and<00:00:40.379> then<00:00:40.770> they<00:00:40.920> puree<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.030> into<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> spread

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and then they puree it so into a spread

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.529 
and then they puree it so into a spread
basically<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.489> here<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.910> can<00:00:45.090> see<00:00:45.329> it's

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
basically so this here you can see it's

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.560 
basically so this here you can see it's
pretty<00:00:45.719> solid<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.550> warm<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> slightly

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
pretty solid but if you warm it slightly

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.569 
pretty solid but if you warm it slightly
warm<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.289> slightly<00:00:49.379> by<00:00:49.770> for<00:00:50.190> example<00:00:50.280> you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
warm and slightly by for example you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.850 
warm and slightly by for example you
could<00:00:50.760> put<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.239> some<00:00:52.020> water<00:00:52.260> that's<00:00:52.559> really

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
could put it in some water that's really

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.400 
could put it in some water that's really
hot<00:00:53.129> put<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.730> jar<00:00:54.030> into<00:00:54.239> water<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.690> slightly

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
hot put this jar into water to slightly

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.799 
hot put this jar into water to slightly
melt<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:56.910> use<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> spread

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
melt it but you can use it as a spread

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.049 
melt it but you can use it as a spread
as<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> dip<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.500> actually<00:00:58.739> had<00:00:59.190> french<00:00:59.730> toast

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.609 
extremely important is that there's no
hexane<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.540> want<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.869> make<00:01:55.020> sure<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
hexane you want to make sure that the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.730 
hexane you want to make sure that the
oil<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.369> buy<00:01:56.759> says<00:01:57.540> no<00:01:57.930> hexane<00:01:58.469> that's

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
oil that you buy says no hexane that's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.700 
oil that you buy says no hexane that's
important<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.969> hexane<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.780> derived<00:02:01.380> from

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
important so hexane is derived from

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.999 
important so hexane is derived from
petroleum<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:02.790> used<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.530> it's<00:02:04.530> used<00:02:04.799> in

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
petroleum and it's used in it's used in

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.679 
petroleum and it's used in it's used in
products<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.490> coconut<00:02:05.880> oil<00:02:05.909> not<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.479> one

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
products like coconut oil not this one

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.990 
products like coconut oil not this one
to<00:02:06.869> extract<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.590> oil<00:02:07.619> but<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.729> product

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
to extract the oil but this is a product

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.300 
to extract the oil but this is a product
that<00:02:09.300> that's<00:02:09.569> used<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.530> things<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:10.979> to

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
that that's used in in things like to

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.460 
that that's used in in things like to
make<00:02:11.459> glue

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
make glue

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.370 
make glue

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
in the roofing industry you do not want

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.830 
in the roofing industry you do not want
your<00:02:18.680> coconut<00:02:19.250> oil<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.970> be<00:02:20.090> extracted<00:02:20.810> by

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
your coconut oil to be extracted by

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.890 
your coconut oil to be extracted by
hexane<00:02:21.470> avoid<00:02:22.100> so<00:02:22.610> now<00:02:23.210> let's<00:02:23.450> talk<00:02:23.630> about

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
hexane avoid so now let's talk about

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.390 
hexane avoid so now let's talk about
what<00:02:24.080> is<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.320> difference<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:24.890> what<00:02:25.070> is<00:02:25.250> the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
what is the difference so what is the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.400 
what is the difference so what is the
oil<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:25.970> oil<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.630> what's<00:02:27.020> actually

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
oil so the oil is what's actually

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.890 
oil so the oil is what's actually
extracted<00:02:27.980> from<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.340> meat<00:02:28.550> now<00:02:29.120> again<00:02:29.540> not

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
extracted from the meat now again not

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.470 
extracted from the meat now again not
