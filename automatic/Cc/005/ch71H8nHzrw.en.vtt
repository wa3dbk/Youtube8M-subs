00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.090
 Hello dear customers 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.559
 online store and tends to wake 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.480
 I present to you a smartphone called 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:18.520
 or fund 5000 apparatus is enough 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.500
 weighty with a battery without amounted to 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.539
 already 205 grams but this figure here 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.730
 not without reason but more on that later 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.570
 chrome plated across the end 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.020
 edge all sides of the device are devoid of sharp 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.750
 corners 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.780
 the size of the apparatus is 74 by 146 on 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.190
 We see 9 and 3 millimeters above icann 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.360
 speaker peephole camera 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.289
 color indicator 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.609
 and light and proximity sensors under 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.410
 screen three buttons in the middle 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.600
 mechanical combined with scanner 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.100
 fingerprints and on the sides of it still 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.730
 one by one a little nervously none 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.730
 white backlight 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.760
 the left end is free and buttons and connectors 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.379
 when cancer is on the right side 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.129
 there is a lock button and 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:03.100
 volume control on top of two connectors 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.920
 under the headphones and charging the bottom two lattice 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.940
 speakers 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.890
 the back cover is matte on it 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.920
 located the camera company logo and 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.380
 flash from the back of the cover can be 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.880
 notice nfc antenna means pay 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.430
 shopping without a card with this phone 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.560
 you can see two slots on the device itself 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.539
 under the sim card and one under the memory card 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.180
 also responsible for the weight of the smartphone 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.060
 5000 mAh battery 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.469
 an hour is a lot of this volume 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.539
 confirmed not only excellent 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.550
 performance in tests and really just 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.470
 mad autonomy 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.970
 5 inch ps display full hd 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.370
 the resolution was not enough for me 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.400
 brightness although it will be noticeable and the fact that 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.869
 on a sunny day, well, a little color 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.740
 pales at large viewing angles 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.600
 multitouch supports 5 simultaneous 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.720
 touches a perfect smoothness when 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.700
 clear motion 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.200
 The device works on the version of android 4 4 with 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.110
 the ability to update the firmware by 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.090
 technology for something that I have heard more than once 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.830
 what man said louder than simple 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.690
 knots out of interestingness and beyond 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.350
 the ability to connect a third-party usb 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.759
 devices have nfc function 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.709
 well, a fingerprint scanner 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.660
 thanks to him, you can deny access to 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.370
 certain applications by opening which 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.070
 can only be scanned your 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.989
 finger is almost all the settings of this 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.950
 functions in English but incomprehensible 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.950
 almost nothing 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.459
 you can also set the opportunity 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.320
 unlock smartphone by double clicking 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.209
 on the screen or you can run 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.060
 certain applications start their desired 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.360
 symbol sound is very loud here questions 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.360
 not 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.750
 16 megapixel main 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.580
 and 8 megapixel front camera 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.800
 have a number of settings that can 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.900
 Significantly improve well or to the edge 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.180
 spoil the shot but having a minimum 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.920
 understanding the values â€‹â€‹of hdr electronic 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.210
 video stabilization and panoramas 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.210
 you can make great shots 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.340
 smartphone comes with a charger 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.519
 device usb cables and film on 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.519
 screen 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.379
 naturally with powerful games or fund 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.239
 5000 cope with a bang all by himself 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.360
 smartphone serves 8-core chip from 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.680
 companies mediatek mt6592 with 1 of 7 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.150
 gigahertz on each core 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.760
 RAM installed two 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.859
 gigabyte built-in for 16k files 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.109
 minus take the weight of the smartphone though 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.790
 The reason for weight is its advantage. 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.560
 extra capacious battery as well 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.250
 pleased with the presence of a fingerprint scanner 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.270
 fingers and presence on all modules
