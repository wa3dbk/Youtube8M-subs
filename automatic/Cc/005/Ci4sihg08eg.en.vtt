00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 yes very welcome to this new 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.819
 video about the critique of amazing 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.790
 man 2 the power of electro and such as 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.990
 his tells me is really amazing 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.700
 first thing you have to mention are the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.650
 performances of the characters are all 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.839
 great but the one I liked the most was the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.820
 of jamie foxx interprets max and long o 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.410
 electro on the tape his performance does not 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.210
 has the same in the whole tape we see that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.970
 a simple maximum employee of obscure to 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.800
 what does he care about is sometimes 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.750
 Surprise that wen remember his name 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.130
 besides that he is a big fan of the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.320
 Spiderman can be said to have 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.000
 an obsession towards the hero then suffers 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.280
 a small accident and become 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.350
 electro basically so it gets the the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.390
 special effects says to be mentioned 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.010
 the transformation is incredible 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.660
 of electro like the fights and the goblin 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.850
 green also had a lot of appearance 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.590
 more natural I think this movie is 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.930
 the level in terms of the effects of 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.640
 avengers although they are not better 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.289
 fight in times square is undoubtedly one of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.539
 the best fights you saw in my life is 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.219
 quite epic as it draws all its power 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.600
 electro and how the name harms reaction 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.430
 before the situation with its meaning 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.440
 arachnid which is another aspect that 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.850
 I want to touch on this criticism 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.559
 we could also have the sense 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.630
 arachnid since with the excellent use of 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.020
 the slow motion allows us to see what 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.119
 there is 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.890
 of the scene is like Peter Parker what 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.200
 can see or grasp with the sense of a 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.609
 spider the truth looked too bad 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.469
 web which was the director of the 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:18.689
 movie and it's one of the best to me 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:20.460
 seem on the other hand the adaptation to 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.500
 the comics makes this movie very 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.299
 humorous we could see a classic book 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.500
 of the printed one that sure of the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.509
 villains who likes to make man 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.100
 it hurts and all this but then it goes 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.200
 realizing that besides being a gift 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.909
 It is also your responsibility and that your 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.750
 decisions can affect people who 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.340
 more wants 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.959
 the relationship between good and peter is very 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.640
 Pretty is I think real life 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:39.989
 Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield the actors 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.209
 who play gwen stacy peter 

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:43.920
 parker have a relationship that is to say that 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:45.509
 they are boyfriends something that gives much more 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.670
 Realism of love scenes between those 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.289
 two characters in the movie the plot 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.119
 neither be said, it must not necessarily be 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.679
 with a spiderman knower for 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.569
 understand it since it's a very plot 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.739
 simple has a lot of mystery 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.780
 discover the glass of the past of the 

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:59.399
 Peter's parents so that you already corp 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.349
 the investigations of richard parker and 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.209
 among many other relevant things the 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:04.860
 soundtrack by hans zimmer is fine 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.959
 but that they are surpassed of the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.000
 main spider-man movies this 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.349
 movie ended in a different way 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.700
 and I will not tell you how not to 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.410
 ruin those 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.330
 people who have not seen it 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.400
 this movie makes a lot of sense 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.990
 humor mystery drama action with 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.640
 incredible special effects and about 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.350
 all feelings not only for the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.120
 relationship between peter and web but for another 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.950
 thing that really made me when I saw 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.570
 for the first time the movie and gave 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.280
 first time because I went to see her two 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.170
 times and now I know liking myself and 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.550
 removing the tear from my eyes 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.170
 there are scenes where I do not like the 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.610
 performance of Andrew Garfield when he is 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.500
 Spiderman maybe because he does 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.570
 seem cheerful very excelled in a 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.520
 conversation with a civilian or even with 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.710
 the enemies but if that performance 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.240
 He was well leave gods alike 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.040
 it was great even when it was the 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.810
 green goblin but I think I would have 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.730
 put a little more presence in the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.860
 movie the villain but good the new 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.480
 main villain but electro so 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.430
 it was not all bad that I just know a 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.810
 little the screen in the green goblin and 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.860
 what clear will be a character that 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.350
 we will continue to see in the future 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.060
 movies in this movie does not arise 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.010
 problem like spiderman 3 for the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.990
 villains each had his turn and he 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.610
 related very well between them 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.560
 so that was another point that made the 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.660
 movie one of the best this year 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.580
 also when we thought that the excess 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.470
 of advance we ordinary the film then 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.660
 we were wrong since in the trailer 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.980
 appear phrases or scenes that do not come out 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.110
 in the movie and they were 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.180
 as something extra for the advances so 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.459
 he offered us enough to judge from the one 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.470
 the movie lasted 2 hours and 30 minutes 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.120
 in short also without firing knobs 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.069
 it's a great superhero movie that 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.840
 It's really worth seeing it's very good 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.970
 made and prepares us for what is 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.180
 come the six sinister so this 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.709
 29.6 film ultimately this was 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.330
 the best movie of the spiderman up 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.670
 the moment in my point of view and that of 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.290
 several critics and well that's all for 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.579
 this criticism leaves the comments what do you 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.620
 it seems the movie and if you have not seen it 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.060
 what do you expect, thank you very much for watching and we 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.060
 we'll see until the next video
