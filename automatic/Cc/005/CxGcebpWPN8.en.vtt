00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.840
 we are here in front of multistrada that 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.330
 surely it is the main novelty of 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.179
 ducati for the 2015 motorcycle completely 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.039
 new whose development starts from the big one 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.900
 innovation that we applied to 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.960
 engine with the contents of the variators of 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.810
 phase then the possibility to resolve 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.460
 we say at the root the compromise that 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.800
 had previously been done with the 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.620
 testastretta 11 degrees the engine that has 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.920
 equipped the multistrada since 2010 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.600
 of the first launch we say is that he was tense 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.250
 to find the optimal one 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.140
 compromise between the performance of the 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.899
 testastretta then superbike engine from 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.480
 which derives and the regularity of 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.769
 typical and necessary operation for a 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.510
 product like this that still comes 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.489
 used for urban commuting rather 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.370
 that tourism therefore in conditions 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.989
 mainly of low loads but if 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.870
 for two butterfly and also low speeds 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.270
 a vehicle has developed completely 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.090
 new that we propose and launch in two 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.970
 a standard versions of an s that are 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.000
 equipped with different contents in 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.229
 led projector terms on 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.930
 s version 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.770
 a lamp on the standard version 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.659
 multifunction color tft dashboard with 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.299
 an integrated infotainment system for 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.350
 the s version while a simpler lcd 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.140
 but still very rich in information 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.080
 to have standards and I also have 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.170
 there 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.370
 cycling that enough 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.810
 specific to the s version much more 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.770
 performance because it was earlier 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.450
 we find a brembo plant with pincers 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.160
 m50 the 330 mm risks then 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.020
 practically the panigale plant 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.670
 while on the standard version anyway 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.020
 well sized plant with disks 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.020
 from 320 and always the monoblock pliers 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.690
 equa 2014 ducati presents the 12 99 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.080
 panigale which is an evolution to all 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.460
 the effects of the 11 99 panigale 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.250
 the main novelties of this new one 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.860
 model is first of all the engine that 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.620
 is the heart of the project thanks to a 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.900
 displacement increase achieved with 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.640
 increase this bore 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.590
 allows together with the fact that we have 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.350
 also redesigned the exhaust system 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.290
 to get an incredible increase of 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.610
 power of 10 horses and respect 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.440
 to the previous model 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.210
 so today we have maximum power 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.610
 of 205 horses 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.310
 but delivery is not only power 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.260
 the character of the engine because the bike is 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.820
 an impressive pair response 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.610
 from mid and low speeds 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.010
 the vehicle has evolved to the level of 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.890
 cycling by making improvements 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.870
 which are derived from the experience in the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.850
 world of competitions and also from the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.290
 feedback that you come from the market with 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.250
 previous models indeed we have 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.850
 advanced steering geometry changed 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.240
 lowered the swingarm pivot 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.490
 4 mm rear to get a 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.320
 dynamic behavior both on the track and 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.320
 on the road at peak performance
