China
and<00:01:11.700> I'm<00:01:12.090> assuming<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:12.630> did<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.200> to

and I'm assuming they did that just to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.800 
and I'm assuming they did that just to
cut<00:01:13.560> costs<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.220> keep<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.580> cost<00:01:14.790> low<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
cut costs and keep the cost low but the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.789 
cut costs and keep the cost low but the
knife<00:01:15.990> itself<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.710> made<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> US<00:01:19.880> the

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
knife itself is made here in the US the

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.270 
knife itself is made here in the US the
steel<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.390> 420hc<00:01:24.409> steel<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.220> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
steel is the 420hc steel so it's a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.010 
steel is the 420hc steel so it's a
pretty<00:01:26.460> decent<00:01:26.640> steel<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.390> intermediate

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
