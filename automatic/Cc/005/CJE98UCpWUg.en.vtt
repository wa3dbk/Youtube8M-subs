00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
it's porous in and absorbs it you could

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.900 
it's porous in and absorbs it you could
use<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.140> templates<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.980> then<00:01:08.340> laminate

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
those and keep reusing them the only

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.490 
those and keep reusing them the only
thing<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.660> little<00:01:12.870> bit<00:01:13.170> like

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
thing is that it's a little bit like

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.720 
thing is that it's a little bit like
slippery<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.670> laminated<00:01:16.610> you<00:01:17.610> know

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
slippery on the laminated you know

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
up and go around again and the technique

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.490 
up and go around again and the technique
is<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.080> same<00:03:17.410> as<00:03:18.480> using<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.660> henna<00:03:19.870> cone<00:03:20.170> and

all<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.739> way<00:03:20.860> around<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.870> then<00:03:26.080> you<00:03:26.290> could

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
all the way around and then you could

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.470 
all the way around and then you could
continue<00:03:27.040> like<00:03:27.220> this<00:03:27.250> pattern<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.880> can<00:03:28.030> go<00:03:28.209> up

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
continue like this pattern you can go up

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.620 
continue like this pattern you can go up

dots<00:05:58.050> again<00:05:58.259> you<00:05:59.099> know<00:05:59.220> all<00:05:59.430> the<00:05:59.729> way<00:05:59.849> down<00:06:00.300> and

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
dots again you know all the way down and

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.080 
dots again you know all the way down and
then<00:06:01.289> you<00:06:01.380> can<00:06:01.530> make<00:06:01.680> little<00:06:01.860> splashes<00:06:02.370> you

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
then you can make little splashes you

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.700 
then you can make little splashes you
know<00:06:03.210> these<00:06:03.389> are<00:06:03.539> all<00:06:03.659> like<00:06:03.810> ideas<00:06:04.229> they<00:06:04.470> click

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
know these are all like ideas they click

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.779 
know these are all like ideas they click
ideas<00:06:05.099> that<00:06:05.220> you<00:06:05.280> could<00:06:05.400> do<00:06:05.550> when<00:06:05.669> you're

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
ideas that you could do when you're

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.499 
ideas that you could do when you're
doing<00:06:06.060> henna<00:06:06.409> you<00:06:07.409> know<00:06:07.560> of<00:06:07.979> course<00:06:08.419> if<00:06:09.419> you

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
doing henna you know of course if you

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:11.149 
doing henna you know of course if you
don't<00:06:09.690> really<00:06:09.840> like<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:10.229> way<00:06:10.380> that<00:06:10.620> the<00:06:10.979> dots

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:11.159 
don't really like the way that the dots

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:13.189 
don't really like the way that the dots
look<00:06:11.460> then<00:06:11.639> you<00:06:11.669> want<00:06:12.240> them<00:06:12.360> thicker<00:06:12.599> always

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
look then you want them thicker always

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:14.540 
look then you want them thicker always
go<00:06:13.349> back<00:06:13.530> and<00:06:13.560> just<00:06:13.860> add<00:06:14.130> a<00:06:14.159> little<00:06:14.280> bit<00:06:14.430> more

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
go back and just add a little bit more

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.909 
go back and just add a little bit more
paste<00:06:14.909> and<00:06:15.210> you<00:06:15.840> know<00:06:15.960> then<00:06:16.259> you<00:06:16.349> fill<00:06:16.620> this<00:06:16.770> in

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
paste and you know then you fill this in

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.420 
paste and you know then you fill this in
with<00:06:16.949> a<00:06:17.099> little<00:06:17.340> bit<00:06:17.460> of<00:06:17.550> paste<00:06:17.759> as<00:06:18.000> well<00:06:19.430> you

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
with a little bit of paste as well you

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.890 
with a little bit of paste as well you
know<00:06:20.520> if<00:06:20.699> you<00:06:20.820> haven't<00:06:21.120> already<00:06:21.270> you<00:06:21.659> know

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
know if you haven't already you know

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.089 
know if you haven't already you know
there's<00:06:22.080> another<00:06:22.289> technique<00:06:22.680> because<00:06:23.009> this

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:23.099 
there's another technique because this

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.040 
there's another technique because this
is<00:06:23.220> a<00:06:23.250> pen<00:06:23.550> mind<00:06:23.880> you<00:06:24.030> so<00:06:24.180> if<00:06:24.270> you<00:06:24.389> had<00:06:24.570> the<00:06:24.750> cone

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
is a pen mind you so if you had the cone

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.899 
is a pen mind you so if you had the cone
it<00:06:25.409> would<00:06:25.560> probably<00:06:25.740> be<00:06:26.009> like<00:06:26.039> a<00:06:26.430> dollop<00:06:26.789> of

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
it would probably be like a dollop of

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:28.879 
it would probably be like a dollop of
pace<00:06:27.210> and<00:06:27.450> then<00:06:27.539> you<00:06:27.630> just<00:06:27.810> pull<00:06:28.020> out<00:06:28.200> it<00:06:28.710> makes

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
pace and then you just pull out it makes

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.269 
pace and then you just pull out it makes
the<00:06:28.979> Kovach<00:06:29.250> really<00:06:29.550> really<00:06:29.760> quick

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:30.279 
the Kovach really really quick

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:32.819 
the Kovach really really quick
and<00:06:30.489> then<00:06:31.149> you<00:06:31.239> could<00:06:31.419> fill<00:06:31.719> it<00:06:31.899> but<00:06:32.499> these<00:06:32.679> are

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:32.829 
and then you could fill it but these are

00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:35.309 
and then you could fill it but these are
some<00:06:33.009> of<00:06:33.039> the<00:06:33.129> basic<00:06:33.789> motifs<00:06:34.299> that<00:06:34.449> will<00:06:35.139> get

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 
some of the basic motifs that will get

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.349 
some of the basic motifs that will get
you<00:06:35.469> started<00:06:35.529> and<00:06:36.129> and<00:06:36.699> this<00:06:36.819> is<00:06:36.999> some<00:06:37.179> of<00:06:37.269> the
