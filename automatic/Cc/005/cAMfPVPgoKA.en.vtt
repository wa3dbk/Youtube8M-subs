00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 shows how to tighten the handbrake on 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:08.040
 configuration 1 and 4 where there is no armrest 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.280
 screwdriver neatly here 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.360
 shovel remove the cover principle 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.740
 removed easily on 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.090
 as you can see I have cracked one mount 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:23.150
 too much jerked us left 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:27.990
 so then here we already see immediately 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:32.369
 cable further here is here unscrew the bolt 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:37.110
 then this finger shows it 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.920
 caught to raise the panel itself raised 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.489
 the panel goes on with this 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:52.890
 fixtures and key for 12 but heads 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:56.850
 On 12 we pull up Russ Nicky head wears 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.699
 You see, all my God, but here by all 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.280
 passengers or anything 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.280
 twist up to three knots as it should be 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.700
 something important not to win, I hope 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.170
 it did not yet pulled in here 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.729
 Basically everything is there head handcuffed 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.650
 mean to 12 here to unscrew 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.189
 upper bolt 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:32.299
 head for 10 meaning everything 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:35.930
 pretty simple and splashing and fast 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.930
 just spinning 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:58.730
 but I already reached out 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:02:06.740
 inside is very 3 clicks to you 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:14.050
 unpleasant all tighten up that's basically 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:14.050
 all the big sofa in the gun and rejoice 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.800
 vodka stands still 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.800
 cherries on 3. 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:42.050
 well 4 it's hard to make a move small on 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:45.010

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.010
