00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
each set that is super play herbal or

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.350 
each set that is super play herbal or
was<00:00:43.710> super<00:00:44.129> playable<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> last<00:00:44.969> rotation

was super playable in the last rotation

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.720 
was super playable in the last rotation
but<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.289> essentially<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.800> card<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.550> does

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
but it's essentially a card that does

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.420 
but it's essentially a card that does
have<00:00:48.030> value<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.809> most<00:00:49.379> cases<00:00:49.649> more<00:00:50.039> value<00:00:50.399> than

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
have value in most cases more value than

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.939 
have value in most cases more value than
a<00:00:50.579> hollow<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.270> anything<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.710> we

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
a hollow or anything like that so we

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.260 
a hollow or anything like that so we
think<00:00:53.129> if<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.699> card<00:00:54.000> you

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
think if you get that card you

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.990 
think if you get that card you
definitely<00:00:54.629> deserve<00:00:54.750> some<00:00:55.079> points<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
definitely deserve some points for a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.220 
definitely deserve some points for a
perfect<00:00:57.000> example<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.539> would<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.079> hip

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
perfect example of this would be the hip

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.340 
perfect example of this would be the hip
no<00:00:58.350> toxic<00:00:58.770> laser<00:00:59.010> from<00:00:59.699> plasma<00:01:00.180> storm<00:01:00.449> yes

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
no toxic laser from plasma storm yes

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.349 
no toxic laser from plasma storm yes
it's<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> holographic<00:01:02.460> or<00:01:02.820> an<00:01:02.910> ultra<00:01:03.180> rare

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
it's not a holographic or an ultra rare

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.060 
it's not a holographic or an ultra rare
but<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.899> still<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.140> very<00:01:04.470> very<00:01:04.710> playable

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
but it is still a very very playable
