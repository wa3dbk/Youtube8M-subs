00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
just being added I figured me take a

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.940 
just being added I figured me take a
crack<00:00:16.630> and<00:00:16.930> see<00:00:17.140> what<00:00:17.289> we<00:00:17.410> could<00:00:17.560> do<00:00:17.710> on<00:00:17.860> the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
crack and see what we could do on the

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.800 
crack and see what we could do on the
formula<00:00:18.340> drift<00:00:18.580> section<00:00:19.000> I<00:00:19.180> know<00:00:19.450> a<00:00:19.539> lot<00:00:19.780> of

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
formula drift section I know a lot of

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.540 
formula drift section I know a lot of
people<00:00:19.930> are<00:00:20.199> having<00:00:20.320> troubles<00:00:20.770> so<00:00:21.190> I<00:00:21.250> figure<00:00:21.520> I

because if you hit one wall your runs

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.670 
because if you hit one wall your runs
over<00:01:10.450> that<00:01:10.810> first<00:01:10.990> corner<00:01:11.260> is<00:01:11.350> going<00:01:11.470> to<00:01:11.530> set

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
over that first corner is going to set

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
swing wide here again you can probably

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.410 
swing wide here again you can probably
get<00:01:15.130> closer<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:15.430> this<00:01:15.520> wall<00:01:15.790> more<00:01:16.210> than<00:01:16.330> the

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
to get used to it there is a difference

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.990 
to get used to it there is a difference

the<00:02:30.470> rumble<00:02:31.470> strip<00:02:31.620> on<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.770> inside<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:32.490> just

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
the rumble strip on the inside it's just

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.000 
the rumble strip on the inside it's just

because<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.550> real<00:02:35.700> clipping<00:02:35.970> point<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.300> just

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
because the real clipping point is just

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.120 
because the real clipping point is just
a<00:02:36.570> cone<00:02:36.840> because<00:02:37.080> they<00:02:37.260> don't<00:02:37.440> run<00:02:37.739> right<00:02:38.010> to

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
a cone because they don't run right to

a cone because they don't run right to
the<00:02:38.160> inside<00:02:38.519> bring<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.120> nice<00:02:39.269> out<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.780> wall
