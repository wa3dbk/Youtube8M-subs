00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.209 

so<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.540> can<00:00:09.750> see<00:00:09.960> here<00:00:10.230> how<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.530> ladder<00:00:11.009> is

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
so you can see here how the ladder is

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.209 
so you can see here how the ladder is
sort<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.549> hanging<00:00:11.879> off<00:00:12.000> away<00:00:12.660> from<00:00:12.959> the<00:00:13.049> gutter

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
sort of hanging off away from the gutter

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.490 
sort of hanging off away from the gutter
it's<00:00:14.219> nice<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.699> stable<00:00:15.259> there's<00:00:16.259> a<00:00:16.320> good

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
it's nice and stable there's a good

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.070 
it's nice and stable there's a good
space<00:00:16.830> there<00:00:17.160> between<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.939> backside<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
space there between the backside of the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.890 
space there between the backside of the
ladder<00:00:19.259> and<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.590> front<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.279> gutter<00:00:20.430> and

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
ladder and the front of the gutter and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.130 
ladder and the front of the gutter and
so<00:00:21.900> for<00:00:22.110> when<00:00:22.349> it<00:00:22.470> comes<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:23.539> clipping<00:00:24.539> lights

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
so for when it comes to clipping lights

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.570 
so for when it comes to clipping lights
to<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> gutter<00:00:25.740> that's<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.369> really

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
to the gutter that's a really

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.609 
to the gutter that's a really
comfortable<00:00:26.970> position<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.689> because

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
comfortable position to be in because

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.800 
comfortable position to be in because
you<00:00:28.920> can<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.220> reach<00:00:29.429> down<00:00:29.460> below<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.359> bring

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
you can just reach down below and bring

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.990 
you can just reach down below and bring
your<00:00:31.019> lights<00:00:31.230> up<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.650> clip<00:00:32.160> them<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.699> we'll

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
your lights up and clip them and we'll

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.299 
your lights up and clip them and we'll
show<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.269> that<00:00:33.449> later<00:00:33.680> when<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:34.920> an<00:00:35.040> actual

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
show you that later when we do an actual

how<00:00:41.250> easy<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.789> climb<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> roof

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
how easy it is to climb up on the roof

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.119 
how easy it is to climb up on the roof
with<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> stand<00:00:43.110> off<00:00:43.289> you<00:00:43.469> see<00:00:43.620> he<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:43.739> kind<00:00:44.039> of

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
with a stand off you see he just kind of

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.850 
with a stand off you see he just kind of
climbed<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.930> off<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.170> ladder<00:00:46.350> right<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.710> onto

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
climbed up off the ladder right up onto

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.430 
climbed up off the ladder right up onto
the<00:00:46.949> roof<00:00:47.539> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.570> kind<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.079> from<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the roof you can kind of see from the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.139 
the roof you can kind of see from the
angle<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> roof<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:50.579> not<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> real<00:00:50.940> steep

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
angle of the roof it's not a real steep

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.540 
angle of the roof it's not a real steep
angle<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.770> see<00:00:52.890> how<00:00:53.010> comfortable<00:00:53.430> it

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
angle and you can see how comfortable it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.000 
angle and you can see how comfortable it
is<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.850> him<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.059> get<00:00:54.149> back<00:00:54.359> on<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> ladder<00:00:55.010> it

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
is for him to get back on the ladder it

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:06.710 
is for him to get back on the ladder it
just<00:00:56.250> provides<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> nice<00:00:56.910> stable<00:00:57.800> ladder

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.270 

you

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.580 

so<00:01:10.030> what<00:01:10.360> we're<00:01:10.480> doing<00:01:10.510> here<00:01:10.930> is<00:01:11.080> we're

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
so what we're doing here is we're

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.050 
so what we're doing here is we're
demonstrating<00:01:12.160> that<00:01:12.250> sometimes<00:01:12.670> when<00:01:12.910> you're

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
demonstrating that sometimes when you're

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.550 
demonstrating that sometimes when you're
moving<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.360> ladder<00:01:13.540> around<00:01:13.870> you<00:01:14.080> can't<00:01:14.290> forget

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
moving a ladder around you can't forget

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.920 
moving a ladder around you can't forget
that<00:01:14.620> there's<00:01:14.920> sometimes<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:15.820> tree<00:01:16.090> above<00:01:16.690> you

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
that there's sometimes a tree above you

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.290 
that there's sometimes a tree above you
and<00:01:17.140> so<00:01:18.130> you<00:01:18.190> might<00:01:18.460> pick<00:01:18.670> up<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.910> ladder<00:01:19.090> and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
and so you might pick up the ladder and

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.510 
and so you might pick up the ladder and
walk<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:19.870> then<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.950> top<00:01:21.160> of<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.370> ladder

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
walk and then the top of the ladder

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.430 
walk and then the top of the ladder
catches<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.060> tree<00:01:22.300> or<00:01:22.510> worse<00:01:22.750> yet<00:01:23.080> an

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
catches a tree or worse yet an

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.280 
catches a tree or worse yet an
electrical<00:01:24.190> line<00:01:24.870> troy's<00:01:25.870> going<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.080> go<00:01:26.200> ahead

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
electrical line troy's going to go ahead

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.020 
electrical line troy's going to go ahead
and<00:01:26.500> extend<00:01:26.800> the<00:01:26.890> ladder<00:01:27.070> up<00:01:27.340> and<00:01:27.520> show<00:01:27.970> you

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
and extend the ladder up and show you

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.880 
and extend the ladder up and show you
what<00:01:28.090> happens<00:01:33.870> see<00:01:34.870> it<00:01:34.990> just<00:01:35.170> gets<00:01:35.410> stuck<00:01:35.740> in

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
what happens see it just gets stuck in

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.250 
what happens see it just gets stuck in
all<00:01:36.010> that<00:01:36.190> tree<00:01:36.460> stuff<00:01:36.790> and<00:01:37.030> that's<00:01:37.960> just<00:01:38.170> a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
all that tree stuff and that's just a

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.830 
all that tree stuff and that's just a
big<00:01:38.380> old<00:01:38.590> problem<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.390> what's<00:01:40.660> going<00:01:40.810> to

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
big old problem so what's going to

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.620 
big old problem so what's going to
happen<00:01:40.930> is<00:01:41.290> it's<00:01:41.470> going<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.650> get<00:01:41.800> stuck<00:01:42.130> and

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
happen is it's going to get stuck and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.820 
happen is it's going to get stuck and
you're<00:01:43.630> going<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:43.869> lose<00:01:44.140> control<00:01:44.619> of<00:01:44.650> the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
you're going to lose control of the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.969 
you're going to lose control of the
ladder<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:46.090> may<00:01:46.450> or<00:01:46.600> may<00:01:46.690> not<00:01:46.720> fall<00:01:47.140> over<00:01:47.170> but

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
ladder it may or may not fall over but

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.010 
ladder it may or may not fall over but
it's<00:01:48.250> going<00:01:48.400> to<00:01:48.460> be<00:01:48.610> a<00:01:48.640> real<00:01:48.880> problem<00:01:49.090> going<00:01:49.900> to

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
it's going to be a real problem going to

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.390 
it's going to be a real problem going to
have<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.260> yank<00:01:50.680> it<00:01:50.770> out<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:50.950> there<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:51.280> it's

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
have to yank it out of there and it's

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.760 
have to yank it out of there and it's
not<00:01:51.550> going<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.760> be<00:01:51.880> easy<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:52.470> always<00:01:53.470> look

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
not going to be easy so always look

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.590 
not going to be easy so always look
ahead

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
ahead

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.270 
ahead
avoid<00:01:56.600> trees<00:01:56.899> sometimes<00:01:57.469> you<00:01:57.859> will<00:01:57.979> have<00:01:58.100> to

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
avoid trees sometimes you will have to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.919 
avoid trees sometimes you will have to
cut<00:01:58.520> tree<00:01:58.820> limbs<00:01:59.030> out<00:01:59.240> of<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.539> way<00:01:59.659> especially

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
cut tree limbs out of the way especially

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.599 
cut tree limbs out of the way especially
if<00:02:00.439> they're<00:02:00.590> too<00:02:00.740> close<00:02:00.979> to<00:02:01.189> your<00:02:01.340> roof

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
if they're too close to your roof

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.809 
if they're too close to your roof
because<00:02:02.539> if<00:02:02.810> if<00:02:03.500> tree<00:02:03.829> limbs<00:02:04.069> are<00:02:04.399> too<00:02:04.579> close

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
because if if tree limbs are too close
