 desmanches de sÃ£o paulo are looking for 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.259
 adjust to the new law regulating the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.450
 sector for the state government 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.120
 changes that start to apply from 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.880
 July can help fight crime 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.100
 such as car theft and robbery that is 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.350
 the theft followed by death 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.689
 the auto parts removal is in Osasco 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.430
 in great sao paulo per thousand year 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.529
 trucks are purchased through 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.869
 auctions and disassembled so that the parts 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.150
 documents are resold in order 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.730
 it is a guarantee for who buys the pieces 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.649
 from photos of how the vehicle was up to 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.079
 purchase receipts in a banknote auction 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.750
 in this decommissioning center. 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.910
 85 per cent of the parts of a 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.190
 truck like this one are reused 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.010
 from here they go through an analysis to 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.260
 see the quality of the instant and 10% 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.420
 are recyclable materials such as oil 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.489
 withdrawn which is later resold to 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.289
 companies re-using the product for 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.629
 was already doing much of the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.489
 required by the new law which 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.379
 greater control over products 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.589
 lack of consumer cookie agreement 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.920
 I need to make it much clearer is the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.840
 which is a cool piece is it requires 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.060
 no security quality issues 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.549
 Can you sell more security parts? 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.020
 directly the final consumer is no 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.840
 plus that thing I'm buying one 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.869
 but I'm not sure if it's a 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.490
 reputable person from the July 2 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.740
 will have to do as company 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.540
 of artur to identify each piece for 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.220
 organize the largest and most 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.229
 faces should still have a 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.210
 label with the bar code so that 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.950
 the product can be traced 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.720
 but this is an exception in the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.439
 around 4,000 dismantling of the state of 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.600
 Sao Paulo 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.950
 according to the detran many not yet 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.930
 succeeded 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.399
 in the neighborhood of pirituba the owners 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.180
 against the time to make the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.090
 changes 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.700
 missing people asphalt is simmental ground ne 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.869
 that can not be the cases can not be 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.890
 in the land where there is an area of 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.899
 contamination and exchange engines where 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.390
 will be the decontamination has to be a 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.490
 floor always felt permeable the term is 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.140
 considered small by him the ideal 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.300
 According to Victor, the pieces 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.690
 leave the factory identified 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.510
 nowadays it comes only that the engine glass 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.660
 exchange what happens says mother 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.190
 works in the case of wrong work with 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.590
 the first things he is that they 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.150
 do these parts because 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.160
 already so marked so they do not have 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.780
 The law of unmasking was useful. 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.030
 approved at the beginning of the year 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.800
 in the first quarter of 2014 the number 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.600
 increased the number of vehicle thefts 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.940
 compared to the same period of the year 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.500
 passed from 11,711 to 13,188 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.570
 secretary of public security of sÃ£o 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.950
 paulo bet that the measure will help 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.740
 reduce this type of crime 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.810
 we will discourage the practice of 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.510
 vehicle theft and theft crimes 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.790
 because these establishments 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.440
 will no longer have room to 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.620
 act what it means if we 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.410
 to succeed as Argentina did in the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.920
 passed on through the law of undercuts 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.350
 to reduce vehicle theft 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.910
 we will also be reducing robbery or 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.910
 be saving lives
