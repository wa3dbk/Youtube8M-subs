remember that when you're using em a
fine<00:00:50.010> needle<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.789> always<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.719> point<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
fine needle it's always the point of the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.319 
fine needle it's always the point of the
needle<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:53.129> will<00:00:53.309> decide<00:00:53.699> whether<00:00:54.120> or<00:00:54.210> not

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
needle that will decide whether or not

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.779 
needle that will decide whether or not
it's<00:00:54.600> suitable<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.949> fabric<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.670> you're

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
it's suitable for the fabric that you're

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.290 
it's suitable for the fabric that you're
using<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.920> I've<00:00:58.920> got<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.340> cotton<00:00:59.789> fabric

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
using here I've got a cotton fabric

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.420 
using here I've got a cotton fabric
which<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.809> medium<00:01:01.469> weight<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.920> I've<00:01:02.219> chosen

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
which is medium weight and I've chosen

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.039 
which is medium weight and I've chosen
to<00:01:02.789> go<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.809> needle<00:01:04.110> size<00:01:04.939> 12<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.900> be

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
to go with that needle size 12 it can be

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.920 
to go with that needle size 12 it can be
high<00:01:07.229> okay<00:01:07.260> go<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> put<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> 14<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.390> will

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
high okay go to put to a 14 it will

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.859 
high okay go to put to a 14 it will
depend<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.820> weight<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> fabric<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.570> if

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
depend on the weight of the fabric so if

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.990 
depend on the weight of the fabric so if
this<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.170> slightly<00:01:13.560> heavier<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.340> presume<00:01:14.970> that

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
this is slightly heavier I presume that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.350 
this is slightly heavier I presume that
I<00:01:15.180> may<00:01:15.509> choose<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.229> size<00:01:16.619> 14<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.670> best<00:01:18.030> choice

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
I may choose a size 14 but best choice

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.990 
I may choose a size 14 but best choice
to<00:01:18.390> make<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.710> row<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.250> stitching<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
to make is to do a row of stitching and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.020 
to make is to do a row of stitching and
then<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:21.659> help<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.170> decide<00:01:23.000> here<00:01:24.000> I

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
then that will help you to decide here I

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.560 
then that will help you to decide here I
have<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.810> size<00:01:25.229> 16<00:01:26.040> needle<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:27.150> usable

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
have a size 16 needle and it's usable

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.690 
have a size 16 needle and it's usable
for<00:01:27.750> heavier<00:01:28.020> type<00:01:28.229> fabrics<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.340> case

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
for heavier type fabrics in this case

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.109 
for heavier type fabrics in this case
I've<00:01:29.939> got<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.299> cotton<00:01:30.780> velvet<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:32.070> war<00:01:32.460> you

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
I've got a cotton velvet and a war you

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.840 
I've got a cotton velvet and a war you
can<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.570> slightly<00:01:33.930> heavier<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> size<00:01:35.070> 18

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
can go slightly heavier to a size 18

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.149 
can go slightly heavier to a size 18
depending<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.259> thickness<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.009> fabric

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
depending on the thickness of the fabric

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.280 
depending on the thickness of the fabric
you're<00:01:38.490> using<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.090> 18<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:39.990> particularly

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
you're using and 18 is particularly

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.050 
you're using and 18 is particularly
suitable<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:41.180> heavier<00:01:42.180> type<00:01:42.450> denim<00:01:43.079> fabric

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
suitable for heavier type denim fabric

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.819 
suitable for heavier type denim fabric
what<00:01:45.060> I'm<00:01:45.119> showing<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.420> here<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> points

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
what I'm showing you here is the points

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.980 
what I'm showing you here is the points
of<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> needle<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.479> what<00:01:48.689> really

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
of the needle and that is what really

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.289 
of the needle and that is what really
determines<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:50.280> choice<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.820> fabric<00:01:51.270> that

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
determines the choice of fabric that

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.270 
determines the choice of fabric that
you're<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.750> go<00:01:51.899> for<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> left

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you're going to go for so on the left

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.160 
you're going to go for so on the left
hand<00:01:53.520> side<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.420> see<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.750> needle<00:01:54.899> is

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
hand side you can see the needle is

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.109 
hand side you can see the needle is
thicker<00:01:55.500> compared<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> needle<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
thicker compared to the needle on the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.969 
thicker compared to the needle on the
right<00:01:57.299> hand<00:01:57.600> side<00:01:57.869> which<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.500> telling<00:01:58.740> you
