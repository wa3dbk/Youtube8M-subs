00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.980
 a wire of 4 to 6 millimeters 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:12.520
 every time the engine is switched off in the 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:17.380
 the battery in the panel lights up ok 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:21.710
 confirmed ball is the exit that goes to 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:26.589
 charging the battery is 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.089
 the output of more green 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:33.800
 shown on the back of the 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:37.250
 alternator this point of more data 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.329
 is the wire that comes out of the 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.470
 drums 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.470
 there in the panel 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.790
 we finish the assembly of the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.909
 coach 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.199
 our next step is the load test 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:58.100
 to check if the same is 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:01.670
 working recharging the battery 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.059
 follow the final load test 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.550
 of the alternator perceives the pilot light 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.350
 on the battery 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.350
 now the engine is spinning 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.680
 O 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.950
 notices that the lamp has gone out 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.470
 It means what the alternator is 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.470
 Good, everything that was done is ok. 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.630
 after mounting the voltage regulator 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.609
 do not forget the two screws have 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.579
 to be tight 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:49.590
 then the instructor pulls the wire 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.109
 loosening the two brushes following the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.229
 the instructor and fits the 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.229
 voltage 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.619
 then the instructor places the first 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:11.630
 screw holding the regulator 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:13.030
 voltage to complete the 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.550
 Assembly 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.390
 we show voltage regulator where 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.420
 Here the recoil coal brushes 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:28.040
 not run the risk of being broken in the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.980
 the assembly time, proceeding 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.920
 placement of the first screw does not 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.830
 Forget the four have to be 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.830
 totally tight 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.830
 following the placement of the four 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.830
 screws 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:57.120
 the two reference points that were 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:02.819
 disassembly now makes it easier to 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:06.599
 following assembly and continuing the 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:13.980
 rear mount docked there 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:20.640
 on the part of the rotor cover perceives the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:31.319
 two branded risk has to be well 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:40.470
 tight sapper proceeds now 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:47.480
 alternator is tightened around the 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.480
 position the pulley and then 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.450
 before the pieces 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:18.760
 following the placement of the hand 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.570
 through the eta key switch and the 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.630
 rest 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:27.390
 continuing the assembly 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.390
 the box instructor the rotor in the cap 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.529
 at the end of the spain act of the three 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.509
 three stature tips on the bridge 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:52.319
 grinding the weld has to stay low 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.829
 OK 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:59.239
 otherwise the engine when it turns handle 

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:59.239
 at the stator tips
