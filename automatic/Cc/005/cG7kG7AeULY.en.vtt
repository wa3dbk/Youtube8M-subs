00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:07.990
 at the first generation you remember 

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:09.190
 charizard with slice the carnage roux 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.500
 in all teams 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.740
 and then captured better all that was 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.970
 something frankly but it's 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.429
 true that at the time we were all a little 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.339
 big fat big brel in 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:22.539
 strategy but percent at the time already 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.480
 there were people who were playing in 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.619
 strategy so what was it 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.249
 excellent at the time 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.599
 knowing that everything was different between 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:34.060
 attacks they have blows 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.280
 critics all the time the fact that the 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.470
 photo type did not exist in term of 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.480
 attack that the guy was weak at 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.010
 himself 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.110
 what was doing well 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.960
 at the time that's what we will see 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.570
 right away with this new top 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.590
 the first pokemon the monster of the 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.920
 first generation 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.200
 it was the lucky guy 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.230
 talk about what pokemon to turn to to rock 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.630
 and kind the biggest defensive pokemon 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.430
 of the game yes yes except at the time 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.400
 besides being a defensive monster 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.190
 it was also an offensive monster you 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.920
 actually explains to the first 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.750
 generation the statistics of attacks 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.590
 special and special defense 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.710
 did one was called the special 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.280
 weblogic 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.250
 at the time the lucky man had 105 of 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.400
 special 105 special is typing more 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.700
 strong that giraschi or selebi almost 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.740
 as loud as the udc cart see a 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.080
 little deal and in addition we know that the 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.810
 lucky man access to blanzat ice thunder 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.600
 and so x so we ended up a 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.420
 pokemon box not only tank and the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.600
 special as a fool but in addition to that 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.380
 he's typing is super strong second pokemon 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.450
 we could see everywhere it's at the casa 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.149
 to the casa which still today is a 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.649
 excellent pokemon it must be confessed 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.409
 always been a good pokemon especially 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.630
 since he has recovered the guard talent 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.119
 magic but at the time it was not that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.020
 that it would make it overuse it was obviously 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.989
 the psy guy to huy the psy guy was the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.450
 most powerful type of the game obviously 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.819
 case the type if they had only one 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.760
 weakness and was himself on the 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.610
 tables were weak at phantom type 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.700
 but the spectrum type did not have any 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.019
 attack so in these cases there as well say 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.640
 that he had only one weakness and 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.010
 himself had to manage 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.650
 one to the casa needed another to the casa 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.989
 or a staros who was another big 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.440
 pokemon of type so in addition with his 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.440
 special e130 it was just intuable on 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.690
 this plan up to now we say to ourselves because 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.480
 there only for the special but not you 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.579
 do not worry because the real pokemon 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.230
 killer of the first generation 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:54.810
 it was toros toros it's the little 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.609
 bull the safege tries since the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.950
 third generation that he was born towards 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.859
 ie it means that nobody uses 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.170
 never a normal type all that is 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.459
 more classic with good speed and 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.290
 a good attack but it's over then 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.220
 why they were so powerful the 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.799
 it's very simple it was mechanics 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.410
 ultra ultra laser laser you know 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.180
 this attack made it a super effects 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.190
 of death when we saw him on draco 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.019
 water that against peter you you 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.700
 remember and here it was 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.069
 best super users of the Azun 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.459
 game in fact you arrived with your 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.739
 toews 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.230
 it was enough to plating on the 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.530
 switch with a good chance of betting and 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.040
 to finish with ultra ultra laser laser 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.530
 who at the time if you would have the kiel 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.810
 on the pokemon opposite did not need 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.519
 no recharge 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.590
 so that you could chained 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.079
 the ultrasonic laser with your toros which 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.900
 was incidentally the type pokemon 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.430
 normal with the strongest attak without 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.439
 count complex obviously 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.000
 but on top of that he was very fast 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.370
 and you know that at the time the blows 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.799
 critics were related to speed so 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.140
 toros had about 20% chance of 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.730
 make a critical hit t still not 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.060
 so disgusting for all these reasons 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.500
 toros and is just excellent then of the 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.420
 blow the next pokemon is very 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.819
 simple is that toro it was so 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.150
 difficult to manage create only way to the 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.190
 manage 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.049
 they were close friends and that's why 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.449
 that I will tell you about graulhet even 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.580
 grau lem who is today also a 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.650
 pokemon never used but who to 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.720
 the time had its place in almost 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.840
 all the tic it was obliged to have 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.389
 a way to manage toros in a team 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.910
 simon toros you mine and mouth and 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:39.389
 yes golem with his rock guy who was holding 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.340
 beautifully the two toros damage and 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.490
 who fought back with big earthquakes 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.220
 which was very very very very bad it 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.580
 at the fifth pokemon surely the set 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.580
 wolf or dog that has ever existed in 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.930
 the game its colossal sheets so what is it 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.419
 that they help touting him enjoy 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.840
 another guichen game party and get 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.280
 guidj it was the bonding glitch in 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.260
 effect in generation when you were 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.860
 tied up this attack 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.720
 at the time prevent fleeing as long as the 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.370
 pokemon was faster than you what 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.830
 which could be sink in fact parat 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.110
 double did he do it then you 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.760
 pamiers and the guy in front could not 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.099
 do nothing because you were more 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.479
 fast than him and on top of that he had 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.159
 still access an ultra laser 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.550
 extremely powerful thanks to its base 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.280
 attack 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.849
 he also had access to thunder and 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.310
 laser therefore rather not disgusting place 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.900
 this colossal cloth and the last pokemon 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.210
 because obviously to make a 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.560
 pokemon team it takes 6 and that's 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.110
 more for the joke than anything else but 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.180
 it's persia and yes nobody who then 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.099
 him for once you never see them again 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.380
 people have forgotten that they were perceived in 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:49.320
 obviously has the cat guillaume anies 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.590
 and well just enjoy version 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.480
 another glyph of the 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.580
 I mean they had access to 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.630
 slice that had a rate of hits 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.000
 100% critics so to come up with 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.020
 your version and then critical hit or 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.760
 critics critical hits 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.960
 critics i can assure you that even 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.800
 if perceived does not have statistics 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.450
 fantastic 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.700
 apart from the speed obviously and ben 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:13.120
 get a critical shot h that was 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.100
 rather not disgusting here you have 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.200
 this team of killers beyond the 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.630
 generation one actually you see 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.770
 capabilities the mechanics have 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.750
 much changed since 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.520
 and finally it's not worse because 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.740
 that today we have a balanced game 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.150
 whereas before all the teams get 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.490
 look like being because otherwise we get 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.990
 rolled over 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.880
 go that's all for me today I 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.880
 tell you at the next chip
