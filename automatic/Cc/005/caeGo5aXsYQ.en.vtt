are<00:01:37.610> one<00:01:37.820> goal<00:01:38.030> games<00:01:38.360> giving<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.470> win<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:40.070> the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
are one goal games giving the win to the

underdog on a puck line bet or the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.410 
underdog on a puck line bet or the
underdog<00:01:43.580> might<00:01:43.790> win<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.030> game<00:01:44.180> outright

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
underdog might win the game outright

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.570 
underdog might win the game outright
which<00:01:44.960> is<00:01:45.110> also<00:01:45.259> a<00:01:45.440> win<00:01:45.619> for<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:45.950> underdog

so basically the puck line is picking

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.359 
so basically the puck line is picking
the<00:01:50.899> favorite<00:01:51.229> team<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.530> win<00:01:51.619> by<00:01:51.799> two<00:01:51.830> or<00:01:52.220> more

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
the favorite team to win by two or more

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.969 
the favorite team to win by two or more
goals<00:01:52.640> or<00:01:52.970> picking<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.780> underdog<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.560> lose<00:01:54.770> by

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
goals or picking the underdog to lose by

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.800 
goals or picking the underdog to lose by
a<00:01:55.009> goal<00:01:55.310> or<00:01:55.640> win<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:55.910> game<00:01:56.119> outright<00:01:56.330> it's

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
a goal or win the game outright it's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.320 
a goal or win the game outright it's
