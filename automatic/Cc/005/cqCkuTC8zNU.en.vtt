important<00:00:28.230> thing<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.529> see<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.859> that

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
important thing that you see is that

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.550 
important thing that you see is that
there<00:00:29.340> are<00:00:29.400> no<00:00:29.519> buttons<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.720> there's<00:00:30.900> no<00:00:31.019> hard

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
there are no buttons so there's no hard

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.930 
there are no buttons so there's no hard
key<00:00:31.710> buttons<00:00:31.980> no<00:00:32.160> soft<00:00:32.399> key<00:00:32.520> buttons<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.880> are

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
key buttons no soft key buttons that are

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.459 
key buttons no soft key buttons that are
there<00:00:33.120> all<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> time<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:34.140> interface

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
there all the time the interface

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.900 
there all the time the interface
basically<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.890> designed<00:00:35.040> around<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.550> edges

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
basically is designed around the edges

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.670 
basically is designed around the edges
so<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.570> user<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.899> interact<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> phone

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
so the user can interact with the phone

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.830 
so the user can interact with the phone
by<00:00:37.860> using<00:00:37.920> all<00:00:38.370> four<00:00:38.640> edges<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.300> every<00:00:39.690> edge

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
by using all four edges and every edge

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.220 
by using all four edges and every edge
is<00:00:40.160> used<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:42.030> different<00:00:42.329> purpose<00:00:42.660> for

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
is used for different purpose for

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.920 
is used for different purpose for
example<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.710> left<00:00:43.890> side<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
example on the left side I have the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.000 
example on the left side I have the
launcher<00:00:45.930> where<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.590> put<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.800> favorite

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
launcher where I can put my favorite

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.369 
launcher where I can put my favorite
apps<00:00:47.340> are<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.329> probably<00:00:48.870> notice<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.200> many

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
apps are we probably notice that many

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.069 
apps are we probably notice that many
users<00:00:49.770> who<00:00:50.370> use<00:00:50.579> maximum<00:00:50.969> 10<00:00:51.510> apps<00:00:51.840> very

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
users who use maximum 10 apps very

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.040 
users who use maximum 10 apps very
frequently<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.579> allows<00:00:53.940> much<00:00:54.270> easier<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
frequently and it allows much easier and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.590 
frequently and it allows much easier and
faster<00:00:55.289> access<00:00:55.620> points<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.699> those<00:00:56.820> apps<00:00:57.059> right

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
faster access points to those apps right

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.980 
faster access points to those apps right
so<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.109> also<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.649> home<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.030> can

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
so I also have home so I can

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.210 
so I also have home so I can
go<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.470> home<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.710> basically<00:01:01.980> buy<00:01:02.130> that

really
for<00:01:37.590> example<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.920> gallery<00:01:38.130> app<00:01:38.250> which<00:01:38.399> is

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
for example the gallery app which is

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.700 
for example the gallery app which is
native<00:01:38.729> app<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.690> we<00:01:39.810> both<00:01:39.960> open<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.560> both

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
native app so we both open the both

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.469 
native app so we both open the both
native<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.460> web<00:01:41.759> app<00:01:41.940> so<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.180> example

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
native and web app so for example

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.840 
native and web app so for example
Facebook<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> web<00:01:43.110> app<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.520> galleries

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
Facebook is a web app and the galleries

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.850 
Facebook is a web app and the galleries
in<00:01:44.940> native<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.360> rights<00:01:45.660> over<00:01:45.840> there<00:01:46.560> equal

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
in native have rights over there equal

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.370 
in native have rights over there equal
citizens<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> bunch<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.050> look<00:01:49.229> at<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
citizens on a bunch of so we look at the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.410 
citizens on a bunch of so we look at the
app<00:01:49.530> now<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.550> core<00:01:51.180> principles

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
app now one of the core principles

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.060 
app now one of the core principles
behind<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.500> didn't<00:01:52.770> want<00:01:52.890> to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
behind this that we didn't want to

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.380 
behind this that we didn't want to
obscure<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> interface<00:01:53.820> with<00:01:53.970> all<00:01:54.090> kinds<00:01:54.330> of

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
obscure the interface with all kinds of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.810 
obscure the interface with all kinds of
controls<00:01:54.780> over<00:01:54.960> time<00:01:55.200> we<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:56.580> give<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
controls over time we really give the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.010 
controls over time we really give the
prominence<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.390> content<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:57.869> I'm<00:01:57.930> gonna

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
prominence to the content so I'm gonna

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.139 
prominence to the content so I'm gonna
use<00:01:58.200> start<00:01:58.440> scrolling<00:01:58.619> or<00:01:59.100> eventually<00:01:59.850> all

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
use start scrolling or eventually all

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.930 
use start scrolling or eventually all
the<00:02:00.420> all<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.500> controls<00:02:01.830> go<00:02:01.979> away<00:02:02.190> when<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.460> go

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
the all the controls go away when I go

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.550 
the all the controls go away when I go
back<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.330> header<00:02:03.690> comes<00:02:03.899> back<00:02:04.110> right<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.500> I

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
back to the header comes back right so I

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.060 
back to the header comes back right so I
can<00:02:04.740> change<00:02:05.400> to<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> different<00:02:05.790> view<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:07.799> events

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
can change to a different view to events

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.859 
can change to a different view to events
for<00:02:08.220> example<00:02:08.250> when<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.179> stop<00:02:09.330> scrolling<00:02:09.510> again

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
for example when I stop scrolling again

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.760 
for example when I stop scrolling again
it<00:02:09.989> goes<00:02:10.080> away<00:02:10.229> see

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
it goes away see

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.100 
it goes away see
for<00:02:12.770> example<00:02:13.240> open-open<00:02:14.240> picture<00:02:14.690> for

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
for example open-open picture for

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.110 
for example open-open picture for
example<00:02:15.170> can<00:02:15.440> open<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.710> space<00:02:15.860> here<00:02:16.040> right<00:02:16.610> and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
example can open a space here right and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.280 
example can open a space here right and
I<00:02:17.330> want<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.570> do<00:02:17.630> something<00:02:17.870> with<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.050> picture

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
I want to do something with the picture

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.040 
I want to do something with the picture
initially<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.040> don't<00:02:19.280> see<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.690> any<00:02:20.690> controls

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
initially I don't see it any controls

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.360 
initially I don't see it any controls
when<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.560> want<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.860> do<00:02:21.980> something<00:02:22.220> with<00:02:22.310> the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
when I want to do something with the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.680 
when I want to do something with the
picture<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:22.610> can<00:02:22.700> use<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.120> bottom<00:02:23.360> edge<00:02:23.450> for

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
picture I can use the bottom edge for

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.360 
picture I can use the bottom edge for
that<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.530> for<00:02:24.620> example<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:24.920> can<00:02:24.980> head<00:02:25.190> up<00:02:25.220> the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
that so for example I can head up the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.950 
that so for example I can head up the
picture<00:02:25.640> if<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.790> want<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.120> also<00:02:26.420> see<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.660> picture

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
picture if I want to also see a picture

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.700 
picture if I want to also see a picture
if<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.200> want<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.610> all<00:02:28.610> go<00:02:28.790> back<00:02:29.000> right<00:02:29.710> another

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
if I want to all go back right another

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.760 
if I want to all go back right another
important<00:02:31.580> thing<00:02:31.700> is<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:32.470> what<00:02:33.470> we<00:02:33.560> saw<00:02:33.740> was

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
important thing is that what we saw was

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.860 
important thing is that what we saw was
that<00:02:33.920> many<00:02:34.160> people<00:02:34.370> when<00:02:35.300> they're<00:02:35.450> using<00:02:35.600> apps

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
that many people when they're using apps

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.170 
that many people when they're using apps
sometimes<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.530> want<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.710> go<00:02:36.830> into<00:02:36.950> settings<00:02:37.310> and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
sometimes I want to go into settings and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.210 
sometimes I want to go into settings and
in<00:02:38.330> many<00:02:38.840> platforms<00:02:39.410> there<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:40.010> go<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.160> the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
in many platforms there to go to the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.890 
in many platforms there to go to the
home<00:02:40.550> screen<00:02:40.730> go<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.030> settings<00:02:41.450> menu<00:02:41.690> deep

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
home screen go to settings menu deep

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.840 
home screen go to settings menu deep
dive<00:02:42.110> into<00:02:42.320> that<00:02:42.500> Howie<00:02:43.190> for<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.760> be

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
dive into that Howie for that to be

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.150 
dive into that Howie for that to be
that's<00:02:44.420> been<00:02:44.660> easy<00:02:44.810> ways<00:02:45.020> of<00:02:45.260> doing<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:45.620> and

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
that's been easy ways of doing that and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.400 
that's been easy ways of doing that and
that's<00:02:46.340> basically<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.940> top<00:02:47.090> edge<00:02:47.240> jobs<00:02:47.570> so

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
that's basically the top edge jobs so

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.260 
that's basically the top edge jobs so
the<00:02:48.560> top<00:02:48.740> right<00:02:48.890> especially<00:02:49.670> allows<00:02:49.880> me<00:02:50.030> to

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
the top right especially allows me to

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.110 
the top right especially allows me to
fastly<00:02:51.260> drill<00:02:51.500> down<00:02:51.680> into<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:52.850> specific

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
fastly drill down into a specific

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.690 
fastly drill down into a specific
settings<00:02:53.750> menu<00:02:53.990> so<00:02:54.110> for<00:02:54.200> example<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.530> battery

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
settings menu so for example the battery

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.640 
settings menu so for example the battery
or<00:02:55.700> net<00:02:55.880> whatever<00:02:56.810> works<00:02:56.960> for<00:02:57.020> example<00:02:57.500> right

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
or net whatever works for example right

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.470 
or net whatever works for example right
so<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:58.190> can<00:02:58.610> bring<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.820> back<00:02:58.940> up<00:02:59.060> because<00:02:59.150> those

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
so I can bring it back up because those

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.220 
so I can bring it back up because those
batteries<00:02:59.810> well<00:02:59.960> CPU<00:03:01.810> when<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:02.930> bring<00:03:03.080> it

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
batteries well CPU when you bring it

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:12.880 
batteries well CPU when you bring it
down<00:03:03.350> like<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:04.190> notification<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:12.410> also<00:03:12.620> allows

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
down like a notification it also allows

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.890 
down like a notification it also allows
me<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.730> focus<00:03:13.820> on<00:03:13.970> messages<00:03:14.420> well<00:03:14.660> we<00:03:14.780> also

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
me to focus on messages well we also

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.820 
me to focus on messages well we also
have<00:03:14.960> messages<00:03:15.380> there<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.650> I<00:03:15.709> could

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
have messages there and I could

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.190 
have messages there and I could
aggragate<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.730> few<00:03:16.910> of<00:03:17.000> my<00:03:17.060> messages<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:18.080> for

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
aggragate a few of my messages so for

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.560 
aggragate a few of my messages so for
example<00:03:18.530> callback<00:03:19.180> more<00:03:20.180> positive<00:03:20.510> message

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
example callback more positive message

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.330 
example callback more positive message
I'll<00:03:21.080> bring<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.380> back<00:03:21.470> up<00:03:21.620> again<00:03:21.680> I'm<00:03:21.980> Amitabh

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
I'll bring it back up again I'm Amitabh

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.190 
I'll bring it back up again I'm Amitabh
Bachhan<00:03:22.550> tamiya<00:03:22.760> right<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:23.600> it's<00:03:23.750> much<00:03:24.020> faster

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
Bachhan tamiya right so it's much faster

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.920 
Bachhan tamiya right so it's much faster
way<00:03:24.530> of

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
way of

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.069 
way of
she's<00:03:25.230> never<00:03:25.319> getting<00:03:25.470> around<00:03:25.799> so<00:03:26.569> that's<00:03:27.569> the

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
she's never getting around so that's the

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.470 
she's never getting around so that's the
top<00:03:28.500> hatch<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.849> what<00:03:29.970> we<00:03:30.060> also<00:03:30.209> did

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
top hatch and this is what we also did

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.080 
top hatch and this is what we also did
was<00:03:31.140> using<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.980> right<00:03:32.129> edge<00:03:32.340> for<00:03:32.670> swishing

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
was using the right edge for swishing

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.119 
was using the right edge for swishing
very<00:03:33.480> fast<00:03:33.689> between<00:03:33.959> apps<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:34.739> for<00:03:34.860> example

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
very fast between apps so for example

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.100 
very fast between apps so for example
when<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.280> go<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.459> camera<00:03:38.060> take<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.090> picture<00:03:40.079> of

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
when I go to camera take a picture of

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.830 
when I go to camera take a picture of
this<00:03:40.230> beautiful<00:03:40.379> carpet<00:03:40.950> right<00:03:41.909> after<00:03:42.750> the
