00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.800
 gamepad from xbox one but not easy 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.289
 gamepad gamepad we madden haven 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.510
 it's a pretty long story i will try 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.369
 tell briefly the fact is that 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.160
 once a girl put me like 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.199
 mini at tim there that is i must 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.090
 gamepad exclusive which will be 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.520
 only he will then agree with 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.160
 me play games on this console 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.500
 Here I chose a long time and threw different 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.780
 colorings of coloring and as a result 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.780
 she wanted it that turned out to be 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.149
 no less that he had 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.340
 not quite the usual color as well 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.890
 some frills that give pretty 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.500
 step on the production here is some 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.980
 farmstead and give you imagine 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.640
 so we will stand there module home. 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.079
 this here is such a take grass and joy 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.619
 he shimmers 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.570
 such blue lilac food made of sequins 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.640
 the sign for the girl is simple 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.979
 crazy pay attention that he 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.760
 it flashes a little subtype now by 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.250
 charged and in general what we will 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.500
 testit I'll link because 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.939
 such told them how it is not at all 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.250
 usual he can say a little fitr 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.439
 where is he a little fedor and he has 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.630
 Here is such a gum. 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.369
 Here is such a paper on which 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.799
 explains a lot of things 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.780
 interesting for example it was fees 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.060
 make a hidden firebird fair like a mod 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.630
 mimic jitter fire automatic on it 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.880
 bass drop shot and author us to do for 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.020
 year and how and then searched the order not 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.909
 do of the supporting there are many, many 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.079
 Total 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.640
 naturally this is supported in 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:02.700
 certain morning can not year 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.890
 I do not know why it is ice so far 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.170
 Leaf grandfather, too, not know whether to do 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.140
 fucked by the of these curly god pan 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.790
 here it is written how much thread you need 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.430
 year 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.280
 battlefield 4 is dead so i 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.959
 I think let's Kama we check it on 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.160
 battlefield 4 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.160
 and so it went 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.359
 honestly going four turns I thought that 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.280
 except for humiliation nothing else 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.889
 I'll get a few deaths later 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.139
 neponyatki how to run a macro and I realized 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.590
 that some functions do not work in 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.650
 battle 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.150
 but work in chaldea and vice versa 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.469
 everything turns on and off is simple 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.299
 clamping two new 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.370
 for example, to enable auto run you need 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.859
 hold both stick and up and 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.959
 I got such combos in the end 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.480
 include quick staples and jamshut fraction that 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.189
 jitter even by well and most importantly 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.379
 of the back which is significant 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.879
 facilitates multiplayer gaming process 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.189
 shooters by the way 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.620
 the gamepad turned out to be programmable on it 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.449
 can you make your presets say 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.549
 frankly all of the above is not for 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:22.310
 ordinary player but for certain people 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.959
 who can not live without cheats personally 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.500
 I don't like a screw at all 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.480
 consoles 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.329
 It was wildly uncomfortable to play with such 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.209
 nishtyak also avtonavdedenie there 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.579
 but do not rejoice works only in 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.090
 single game modes and zombie mode 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.799
 koldy 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.680
 did this gamepad make it easier for me 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.930
 process yes but I would not say that I played 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.970
 much better than the usual gamepad 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.790
 just a little more comfortable running plan and 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.500
 quick reload gamepad cool come out 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.959
 and the functionality is great so 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.500
 purchase is clearly justified problem only in 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.540
 the price tag is worth a gamepad like 1 x box 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.629
 average condition here and guess what 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.060
 price tag well, but on this I have everything all bye 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.310
 Swami was you point loved qx cops and 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.840
 headshots play good games and not 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.540
 forget to subscribe to my channel 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.879
 put like yes they write good 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.879
 comment everyone good luck 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.560
