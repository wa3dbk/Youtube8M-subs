00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello serenac I wanted to share with 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.000
 you a little trick to recover 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.559
 a lot of sand so if you have 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.840
 need sand to make glass or 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.790
 if you want to make sandstone it's true 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.880
 that it is not easy to find 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.410
 a lot of regrets so from there it takes 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.779
 recover sand and turn it into 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.480
 sandstone and therefore art me what I 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.689
 is that this is my little girl 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.949
 sand quarry actually is the trick 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.149
 is simply had to think 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.770
 it's true that I needed 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.410
 a lot of sand in fact you just need 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.600
 to dig below the sand okay 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.300
 and you dig up to two blocks in 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.719
 under and in two blocks solid then 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.210
 you just have to dig first 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:54.120
 block 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:58.410
 from the bottom and so I'm going dig 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 to the dish and then you stick some 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.799
 torches underneath so I believe that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.290
 you gave a tip with some 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.030
 rails to harvest the gravel so well 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.210
 sure to Belgian facet torch of course 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.509
 it works it works also with the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.310
 gravel and then then you break the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.890
 second block and so the sand goes its 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.880
 falls and who is subject gravity and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.090
 he's going to smash on the torches and 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.180
 so you will recover 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.400
 you will recover a lot of not bad 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.340
 of sand and then afterwards it suffices 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.680
 to take an object then high risk 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.150
 provided they left and then 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.189
 you advance then at the same time that you 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.890
 allows you to recover from recovering your 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.220
 torch 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.220
 this is simply 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.610
 so after that there is that if 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.869
 you have the opportunity to come across 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.240
 a flaw so how can we sell 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.759
 there so see what I did is that 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.470
 I created a floor under the under 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:13.670
 sandstone blocks and then and then from there 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.569
 I just need to remove it 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.040
 to remove sandstone blocks one hesitates and not 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.700
 sub nevertheless sent because it 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.390
 there are hotbeds the sand which where there is 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.470
 no solid block underneath and if you 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.620
 have a family torch well you you 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.150
 find yourself with a pile of sand and you 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.090
 can not save time I 'm less 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.160
 to regroove again below what is 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.680
 there it's still two lines that 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.450
 have fallen and then then once 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.090
 you have harvested your sand to make 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.470
 the gray is pretty simple enough 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.010
 you do not even need a workshop 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.470
 you put four blocks of sand as 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:00.650
 these and it makes you a block of 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:02.810
 sandstone you produced you produced 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.890
 not bad degrees if you need degree 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.989
 also a little trick 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.120
 know that if you have the chance to 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.019
 find a good pyramid if you even if 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.630
 you do not want to destroy it 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.720
 it would be finally after it's up to you to 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.700
 see but 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.719
 know that if you dig in the basement 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.819
 you have four five degree writers 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:29.549
 below the pyramid in fact and 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.329
 so that allows you to dig alone under 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.159
 the pyramid without damaging it and is 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.219
 harvest a lot degrees for me this 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.769
 that it is that I have already done 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:43.950
 for the pyramid that is next and so 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.209
 so I still have a lot of it 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.090
 I need a lot of degrees for 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.269
 to enlarge the village so voila 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.849
 So that's the way it works. 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.010
 recover again to recover a lot of 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.480
 sand whatever it is for I told you 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.599
 to do what you want to do 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:05.730
 glass or constructions but that's it 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:09.629
 I hope these tips this little 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.189
 trick will have pleased you so if she has you 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:16.889
 please make a little green thumb 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:19.340
 it will be nice and then and then 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:24.720
 bada remember to subscribe too that will be 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.919
 that's still nice here so if you 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.750
 have other tips in kind there 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:33.659
 do not hesitate to share them game I 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.600
 will make videos if if you want them 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:39.580
 to share so that's okay listen to me I 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.770
 I'm going back to the village and then I 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.850
 may be going though I saw that 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.930
 night I may have to continue to 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.400
 pick up some sand waiting 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.530
 days and then I'm going we'll continue on 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.380
 maybe going to make a farm at 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.380
 mushrooms here go see you soon
