 until I come out what I'm looking forward to me 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.340
 Today on the other side it says 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.290

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.510
 Tomorrow and Saturday will not stream 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.070

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.620

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.280
 Sometime next week spontaneously 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.559

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.930
 vacation or have to have time anyway 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.910
 At 8 o'clock something was pretty easy 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.010

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.119
 So yes, I'll just go to the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.590

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.830
 I would not be two every day 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.450
 I only make three videos about it 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.220

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.770

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.090

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.680
 we can get it out there that is 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.409
 want to know her across all ages 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.460

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.290
 I could be very, very much 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.210
 so you are happy to write the comments 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.100
 what you think about the real morning 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.960
 come out because I would ask you 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.659
 made as soon as demo from the game outside 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.369
 is played the next day and it is 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.909
 recognizes scott he does not stick to any 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.380
 meeting 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.299
 you could say come in three years 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.070
 By the way, the game says outside tomorrow 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.750
 nothing about the change simply outside 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.119
 is it there and then should new stars 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.500
 play where is that with a triple am 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.119
 I also a bit stupid but what has 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.280
 the page may also be called 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.670
 might go to gamescom yet 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.020
 will 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.970
 i actually wanted to go on saturday 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.310
 gamescom keep the problem 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.320
 actually whistle as the exact day 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.640
 information should be profile gamescom if 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.480
 it does not come tomorrow I am here 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.800
 maybe at gamescom 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.230
 it can be quite spontaneous because of that 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.970
 I do not say so much then me 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.410
 In any case, I have had a lot, even if 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.090
 I then see a little pissed off 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.440
 am that the type is always changing 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.230
 and do not say on any dates 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.790
 can that demo that alexis the game 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.050
 because once I have finished 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.970
 could as easily say normal data 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.040
 but hey it's god not the youngest 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.420
 So win in the next few days 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.080
 they can probably four to four 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.970
 expect 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.890
 I'll try tomorrow maybe 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.930
 even a mission statement deploy way 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.459
 even if fans can get out on that 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.020
 project still can finish where I 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.070
 so last two nights I make 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.930
 only with all the projects I now 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.410
 finished if namely a network care 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.690
 can 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.209
 that will be cool, I know that very well 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.410
 and had update but that has to be yes 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.640
 maybe wait it depends how 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.990
 that's how it works, maybe even 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.150
 already record tonight while I am 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.160
 wait or something but it will eventually 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.750
 out because no children we sat 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.650
 will see but that means it will be very 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.950
 give a lot of time 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.170
 you can rejoice i am happy we 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.070
 see us and are for the s4 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.070
 possibly
