let's<00:00:27.660> go<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.260> tools<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.779> then<00:00:30.779> announce

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
let's go to tools and then announce

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.010 
let's go to tools and then announce
cubes<00:00:32.040> down<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.390> create<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> pivot

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
cubes down here and I create a pivot

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.180 
cubes down here and I create a pivot
table<00:00:34.489> I've<00:00:35.489> set<00:00:35.760> up<00:00:35.790> some<00:00:35.880> standard<00:00:37.190> pivot

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
table I've set up some standard pivot

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.310 
table I've set up some standard pivot
table<00:00:38.460> templates<00:00:38.910> already<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:40.079> all<00:00:40.230> this

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
table templates already and all this

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.470 
table templates already and all this
does<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.800> really<00:00:40.980> allows<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.969> system<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.329> take

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
does is really allows the system to take

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.150 
does is really allows the system to take
the<00:00:42.600> data<00:00:42.809> from<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> analysis<00:00:43.739> cube<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the data from the analysis cube and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.310 
the data from the analysis cube and
throw<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.460> into<00:00:44.579> Excel<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.300> really<00:00:46.170> it

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
throw it into Excel and really it

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.020 
throw it into Excel and really it
doesn't<00:00:46.350> matter<00:00:46.770> which<00:00:47.039> field<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.489> use<00:00:47.760> in

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
doesn't matter which field you use in

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.119 
doesn't matter which field you use in
here<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:49.079> long<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.500> some<00:00:49.710> fields

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
here as long as you have some fields

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.799 
here as long as you have some fields
because<00:00:50.340> when<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.520> goes<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.670> excel<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.660> have

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
because when it goes to excel you have

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.840 
because when it goes to excel you have
the<00:00:51.930> ability<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.350> go<00:00:53.100> back<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.489> pull<00:00:53.610> any

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the ability to go back and pull any

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.160 
the ability to go back and pull any
field<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.390> want<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:55.050> that

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
field that you want to from that

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.650 
field that you want to from that
particular<00:00:55.469> cube<00:00:56.120> now<00:00:57.120> here<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.390> cute<00:00:57.629> that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
particular cube now here it's cute that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.240 
particular cube now here it's cute that
I<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:57.960> setup<00:00:58.230> I've<00:00:58.500> got<00:00:58.649> customers<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
I have setup I've got customers on the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.950 
I have setup I've got customers on the
left-hand<00:00:59.670> side<00:00:59.760> I've<00:01:00.180> got<00:01:00.210> time<00:01:00.570> periods<00:01:00.899> at

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
left-hand side I've got time periods at

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.930 
left-hand side I've got time periods at
the<00:01:00.989> top<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.590> they<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> extended<00:01:02.670> price

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the top and they have the extended price

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.299 
the top and they have the extended price
down<00:01:03.420> here<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.739> actually<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.100> fairly

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
down here so this is actually a fairly

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.230 
down here so this is actually a fairly
decent<00:01:05.610> report<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:07.979> see<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:09.000> time

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
decent report you can see that the time

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.640 
decent report you can see that the time
periods<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:09.720> are<00:01:09.810> months<00:01:10.170> they're<00:01:10.500> not

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
periods here are months they're not

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.950 
periods here are months they're not
dates<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.369> that's<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> value<00:01:12.780> of

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
dates and that's one of the value of

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.750 
dates and that's one of the value of
having<00:01:13.200> analysis<00:01:13.770> cubes<00:01:14.040> connected<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
having analysis cubes connected to the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.210 
having analysis cubes connected to the
GP<00:01:15.150> data<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.810> when<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.049> goes<00:01:16.229> over<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
GP data is that when it goes over to the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.480 
GP data is that when it goes over to the
analysis<00:01:17.729> cube<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.119> going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.299> add<00:01:19.490> dimensions

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
analysis cube is going to add dimensions

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.570 
analysis cube is going to add dimensions
such<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:20.700> date<00:01:21.150> quarter<00:01:21.960> year<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:23.310> dad<00:01:23.549> is

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
such as date quarter year that dad is

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.929 
such as date quarter year that dad is
not<00:01:23.820> normally<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.570> GP<00:01:25.170> though<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> date<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.250> so

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
not normally in GP though the date is so

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.630 
not normally in GP though the date is so
I've<00:01:27.240> got<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.540> data<00:01:27.860> table<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:29.610> I

I've got this data table here and what I

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.460 
I've got this data table here and what I
can<00:01:29.790> do<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.329> use<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.110> I

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
can do is I can just use it as it is I

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.460 
can do is I can just use it as it is I
can<00:01:32.070> also<00:01:32.189> change<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.119> example<00:01:33.570> over

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
can also change it so for example over

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.460 
can also change it so for example over
here<00:01:34.500> I've<00:01:34.920> got<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.430> number<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:36.200> values<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
here I've got a number of values and
