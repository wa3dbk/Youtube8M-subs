told<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.500> use<00:00:07.830> get<00:00:08.099> some<00:00:08.280> parts<00:00:08.610> on<00:00:08.760> these

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
told you use get some parts on these

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.080 
told you use get some parts on these
things<00:00:09.980> and<00:00:10.980> simply<00:00:11.280> because<00:00:11.700> they're<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
things and simply because they're the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.810 
things and simply because they're the

potentiometer<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.570> cost<00:00:18.869> twelve<00:00:19.199> dollars

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
potentiometer that cost twelve dollars

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.599 
potentiometer that cost twelve dollars
and<00:00:20.090> a<00:00:21.140> cheaper<00:00:22.140> model<00:00:22.350> from<00:00:25.099> pro-line<00:00:26.099> parts

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609

st.<00:00:27.599> 500k<00:00:28.380> was<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> tiny<00:00:29.039> one<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.580> way<00:00:29.730> small

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
st. 500k was a tiny one it's way small

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.709 
st. 500k was a tiny one it's way small
ones<00:00:30.510> right<00:00:31.820> that's<00:00:32.820> gonna<00:00:33.000> fit<00:00:33.210> inside<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
ones right that's gonna fit inside the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.810 
ones right that's gonna fit inside the
cello<00:00:34.290> caster<00:00:34.800> because<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.160> only<00:00:35.399> size<00:00:35.610> it

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
cello caster because it's only size it

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.760 
cello caster because it's only size it
will<00:00:35.880> fit<00:00:35.940> inside<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.719> due<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> its<00:00:37.620> small

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
will fit inside of it due to its small

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.810 
will fit inside of it due to its small
opening<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.550> its<00:00:38.700> cover<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:40.760> there's<00:00:41.760> a

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
opening on its cover but there's a

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.910 
opening on its cover but there's a
difference<00:00:42.329> between<00:00:42.480> these<00:00:42.989> potentiometers

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
difference between these potentiometers

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.040 
difference between these potentiometers
that<00:00:44.250> becomes<00:00:44.579> very<00:00:44.820> obvious<00:00:45.030> when<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.539> just

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
that becomes very obvious when you just

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.229 
that becomes very obvious when you just
put<00:00:46.260> one<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.620> play<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.670> replace<00:00:48.059> an

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
put one in and play it and replace an

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.470 
put one in and play it and replace an
older<00:00:48.600> one<00:00:49.160> right<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.550> I've<00:00:50.610> got<00:00:50.670> hooked<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
older one right so I've got hooked up to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.340 
older one right so I've got hooked up to
a<00:00:51.510> multi<00:00:52.350> volt<00:00:52.620> voltmeter<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:54.079> as<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.289> can

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
a multi volt voltmeter and as you can

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.590 
a multi volt voltmeter and as you can
see<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:56.370> still<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.789> package<00:00:57.000> I'm<00:00:57.449> just

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
see it's still in the package I'm just

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.740 
see it's still in the package I'm just
hooking<00:00:57.989> up<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.260> leads<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.710> its<00:00:59.010> reading<00:00:59.750> 557

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
hooking up the leads on its reading 557

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.820 
hooking up the leads on its reading 557
so<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.050> hot<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:02.090> it's<00:01:03.090> way<00:01:03.539> past<00:01:03.570> its<00:01:04.140> 500k

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
so it's a hot one it's way past its 500k

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.020 
so it's a hot one it's way past its 500k
right<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> normally<00:01:07.500> put<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:09.200> tone

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
right so I normally put this on the tone

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.149 
right so I normally put this on the tone
spot<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.750> allow<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> greater<00:01:13.920> range

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
spot to allow it to have a greater range

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.420 
spot to allow it to have a greater range
of<00:01:14.310> tone<00:01:15.439> this<00:01:16.439> one<00:01:16.710> came<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.100> at<00:01:17.250> 485<00:01:18.500> right<00:01:19.500> so

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
of tone this one came in at 485 right so

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.770 
of tone this one came in at 485 right so
just<00:01:20.640> trust<00:01:20.850> me<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.299> what<00:01:21.509> came<00:01:21.659> out

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
just trust me is this what came out

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.660 
just trust me is this what came out
anyway<00:01:23.330> both<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.630> them<00:01:24.750> are<00:01:24.840> 500<00:01:25.470> KS<00:01:25.710> as<00:01:26.100> you

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
anyway both of them are 500 KS as you

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.100 
anyway both of them are 500 KS as you
can<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.240> very<00:01:27.420> top<00:01:27.450> line<00:01:27.810> gets<00:01:28.049> finer

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
can see the very top line gets finer

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.730 
can see the very top line gets finer
kaolin

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
kaolin

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:37.429 
kaolin
right<00:01:29.100> tapered<00:01:31.520> potentiometers<00:01:36.439> yeah

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
right tapered potentiometers yeah

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.780 
right tapered potentiometers yeah
there's<00:01:37.650> no<00:01:37.740> Photoshop<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.610> here

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
there's no Photoshop going on here

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.880 
there's no Photoshop going on here
they're<00:01:38.939> still<00:01:39.119> attached<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.650> well

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
they're still attached you can see well

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.490 
they're still attached you can see well
the<00:01:41.220> reading<00:01:41.340> when<00:01:41.520> obviously<00:01:41.729> touch<00:01:42.150> but

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
the reading when obviously touch but

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.060 
the reading when obviously touch but
anyway<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.189> thing<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:45.299> still<00:01:46.070> are

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
anyway the thing is they still are

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.060 
anyway the thing is they still are
hotter<00:01:47.490> than<00:01:47.909> they<00:01:48.119> should<00:01:48.390> be

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
hotter than they should be

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.530 
hotter than they should be
so<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.159> can't<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.579> balance<00:01:51.090> pair<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:51.479> if

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
so you can't get a balance pair now if

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.969 
so you can't get a balance pair now if
you<00:01:51.630> want<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.869> balance<00:01:52.110> pair<00:01:52.649> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
you want to balance pair of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.590 
you want to balance pair of
potentiometers<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.909> got<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> go<00:01:54.270> out<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.390> buy

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
potentiometers you got to go out and buy

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.420 
potentiometers you got to go out and buy
like<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.899> dozen<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.439> these<00:01:55.500> things<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.070> get

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
like a dozen of these things and get

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.149 
like a dozen of these things and get
your<00:01:56.640> volt<00:01:57.240> meter<00:01:57.420> ran<00:01:57.600> out<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.560> get<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> two

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
your volt meter ran out and get the two

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.679 
your volt meter ran out and get the two
clothes<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.820> can<00:01:59.850> find<00:02:00.210> which<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.509> why<00:02:00.630> I

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
clothes that you can find which is why I

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.429 
clothes that you can find which is why I
normally<00:02:01.049> do<00:02:01.259> right<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.600> out<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> group<00:02:04.259> of

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
normally do right so out of the group of

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.950 
normally do right so out of the group of
a<00:02:04.469> potentiometer<00:02:05.460> got<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.090> storage<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.840> my

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
a potentiometer got in storage in my

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.960 
a potentiometer got in storage in my
junk<00:02:07.290> drawer<00:02:07.350> I'll<00:02:08.069> find<00:02:08.459> one<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.759> matches

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
junk drawer I'll find one that matches

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.850 
junk drawer I'll find one that matches
up<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.479> 557<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.530> put<00:02:10.649> inside<00:02:10.950> the

read<00:02:28.260> 330<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.489> may<00:02:29.730> read<00:02:29.940> 420<00:02:30.709> but<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:32.580> know

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
read 330 it may read 420 but you know

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.510 
read 330 it may read 420 but you know
they're<00:02:33.270> just<00:02:33.569> not<00:02:33.690> exact<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:35.040> one<00:02:35.310> thing<00:02:35.459> I

much better made than these other ones
it's<00:02:41.849> like<00:02:42.120> night<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.390> day

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
it's like night and day

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.309 
it's like night and day
and<00:02:44.250> they<00:02:44.370> do<00:02:44.430> last<00:02:44.940> thirty<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.660> forty<00:02:45.989> fifty

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
and they do last thirty to forty fifty

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.890 
and they do last thirty to forty fifty
years<00:02:46.650> which<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.400> amazing<00:02:47.550> it's<00:02:48.360> phenomenal

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
years which is amazing it's phenomenal

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.210 
years which is amazing it's phenomenal
to<00:02:48.930> find<00:02:49.170> them<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.560> guitar<00:02:49.830> are<00:02:49.950> still

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
to find them in the guitar are still

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.770 
to find them in the guitar are still
working<00:02:50.430> still<00:02:50.730> if<00:02:51.030> there's<00:02:51.180> their<00:02:51.569> peak

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
working still if there's their peak

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.009 
working still if there's their peak
levels<00:02:52.970> compared<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.030> these<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.540> last<00:02:54.569> few

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
levels compared to these in the last few

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.190 
levels compared to these in the last few
years<00:02:55.319> so<00:02:56.160> it's<00:02:56.310> worth<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.610> extra<00:02:56.730> money

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200

alright so remember check your
potentiometers<00:03:06.510> against<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.840> voltmeter<00:03:07.140> and

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
potentiometers against the voltmeter and

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.420 
potentiometers against the voltmeter and
try<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.340> match<00:03:08.700> them<00:03:08.970> up<00:03:09.090> as<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.720> pair<00:03:10.100> that's<00:03:11.100> it
