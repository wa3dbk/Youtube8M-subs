 scheme 11 the final velocity of it 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.399
 this is good 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:07.160
 against a cd thousand in our business comes out 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.160
 jumping is 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.130
 the snore is very cute right hand 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:28.269
 We do well, the guy saw 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.269
 even we are already in sixth gear 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.900
 The bike already Pauline its limit 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:42.049
 almost starts to cut whirl 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:44.450
 267 km very good very good 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.829
 legal people who in the end if it is limited 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.099
 to take it we do not get a motorcycle 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:52.159
 here with the final good speed that this 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.349
 can complicate for us here 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:03:01.189
 he motorcycle on the side he's already playing 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:03.199
 strong in addressing a very crazy fear and 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.530
 motorcycle also let's here is the vision of 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.530
 panel 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.610
 in the duel there on the map you can see that 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.760
 We are very close to the duel face. 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.890
 The sixth game is very difficult. 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:30.840
 left you but look only that duel the guy 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:33.540
 My gosh, it goes hand in hand. 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.160
 absurd the guy also can not have 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.170
 a better ending there he is coming 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.660
 before I had a little more clue 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.340
 This guy passed me, man, the tape is 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.530
 duel and against the grain 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.670
 brilliance now we will face the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:53.040
 alejandro gonzÃ¡lez in the grand finale and 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.480
 I think it's going to be a quarry to see the old man. 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.660
 quarry 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.519
 I will need a lot of luck also to 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.739
 win 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.739
 Look at the motorcycle lovers is crazy. 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.430
 the guy with the long march 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.209
 a little bit in front of him for what gives 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:21.400
 to see on the map and it begins to touch 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.870
 begins to pass our chance, right? 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.580
 other motor there the guy does not have what 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.259
 do 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.449
 As I explained to you here in this 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.949
 category here we can not 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.199
 win all unless we change 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.000
 with the bike that fits in with 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.199
 category and a better bike than the 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.030
 senile 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.889
 but the income was very good to us 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.310
 managed to get to the end of the 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:46.009
 but the new bike there for harvested pres 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.840
 by the competitor there for the challenger was 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.419
 better and had a final speed 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.300
 the bigger one did not have how we got out and 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.479
 to get second in the second position there 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.250
 in the final an award of 5,500 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.110
 we got order and reputation show 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.190
 that's where it was a test of 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.180
 ripped off with kawasaki cemil 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.530
 Thank you who watched the video. 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.120
