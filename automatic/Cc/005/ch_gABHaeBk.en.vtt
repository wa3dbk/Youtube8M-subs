hi<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:01.020> Robbie<00:00:01.230> reticular<00:00:01.800> photography

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hi this is Robbie reticular photography

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.700 
hi this is Robbie reticular photography
I<00:00:02.550> wanted<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.389> do<00:00:03.480> another<00:00:03.689> little<00:00:03.990> macro

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
I wanted to do another little macro

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.930 
I wanted to do another little macro
demonstration<00:00:05.700> of<00:00:05.970> these<00:00:07.069> macro<00:00:08.069> filters

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
demonstration of these macro filters

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.810 
demonstration of these macro filters
I<00:00:08.970> found<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.540> beetle<00:00:10.650> kind<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:10.980> lying<00:00:11.250> dead<00:00:11.550> last

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
I found a beetle kind of lying dead last

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.259 
I found a beetle kind of lying dead last
night

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
night

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.509 
night
so<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.420> picked<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.840> up<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.530> thought<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.370> would

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
so I picked it up and I thought I would

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.689 
so I picked it up and I thought I would
photograph<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.570> today<00:00:16.130> I'm<00:00:17.130> going<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.400> start

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
photograph it today I'm going to start

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.060 
photograph it today I'm going to start
with<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.119> 100<00:00:18.840> millimeter<00:00:19.020> macro<00:00:19.590> lens

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
with a 100 millimeter macro lens

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.060 
with a 100 millimeter macro lens
shooting<00:00:21.029> out<00:00:21.180> one<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.660> one<00:00:21.810> resolution<00:00:22.410> then

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
shooting out one to one resolution then

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.060 
shooting out one to one resolution then
we<00:00:23.310> will<00:00:23.519> put<00:00:23.840> 69<00:00:24.840> millimeters<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.619> macro

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
we will put 69 millimeters of macro

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.310 
we will put 69 millimeters of macro
extension<00:00:26.369> tubes<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.150> there<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:27.900> should

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
extension tubes on there so that should

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.109 
extension tubes on there so that should
get<00:00:28.500> us<00:00:28.650> pretty<00:00:29.130> close<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.699> two<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.090> one

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
get us pretty close to two to one

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.359 
get us pretty close to two to one
magnification<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.289> then<00:00:32.099> we're<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.309> to

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
magnification and then we're going to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.130 
magnification and then we're going to
stick<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.880> 10x<00:00:34.489> magnification<00:00:36.140> close-up

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
stick the 10x magnification close-up

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.889 
stick the 10x magnification close-up
filter<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> front<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.910> see<00:00:39.780> what

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
filter on the front of that and see what

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.770 
filter on the front of that and see what
it<00:00:39.960> looks<00:00:40.200> like<00:00:40.640> this<00:00:41.640> should<00:00:41.700> take<00:00:42.239> us<00:00:42.450> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
it looks like this should take us to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.850 
it looks like this should take us to
ultra<00:00:43.530> macro<00:00:45.020> magnifications<00:00:46.020> I'm<00:00:46.680> not

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
ultra macro magnifications I'm not

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.770 
ultra macro magnifications I'm not
exactly<00:00:47.250> sure<00:00:47.489> how<00:00:47.700> close<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.360> will<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:48.629> us

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
exactly sure how close it will get us

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.270 
exactly sure how close it will get us
it's<00:00:48.930> my<00:00:49.110> first<00:00:49.350> experiment<00:00:49.739> using<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
it's my first experiment using the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.470 
it's my first experiment using the
entire<00:00:50.760> set<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.829> magnification<00:00:52.829> tools<00:00:53.610> so

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
entire set of magnification tools so

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.110 
entire set of magnification tools so
let's<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:55.289> what<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.649> get<00:00:55.850> first<00:00:56.850> I'm

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
let's see what we can get first I'm

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.360 
let's see what we can get first I'm
going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.360> shoot<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.780> needle<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
going to shoot this needle here with the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.959 
going to shoot this needle here with the
100<00:00:59.940> millimeter<00:01:00.300> macro<00:01:01.100> at<00:01:02.100> its<00:01:02.430> closest

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
100 millimeter macro at its closest

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.210 
100 millimeter macro at its closest
focus<00:01:03.359> distance<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.930> it'll<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.290> one-to-one<00:01:04.769> on

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
focus distance so it'll be one-to-one on

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.410 
focus distance so it'll be one-to-one on
the<00:01:05.369> sensor<00:01:06.110> will<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.140> shooting<00:01:07.439> about<00:01:08.420> f-14

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the sensor will be shooting about f-14

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.660 
the sensor will be shooting about f-14
one<00:01:10.760> 250th<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.030> second<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.570> ISO<00:01:13.110> 100<00:01:13.740> so

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
one 250th of a second and ISO 100 so

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.670 
one 250th of a second and ISO 100 so
let's<00:01:14.850> take<00:01:15.060> our<00:01:15.240> first<00:01:15.450> shot<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.650> what

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
let's take our first shot and see what

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.770 
let's take our first shot and see what
this<00:01:17.009> beetle<00:01:17.369> looks<00:01:17.520> like

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.780 

so<00:01:24.410> there's<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.740> first<00:01:24.980> shot<00:01:25.190> of<00:01:25.220> our<00:01:25.460> beetle

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
so there's the first shot of our beetle

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.330 
so there's the first shot of our beetle
at<00:01:25.940> one-to-one<00:01:26.660> magnification<00:01:27.410> let's<00:01:28.130> stick

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
at one-to-one magnification let's stick

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.040 
at one-to-one magnification let's stick
some<00:01:28.370> extension<00:01:29.000> tubes<00:01:29.270> on<00:01:29.480> there<00:01:29.660> and<00:01:29.870> see

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
some extension tubes on there and see

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.360 
some extension tubes on there and see
how<00:01:30.170> much<00:01:30.290> bigger<00:01:30.470> we<00:01:30.740> can<00:01:30.860> make<00:01:30.980> this<00:01:31.100> beetle

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
how much bigger we can make this beetle

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.260 
how much bigger we can make this beetle
get<00:01:32.560> I'm<00:01:33.560> using<00:01:33.830> all<00:01:34.310> of<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:34.640> extension<00:01:35.030> tubes

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
get I'm using all of the extension tubes

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.050 
get I'm using all of the extension tubes
I<00:01:35.390> have<00:01:35.570> it's<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:35.840> 13<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.380> 20<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.190> a<00:01:37.280> 36<00:01:37.820> put

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
I have it's a 13 a 20 and a 36 put

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.680 
I have it's a 13 a 20 and a 36 put
together<00:01:38.890> so<00:01:39.890> that<00:01:40.100> equals<00:01:40.450> 69<00:01:41.450> millimeters

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
together so that equals 69 millimeters

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.440 
together so that equals 69 millimeters
of<00:01:42.110> extension<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.650> use<00:01:45.130> our<00:01:46.130> lens<00:01:46.400> gets<00:01:46.610> very

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
of extension to use our lens gets very

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.420 
of extension to use our lens gets very
big

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.520 

and<00:01:50.990> because<00:01:51.990> we're<00:01:52.140> using<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.380> macro

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
and because we're using a macro

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.160 
and because we're using a macro
extension<00:01:52.860> tubes<00:01:53.400> we<00:01:53.970> lost<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.450> ton<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.810> light

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
extension tubes we lost a ton of light

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.050 
extension tubes we lost a ton of light
here<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.010> can<00:01:56.160> see<00:01:56.370> the<00:01:56.490> difference<00:01:56.850> between

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
here you can see the difference between

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.020 
here you can see the difference between
non<00:01:57.990> extension<00:01:58.530> tubes<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.100> 69<00:01:59.850> millimeters

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
non extension tubes and 69 millimeters

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.190 
non extension tubes and 69 millimeters
of<00:02:00.390> extension<00:02:00.810> tubes

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
of extension tubes

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.450 
of extension tubes
we've<00:02:01.650> lost<00:02:03.320> probably<00:02:04.320> two<00:02:04.800> stops<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.280> light

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
we've lost probably two stops of light

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.940 
we've lost probably two stops of light
so<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.330> to<00:02:06.540> increase<00:02:07.140> my<00:02:07.410> light<00:02:07.590> sources

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
so I have to increase my light sources

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.930 
so I have to increase my light sources
to<00:02:08.070> compensate

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.230 

okay<00:02:11.570> that's<00:02:11.900> looking<00:02:12.410> quite<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:12.830> bit<00:02:12.920> better

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
okay that's looking quite a bit better

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.090 
okay that's looking quite a bit better
we're<00:02:14.240> still<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:15.080> little<00:02:15.470> bit<00:02:15.590> dark

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.460 

are<00:02:19.100> there<00:02:19.700> we<00:02:19.820> go<00:02:19.960> now<00:02:20.960> we<00:02:21.020> have<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.230> nicely

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
are there we go now we have a nicely

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.860 
are there we go now we have a nicely
expose<00:02:21.980> deal<00:02:22.450> all<00:02:23.450> right

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
expose deal all right

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.530 
expose deal all right
so<00:02:24.290> our<00:02:24.410> next<00:02:24.620> step<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.370> put<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.820> big

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
so our next step is to put the big

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.780 
so our next step is to put the big
eyeglasses<00:02:27.410> on<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:27.830> front<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.100> this<00:02:28.190> lens<00:02:28.490> and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
eyeglasses on the front of this lens and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.850 
eyeglasses on the front of this lens and
see<00:02:29.210> where<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.450> gets<00:02:29.540> us<00:02:29.750> where<00:02:30.350> take<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.650> lens

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
see where it gets us where take the lens

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.930 
see where it gets us where take the lens
head<00:02:31.070> off<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.460> screw<00:02:31.970> on<00:02:32.150> these<00:02:32.480> filter

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.920 

all<00:02:36.940> right<00:02:37.120> when<00:02:37.240> you<00:02:37.300> first<00:02:37.450> put<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.660> on<00:02:37.720> can

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
all right when you first put it on can

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.330 
all right when you first put it on can
you<00:02:38.020> tell<00:02:38.230> what<00:02:38.320> you're<00:02:38.410> looking<00:02:38.650> at

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.100 

Wow<00:02:42.400> all<00:02:42.970> right<00:02:43.180> sure<00:02:43.990> enough<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.560> that

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
Wow all right sure enough that that

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.390 
Wow all right sure enough that that
increased<00:02:47.110> our<00:02:47.260> magnification<00:02:48.160> but<00:02:48.340> I

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
increased our magnification but I

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.000 
increased our magnification but I
probably<00:02:48.640> done<00:02:48.910> done<00:02:49.230> substantially<00:02:50.230> that's

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
probably done done substantially that's

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.340 
probably done done substantially that's
awesome<00:02:51.940> we<00:02:52.180> didn't<00:02:52.420> lose<00:02:52.570> any<00:02:52.840> light<00:02:53.110> when<00:02:53.320> I

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
awesome we didn't lose any light when I

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.650 
awesome we didn't lose any light when I
put<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.650> 10x<00:02:54.040> magnification<00:02:54.760> on<00:02:55.300> there<00:02:55.510> and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
put the 10x magnification on there and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.200 
put the 10x magnification on there and
we're<00:02:56.320> getting<00:02:56.410> some<00:02:57.220> really<00:02:57.550> nice<00:02:57.700> details

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
we're getting some really nice details

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.090 
we're getting some really nice details
some<00:02:58.420> really<00:02:58.660> good<00:02:58.750> color<00:02:59.020> with<00:02:59.260> this<00:02:59.410> so<00:02:59.920> I'm

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
some really good color with this so I'm

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.210 
some really good color with this so I'm
I'm<00:03:00.850> happy<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.480> think<00:03:02.470> I'm<00:03:02.710> going<00:03:02.800> to<00:03:02.860> do<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.040> a

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
I'm happy I think I'm going to do a a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.650 
I'm happy I think I'm going to do a a
macro<00:03:03.910> focus<00:03:04.450> stack<00:03:04.930> with<00:03:05.380> this<00:03:06.060> same<00:03:07.060> kind<00:03:07.510> of

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
macro focus stack with this same kind of

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.120 
macro focus stack with this same kind of
pose<00:03:07.990> I<00:03:08.290> guess<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.740> then<00:03:08.830> I'll<00:03:08.920> rearrange

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
pose I guess and then I'll rearrange

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.430 
pose I guess and then I'll rearrange
them<00:03:09.450> but<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:10.480> thought<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.900> might<00:03:11.080> find<00:03:11.290> this

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
them but I thought you might find this

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.090 
them but I thought you might find this
interesting

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
interesting

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.100 
interesting
how<00:03:12.250> much<00:03:12.430> additional<00:03:12.959> magnification<00:03:13.959> you

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
how much additional magnification you

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.660 
how much additional magnification you
can<00:03:14.140> get<00:03:14.470> with<00:03:14.740> a<00:03:15.180> 8<00:03:16.180> or<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.750> $10<00:03:17.350> filter<00:03:17.890> so

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
can get with a 8 or a $10 filter so

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.880 
can get with a 8 or a $10 filter so
really<00:03:19.480> cool<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:20.380> I<00:03:20.410> hope<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.650> found<00:03:20.740> this

really cool so I hope you found this
