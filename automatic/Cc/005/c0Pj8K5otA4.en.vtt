anymore um also have a new one coming on
the<00:00:32.669> way<00:00:32.759> but<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.940> had<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.239> think<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.570> video

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
the way but I had to think of a video

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.479 
the way but I had to think of a video
that<00:00:33.899> didn't<00:00:34.530> really<00:00:34.649> require<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:35.340> high

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
that didn't really require like high

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.900 
that didn't really require like high
resolution<00:00:36.149> um<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:38.309> decided<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.850> do

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
resolution um so I just decided to do

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.950 
resolution um so I just decided to do
this<00:00:39.000> video<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.360> I've<00:00:39.420> been<00:00:39.510> getting<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.780> lot<00:00:39.899> of

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
this video so I've been getting a lot of

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.479 
this video so I've been getting a lot of
questions<00:00:40.320> lately<00:00:40.440> about<00:00:40.620> where<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:40.980> shop<00:00:41.219> and

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.960 
it for the most part most of these
shirts<00:01:25.830> pretty<00:01:26.220> much<00:01:26.340> all<00:01:26.520> these<00:01:26.670> shirts<00:01:26.880> are

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
shirts pretty much all these shirts are

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.280 
shirts pretty much all these shirts are
not<00:01:27.180> supposed<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.659> off<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.810> shoulder<00:01:28.170> but

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
not supposed to be off the shoulder but

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.600 
not supposed to be off the shoulder but
I<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.560> think<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.860> looks<00:01:29.009> better<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.400> this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
I just think it looks better like this

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.340 
I just think it looks better like this
because<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.299> lot<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.869> guys<00:01:30.960> probably<00:01:31.110> don't

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
because a lot of you guys probably don't

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.230 
because a lot of you guys probably don't
know<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.890> actually<00:01:32.100> used<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> swim<00:01:33.030> I

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
know this but I actually used to swim I

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.359 
know this but I actually used to swim I
used<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.450> lap<00:01:33.659> swim<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.290> exercise<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
used to lap swim for exercise but the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.770 
used to lap swim for exercise but the
nice<00:01:35.520> thought<00:01:35.729> because<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> noticed<00:01:36.540> like<00:01:36.689> my

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
nice thought because I noticed like my

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.300 
nice thought because I noticed like my
ribcage<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.259> getting<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> lot<00:01:37.680> bigger<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.220> my

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
ribcage is getting a lot bigger and my

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.440 
ribcage is getting a lot bigger and my
shoulders<00:01:38.340> were<00:01:38.820> getting<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> really<00:01:39.180> broad

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
shoulders were getting a really broad

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420 
shoulders were getting a really broad
and<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.740> feel<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.009> these<00:01:41.159> kind<00:01:41.400> of
