does<00:01:01.460> not<00:01:01.640> happen<00:01:02.059> quickly<00:01:03.309> it's<00:01:04.309> just<00:01:04.460> a<00:01:04.760> lot

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
does not happen quickly it's just a lot

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
working it working it good once you get

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.460 
working it working it good once you get
it<00:01:22.210> started<00:01:22.450> like<00:01:23.080> this<00:01:24.630> then<00:01:25.630> taking<00:01:26.350> the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
it started like this then taking the

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.920 
it started like this then taking the
long<00:01:26.710> guy<00:01:29.550> and<00:01:30.550> sometimes<00:01:31.030> it's<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.570> lot<00:01:31.780> more

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
long guy and sometimes it's a lot more

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.600 
long guy and sometimes it's a lot more
flexible<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.710> do<00:01:32.830> it<00:01:32.950> this<00:01:33.100> way

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
flexible to do it this way

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.000 
flexible to do it this way
Sabra<00:01:34.540> was<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.750> well-made<00:01:34.960> guitar<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:35.650> was<00:01:35.800> the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
Sabra was a well-made guitar it was the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.850 
Sabra was a well-made guitar it was the
it<00:01:36.700> was<00:01:36.760> higher<00:01:37.090> up<00:01:37.330> on<00:01:37.480> the<00:01:37.660> harmony<00:01:38.590> food

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
it was higher up on the harmony food

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.000 
it was higher up on the harmony food
chain<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.420> it's<00:01:40.780> not<00:01:40.930> surprising<00:01:41.200> that<00:01:41.650> they

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
chain so it's not surprising that they

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.850 
chain so it's not surprising that they
put<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:42.940> together<00:01:43.090> very<00:01:43.570> nicely<00:01:43.840> well<00:01:44.710> we're

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
put it together very nicely well we're

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.050 
put it together very nicely well we're
going<00:01:44.980> to<00:01:45.040> start<00:01:45.400> putting<00:01:45.640> this<00:01:45.820> back

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
going to start putting this back

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.150 
going to start putting this back
together<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.560> first<00:01:47.710> thing<00:01:47.920> we're<00:01:48.040> going

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
together and the first thing we're going

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.130 
together and the first thing we're going
to<00:01:48.220> do<00:01:48.400> is<00:01:48.550> take<00:01:48.790> a<00:01:48.820> look<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:49.300> see<00:01:49.930> what<00:01:50.110> kind

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
to do is take a look and see what kind

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.170 
to do is take a look and see what kind
of<00:01:50.410> truss<00:01:50.680> rod<00:01:50.980> that<00:01:51.280> we've<00:01:51.400> got<00:01:51.640> in<00:01:51.820> this

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
of truss rod that we've got in this

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.150 
of truss rod that we've got in this
now<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.200> original<00:01:53.380> truss<00:01:53.920> rod<00:01:55.860> which<00:01:56.860> is<00:01:57.040> this

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
now the original truss rod which is this

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.910 
now the original truss rod which is this
one<00:01:57.400> here<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:58.570> can<00:01:58.780> see<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.230> it's<00:01:59.410> still

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
one here you can see that it's still

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.410 
one here you can see that it's still
under<00:02:00.100> tension<00:02:00.400> there's<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:00.910> there's<00:02:01.300> a<00:02:01.390> big

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
under tension there's a there's a big

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.250 
under tension there's a there's a big
arc<00:02:01.840> on<00:02:02.080> it

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
arc on it

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.850 
arc on it
and<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:04.210> adjusting<00:02:04.750> screw<00:02:04.780> broke<00:02:05.350> off<00:02:05.560> and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
and the adjusting screw broke off and

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.890 
and the adjusting screw broke off and
somebody<00:02:06.130> probably<00:02:06.400> pushed<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.330> its<00:02:07.510> limit

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
somebody probably pushed it to its limit

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.220 
somebody probably pushed it to its limit
and<00:02:08.320> as<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.679> tighten<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.220> up<00:02:09.429> she'll<00:02:09.970> Bend<00:02:10.300> right

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
and as I tighten it up she'll Bend right

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.890 
and as I tighten it up she'll Bend right
around<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.720> radius<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.530> neck<00:02:15.690> I'm<00:02:16.690> going

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
around the radius of the neck I'm going

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.870 
around the radius of the neck I'm going
to<00:02:17.490> bring<00:02:18.490> these<00:02:18.670> down<00:02:18.910> nice<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:19.270> good

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
to bring these down nice and good

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.260 
to bring these down nice and good
excellent<00:02:21.880> excellent<00:02:23.640> okay<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:25.030> only<00:02:25.150> thing

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
excellent excellent okay the only thing

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.960 
excellent excellent okay the only thing
left<00:02:25.600> here<00:02:25.840> now<00:02:26.050> is<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.470> let<00:02:27.100> this<00:02:27.310> dry<00:02:27.640> and

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
left here now is to let this dry and
