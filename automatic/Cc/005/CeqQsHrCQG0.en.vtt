 check our knots and beans 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.140
 She as you can see still divided but in 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:32.090
 some places she starts 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:37.740
 redden go down mixed up

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:15.150
 mix all the pieces carefully 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:20.420

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:30.990
 frozen she still gave and juice and now 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.180

 green bean 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:41.400
 at first I do n't even know but she is 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:46.020
 very useful and the world do not know 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.960
 how to call her by God in her very much 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.490

 league and 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:08.370
 folic acid and for me it was very 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:11.280
 surprisingly clever, there is very little 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.640
 calories less than 25 kilocalories per 100 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.970

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.850
 bastard and also 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.140
 for me it was a discovery when I found out 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.760
 what is green string beans 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.850
 he can replace 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.920
 show up as insulin and therefore very 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.870
 is useful 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:39.870

 reddened 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:53.430
