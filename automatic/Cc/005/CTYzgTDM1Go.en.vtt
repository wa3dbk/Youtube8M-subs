there<00:03:21.580> now<00:03:21.810> three<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:22.930> two<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.470> think<00:03:24.190> no<00:03:24.370> two

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
there now three and two I think no two

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.229 
there now three and two I think no two
and<00:03:24.819> two<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.959> should<00:03:26.170> be<00:03:26.200> i<00:03:27.010> guess<00:03:27.730> this<00:03:27.910> auto

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
and two it should be i guess this auto

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.610 
and two it should be i guess this auto
updates<00:03:28.630> because<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:28.930> currently<00:03:29.200> says<00:03:29.380> in<00:03:29.530> our

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
updates because it currently says in our

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:38.950 
updates because it currently says in our
score<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.549> there<00:03:31.000> are<00:03:31.060> two<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.390> one<00:03:31.540> so

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.020
