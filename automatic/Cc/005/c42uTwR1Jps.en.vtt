00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
and there's a symbol that I'm not

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.869 
and there's a symbol that I'm not
familiar<00:00:43.829> with<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:45.050> usually<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.219> chair

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879

I<00:00:47.910> figure<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.539> will<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.620> Jedi<00:00:49.920> symbol<00:00:50.520> on

them<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.949> one<00:00:53.129> has<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> very<00:00:53.850> weird

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
them but this one has a very weird

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.209 
them but this one has a very weird
symbol<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:57.230> this<00:00:58.230> figure<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.710> very<00:00:58.980> accurate

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
symbol so this figure is very accurate

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.090 
symbol so this figure is very accurate
