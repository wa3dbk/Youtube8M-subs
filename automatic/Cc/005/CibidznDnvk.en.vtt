00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.670 
how do you make a teacher great now it
seems<00:00:03.179> like<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.419> kind<00:00:03.899> of<00:00:03.959> question<00:00:04.470> that

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
seems like the kind of question that

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.039 
seems like the kind of question that
people<00:00:05.339> would<00:00:05.609> spend<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.940> lot<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.150> time<00:00:06.540> on<00:00:06.810> and

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
people would spend a lot of time on and

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.290 
people would spend a lot of time on and
that<00:00:07.170> we'd<00:00:07.319> understand<00:00:07.859> very<00:00:08.160> well<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.820> the

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
that we'd understand very well and the

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.209 
that we'd understand very well and the
answer<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.780> really<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:11.490> we<00:00:11.700> don't<00:00:13.219> let's

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
answer is really that we don't let's

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.150 
answer is really that we don't let's
start<00:00:14.519> with<00:00:14.670> why<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.210> important<00:00:16.160> well

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
start with why this is important well

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.450 
start with why this is important well

teachers in a narrow set of places so
the<00:00:45.000> top<00:00:45.270> 20%<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:46.140> students<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:47.129> gotten<00:00:47.489> a

been the best in the world if you

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.010 
been the best in the world if you
measure<00:00:53.129> them<00:00:53.399> against<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.879> other<00:00:54.000> top<00:00:54.270> 20%

measure them against the other top 20%

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.290 
measure them against the other top 20%
and<00:00:55.230> they've<00:00:55.710> gone<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.460> create<00:00:57.270> the

20%<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:07.340> starting<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> fade<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> relative

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
20% is starting to fade on a relative

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.969 
20% is starting to fade on a relative
basis<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.710> even<00:01:11.040> more<00:01:11.369> concerning<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
basis but even more concerning is the

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.499 
basis but even more concerning is the
education<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.580> balance<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.150> people<00:01:15.420> are

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
education that the balance of people are

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.560 
education that the balance of people are
getting<00:01:15.830> not<00:01:16.830> only<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.340> been<00:01:17.880> weak<00:01:18.119> it's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
getting not only is that been weak it's

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.630 
getting not only is that been weak it's
getting<00:01:18.990> weaker<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.250> look<00:01:20.430> at<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
getting weaker and if you look at the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.840 
getting weaker and if you look at the
economy<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:22.110> really<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.070> only<00:01:23.220> providing

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
economy it really is only providing

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.899 
economy it really is only providing
opportunities<00:01:24.840> now<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.950> people<00:01:26.400> with<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
opportunities now to people with a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.359 
opportunities now to people with a
better<00:01:27.270> education<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.220> to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
better education and so we have to

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.520 
better education and so we have to
change<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.420> change<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.500> that

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
change this we have to change it so that

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.069 
change this we have to change it so that
people<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.070> equal<00:01:32.430> opportunity<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.900> to

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
people have equal opportunity we have to

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.719 
people have equal opportunity we have to
change<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> country<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.430> strong

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
change it so that the country is strong

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.300 
change it so that the country is strong
and<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.570> stays<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.320> forefront<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:38.070> things

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
and and stays in the forefront of things

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.179 
and and stays in the forefront of things
that<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.610> driven<00:01:39.479> by<00:01:39.780> advanced<00:01:40.470> education

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
that are driven by advanced education

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.899 
that are driven by advanced education
like<00:01:41.450> science<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.600> mathematics<00:01:43.880> when<00:01:44.880> I

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
like science and mathematics when I

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.520 
like science and mathematics when I
first<00:01:45.240> learned<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> statistics<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.380> was

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
first learned the statistics I was

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.649 
first learned the statistics I was
pretty<00:01:46.799> stunned<00:01:47.159> at<00:01:47.520> how<00:01:47.579> bad<00:01:48.149> things<00:01:48.390> are

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
pretty stunned at how bad things are

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.520 
pretty stunned at how bad things are
over<00:01:49.470> 30%<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.640> kids<00:01:51.030> never<00:01:51.840> finished<00:01:52.350> high

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.880 
to the number of the finished senior
year<00:02:03.180> because<00:02:03.450> they<00:02:03.540> were<00:02:03.659> tracking<00:02:04.320> where

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
year because they were tracking where

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.410 
year because they were tracking where
the<00:02:05.009> kids<00:02:05.250> were<00:02:05.369> before<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.060> most<00:02:06.270> of

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
the kids were before that but most of

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.809 
the kids were before that but most of
the<00:02:06.540> dropouts<00:02:07.020> had<00:02:07.229> taken<00:02:07.409> place<00:02:08.099> before<00:02:08.610> that

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
the dropouts had taken place before that

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.850 
the dropouts had taken place before that
so<00:02:09.060> they<00:02:09.179> had<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.450> raise<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:10.500> state<00:02:10.739> of

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
so they had to raise the state of

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.500 
so they had to raise the state of
dropout<00:02:11.250> rate<00:02:11.430> as<00:02:11.580> soon<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.060> tracking

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
dropout rate as soon as that tracking

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.390 
dropout rate as soon as that tracking
was<00:02:12.629> done<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:13.050> over<00:02:13.440> 30

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
was done to over 30

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.059 
was done to over 30
for<00:02:15.090> minority<00:02:15.540> kids<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.709> over<00:02:17.040> 50%<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:19.069> even

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
for minority kids it's over 50% and even

a four-year degree and that you know

a four-year degree and that you know
doesn't<00:02:42.540> seem<00:02:42.780> entirely<00:02:43.260> fair<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:45.019> how<00:02:46.019> do<00:02:46.079> you

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
doesn't seem entirely fair so how do you

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.309 
doesn't seem entirely fair so how do you

there's many people working on it we've

there's many people working on it we've
worked<00:02:53.639> on<00:02:53.819> small<00:02:54.060> schools<00:02:54.599> we<00:02:55.530> funded

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
worked on small schools we funded

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.710 
worked on small schools we funded
scholarships<00:02:56.790> we've<00:02:57.120> done<00:02:57.329> things<00:02:57.510> in

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
scholarships we've done things in

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.500 
scholarships we've done things in
libraries<00:02:58.319> a<00:02:59.099> lot<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.790> these<00:02:59.940> things<00:03:00.239> had<00:03:00.480> a

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
libraries a lot of these things had a

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.930 
libraries a lot of these things had a
good<00:03:00.750> effect<00:03:00.950> but<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.159> more<00:03:02.340> we<00:03:02.489> looked<00:03:02.730> at<00:03:02.879> it

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
good effect but the more we looked at it

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.809 
good effect but the more we looked at it
the<00:03:03.299> more<00:03:03.329> we<00:03:03.510> realized<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.769> having<00:03:05.400> great

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
the more we realized that having great

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.229 
the more we realized that having great
teachers<00:03:06.090> was<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.079> very<00:03:07.260> key<00:03:07.530> thing<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:09.090> so

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
teachers was the very key thing and so

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.759 
teachers was the very key thing and so
we<00:03:09.359> hooked<00:03:09.540> up<00:03:09.659> with<00:03:09.810> some<00:03:10.019> people<00:03:10.290> studying

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
we hooked up with some people studying

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.949 
we hooked up with some people studying
how<00:03:11.549> much<00:03:11.819> variation<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.569> there<00:03:12.599> between

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
how much variation is there between

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.500 
how much variation is there between
teachers<00:03:13.530> between<00:03:14.220> say<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:14.670> top<00:03:15.150> quartile

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
teachers between say the top quartile

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.170 
teachers between say the top quartile
the<00:03:16.019> very<00:03:16.620> best<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.310> bottom<00:03:17.670> quartile

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
the very best and the bottom quartile

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.509 
the very best and the bottom quartile
how<00:03:19.169> much<00:03:19.319> variation<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.980> there<00:03:20.010> within<00:03:20.340> a

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
how much variation is there within a

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.849 
how much variation is there within a
school<00:03:20.849> or<00:03:20.910> between<00:03:21.299> schools<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.560> answer

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
school or between schools and the answer

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.849 
school or between schools and the answer
is<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.160> these<00:03:23.340> variations<00:03:23.879> are<00:03:24.859> absolutely

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
is that these variations are absolutely

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.949 
is that these variations are absolutely
unbelievable<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:27.690> top<00:03:28.349> quartile<00:03:28.889> teacher<00:03:29.959> will

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
unbelievable a top quartile teacher will

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.009 
unbelievable a top quartile teacher will
increase<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.680> performance<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.400> their<00:03:32.519> class

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
increase the performance of their class

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.199 
increase the performance of their class
based<00:03:34.019> on<00:03:34.230> test<00:03:34.560> scores<00:03:34.620> by<00:03:35.099> over<00:03:35.400> ten<00:03:35.730> percent

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
based on test scores by over ten percent

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.720 
based on test scores by over ten percent
in<00:03:36.419> a<00:03:36.599> single<00:03:36.629> year<00:03:37.220> what<00:03:38.220> does<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.370> mean

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
in a single year what does that mean

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.270 
in a single year what does that mean
well<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.120> means<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.660> entire<00:03:39.900> us<00:03:40.590> for

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
well that means that the entire us for

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.199 
well that means that the entire us for
two<00:03:41.430> years<00:03:41.730> had<00:03:42.120> top<00:03:42.540> quartile<00:03:43.400> teachers<00:03:44.400> the

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
two years had top quartile teachers the

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.659 
two years had top quartile teachers the
entire<00:03:45.660> difference<00:03:46.230> between<00:03:46.949> us<00:03:47.129> and<00:03:47.400> Asia

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
entire difference between us and Asia

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.710 
entire difference between us and Asia
would<00:03:48.389> go<00:03:48.599> away<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.169> within<00:03:50.069> four<00:03:50.669> years<00:03:50.720> we

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
would go away and within four years we

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.110 
would go away and within four years we
would<00:03:51.930> be<00:03:51.959> blowing<00:03:52.760> everyone<00:03:53.760> in<00:03:53.849> the<00:03:53.940> world

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
would be blowing everyone in the world

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.899 
would be blowing everyone in the world
away<00:03:54.560> so<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:55.859> simple<00:03:56.220> all<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:56.549> need<00:03:56.760> is

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
away so it's simple all you need is

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.259 
away so it's simple all you need is
those<00:03:57.060> top<00:03:57.480> quartile<00:03:57.930> teachers<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:59.120> so<00:04:00.120> you'd

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
those top quartile teachers and so you'd

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.479 
those top quartile teachers and so you'd
say<00:04:00.480> well<00:04:00.690> wow<00:04:01.260> that's<00:04:01.799> good<00:04:02.010> we<00:04:02.220> should

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
say well wow that's good we should

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.640 
say well wow that's good we should
reward<00:04:02.699> those<00:04:03.329> people<00:04:03.359> we<00:04:04.049> should<00:04:04.260> retain

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
reward those people we should retain

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.710 
reward those people we should retain
those<00:04:05.010> people<00:04:05.430> we<00:04:05.970> should<00:04:06.180> find<00:04:06.449> out<00:04:06.599> what

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
those people we should find out what

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.170 
those people we should find out what
they're<00:04:06.930> doing<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.620> transfer<00:04:08.549> that<00:04:08.579> skill<00:04:08.730> to

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
they're doing and transfer that skill to
