00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
look at that in sending a little more I

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.740 
look at that in sending a little more I
was<00:00:57.449> an<00:00:57.510> excellent<00:00:57.780> sound<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.730> I<00:01:00.030> got<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.570> guy

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
was an excellent sound so I got that guy

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.880 
was an excellent sound so I got that guy
missed<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> bars<00:01:01.320> -<00:01:01.469> after<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.550> see<00:01:02.579> that

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
missed the bars - after you can see that

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.140 
missed the bars - after you can see that
right<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.339> how<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.460> collar<00:01:05.729> opened

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
right and you see how the collar opened

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.429 
right and you see how the collar opened
up<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:08.640> I'll<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.540> back<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.930> off<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.080> little<00:01:10.260> bit

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
up so I'll just back it off a little bit

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.859 
up so I'll just back it off a little bit
no<00:01:11.659> okay<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> whole<00:01:15.000> purpose<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
no okay and the whole purpose of this is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.359 
no okay and the whole purpose of this is
try<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.110> make<00:01:16.320> these<00:01:16.470> collars<00:01:16.890> easier<00:01:17.250> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
try to make these collars easier to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.840 
try to make these collars easier to
remove<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:20.030> look<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:22.610> had<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.700> set

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
remove and look at this I had to set

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.950 
remove and look at this I had to set
screw<00:01:24.060> tight<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:27.240> let's<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.780> look

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
screw tight on that so let's have a look

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:38.490 
screw tight on that so let's have a look
oh<00:01:28.259> that's<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.369> good<00:01:29.490> experiment

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.190 

so<00:01:39.500> here<00:01:40.250> it<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.430> I<00:01:40.700> can't<00:01:41.570> hold<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:41.840> in<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:42.049> good

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
so here it is I can't hold it in a good

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.960 
so here it is I can't hold it in a good
spot<00:01:42.439> for<00:01:42.470> you<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:44.360> see<00:01:44.780> we<00:01:45.380> can<00:01:45.740> hold<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.790> away

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
spot for you you see we can hold it away

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.999 
spot for you you see we can hold it away
and<00:01:47.119> zoom<00:01:47.330> in<00:01:47.479> might<00:01:47.720> be<00:01:47.899> clearer<00:01:48.939> yeah<00:01:50.950> so<00:01:51.950> I

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
and zoom in might be clearer yeah so I

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.800 
and zoom in might be clearer yeah so I
just<00:01:52.369> don't<00:01:52.549> ninety<00:01:52.909> degrees<00:01:53.180> out<00:01:53.420> from<00:01:53.689> the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
just don't ninety degrees out from the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:02.139 
just don't ninety degrees out from the
setscrew<00:01:57.610> see<00:01:59.229> see<00:02:00.229> there<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:00.970> screw<00:02:01.970> it<00:02:02.060> in

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
setscrew see see there and screw it in

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.080 
setscrew see see there and screw it in
my<00:02:02.210> little<00:02:02.360> nut<00:02:02.570> splitter<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:05.590> snap<00:02:07.090> just

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
my little nut splitter and snap just

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.500 
my little nut splitter and snap just
broke<00:02:08.330> open

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
broke open

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:17.080 
broke open
what's<00:02:11.510> great<00:02:15.519> can<00:02:16.519> you<00:02:16.610> check<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.940> nut

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
what's great can you check the nut

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.280 
what's great can you check the nut
splitter<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.480> don't<00:02:17.690> look<00:02:17.810> like<00:02:17.930> there's<00:02:18.110> any

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
splitter and don't look like there's any

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.449 
splitter and don't look like there's any
damage<00:02:19.540> on<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:20.780> see<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:21.650> is<00:02:21.709> removable<00:02:22.190> I

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
damage on that see this is removable I

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.780 
damage on that see this is removable I
think<00:02:24.489> yep<00:02:26.080> that's<00:02:27.080> just<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.350> cutting<00:02:27.620> hit<00:02:27.799> you

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
think yep that's just a cutting hit you

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.030 
think yep that's just a cutting hit you
may<00:02:28.970> have<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.590> shorten<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.650> one<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:30.890> little

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
may have to shorten that one a little

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:39.780 
may have to shorten that one a little
bit<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:33.010> it's<00:02:34.010> just<00:02:37.450> screws<00:02:38.450> over<00:02:38.720> like<00:02:39.019> that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
bit and it's just screws over like that

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.180 
bit and it's just screws over like that
that's<00:02:40.790> just<00:02:41.000> like<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:43.450> hmm<00:02:44.450> what's<00:02:44.870> good

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
that's just like that hmm what's good

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.090 
that's just like that hmm what's good
that<00:02:46.190> may<00:02:46.340> be<00:02:46.549> solution
