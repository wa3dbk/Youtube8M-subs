00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 back to the roots a lot of memories 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.820
 who come to my party spirit 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.410
 big win or big disappointments 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.250
 the nervousness of cries in the gala of 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.049
 Intense player hugs the door 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.350
 still the stigmata precisely of 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.410
 some evenings a little neurotic but 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.359
 otherwise a lot of emotion every time 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.619
 it's an impression to see my past 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.619
 constantly scrolling 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.520
 I loved integrated the center of 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.430
 training here at a time when at the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.250
 football was still different by summer 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.540
 the close was different and in me who 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.590
 came from my native Normandy 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.230
 it was a cultural shock to all 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.600
 total uprooting levels of a product 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.160
 geographical distance from the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.340
 family of the family unit but in 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.600
 the more you were 12 13 years old no one 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.899
 was not aware that I want your 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.940
 to come up 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.190
 then after then incorporate the team 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.290
 first with under the guidance of arsene 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.270
 wenger with players to help 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.820
 monstrous players the battiston the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.850
 smells harness them jean luc ettori manu 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.580
 amoros josé turned at last short the cream of 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.159
 the cream that at the time and with a super 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.720
 mentality that's why I say the world 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.070
 evolves very quickly a little 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.780
 nostalgic also of certain principles 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.369
 that we could have at that time there 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.590
 must not fall a little 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.680
 in bitterness because otherwise I have 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.420
 pass for an old con but I keep 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.280
 really memories extremely 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.530
 marking is for me the list monaco 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.790
 will always be etched in 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.790
 my heart is not bleeding 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.110
 whatever you do is doing it 100% 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.229
 but always be passionate 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.009
 it's the passion that team that for me 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.079
 the driving element really the very essence 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.700
 who will be able to implement 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.860
 will he be able to make you touch 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.330
 fingertips the dreams that you 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.010
 goal you put in your life what 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.030
 either at the private or professional level 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.710
 maintains some form 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.540
 carefree when a passionate side 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.920
 and that's what's good we're in a 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.710
 football world 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.050
 so we must provide emotion not 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.520
 just for teammates though 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.080
 coaching for club people but 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.760
 also for the spectators that it is 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.110
 were own fans but the fans too 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.460
 opposing clubs what matters what 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.200
 I mean but that famous phrase 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.480
 in the movie ridley scott gladiator 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.320
 if you want to win your freedom win the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.750
 audience's heart 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.160
 that's a bit of the problematic that 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.470
 I have today in the world of football 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.590
 or in all trades a little bit 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.180
 publicized if you can touch 106 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.280
 the sensitivity of people so brought from 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.580
 the emotion is somewhere you won 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.580
 his bet 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.550
 it's easier to project yourself in 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.160
 the future with a real sports project 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.020
 but at the same time they do not do the 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.030
 things by chance so I find that 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.650
 since a little over a year since the recovery 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.330
 of the club 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.580
 it is rather very satisfying of what 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.720
 does monaco at the moment they 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.850
 are rebuilding the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.680
 club foundations 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.660
 so for me that's a good thing 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.760
 and I think if the club continues 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.260
 like that it will go up without problem in 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.250
 league 1 glad to see that there is 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.600
 many old players who are 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.370
 responsible today the center of 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.750
 training marrow as monaco was one of 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.060
 main provider of football 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.980
 French we saw in 98 we saw that the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.410
 club won the gambardella ago 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.120
 a few years of which there have always been 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.549
 a real potential in terms of training 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.080
 here I am a geek at the base so that 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.940
 makes things easier again one 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.680
 back to passion I love them 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.549
 new technologies we are in the era of 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.819
 digital internet it almost seems him 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.549
 minitel 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.150
 that's it for the new generation 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.950
 so much things would have 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.170
 extremely quickly so when we 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.840
 sees advances in technology 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.310
 today we can imagine 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.010
 extraordinary perspectives for everything 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.359
 the monaco world just like 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.310
 many French or European clubs 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.900
 in football I speak but creaççois 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.310
 the leagues also the uefa all that since 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.980
 today with the sport pros we have 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.900
 signed almost half of the clubs 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.689
 league 1 league professional uefa 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.069
 canal + a brief we are very very present 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.209
 its French market not just because 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.480
 that we are we are present through the 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.340
 world 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.250
 it allows me somewhere to help 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.599
 also the monaco ace in his visibility not 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.989
 simply at the level of advertisers 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:18.880
 sponsors but also the history of the club 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.599
 in his news of an Italian so 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.090
 the italian school 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:24.190
 so in my time there are about ten 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.150
 of years with chelsea there was 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:40.090
 a lot of physical work 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:41.349
 a shredded flap and dragging for me 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.810
 it is imperative that they preserve 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.860
 that passion must be that he has to 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.860
 to be a little bit the guide 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.199
 but at the same time they have to 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.280
 make sure the guardrail to be able to 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.530
 keep this flame alive 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.789
 permanently if you do the more you 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.500
 no longer the players are 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.909
 disengaged they feel like 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.949
 football officials its fashion 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.150
 operating and Italian but 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.610
 at the same time he rolled his hump a 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.080
 little bit everywhere so I think he has 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.090
 he has concluded today that we are 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.099
 in the globalization of football so 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.120
 skills today are brought 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:15.520
 to circulate transversally in 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.030
 permanence so I think all that he 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.030
 understood it very well
