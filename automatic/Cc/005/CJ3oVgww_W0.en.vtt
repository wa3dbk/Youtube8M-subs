00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and the first thing to do is to make the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.870 
and the first thing to do is to make the
rim<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.170> your<00:00:31.199> hat<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.309> would<00:00:32.610> set<00:00:32.820> your

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
rim of your hat so you would set your

rim of your hat so you would set your
empty<00:00:33.690> oatmeal<00:00:34.620> container<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:35.630> top<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
empty oatmeal container on top of a

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.639 
empty oatmeal container on top of a
piece<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.530> 12<00:00:37.890> by<00:00:38.070> 9<00:00:38.100> construction<00:00:38.879> paper<00:00:39.649> in

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
piece of 12 by 9 construction paper in

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.350 
piece of 12 by 9 construction paper in
the<00:00:40.860> center<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:42.870> would<00:00:43.050> trace<00:00:43.320> around<00:00:43.469> it

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
the center and you would trace around it

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.590 
the center and you would trace around it
with<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> pencil<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.120> going<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.449> be

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
with a pencil and so this is going to be

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.410 
with a pencil and so this is going to be
the<00:00:52.110> inner<00:00:52.289> part<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.800> your<00:00:52.949> brim<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.460> then

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the inner part of your brim and then

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.360 
the inner part of your brim and then
you're<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> take<00:00:55.110> something<00:00:55.559> round<00:00:56.010> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
you're going to take something round and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.420 
you're going to take something round and
bigger<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.180> fits<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.750> piece<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:57.960> paper

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
bigger that fits on your piece of paper

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.849 
bigger that fits on your piece of paper
Center<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.609> within<00:00:59.820> your<00:01:00.090> circle<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.859> then

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
Center that within your circle and then

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.620 
Center that within your circle and then
trace<00:01:02.219> around<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.390> a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
trace around that and so now you have a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.530 
trace around that and so now you have a
circle<00:01:07.049> within<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.470> circle<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:09.060> next<00:01:09.360> thing

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
circle within a circle the next thing

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.950 
circle within a circle the next thing
you're<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.900> want<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:11.780> cut<00:01:12.780> this

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
little tabs and these just need to be

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.190 
little tabs and these just need to be
strips<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.250> paper<00:01:35.570> maybe<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.689> couple<00:01:37.079> inches

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
strips of paper maybe a couple inches

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.770 
strips of paper maybe a couple inches
long<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.420> four<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.570> them<00:01:39.720> will<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:40.460> plenty<00:01:41.780> and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
to see it because we're going to cover

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.350 
to see it because we're going to cover
it<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.549> with<00:01:50.820> our<00:01:51.570> decoration<00:01:52.729> you<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:53.970> going

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
it up with our decoration you are going

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.540 
it up with our decoration you are going
to<00:01:54.720> slide<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.439> down

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.760 

very<00:01:59.550> gently<00:01:59.970> so<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:03.780> get<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.230> bottom<00:02:04.470> of
