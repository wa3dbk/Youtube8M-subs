00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.709
 hi the gamer is what makes them 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.920
 3.25 at the microphone back for you 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:13.610
 explain a little bit a bonus one 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.340
 bonuses hidden precisely on this little 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.789
 game the fact of being able to simply 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.949
 recover 5 to all here is a small 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.849
 simple manipulation that will allow you 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:28.189
 to be able to play with 5 to all and is 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.699
 not far from the way departure after at 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.950
 to be able to chain the parts 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:37.390
 seriously you no longer need to 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.750
 nothing you're real dad attack so 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.890
 simply start with the turbine 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.510
 so you must be used to 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.710
 do it we explain to you how 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.710
 How's it going 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.930
 and once assembled so I'm going to you 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.219
 spare all scenes 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.739
 so here's the turbine is done 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.109
 now direction the bank for 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.640
 to get some money back for 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.880
 level 2 1 we did not do much 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.369
 we just kill 3410 history of having 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.009
 enough money to open the 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.100
 city ​​gate and bank 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.490
 especially so here we are refuel 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.009
 money 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.009
 and then we'll do our little tour of 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:27.450
 little tour of maps to recover 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:30.670
 assets but especially in a good way 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.740
 so back to square one 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:38.800
 inevitably so there everything simple you go 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.710
 falsely activate the assets so as to 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.030
 to be able to take them 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.069
 but once you remove the 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.020
 turbine obviously the assets do not 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.360
 are more active but they are well 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.740
 present 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.750
 so once it's small 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.590
 board destroy your pascal turbine 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.710
 will have served well and the next is well 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.280
 serve too so you pick up one and 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.890
 it's back to level 2 we're there 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.750
 So here is always 2nd round 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.470
 we do not see now we moved 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.890
 below so same same principle one that 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.370
 activates the distributor and both 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.370
 can use 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.870
 tec is 2 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.270
 so this is where we show catches a 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.480
 of course we take the shot of 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.280
 fist taser like that one is equipped for 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.830
 go to the 13th inning but that's it 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.240
 know if you followed the video 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.220
 just before we explain all that 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.210
 So here we are at the farm we took over 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.600
 the same principle bus to the farm on 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.800
 activates the dispenser and therefore serves 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.650
 that's what makes us three for 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.580
 the moment so I'll show you 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.420
 the little secret passage we speak on 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.090
 part of the farm by returning to the 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.460
 green the diners and you will see on your 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.300
 right on if the electricity is on 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.860
 there teleporter not very far who 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.280
 you said turned around you went 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.530
 too far 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.240
 but here are the small barriers 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.590
 along the abandoned city that we have 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:23.700
 will talk in in a next video 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.700
 and here we are at the city 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.380
 so that was to show you the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:35.120
 shortcut so last step 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:38.360
 switched to electrifying electricity 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:45.860
 the lit of course you can turn it on 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:46.520
 and turn it off no matter where you go 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.510
 get started 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.510
 we have all our assets 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.959
 he loses no time 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.260
 and we will now go to the city 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.320
 here we go so you see my 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.930
 Soral colleague gets jumped over 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.220
 commits suicide 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.870
 I still have more than to kill the 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.390
 last zombie forever this famous 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:19.090
 branch two jumps she will reappear 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.440
 show you both config you have 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.940
 the view from the outside you go 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.970
 understand easily and after I you 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.450
 will show with my coming to me so the 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.430
 room 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:33.370
 I am looking for the last 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:36.250
 zombie I have the impression of voice reads the 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.870
 see that that's done so either stop 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.160
 obviously appears beginning of the 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.660
 handle 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.690
 what does it do and ben he'll go 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.260
 look for his mastodon 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:52.720
 here he is the ski jump resuscitate he is going 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:55.260
 looking for her early mas and her stamina 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.260
 speed up 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.979
 especially they do not pick up his stone 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.080
 tombstone and you will understand 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.939
 it's all stupid once you get 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.650
 taken again that's why do it here 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:07.080
 Once you have resumed 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.090
 your stamina stamina and your mass 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.639
 early you recover your gravestone 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.650
 and this is the beginning of the glory had 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.129
 go on there are they does see how that 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.939
 market 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:24.960
 ban and that's it and that's five good assets 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:26.460
 aligned well clean in operation 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.550
 so here we are just going to spend a 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.979
 sleeve and then and then I'm going to do 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:38.810
 so obviously so here we are 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:41.039
 end of round 3 I commit suicide 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.129
 I do not feed the zombies 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.990
 I put my gravestone in place 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:50.180
 during that time soual will kill the 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:55.680
 zombies that rest here it's going to be soon 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:57.150
 and so we're alive again so that 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.539
 it is either forgiveness that will kill the 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.539
 last zombie 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.330
 here 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:09.949
 toc end of the round so I reappeared 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:13.370
 here I am and so it is left for me 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:16.400
 Also what we have had at the 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.610
 sleeve 4 both the five at all 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.319
 is there and well as you say 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.539
 now we will be able to have fun one 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:26.599
 little bit chained the sleeves he us 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.810
 not missing much since 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:31.629
 obviously we had a gun in the cool 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:35.900
 we have everything we need to attack 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:37.219
 so go on it all you need and you and 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.690
 well and if you have any questions 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:41.300
 leave me a little but not 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.449
 worries coach olivier murat more in the 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.449
 bus
