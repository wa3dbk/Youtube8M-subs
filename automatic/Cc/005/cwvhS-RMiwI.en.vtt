for<00:03:21.180> my<00:03:21.300> eye<00:03:21.390> shadow<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.019> think<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.260> works

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
for my eye shadow and I think it works

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.570 
for my eye shadow and I think it works
pretty<00:03:22.830> good<00:03:22.950> honestly<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.610> really<00:03:23.730> like<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.269> um

the next brush this one I'm not loving

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.890 
the next brush this one I'm not loving
it's<00:03:28.830> not<00:03:29.040> bad<00:03:29.280> it's<00:03:29.519> a<00:03:29.670> small<00:03:29.970> angled<00:03:30.390> brush<00:03:30.600> I

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
it's not bad it's a small angled brush I

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.199 
it's not bad it's a small angled brush I
think<00:03:31.380> some<00:03:31.560> people<00:03:31.830> use<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.130> for<00:03:32.400> eyeliner

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209

think some people use this for eyeliner
like<00:03:33.480> gel<00:03:33.690> eyeliner<00:03:34.080> but<00:03:34.650> um<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:35.010> don't<00:03:35.130> think

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
it's too good for that because sometimes

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.630 
it's too good for that because sometimes

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.280 
crease look then should be a perfect
brush<00:03:53.670> for<00:03:53.820> that<00:03:53.970> it's<00:03:54.450> not<00:03:54.600> bad<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:55.019> mean<00:03:55.230> I'm
