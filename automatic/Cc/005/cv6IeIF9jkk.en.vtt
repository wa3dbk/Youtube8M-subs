00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.319
 from the forage planning that is the producer 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:34.039
 the inmates play a very important role to keep both a solution 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.670
 stable forage 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.380
 especially that of the autumn-winter months 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.079
 due especially to the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.379
 to the great low production they have long alfalfa that the main source 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.490
 of food 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.490
 who has masters of the sweet pepper system of that area 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.980
 finally when the winter model he the main species that one many 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.770
 sometimes takes into account to plant in this era 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.410
 they are the vein 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.490
 as the main species and lately the missive for what is given 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.340
 We had usu very good production in turn 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.010
 the seriousness of the war we begin this contribution that in day they must cultivate the one that 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.350
 has let's say not behavior of this kind 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.810
 which has very good quality 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.960
 p many cases 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.450
 due to two predecessors worse because it comes from the lot that we do not touch the green 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.870
 If the planting date delays us 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.640
 before the increase some when you talk about green waterlogging we assess the date of 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 planting we enter amoco season - your web medals much colder 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.370
 where can and the vein and thus attract having problems to give a good 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.810
 production 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.680
 dt matías we would have for a way to complement and have a 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.020
 higher production in the winter month 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.550
 within one of those species to send what one could choose is the wheat 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.730
 although wheat is not a law it is a kind that so one to one hour still 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.670
 an improved integration for 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.600
 for truncheons for forage 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.970
 one can be human especially to the long cycle wheats to produce say 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.910
 a good amount of forage during the winter 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.650
 we take into account that everything that has lied but long or very bad caregivers 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.860
 They are very tolerant to the cold 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.320
 has as another advantage let's say that they are much more tolerant to the high 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.609
 leaf moisture as the attack of rocks 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:15.099
 therefore opposing a good alternative to take into account 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.410
 to complement and have a good production of the duck in winter 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:23.159
 if it is already that of amaral some may think that evident that subjecting fact of 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:23.779
 what 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.909
 as it is natural that the cold I can not is one of the most afternoons we are talking 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.510
 from this time without opening 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.869
 There is still a very good time to plant the wheat 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:35.099
 think always come pretty dense planting 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.409
 receives 100 120 kilos of seed per hectare 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.839
 think about fertilization with one to one pair a high production 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:45.549
 and this would allow me the wheat is very especially cold however harvest 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.899
 rúa as it may be that it is wanted that yes it criticized that it has a fracture 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:52.979
 previous manager given that in him in his time of production 3 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:54.519
 three or four pastors 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.230
 I know inside the tour or you may think that the educational pinocchio that can be 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.379
 dedicated for grazing which one can use directly and also not 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:03.400
 have another use 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.509
 that could be with a point of union among others by the fire burns for 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:12.749
 to be used as silage or for hill chosen in the spring we would touch 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:14.709
 the wheat between all day let's say 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.750
 but 4v alternative of direct grazing use 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.810
 you could apply if you could not pull for simple to mediate a mule buna 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.079
 produce gold could be let's say 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.529
 e used for this one was serene I call dry grass in the summer os x a 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.339
 alternative the uncle is a very good alternative that he should soon have in 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.830
 account 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.970
 how to improve 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.170
 the penalty for forage one looks for in the north field for mothers table 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.249
 production 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:41.209
 for busy chamorro of the rosemary geologist 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.599
 especially the bad forage wheat alternative many times 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.199
 Yet a very good mixed positive alternative to be covering a 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:54.310
 important surface counting with destiny to agriculture prepare it of the best 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:56.919
 way another afternoon 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.789
 to draw long cycles not the variety of high grain production but little 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:03.299
 forage development as you know 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.219
 to have it as an alternative 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:10.840
 of use the winter if we can send envoys to the planned reserve cuasa 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:14.399
 crop that is not going to return we destine agriculture and continue with the 

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:18.919
 agricultural rotation and eventually we have a forage deficit during 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.060
 the winter as it did not happen last year are relatively resources 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.610
 cheap and important is to share 'box' that agricultural part in milk that 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.729
 surely a better economic benefit will come to our 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.660
 our company therefore another unemployed that we can incorporate wheat 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:40.009
 It is very good alternative to have an additional forage reserve for 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.440
 what but classified for the eighths
