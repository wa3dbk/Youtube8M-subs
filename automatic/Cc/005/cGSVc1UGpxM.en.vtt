00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.200 
little less costly you can go with
something<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.170> Orion<00:01:34.259> GTX<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.520> then

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
something like the Orion GTX and then

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.370 
something like the Orion GTX and then
you<00:01:36.509> know<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> fusion<00:01:37.020> here<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.170> gonna<00:01:37.259> be

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
you know the fusion here is gonna be

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.480 
you know the fusion here is gonna be
around<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.650> hundred<00:01:37.890> eighty<00:01:38.040> dollar<00:01:38.250> mark

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
around that hundred eighty dollar mark

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.039 
around that hundred eighty dollar mark
if<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.640> want<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> step<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.840> go<00:01:39.990> to

if you want to step up you can go to

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.690 
if you want to step up you can go to
something<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.829> when<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.009> say<00:01:41.189> step<00:01:41.400> up<00:01:41.549> its

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
something and when I say step up its

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.030 
something and when I say step up its
really<00:01:41.970> all<00:01:42.570> leather<00:01:43.170> versus<00:01:43.619> leather<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
really all leather versus leather and

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.670 
really all leather versus leather and
textile<00:01:44.460> harden<00:01:45.149> uh<00:01:45.240> chol<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.689> Alaska<00:01:46.170> GTX
