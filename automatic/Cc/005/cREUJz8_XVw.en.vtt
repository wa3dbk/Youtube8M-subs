 to highlight your adventurous side not 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.520
 we can stop talking about that your 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.110
 suspension is higher so the hatch 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.270
 goes through irregularities with more 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.030

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.270
 symbolizing a chrome aquino in the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.150
 good 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.360
 I'll turn on the air conditioner and on the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.510
 board computer 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.940
 we have a digital speedometer 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.590
 the average speed at distance 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:02.729
 average consumption covered autonomy 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.740
 instantaneous consumption and travel time 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.200
 and here is the speed alert and if you 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.580
 Do you want to connect then to call? 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.520

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.470
 and then you will climb in speed here 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.110
 the way you want it 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.970
 and then you press here again and he 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.550

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.430
 is to zero the good odometer here also from the 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.340
 steering wheel back command we have 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.940
 the volume of the radio 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.170
 here we pass from station 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.530
 then it is still changing up in the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.530
 Earth 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.930
 Here you answer the telephone and you. 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.720
 you can also call the audio selector 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.319
 like iphone crab then you tighten 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.159
 That you talk to Crab is without powders. 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.099
 hands on it 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.750
 in this case as if it is still in 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.980
 you need to talk to him in English. 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:06.010
 English 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.510
 here you change the saved stations and here 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.849
 you change the on-board computer there in 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.450
 top 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.760
 and here you come in the vehicle menu to 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.220
 you pack the onboard computer 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.129
 The way you want it 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.040
 well here you are seeing the shift pedal 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.620
 on the gear shift on the steering wheel then here 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.640
 You slow down and here you 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.099
 a gear raises a great thing that 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.700
 We have crossfox now. 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:42.459
 automatic internal and external lighting 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:44.019
 so you leave the fin on her and he 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.959
 will light a car alone when he 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:52.660
 low light 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:54.730
 here you left the flashlight and good panel 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.840
 here on volkswagen's radio has 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.819
 bluetooth usb and usb input for iphone and 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.200
 other accessories 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.329
 here you connect the bluetooth and here 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.780
 you select the SD card to listen to the 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.330
 songs that are in here 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.500
 it's a cool thing the crossfox is a 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.609
 electric rear view mirror then we 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.630
 leaving him on the right side and pulling the 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.360
 reverse the mirror on the right goes to 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.080
 down so you can look at the guide with 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.080
 more easily 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.080
 enjoying that we are here in the 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.720
 part of the exchange 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:39.360
 the automated exchange i-motion it as 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.000
 it is said he is automated and not 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.910
 automatic or here in the internal part 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.140
 of the vehicle it's all automatic but there 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.930
 inside the hood 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.000
 He has a robot that changes the gears. 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.120
 for you 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.169
 It's something we wanted to talk about. 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.900
 here about the gaucho champion is that for 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.430
 you make it a little more subtle in the 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.950
 gear shifts 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.860
 you can press here in s mode to 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.450
 leave the sport and so on and so on 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.090
 You shift the gears here on the pedal. 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.040
 shift and then what you do in that time 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.479
 you had lehane to feel that the 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.680
 car is going to change gear or you 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.950
 I want to change the gear 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.080
 You just warn the foot and press here to 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.580
 So you change the gear and change a 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.400
 little faster and you will feel 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.700
 less the stride is to leave in the 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.010
 driveability and better 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.000
 Another cool thing is the 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:39.680
 cross Fox 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.680
 So we'll be turning here and it's going to open. 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.740
 we go back it closes if you want 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.370
 leave him alone here 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:54.800
 The law had lifted you turn to this 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:06:00.000
 side here but for you to close the ceiling 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:02.310

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.740
