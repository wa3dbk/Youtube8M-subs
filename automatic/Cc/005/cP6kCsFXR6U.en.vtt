00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.890
 hello to all my subscribers 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.039
 Today in this video I want to do 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.200
 review on 3 products from natural 

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:12.320
 cosmetics that came to my review 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.060
 even before i left to rest but everything 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.960
 how could I not tell you about these 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.240
 means and remove this video data 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.460
 I use products and cosmetics 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.989
 already as you know pretty long ago 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.839
 already more than two weeks probably already 3 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:32.719
 weeks for about a month too 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:36.100
 I generally have something to tell and so 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.739
 This is how these look 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:44.090
 cosmetic cosmetic products 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:46.370
 They are a site called Ayurveda Shop 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.460
 dot ru on this site are presented 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.989
 only natural cosmetics in general 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.679
 what I want to say about playing 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.719
 cosmetics 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.730
 I really like natural cosmetics 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.219
 and know the girls who use 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.850
 only such cosmetics i 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.679
 Of course, I use ordinary cosmetics 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.900
 not only natural but I really 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.329
 like natural and because I 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.979
 it is even more pleasant to use it 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.100
 there is to realize that it is natural 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.590
 components that is all harmless to 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.619
 health and so on that is such 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.540
 cosmetics even nicer to use 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.939
 here about the results from her 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.970
 use very often really 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.479
 natural cosmetics please and result 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.460
 very very good that's why i'm at 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.860
 In general, she chose these 3 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.549
 funds on this site can credit the site 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:42.290
 ivy ayurveda shop.ru will of course 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:45.140
 under this video the first thing I chose this 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.509
 mask to accelerate hair growth with 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.579
 ginger that is dough in general 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.140
 one hundred percent death is natural 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.110
 hair mask and in 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.920
 Effectively stimulates hair growth 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.780
 so on in general, what I want to say 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.000
 The packaging is very nice and very good 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.600
 gum that minus it's pretty heavy 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.759
 and it is glass and also minus what is here 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.300
 very little on the product itself just 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:15.950
 share on such a small amount but because 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.830
 the fact that this mask is very thick and so 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.510
 let's say so fat it is very economical 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.160
 consumed as you can see i'm enough 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.680
 often used but I have left 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.990
 her smell is so much 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.050
 medicinal herbs of some kind but rather 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.020
 nice mask I really liked her 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.570
 very well softens the hair saturate 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.150
 their hair shiny hair does not split 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.810
 of course about this 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.120
 so growth acceleration hair growth i'm nothing 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.130
 I did not notice to be honest but by itself 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.810
 Masochka is very good 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.460
 perhaps if really very often 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.430
 and enjoy and leave as 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.650
 written it for 20 minutes on the roots then 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.570
 maybe some kind of result and it will be but 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.450
 I'm still using just like 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.520
 regular mask on the tip more 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.380
 used because i really 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.690
 I liked exactly the result 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.080
 hair so soft become shiny 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.790
 the tips do not split a good mask and weight 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.570
 before so natural 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.540
 orange water with orange extract 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.850
 she goes in sprays of a transparent color here 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.520
 so she looks sprayed very 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.860
 nice citrus smell at all 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.260
 this water is intended for various 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.290
 goals she can simply wipe her skin 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.360
 can be used as thermal water 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.970
 you can simply refresh the face can be 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.870
 use as tonic and some 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.420
 redness she is very water perfect 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.540
 suitable for dry skin because it 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.030
 may even heal some very such 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.850
 dry areas she is very very good 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.410
 moisturizes the skin right such skin 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.420
 nourished and can say so fresh 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.790
 straight breathes really very good 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.880
 moistening this lichke also oranges 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.660
 in the water and used to combat even 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.880
 cellulite 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.739
 That is, there is a lot of such functional 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.780
 remedy but I'm a little more often 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.840
 use just like thermal water 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.510
 she sprayed her face especially on the sea to me 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.630
 it helped a lot because it was refreshing 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.579
 and moisturizes the skin very very well here 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.220
 and last resort which 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.220
 I want to show you that to me at all 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.509
 really enjoyed it best 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:29.539
 a tool that I generally ever 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:31.490
 used to fight let's say with 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:35.169
 by some kind of skin imperfections i.e. 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.319
 some pimples and so it is generally there 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.319
 Neroli hydrolat 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.490
 here's a contractor here too 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.680
 cute glass also with 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.530
 spray I just love it 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.840
 this means of his i'm ready to buy more 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.660
 when it is over for me now 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.850
 left somewhere exactly half of it i 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.610
 used very often everybody at all 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.380
 a day several times a day this one 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.539
 Hydrolat her role 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.960
 This water is great for 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:20.970
 oily skin because it has astringent 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.860
 such properties dry the skin here 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.830
 removes all this greasy unnecessary shine 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.229
 but it does not dry out the skin very much 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.310
 generally copes with the appearance 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:35.620
 pimples with the appearance of some kind of window 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.470
 some kind of redness in general is just very 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.720
 cool and clear seventh want to say 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.699
 that I had acne on my face when 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:47.680
 I began to use this water here 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:50.169
 I was all the same way I could 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.479
 sometimes such small ones appear 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.270
 pimples on the shoulders well here in this area 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.669
 Of course they were not visible there but all 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.430
 she was not very nice here and i am also 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:03.070
 mom has her shoulders too with this water and 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.349
 no pryshchiki 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.440
 nothing really really very 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:10.030
 cool dough so who fights with 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.099
 some acne and some 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.190

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:16.840
