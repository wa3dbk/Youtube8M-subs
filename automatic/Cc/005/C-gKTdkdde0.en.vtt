00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
look India so this is a Raspberry Pi

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.079 
look India so this is a Raspberry Pi
order<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:03.899> just<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.830> little<00:00:05.220> tiny<00:00:05.520> computer

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
order and just a little tiny computer

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.330 
order and just a little tiny computer
here<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.450> put<00:00:07.140> some<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.440> these<00:00:07.770> little<00:00:07.980> cheap

the<00:00:28.080> raspberry<00:00:28.260> pi<00:00:28.650> as<00:00:29.240> setting<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.330> up<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.480> I'm

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the raspberry pi as setting it up so I'm

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.530

going<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.590> put<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> wireless<00:00:32.279> adapter<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:33.360> here

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
going to put a wireless adapter in here

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.610 
going to put a wireless adapter in here
so<00:00:34.790> pop<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.820> guy<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.540> then<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.320> bought

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
this i had 700 megahertz cpu 512

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.749 
this i had 700 megahertz cpu 512
megabyte<00:01:44.880> bytes<00:01:45.360> ram<00:01:46.369> it's<00:01:47.369> not<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.729> a

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
megabyte bytes ram it's not like a

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.789

make<00:05:10.550> sure<00:05:10.580> this<00:05:10.880> works<00:05:11.270> whoops<00:05:12.080> i<00:05:12.199> opened<00:05:12.470> two

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
make sure this works whoops i opened two

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.560 
make sure this works whoops i opened two
of<00:05:12.680> them<00:05:12.830> it's<00:05:13.490> not<00:05:13.639> like<00:05:13.849> the<00:05:14.000> fastest

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
of them it's not like the fastest

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.900 
of them it's not like the fastest
computer<00:05:15.530> obviously<00:05:16.190> so<00:05:16.460> let's<00:05:16.699> go<00:05:16.849> to

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
computer obviously so let's go to

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:32.590 
computer obviously so let's go to
google.com<00:05:23.020> see<00:05:24.020> Wi-Fi<00:05:24.590> is<00:05:24.620> actually<00:05:25.130> working

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.770 

there<00:05:33.260> we<00:05:33.590> go<00:05:33.790> cool<00:05:34.790> um<00:05:35.200> so<00:05:36.200> if<00:05:36.920> I<00:05:37.640> go<00:05:37.670> to<00:05:37.880> the<00:05:38.210> PI

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
there we go cool um so if I go to the PI

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.820 
there we go cool um so if I go to the PI
store<00:05:39.170> right<00:05:40.100> here<00:05:41.410> they<00:05:42.410> have<00:05:42.500> a<00:05:42.560> bunch<00:05:42.710> of

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.190 
add-ons and everything it's pretty
simple<00:05:45.290> operating<00:05:45.890> system<00:05:46.310> I<00:05:47.080> think<00:05:48.080> it's

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
simple operating system I think it's

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.010 
simple operating system I think it's
only<00:05:48.290> about<00:05:48.650> 300<00:05:49.520> to<00:05:49.850> 600<00:05:50.120> megs<00:05:50.570> I<00:05:50.840> don't

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
only about 300 to 600 megs I don't

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.450 
only about 300 to 600 megs I don't
recall<00:05:52.570> and<00:05:53.570> it's<00:05:54.200> loading<00:05:54.620> according<00:05:55.310> this

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
recall and it's loading according this

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.910 
recall and it's loading according this
indicator<00:05:56.170> but<00:05:57.170> most<00:05:57.320> people<00:05:57.590> like<00:05:57.740> to<00:05:57.770> use

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
indicator but most people like to use

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.560 
indicator but most people like to use
this<00:05:58.220> maybe<00:05:58.580> as<00:05:58.760> a<00:05:58.790> media<00:05:59.150> center<00:05:59.330> or

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
this maybe as a media center or

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.360 
this maybe as a media center or
something<00:05:59.780> I<00:06:00.200> might<00:06:00.770> need<00:06:00.950> something<00:06:01.280> a

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
something I might need something a

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.760 
something I might need something a
little<00:06:01.420> faster<00:06:02.420> if<00:06:02.690> i'm<00:06:02.810> going<00:06:02.960> to<00:06:03.050> use<00:06:03.140> XMBC

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
little faster if i'm going to use XMBC

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.930 
little faster if i'm going to use XMBC
because<00:06:04.400> it<00:06:04.520> does<00:06:04.700> tie<00:06:05.000> up<00:06:05.180> a<00:06:05.330> little<00:06:05.570> bit<00:06:06.940> but

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
because it does tie up a little bit but

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.310 
because it does tie up a little bit but
it's<00:06:08.090> extremely<00:06:08.420> easy<00:06:08.750> to<00:06:08.900> use<00:06:10.150> and<00:06:11.290> you<00:06:12.290> can

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
it's extremely easy to use and you can

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.410 
it's extremely easy to use and you can
see<00:06:12.620> the<00:06:12.650> hardware<00:06:13.310> is<00:06:13.520> just<00:06:13.820> it's<00:06:14.120> a<00:06:14.210> little

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
see the hardware is just it's a little

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.270 
see the hardware is just it's a little
ugly<00:06:14.780> looking<00:06:15.080> but<00:06:15.320> if<00:06:15.770> you<00:06:15.920> hid<00:06:16.100> it<00:06:16.190> behind

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
ugly looking but if you hid it behind

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.610 
ugly looking but if you hid it behind
the<00:06:16.580> TV<00:06:16.760> it<00:06:17.060> might<00:06:17.090> be<00:06:17.330> kind<00:06:17.540> of<00:06:17.570> cool<00:06:17.780> you<00:06:18.020> got
