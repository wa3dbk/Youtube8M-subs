00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.880
 in this video is in solar panels for on a boat 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.110
 and those titanium jumper cables 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.650
 and anti-dumping herewith once again the solar panel with the foot where 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.439
 you get up and see the cable without members 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.729
 but how does it actually work those solar panels for a boat 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:19.539
 that is actually best and you would actually have the three parts ipte 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:20.710
 solar panels 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.359
 I have the late defeat 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.359
 and you have the connection material thus the cables 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.779
 the weatherproof turns 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.559
 and the feet where the erect a solar panel or the solar panels 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.820
 for that of course look for a good place on the boat where the solar panels 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.840
 could live you have room for sunglasses or several solar panels 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.500
 governance is important 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.560
 in addition to a delicious self-calculation 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.560
 what weird capacity solar panels you need 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.860
 and there is also going to make up if reader need one or two 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.010
 mt yes or in 100 watt peak solar panel 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.760
 need or maybe even more or less 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.150
 but with such a measure from a set you actually just set 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.480
 or such a water and takes care of you 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.540
 until energy from the sun is converted 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.420
 in the energy that you can use to bend until the tumor monitors 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.680
 that is also automatically protected so that she cannot do everything 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.080
 to leave 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.310
 and also not that the battery completely drained after distillate controller 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.120
 to follow 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.560
 the cables connect there for this 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.900
 and mounts them on the boat 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.870
 and that way the competition stands and you also see more and more boats 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.680
 because your tips are less dependent on a port where you have energy 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.210
 there must be a cable by type 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.520
 so you can also spend the night in places where that is not present 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.360
 a piece that is always handy for generating that free energy yourself 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.840
 and therefore you see more and more solar panels on a boat with such a 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.130
 cache 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.869
 in the boat often very nice that his crash is to read everything everything 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.290
 think of a candle or the home shirt for the resume then you can too 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.409
 see is allowed 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:09.699
 how through 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.969
 how the heating interview thus performs solar panel 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.949
 how much the divers are charged or not 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.459
 what is solar panels at the moment 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.729
 yes to generate energy 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:22.359
 and much more 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.689
 well i will be the link below the fourth set with more information 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.849
 about the solar panels for a boat
