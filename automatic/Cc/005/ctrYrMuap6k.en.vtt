once I get it started I can use my
finger<00:02:28.160> let's<00:02:29.160> see<00:02:29.400> if<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:31.110> dough<00:02:31.349> held

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
finger let's see if the dough held

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.670 
finger let's see if the dough held
together<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.430> our<00:02:32.489> mold<00:02:34.910> yeah<00:02:36.349> that<00:02:37.349> held

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
together on our mold yeah that held

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.000 
together on our mold yeah that held
together<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.989> it<00:02:39.989> looks<00:02:40.680> great<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:43.680> set
