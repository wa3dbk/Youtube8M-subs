00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.809
 now good that such little windows how 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.480
 we are here to see another 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.039
 new trick on windows that good 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.539
 many of you will know but what not 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.460
 you know, I want to teach oslo because 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.800
 it is very useful that it happens that many times 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.360
 we install many applications or 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.400
 we install many things without knowing that 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.070
 we install and our system works 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.080
 slow how can we solve this is 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.930
 very simple let's do it from a 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.269
 very intuitive way and also without 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.180
 require great knowledge first 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.860
 place we are going to open well from is 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.350
 possible for windows xp windows 7 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.570
 windows 8 any operating system 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.019
 let's go to the start menu and look for more 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.489
 config if you are in windows xp as not 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.119
 there's search bar then instead 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:01.750
 to look for it you will go to run and you put 

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:01.750
 to ims config in agreement and we open it 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.780
 well once we have it open we are going to 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.729
 go to the services tab and we're going to 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.200
 check the box that appears below 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.740
 to hide all the services of 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.659
 microsoft 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.210
 and here we have all the services that 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.299
 they are loading into the system 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.729
 because some program has installed them 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.440
 While there are services that do not have 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.030
 be running if we do not want and that 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.580
 will cause our system to work 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.560
 much faster in this case you see that 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.590
 all that I have disabled are the 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.229
 services that I do not consider necessary 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.000
 to run the system see by 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.170
 example as all the services of 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.790
 google update are 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.009
 disabled do not have the box 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.740
 All update services 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.649
 adobe are also disabled etc 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.179
 etc etc that we can disable and that 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.440
 not so here you have to do a little 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.000
 of your intention of yours 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.310
 intuition and what you look for in google 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.130
 in agreement 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.229
 for example the service of sending 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.700
 envies trans copy 3d I do not have it 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.520
 enabled because you are not using the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.320
 3d agree and like adobe 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.030
 I have a short switch enabled because 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.440
 I do not use adobe sweet word is not for 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.520
 that is loading the service if I 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.349
 I do not use 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.420
 likewise, the updaters do not 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.920
 I have enabled because what they do is 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.480
 be looking for elections in second 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.790
 flat and I'll take care of myself 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.830
 update them manually then it's not 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.440
 necessary that they are occupying memory and 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.480
 processor but are you going to use so 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.670
 that you can disable them and leave them alone 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.200
 essential services if you have doubts 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.239
 about some service not knowing if it is 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.890
 essential or you can not leave us a 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.630
 comment on the channel and we will 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.830
 we will help you or other users who 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.690
 are watching the video they can help you 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.030
 as far as possible so that 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.769
 you know, you can enable another 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.420
 what we are going to do to improve the 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.370
 system performance we're going to go to 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.769
 the windows start tab in 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.870
 windows 7 and windows xp here you 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.130
 all the data will appear but in 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.330
 windows 8 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.360
 we will have to go to the administrator 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.260
 tasks and go to the home tab that 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.080
 it's exactly the same 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.140
 in windows 7 in windows xp is here of 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.849
 agreement then what are we going to do let's 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.489
 to look for the services that we do not use 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.079
 and we're going to give it to disable 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.600
 agreement as we did with the 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.530
 services 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.480
 well for example in my case I have 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.800
 enabled the java updater and 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.210
 how do I update it? 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.000
 manually and I do not want to be consumed 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.740
 resources I give to disable 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.360
 agreement in such a way that it no longer 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.880
 will load at the start of the computer or 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.830
 will always be running on 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.570
 background as they were 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.490
 enabled and you see here in the 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.690
 task manager in details you see 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.310
 all the processes that are active 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.910
 surely here is the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.980
 java updater just running 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.900
 and consuming us memory and consuming 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.840
 those processed and that will make our 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.340
 team go slower it 's likely that if 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.490
 have been with your computer for a while 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.830
 two months three months and it turns out that never 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.870
 you have done this you find yourself with a 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.100
 list here of 20 or 30 applications that 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.900
 are running at the beginning and that 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.120
 they are all in memory or even 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.100
 in services this will make our 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.290
 system go very slow you only have 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.020
 that disable it either at startup or 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.490
 well in services and well this does not have 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.080
 much more with this you are going to get that 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.530
 our system go much faster and 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.390
 without any complications and another 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.040
 note that you want to say make sure 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.840
 When you touch the services, be 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.120
 check the box hide all 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.410
 microsoft services because if not 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.030
 it will also not show the services of 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.130
 microsoft and disable one of them 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.770
 could lead to certain parts of 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.180
 our computer will stop working 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.460
 in such a way that ensure or always that 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.129
 this box is marked another 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.319
 recommendation is that 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.239
 you google what are the 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:47.819
 services that are enabled so much 

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:50.610
 here as in the beginning and those that 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.589
 are important not those of xavi lite jce 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.349
 because if you can not stop working 

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:57.839
 something for example I could stop you 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.759
 run the wifi I could stop 

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:03.319
 operate the quick keys of our 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:05.429
 portable but if you do this I tell you 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:07.050
 looking for that is everything you do not know 

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:09.169
 or asking you are going to get a lot 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.399
 better performance and also in a moment 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.949
 after this you only have to 

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:16.619
 accept this dialogue and if you have touched 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.689
 something in my case of touched nothing will put you 

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:20.219
 that restarting the computer restarts it 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:21.869
 you will see already how in that reboot 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:24.300
 Windows loaded much faster 

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:26.159
 I did it and well I hope that this 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.229
 has served and well see you in the 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:31.669
 next video of bs.f team sider de 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.669
