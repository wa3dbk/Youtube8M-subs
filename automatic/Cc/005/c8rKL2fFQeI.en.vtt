00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.710 
out either this year not this year but
becoming<00:04:12.819> you<00:04:13.819> know<00:04:13.849> maybe<00:04:14.120> maybe<00:04:14.449> it<00:04:14.599> was

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
becoming you know maybe maybe it was

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.719 
becoming you know maybe maybe it was
this<00:04:14.840> year<00:04:15.019> maybe<00:04:15.230> this<00:04:15.440> year<00:04:15.590> next<00:04:15.829> year<00:04:15.980> but

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
this year maybe this year next year but

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:17.890 
this year maybe this year next year but
the<00:04:16.880> whole<00:04:17.000> point<00:04:17.030> of<00:04:17.299> it<00:04:17.389> was<00:04:17.449> to<00:04:17.599> see<00:04:17.870> if

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
the whole point of it was to see if

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.089 
the whole point of it was to see if
people<00:04:18.289> are<00:04:18.380> still<00:04:18.410> in<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.889> Star<00:04:19.070> Wars

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
people are still in the Star Wars

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.710 
people are still in the Star Wars
first-person<00:04:19.789> shooters<00:04:20.150> and<00:04:20.389> if<00:04:20.510> that<00:04:20.690> goes

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
first-person shooters and if that goes

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.029 
first-person shooters and if that goes
well<00:04:20.930> they<00:04:21.289> might<00:04:21.320> make<00:04:21.769> it<00:04:21.859> the<00:04:21.979> star

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
well they might make it the star

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.520 
well they might make it the star
battlefront<00:04:22.669> 3<00:04:22.699> and<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.199> game<00:04:24.349> looks

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
battlefront 3 and the the game looks

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.980 
battlefront 3 and the the game looks
pretty<00:04:24.710> cool<00:04:24.830> itself<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.750> basalt<00:04:26.750> or

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
pretty cool itself the basalt or

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.830 
pretty cool itself the basalt or
whatever<00:04:27.289> it's<00:04:27.470> called<00:04:28.120> first<00:04:29.120> first<00:04:29.479> assault

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
whatever it's called first first assault

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.770 
whatever it's called first first assault
and<00:04:30.139> I<00:04:30.590> really<00:04:30.979> think<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:31.729> can<00:04:31.789> do<00:04:32.060> well<00:04:32.270> and

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
and I really think it it can do well and

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.900 
and I really think it it can do well and
the<00:04:33.020> graphics<00:04:33.199> are<00:04:33.500> really<00:04:33.530> good<00:04:34.130> the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
the graphics are really good the

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.629 
the graphics are really good the
gameplay<00:04:35.090> kind<00:04:35.510> of<00:04:35.570> looks<00:04:35.720> like<00:04:36.340> gears<00:04:37.340> of<00:04:37.520> war

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
gameplay kind of looks like gears of war

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.560 
gameplay kind of looks like gears of war
