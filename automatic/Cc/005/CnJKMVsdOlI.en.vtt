00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
that's really master skill now if I

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.860 
that's really master skill now if I
equip<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.570> second<00:01:17.260> second<00:01:18.070> chance<00:01:18.370> potion<00:01:19.120> then

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
equip a second second chance potion then

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.500 
equip a second second chance potion then
they<00:01:20.170> actually<00:01:20.650> stack<00:01:21.070> so<00:01:21.820> you'll<00:01:22.030> see<00:01:22.270> with

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
they actually stack so you'll see with

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.290 
they actually stack so you'll see with
the<00:01:22.540> same<00:01:22.870> Titan<00:01:23.500> I<00:01:23.860> go<00:01:24.280> through<00:01:24.640> being

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
the same Titan I go through being

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.800 
the same Titan I go through being
defeated<00:01:25.660> many<00:01:26.080> times<00:01:26.440> again<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.220> in<00:01:28.150> fact<00:01:28.450> I

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
defeated many times again and in fact I

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.280 
defeated many times again and in fact I
end<00:01:29.170> up<00:01:29.410> getting<00:01:29.680> 10<00:01:30.340> extra<00:01:31.150> second<00:01:31.660> chances

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
end up getting 10 extra second chances

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.060 
end up getting 10 extra second chances
per<00:01:32.710> potion<00:01:33.550> with<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.720> potion<00:01:34.960> master<00:01:35.680> skill

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
per potion with the potion master skill

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.510 
per potion with the potion master skill
so<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.270> believe<00:01:37.660> it's<00:01:37.960> only<00:01:38.410> one<00:01:38.710> second<00:01:39.280> chance

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
so I believe it's only one second chance

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.850 
so I believe it's only one second chance
if<00:01:39.910> you<00:01:40.030> haven't<00:01:40.420> got<00:01:40.570> that

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
if you haven't got that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.060 
if you haven't got that
skill<00:01:41.190> but<00:01:41.970> if<00:01:42.330> you<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.840> got<00:01:43.140> potion<00:01:43.620> master

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
skill but if you have got potion master

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.240 
skill but if you have got potion master
skill<00:01:44.400> you'll<00:01:44.850> get<00:01:45.090> ten<00:01:45.420> second<00:01:46.050> chances<00:01:46.590> for

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
skill you'll get ten second chances for

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.750 
skill you'll get ten second chances for
each<00:01:47.550> potion<00:01:48.300> that<00:01:48.690> you<00:01:48.810> drink<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.760> the
