00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
find if you get it lined up in the right

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.420 
find if you get it lined up in the right
spot<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:40.590> able<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:40.980> pushed<00:00:41.250> in

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
spot it's able to be pushed in

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.520 
spot it's able to be pushed in
completely<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.960> rotate<00:00:43.410> it

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
completely and then you rotate it

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.290 
completely and then you rotate it
forward<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.700> then<00:00:44.879> locked<00:00:45.120> in

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
forward so that it's then locked in

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.709 
forward so that it's then locked in
place<00:00:48.079> next<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.379> double-check<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
place next just double-check that the

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.090 
place next just double-check that the
breakaway<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:52.610> correctly<00:00:54.649> you'll<00:00:55.649> find<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
breakaway is correctly you'll find the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
right where it says PC after that you

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.030 
right where it says PC after that you
also<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:20.119> headphones<00:01:21.119> come<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
also see that the headphones come with a

also see that the headphones come with a
optical<00:01:23.040> cable<00:01:23.869> will<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:24.960> select<00:01:25.170> connecting

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
optical cable will we select connecting

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.640 
optical cable will we select connecting
those<00:01:25.979> next<00:01:26.460> make<00:01:27.420> sure<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.840> plastic

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
those next make sure that the plastic

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.819 
those next make sure that the plastic
covers<00:01:28.950> are<00:01:29.070> taken<00:01:29.369> off<00:01:29.520> both<00:01:29.790> ends<00:01:30.590> one<00:01:31.590> end

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
covers are taken off both ends one end

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.539 
covers are taken off both ends one end
goes<00:01:32.610> into<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> backs<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> decoder<00:01:34.049> box

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
goes into the backs of the decoder box

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.560 
goes into the backs of the decoder box
and<00:01:36.170> then<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:38.130> other<00:01:38.280> end<00:01:38.549> goes<00:01:39.119> into<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and then the other end goes into the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.630 
and then the other end goes into the
back<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.990> your<00:01:40.200> ps3<00:01:40.740> console<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:44.130> other<00:01:44.280> cable

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
back of your ps3 console the other cable

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.630 
back of your ps3 console the other cable
we'll<00:01:44.759> be<00:01:44.850> using<00:01:45.500> is<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.799> USB<00:01:47.280> cable<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
we'll be using is the USB cable and it

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.609 
we'll be using is the USB cable and it
has<00:01:50.850> an<00:01:51.149> connection<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.290> looks<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.500> lot

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
has an connection on it that looks a lot

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.980 
has an connection on it that looks a lot
like<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:53.299> essentially<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> same<00:01:54.509> as<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> printer

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
like a essentially the same as a printer

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.889 
like a essentially the same as a printer
connection<00:01:55.969> you'll<00:01:56.969> put<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
connection you'll put that and the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.319 
connection you'll put that and the
printer<00:01:58.229> connection<00:01:58.829> into<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.070> back<00:01:59.399> of<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
printer connection into the back of the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.380 
printer connection into the back of the
decoder<00:02:00.659> box<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.430> then<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.610> standard<00:02:03.000> USB

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
decoder box and then the standard USB

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.929 
decoder box and then the standard USB
connection<00:02:04.200> will<00:02:04.770> go<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.310> front<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.790> your

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
connection will go in the front of your

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.940 
connection will go in the front of your
ps3<00:02:06.329> system

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.250 

they're<00:02:09.160> also<00:02:09.550> obviously<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.300> put<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.080> power

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
they're also obviously to put the power

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.490 
they're also obviously to put the power
cable<00:02:12.010> in<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.340> back<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:12.790> as<00:02:12.910> well<00:02:13.500> those

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
cable in the back of this as well those

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.720 
cable in the back of this as well those
are<00:02:14.650> essentially<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.160> three<00:02:15.430> connections

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
are essentially the three connections

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.910 
are essentially the three connections
you<00:02:16.030> need<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.209> make<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.660> you'll<00:02:16.810> be<00:02:16.959> set<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.890> go

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
you need to make and you'll be set to go

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.839 
you need to make and you'll be set to go
and<00:02:18.310> up<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.819> running<00:02:23.310> okay<00:02:24.310> so<00:02:24.370> once<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.819> have

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
and up and running okay so once you have

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.130 
and up and running okay so once you have
your<00:02:25.590> headphone<00:02:26.590> Hardware<00:02:27.400> set<00:02:27.670> up<00:02:27.760> correctly

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
your headphone Hardware set up correctly

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.390
