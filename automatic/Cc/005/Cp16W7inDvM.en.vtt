so<00:00:00.780> a<00:00:00.810> few<00:00:01.020> people<00:00:01.350> have<00:00:01.530> asked<00:00:01.800> me<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:01.949> give<00:00:02.340> a

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
so a few people have asked me to give a

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.840 
so a few people have asked me to give a
quick<00:00:02.610> demonstration<00:00:02.850> on<00:00:03.480> how<00:00:03.710> my<00:00:04.850> single

motor access mod for the cubed one up
printer<00:00:11.490> works<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.450> maybe<00:00:12.840> explain<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> little

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
printer works and maybe explain a little

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.890 
printer works and maybe explain a little
how<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.860> works<00:00:14.130> I've<00:00:15.030> used<00:00:15.269> several<00:00:15.540> 3d

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
how it works I've used several 3d

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.540 
how it works I've used several 3d
printers<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.440> past<00:00:16.650> I've<00:00:16.920> used<00:00:16.949> bits<00:00:17.400> from

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
printers in the past I've used bits from

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.750 
printers in the past I've used bits from
bites<00:00:17.789> 3d<00:00:18.420> systems<00:00:18.980> but<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.340> my<00:00:20.520> first

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
bites 3d systems but this is my first

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.870 
bites 3d systems but this is my first
DIY<00:00:21.210> printer<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.810> I've<00:00:21.900> ever<00:00:22.050> done<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.880> when

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
DIY printer that I've ever done and when

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.830 
DIY printer that I've ever done and when
I<00:00:23.910> bought<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.449> could<00:00:24.570> already<00:00:24.720> tell

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
I bought this I could already tell

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.990 
I bought this I could already tell
there's<00:00:25.109> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.439> problem<00:00:25.619> one

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
there's going to be a problem one

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.400 
there's going to be a problem one
there's<00:00:27.000> only<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.240> lead<00:00:27.660> screw<00:00:27.930> supporting

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
there's only one lead screw supporting

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.740 
there's only one lead screw supporting
one<00:00:29.160> side<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.550> printer<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.970> that's<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
one side of the printer and that's a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.690 
one side of the printer and that's a
problem<00:00:30.929> because<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.949> extruder<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.460> an

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
problem because this extruder is an

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.120 
problem because this extruder is an
exactly<00:00:33.000> lightweight<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:34.559> carriage

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
exactly lightweight and this carriage

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.350 
exactly lightweight and this carriage
itself<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.610> an<00:00:35.730> executive<00:00:36.090> lightweight

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
itself is an executive lightweight

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.970 
itself is an executive lightweight
either<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.140> when<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.620> combined

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
either so when you have the combined

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.580 
either so when you have the combined
weight<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.910> extruder<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.230> carriage

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
weight of the extruder and the carriage

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.880 
weight of the extruder and the carriage
all<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.219> side<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:42.329> tends<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:42.989> sag<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.710> i

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
all in one side it tends the sag and i

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.139 
all in one side it tends the sag and i
don't<00:00:44.010> mean<00:00:44.070> sag<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> little<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.879> actually

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
don't mean sag a little it actually

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.630 
don't mean sag a little it actually
sagged<00:00:45.420> quite<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> bit<00:00:46.100> so<00:00:47.100> much<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.550> it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
sagged quite a bit so much that it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.549 
sagged quite a bit so much that it
actually<00:00:47.850> through<00:00:48.239> many<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.899> my<00:00:49.020> prints<00:00:49.410> out

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
actually through many of my prints out

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.139 
actually through many of my prints out
of<00:00:49.860> whack<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.100> i<00:00:50.670> had<00:00:51.270> several<00:00:51.750> failed<00:00:52.050> prints

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
of whack and i had several failed prints

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.209 
of whack and i had several failed prints
but<00:00:54.149> i've<00:00:54.449> come<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.930> system<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.920> help

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
but i've come up with a system to help

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.299 
but i've come up with a system to help
fix<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:57.079> from<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.199> as<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.710> see<00:00:58.859> there

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
fix this from what as you can see there

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.599 
fix this from what as you can see there
is<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.670> series<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.449> pulleys<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.980> some<00:01:01.980> wine<00:01:02.250> and

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
is a series of pulleys and some wine and

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.179 
is a series of pulleys and some wine and
what<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.510> does<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.899> eliminate<00:01:04.049> all<00:01:04.439> sag<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
what this does is eliminate all sag and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.140 
what this does is eliminate all sag and
here's<00:01:05.400> how<00:01:05.600> how<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.689> does<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.760> this<00:01:08.760> side<00:01:08.970> is

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
here's how how it does it this side is

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.969 
here's how how it does it this side is
being<00:01:09.360> pulled<00:01:09.600> down<00:01:09.750> by<00:01:09.990> gravity<00:01:10.020> because

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
being pulled down by gravity because

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.700 
being pulled down by gravity because
it's<00:01:11.360> there's<00:01:12.360> no<00:01:12.540> lead<00:01:12.750> screw<00:01:13.049> supporting<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
it's there's no lead screw supporting it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.380 
it's there's no lead screw supporting it
like<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.130> side<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.610> side<00:01:14.850> can't<00:01:15.180> move

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
like this side so this side can't move

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.740 
like this side so this side can't move
so<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.650> do<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.670> attach<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.000> line<00:01:18.240> here

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
so what we do is we attach a line here

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.260 
so what we do is we attach a line here
that's<00:01:19.170> pulling<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.950> now<00:01:20.490> how<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.030> pointing

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
that's pulling up now how is it pointing

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.789 
that's pulling up now how is it pointing
out<00:01:21.390> well<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.840> not<00:01:21.930> exactly<00:01:22.049> pulling<00:01:22.650> up

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
out well it's not exactly pulling up

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.060 
out well it's not exactly pulling up
what<00:01:23.790> I've<00:01:23.880> done<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.330> route<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> line<00:01:25.439> over

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
what I've done is route the line over

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.640 
what I've done is route the line over
the<00:01:26.220> top<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:27.030> back<00:01:27.540> underneath<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.290> attached

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the top and back underneath and attached

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.200 
the top and back underneath and attached
it<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.180> this<00:01:30.180> side<00:01:30.450> where<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.500> can't<00:01:31.770> move<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
it to this side where it can't move and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.520 
it to this side where it can't move and
I've<00:01:33.210> tension<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> line<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.990> everything<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
I've tension the line and everything and

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.090 
I've tension the line and everything and
what's<00:01:35.100> doing<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.210> keeping<00:01:36.630> this

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
what's doing is it's keeping this

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.270 
what's doing is it's keeping this
sagging<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.990> dropping<00:01:39.990> which<00:01:40.500> eliminates

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
sagging and dropping which eliminates

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.850 
sagging and dropping which eliminates
all<00:01:41.540> my<00:01:42.540> failed<00:01:42.840> prints<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.350> everything<00:01:43.680> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
all my failed prints and everything and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.789 
all my failed prints and everything and
what<00:01:44.729> happens<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.450> when<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.840> side<00:01:46.079> moves<00:01:46.590> up

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
what happens is when this side moves up

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.429 
what happens is when this side moves up
it's<00:01:47.310> pulling<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.420> line<00:01:48.689> which<00:01:49.259> in

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
it's pulling up on this line which in

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.160 
it's pulling up on this line which in
turn<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:50.189> pulling<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.299> side<00:01:51.600> because

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
turn is pulling up on this side because

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.200 
turn is pulling up on this side because
there's<00:01:52.500> nothing<00:01:52.829> down<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.729> keep<00:01:53.909> from

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
there's nothing down here to keep from

adjustments<00:04:07.680> what<00:04:08.370> can<00:04:08.579> make<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.150> big

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
adjustments what can make a big

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.439 
adjustments what can make a big
difference<00:04:09.569> on<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.109> so<00:04:10.709> I've<00:04:10.979> got<00:04:11.190> it

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:11.449 
difference on this so I've got it

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.520 
difference on this so I've got it
basically<00:04:12.449> perfect<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:13.019> everything<00:04:13.229> works

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
basically perfect and everything works

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.770 
basically perfect and everything works
just<00:04:13.650> fine<00:04:13.979> I'm<00:04:14.940> right<00:04:15.239> now<00:04:15.269> in<00:04:15.419> the<00:04:15.599> process

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
just fine I'm right now in the process

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.990 
just fine I'm right now in the process
of<00:04:16.079> making<00:04:16.320> some<00:04:16.530> 3d<00:04:16.949> files<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.549> anyone

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
of making some 3d files so that anyone

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.289 
of making some 3d files so that anyone
can<00:04:18.299> 3d<00:04:18.570> print<00:04:19.250> some<00:04:20.250> pulley<00:04:20.549> holders<00:04:21.000> and

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
can 3d print some pulley holders and

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.360 
can 3d print some pulley holders and
just<00:04:21.570> attach<00:04:21.959> it<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.860> top<00:04:22.979> of<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.190> printer

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
just attach it to the top of the printer

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.040 
just attach it to the top of the printer
you'll<00:04:23.760> have<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.030> drill<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.270> few<00:04:24.360> holes<00:04:24.750> but<00:04:24.990> I

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
you'll have to drill a few holes but I

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.890 
you'll have to drill a few holes but I
think

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
think

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.909 
think
that's<00:04:26.229> a<00:04:26.530> fair<00:04:27.400> deal<00:04:27.930> in<00:04:28.930> exchange<00:04:29.110> for<00:04:29.650> high

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
that's a fair deal in exchange for high

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.040 
that's a fair deal in exchange for high
quality<00:04:29.979> prints<00:04:30.639> the<00:04:31.210> one<00:04:31.419> thing<00:04:31.780> that's<00:04:31.930> a

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
quality prints the one thing that's a

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.430 
quality prints the one thing that's a
challenge<00:04:32.380> with<00:04:32.770> this<00:04:32.919> is<00:04:33.280> as<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:33.699> can<00:04:33.759> see

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
challenge with this is as you can see

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.310 
challenge with this is as you can see
the<00:04:35.440> pulleys<00:04:35.770> aren't<00:04:36.100> aren't<00:04:37.050> parallel<00:04:38.050> to

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
the pulleys aren't aren't parallel to

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.340 
the pulleys aren't aren't parallel to
each<00:04:38.410> other<00:04:38.530> they're<00:04:38.800> actually<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.100> task<00:04:39.550> you

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
each other they're actually a task you

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.450 
each other they're actually a task you
just<00:04:41.350> because<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.770> way<00:04:41.860> this<00:04:42.009> carriage<00:04:42.340> is

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
just because the way this carriage is

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.240 
just because the way this carriage is
designed<00:04:43.350> so<00:04:44.350> I'm<00:04:44.680> gonna<00:04:44.860> have<00:04:44.979> to<00:04:45.070> take<00:04:45.220> that

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
designed so I'm gonna have to take that

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.580 
designed so I'm gonna have to take that
into<00:04:45.400> account<00:04:45.610> in<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.090> 3d<00:04:46.419> models<00:04:46.810> but<00:04:47.350> um

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
into account in the 3d models but um

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.010 
into account in the 3d models but um
that<00:04:48.520> should<00:04:48.789> be<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:48.880> simple<00:04:49.090> fix<00:04:49.240> as<00:04:49.810> far<00:04:49.990> as

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
that should be a simple fix as far as

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.860 
that should be a simple fix as far as
I'm<00:04:50.199> concerned<00:04:50.639> but<00:04:51.639> yeah<00:04:51.880> this<00:04:52.360> is<00:04:52.509> a<00:04:52.539> fairly

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
I'm concerned but yeah this is a fairly

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.960 
I'm concerned but yeah this is a fairly
simple<00:04:53.050> mod<00:04:53.350> that<00:04:53.590> I<00:04:53.650> feel<00:04:53.889> like<00:04:54.039> cube<00:04:54.669> should

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
simple mod that I feel like cube should

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.210 
simple mod that I feel like cube should
actually<00:04:55.120> have<00:04:55.449> done<00:04:55.660> themselves<00:04:55.900> or<00:04:56.470> at

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
actually have done themselves or at

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.670 
actually have done themselves or at
least<00:04:57.490> added<00:04:57.880> another<00:04:58.090> we'd<00:04:58.389> screw<00:04:58.690> that

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
least added another we'd screw that

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.750 
least added another we'd screw that
would<00:04:59.830> have<00:04:59.919> been<00:04:59.979> an<00:05:00.340> easier<00:05:00.970> fix<00:05:01.240> than<00:05:01.570> this

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
would have been an easier fix than this

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.210 
would have been an easier fix than this
just<00:05:03.760> at<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.090> get-go<00:05:04.300> but<00:05:04.770> you<00:05:05.770> know<00:05:05.860> even<00:05:06.010> if

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
just at the get-go but you know even if

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.379 
just at the get-go but you know even if
they<00:05:06.310> had<00:05:06.460> just<00:05:06.490> come<00:05:06.729> up<00:05:06.820> with<00:05:06.940> a<00:05:06.970> system<00:05:07.150> like

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
they had just come up with a system like

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.330 
they had just come up with a system like
this<00:05:07.690> this<00:05:07.900> would<00:05:08.020> have<00:05:08.139> probably<00:05:08.350> saved<00:05:08.710> them

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
this this would have probably saved them

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.939 
this this would have probably saved them
so<00:05:09.639> many<00:05:09.760> questions<00:05:10.240> so<00:05:10.449> many<00:05:10.479> tickets<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:11.889> a

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
so many questions so many tickets and a

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.000 
so many questions so many tickets and a
lot<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.460> people<00:05:12.580> a<00:05:12.880> lot<00:05:12.910> of<00:05:13.120> hassle<00:05:13.680> no<00:05:14.680> gluing

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
lot of people a lot of hassle no gluing

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.710 
lot of people a lot of hassle no gluing
especially<00:05:15.550> I'm<00:05:15.669> not<00:05:15.789> a<00:05:15.820> big<00:05:16.000> fan<00:05:16.030> of<00:05:16.240> gluing

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
especially I'm not a big fan of gluing

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.320 
especially I'm not a big fan of gluing
you<00:05:17.530> know<00:05:17.620> massive<00:05:18.250> amount<00:05:18.490> of<00:05:18.550> ports<00:05:18.880> I<00:05:19.120> like

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
you know massive amount of ports I like

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.990 
you know massive amount of ports I like
to<00:05:19.449> be<00:05:19.539> able<00:05:19.599> to<00:05:19.720> take<00:05:19.870> things<00:05:19.990> apart<00:05:20.820> but<00:05:21.820> yeah

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
to be able to take things apart but yeah

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.909 
to be able to take things apart but yeah
it's<00:05:22.479> a<00:05:22.539> very<00:05:22.750> simple<00:05:22.930> mod<00:05:23.229> that<00:05:23.560> I<00:05:23.650> feel<00:05:23.800> like

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
it's a very simple mod that I feel like

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.240 
it's a very simple mod that I feel like
anyone<00:05:24.520> can<00:05:24.759> do<00:05:24.910> I'll<00:05:25.210> have<00:05:25.449> the<00:05:25.570> 3d<00:05:25.840> files<00:05:26.250> up

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
anyone can do I'll have the 3d files up

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.909 
anyone can do I'll have the 3d files up
sometime<00:05:27.729> soon<00:05:28.000> I'll<00:05:28.990> have<00:05:29.229> some<00:05:29.410> links<00:05:29.770> where

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
sometime soon I'll have some links where

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.650 
sometime soon I'll have some links where
you<00:05:29.949> can<00:05:30.070> get<00:05:30.250> all<00:05:30.370> the<00:05:30.460> parts<00:05:30.660> and<00:05:33.660> yeah

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
you can get all the parts and yeah

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.830 
you can get all the parts and yeah
that's<00:05:35.410> basically<00:05:35.500> it
