00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.760
 maybe this is a surprise for 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.070
 some of you but the way more 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.350
 fast and more effective to transform 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.380
 your body and start the process to 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.689
 burn fat 24 hours a day 7 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.749
 days a week is the training of 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.730
 force you did not think you could get in 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:24.650
 way by just running for hours and 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.560
 hours on the treadmill going to no 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.109
 side true our goal with the 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.689
 Strength training also known 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.850
 as an anaerobic exercise is to increase 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.829
 our muscle strength and add so much 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.620
 thin muscle conditioning like 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.949
 we can to our bodies because 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.440
 we want to add muscle well it turns out 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.809
 attractive when you look at it increases the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.149
 bone density something essential 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.309
 when we grow older a body 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.559
 muscular burns many more calories in 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.780
 I rest every day that a body with 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.050
 less muscle raising our rate 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.969
 basal metabolic this last fact is a 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.430
 extremely important secret for 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.620
 get the body you want 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.620
 only half a kilo more of muscle 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.050
 added to your body will require 40-50 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.100
 extra calories a day to continue with 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.740
 lifetime 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.050
 Imagine if we added 9 kilos of tissue 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.630
 Slim muscle automatically 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.280
 you would be burning around 800 to 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.530
 1000 additional calories per day 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.670
 sitting still watching television 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.610
 or at work 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.470
 likewise guess what happens when you're 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.140
 burning more calories than 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.020
 You need to maintain your current weight 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.060
 you have a calorie deficit and 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.630
 your body begins to shed the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.640
 fat plus the process of growth and 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.710
 repair that follows the exercise of 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.990
 resistance requires huge 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.990
 amounts of energy stored in the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.910
 calorie form now you know that you're going to 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.310
 burn many more calories and fat 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.369
 stored to develop your new 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.080
 strength and muscle in fact after that 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.720
 you finish a resistance training 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.450
 your body will use its stored fat 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.430
 for the repair process 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.550
 This is equivalent to burning body fat 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.610
 as crazy up to 48 hours after 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.980
 finished the exercise another concept 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.989
 important to understand with respect 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.910
 to strength training and development 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.980
 of muscle is that as you 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.420
 we grow old we lose muscle 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.459
 naturally 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.739
 have you ever observed that a man or 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.860
 a woman who has good condition 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.010
 physical during their 20s and 30s begin to 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.769
 gain weight in its 40s and more is gradual 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.230
 and before you know it, they look like 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.239
 if they had gained 9 kilos of fat 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.670
 overnight 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.860
 the muscle deterioration is huge the 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.569
 muscle deteriorates with age by 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.660
 every kilo of muscle that we lose 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.329
 we are burning 80 fewer calories each 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.720
 day your metabolic rate is going down 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:59.480
 right now to those add a period of 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.810
 years and you'll see why you accumulate fat 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.520
 as we get older it 's something 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.500
 unfortunately very easy to do 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.590
 although we can not prevent deterioration 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.780
 muscle we can certainly fight it 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.780
 adding so much thin muscle to 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.460
 our bodies as possible that is 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.590
 the reason why I train for 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.750
 get strength and build muscle 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.580
 thin conditioning is the stone 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.310
 angular to have the best condition 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.470
 physical for the rest of your life and that's 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.010
 the spark that ignites your fat burning 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.010
 all day
