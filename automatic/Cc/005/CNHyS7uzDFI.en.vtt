and there's some different containers
and<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:57.390> will<00:00:57.739> fry<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:59.390> let's<00:01:00.390> call<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.690> frying

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
and it will fry it let's call it frying

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.700 
and it will fry it let's call it frying
with<00:01:02.789> hardly<00:01:03.420> any<00:01:03.600> oil<00:01:03.899> which<00:01:04.320> makes<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
with hardly any oil which makes it a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.740 
with hardly any oil which makes it a
much<00:01:04.890> healthier<00:01:05.159> choice<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.540> going<00:01:06.689> to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
much healthier choice so it's going to

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.510 
much healthier choice so it's going to
cook<00:01:06.930> your<00:01:07.110> food<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.979> crisp<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.400> up

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
but very little oil if you choose to put

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.530 
but very little oil if you choose to put
any<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.250> let's<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.670> name<00:01:11.880> these<00:01:12.090> there's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
vive and it also has a digital readout

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.760 
vive and it also has a digital readout
when<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
when it's on and this is just the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.160 
when it's on and this is just the
airfryer<00:01:26.280> which<00:01:26.729> has<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.270> manual<00:01:27.720> control

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
airfryer which has your manual control

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.390 
airfryer which has your manual control
here<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.799> timer<00:01:29.070> here<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.509> these<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:32.130> can

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
here and a timer here so these you can

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.910 
here and a timer here so these you can
program<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.180> temperature<00:01:33.750> everything<00:01:34.200> from

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
program the temperature everything from

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.090 
program the temperature everything from
150<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.380> 390<00:01:38.479> these<00:01:39.680> typically<00:01:40.680> run

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
150 on up to 390 these typically run

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.730 
150 on up to 390 these typically run
colder<00:01:42.000> than<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> regular<00:01:42.720> convention<00:01:43.380> ovens

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
colder than a regular convention ovens

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.490 
colder than a regular convention ovens
by<00:01:44.280> about<00:01:44.490> twenty<00:01:44.850> thirty<00:01:45.030> degrees<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.380> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
by about twenty thirty degrees so you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.950 
by about twenty thirty degrees so you
can<00:01:46.619> program<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.369> temperature<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.450> want<00:01:48.689> and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
can program the temperature you want and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.230 
can program the temperature you want and
then<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:49.979> also<00:01:50.189> program<00:01:50.640> how<00:01:51.060> many

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
then you can also program how many

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.179 
then you can also program how many
minutes<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.689> want<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.320> run<00:01:52.530> for<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
minutes you want that to run for and

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.460 
minutes you want that to run for and
there's<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.630> manual<00:01:55.079> there<00:01:55.200> are<00:01:55.320> some

then<00:02:01.350> also<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.130> particular<00:02:02.369> machine

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
then also in this particular machine

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.069 
then also in this particular machine
which<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.670> larger<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.850> ones<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.899> can

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
which is the larger of the ones you can

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.350 
which is the larger of the ones you can
actually<00:02:07.380> program<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:08.220> time<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.119> a

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
actually program a time and a

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.559 
actually program a time and a
temperature<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> particular<00:02:11.310> recipe<00:02:12.120> that

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
temperature for a particular recipe that

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.760 
temperature for a particular recipe that
you<00:02:12.720> like<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.230> got

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
you like so you got

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.010 
you like so you got
mozzarella<00:02:14.280> sticks<00:02:14.580> your<00:02:14.790> jalapeno<00:02:15.510> poppers

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
mozzarella sticks your jalapeno poppers

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.500 
mozzarella sticks your jalapeno poppers
you<00:02:16.230> know<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.590> they<00:02:16.710> run<00:02:16.890> at<00:02:17.070> about<00:02:17.160> 6<00:02:17.520> 350

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
you know that they run at about 6 350

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.170 
you know that they run at about 6 350
360<00:02:19.140> degrees<00:02:19.650> for<00:02:20.400> 10<00:02:20.580> minutes<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.970> can

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
360 degrees for 10 minutes you can

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.300 
360 degrees for 10 minutes you can
program<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.230> access<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.710> right

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
program that in and access that right

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.240 
program that in and access that right
here<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.090> then<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.170> push<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.980> it

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
here and then you push this and it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.970 
here and then you push this and it
starts<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.750> whatever<00:02:28.050> was<00:02:28.290> programmed<00:02:28.770> in

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
starts so whatever was programmed in

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.340 
starts so whatever was programmed in
there<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.490> what's<00:02:29.790> running<00:02:30.180> right<00:02:30.360> now<00:02:30.540> you

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
there is what's running right now you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.100 
there is what's running right now you
can<00:02:31.530> preheat<00:02:31.770> this<00:02:32.220> for<00:02:32.430> about<00:02:32.550> three<00:02:32.850> minutes

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
can preheat this for about three minutes

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.150 
can preheat this for about three minutes
five<00:02:34.110> minutes<00:02:34.170> whatever<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.070> will

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
five minutes whatever it is it will

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.830 
five minutes whatever it is it will
preheat<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:35.850> it'll<00:02:35.970> ding<00:02:36.240> when<00:02:36.450> it's<00:02:36.600> ready

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
preheat and it'll ding when it's ready

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.170 
preheat and it'll ding when it's ready
and<00:02:37.020> then<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.250> can<00:02:38.430> put<00:02:38.580> your<00:02:38.610> product<00:02:39.090> in

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
and then you can put your product in

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.860 
and then you can put your product in
there<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.840> cook<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:41.490> particular<00:02:41.970> one<00:02:42.390> is

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
there and cook this particular one is

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
kebabs whatever it is this is a little

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.700 
kebabs whatever it is this is a little
bit<00:02:53.610> different<00:02:53.940> as<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.300> this<00:02:54.480> tray<00:02:54.870> stays

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
bit different as in this tray stays

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.680 
bit different as in this tray stays
attached<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.520> machine<00:02:56.820> but<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.210> does<00:02:57.390> come

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
attached to the machine but it does come

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.910 
attached to the machine but it does come
out<00:02:57.810> like<00:02:57.990> that<00:02:58.200> for<00:02:58.560> washing<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:01.500> that's<00:03:01.710> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
out like that for washing so that's the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.980 
out like that for washing so that's the
biggest<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.550> units<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.120> one<00:03:03.450> also<00:03:03.630> has<00:03:03.810> a

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
biggest of the units this one also has a

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.820 
biggest of the units this one also has a
vent<00:03:04.800> bulbous<00:03:05.760> on<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.060> back<00:03:06.240> here<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:07.590> one

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
vent bulbous on the back here this one

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.860 
vent bulbous on the back here this one
here<00:03:08.280> again<00:03:09.200> temperatures<00:03:11.480> right<00:03:12.480> down<00:03:12.660> to

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
here again temperatures right down to

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.810 
here again temperatures right down to
the<00:03:12.960> 150<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.590> same<00:03:13.770> temperature<00:03:14.130> range<00:03:14.580> and

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
the 150 the same temperature range and

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.030 
the 150 the same temperature range and
let's<00:03:15.750> say<00:03:15.960> now<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.350> want<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:16.860> go<00:03:17.010> for<00:03:19.040> 3

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
let's say now you want to go for 3

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.740 
let's say now you want to go for 3
minutes<00:03:20.250> now<00:03:20.670> you're<00:03:21.000> at<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.390> temperature

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
minutes now you're at that temperature

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.380 
minutes now you're at that temperature
that<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.140> set<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.440> for<00:03:22.650> 3<00:03:22.950> minutes<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.490> it'll

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
that I set it for 3 minutes and it'll

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.170 
that I set it for 3 minutes and it'll
run<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.410> then<00:03:25.650> back<00:03:25.830> off<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.370> does<00:03:26.730> not<00:03:26.940> have

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
run and then back off it does not have

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.310 
run and then back off it does not have
the<00:03:27.300> memory<00:03:27.600> like<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:27.810> one<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.530> also<00:03:29.390> has<00:03:30.390> the

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
the memory like that one it also has the

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.400 
the memory like that one it also has the
tray<00:03:31.590> in<00:03:31.830> here<00:03:32.310> which<00:03:32.670> is<00:03:34.280> 1.85<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.230> comes

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
tray in here which is 1.85 and it comes

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.530 
tray in here which is 1.85 and it comes
out<00:03:37.500> like<00:03:37.740> that<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.670> also<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.510> a

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
out like that and this also is a

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.500 
out like that and this also is a
separate<00:03:39.990> unit<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.910> little<00:03:41.910> bit<00:03:42.000> smaller<00:03:42.300> as

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
separate unit a little bit smaller as

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.550 
separate unit a little bit smaller as
you<00:03:42.540> can<00:03:42.810> see<00:03:45.020> and<00:03:46.020> then<00:03:46.730> this<00:03:47.730> one<00:03:48.320> it's<00:03:49.320> just

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
you can see and then this one it's just

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.500 
you can see and then this one it's just
the<00:03:49.650> basic<00:03:50.040> unit<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.730> set<00:03:51.120> your<00:03:51.330> temperature

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
the basic unit you set your temperature

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.170 
the basic unit you set your temperature
right<00:03:52.080> here<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.620> then<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.459> turn<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.700> on<00:03:53.910> right

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
right here and then you turn it on right

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.600 
right here and then you turn it on right
here<00:03:54.290> this<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.470> timer<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.459> runs

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
here this is a timer and it runs

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.390 
here this is a timer and it runs
backwards<00:03:59.959> 1.6<00:04:00.959> or<00:04:01.200> so<00:04:01.500> on<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:01.980> inside<00:04:02.370> a

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
backwards 1.6 or so on the inside a

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.310 
backwards 1.6 or so on the inside a
little<00:04:02.640> bit<00:04:03.030> smaller<00:04:03.300> than<00:04:03.600> that<00:04:03.780> one<00:04:03.959> but<00:04:04.170> not

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
little bit smaller than that one but not

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.070 
little bit smaller than that one but not
a<00:04:04.350> lot<00:04:04.620> again<00:04:05.250> same<00:04:05.850> idea<00:04:05.880> these<00:04:06.870> are<00:04:06.990> all
