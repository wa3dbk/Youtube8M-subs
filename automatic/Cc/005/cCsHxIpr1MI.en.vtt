 we open it and before doing everything 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.970
 read this 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.110
 look 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.480

 and models of our gta san andreas 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.240
 I do not do that security thing because 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.660
 I have 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.520

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.400
 and once they have made the copy of 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:07.440

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:10.740

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.550
