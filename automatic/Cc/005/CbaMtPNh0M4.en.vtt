00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
msi does not want to boot up so look at

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.950 
msi does not want to boot up so look at
this

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
this

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.100 
this
so<00:00:34.350> i'm<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:34.469> going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.710> switch<00:00:34.920> off<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.190> PC

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
so i'm just going to switch off the PC

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.380 
so i'm just going to switch off the PC
right<00:00:37.110> now<00:00:37.350> it's<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.280> BIOS<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:39.059> got<00:00:39.239> as

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
right now it's on the BIOS it's got as

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.979 
right now it's on the BIOS it's got as
auto<00:00:39.860> in<00:00:40.860> terms<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.280> selection<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:42.149> display

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
auto in terms of selection of display

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.650 
auto in terms of selection of display
now<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.100> were<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.489> go<00:00:44.700> start<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:47.480> get<00:00:48.480> into

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
now if I were to go start up get into

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.959 
now if I were to go start up get into
the<00:00:48.750> BIOS<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.289> put<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.530> GPU<00:00:49.980> which<00:00:50.640> would<00:00:50.850> be

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the BIOS and put a GPU which would be

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.660 
the BIOS and put a GPU which would be
the<00:00:51.090> primary<00:00:51.420> display<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the primary display for the for the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.439 
the primary display for the for the
graphics<00:00:54.059> card<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:57.980> let's<00:00:58.980> go<00:00:59.699> they're<00:00:59.969> there

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
graphics card so let's go they're there

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.540 
graphics card so let's go they're there
as<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.410> see<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.859> don't<00:01:02.250> know<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.489> can

as you can see I don't know if you can

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.549 
as you can see I don't know if you can
see<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.760> auto<00:01:03.120> auto<00:01:03.420> enabled<00:01:03.989> enabled<00:01:04.379> so

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
see it auto auto enabled enabled so

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.850 
see it auto auto enabled enabled so
primary<00:01:04.949> display<00:01:05.189> auto<00:01:05.750> if<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.930> put<00:01:07.140> PCIe<00:01:07.560> it

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
primary display auto if I put PCIe it

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.590 
primary display auto if I put PCIe it
has<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> same<00:01:08.220> thing<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.640> let's<00:01:08.820> go<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.090> GP<00:01:09.360> you

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
what I do it's always going to do it so

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.540 
what I do it's always going to do it so
right<00:02:18.750> now<00:02:18.930> as<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.200> can<00:02:19.290> see<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.740> work<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.310> it

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
right now as you can see it work and it

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.790 
right now as you can see it work and it
boots<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.630> can<00:02:21.750> see<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:22.140> am<00:02:22.470> on<00:02:22.500> the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
boots and you can see I am on the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.170 
boots and you can see I am on the
desktop<00:02:23.190> right<00:02:23.370> now<00:02:23.490> I'm<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.760> going<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.910> sign

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
desktop right now I'm just going to sign

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.330 
desktop right now I'm just going to sign
in<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:24.990> I've<00:02:25.110> stupids<00:02:25.530> Microsoft<00:02:26.070> things

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
in because I've stupids Microsoft things

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.370 
in because I've stupids Microsoft things
I<00:02:26.580> need<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:27.030> don't<00:02:27.120> want<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.420> show<00:02:27.540> my<00:02:27.750> name<00:02:28.110> or

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
I need I don't want to show my name or

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:41.180 
I need I don't want to show my name or

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
my email so boot up takes its time come

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.470 
my email so boot up takes its time come
on<00:02:44.510> still<00:02:45.510> waiting<00:02:45.870> for<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.140> log<00:02:46.350> on

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
on still waiting for it to log on

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.540 
on still waiting for it to log on
anytime<00:02:48.480> now

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.610 

but<00:02:53.550> yeah<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.940> problem<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.420> there<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.230> go<00:02:55.320> I'm

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
but yeah the problem is there you go I'm

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.220 
but yeah the problem is there you go I'm
into<00:02:55.860> desktop<00:02:56.070> as<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.910> can<00:02:57.060> see<00:02:57.209> look<00:02:58.019> at<00:02:58.140> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
into desktop as you can see look at the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.670 
into desktop as you can see look at the
dual<00:02:58.440> monitor<00:02:58.920> display<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.850> speak<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.680> so

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
dual monitor display so to speak and so

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.620 
dual monitor display so to speak and so
essentially<00:03:02.190> when<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.519> want<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.820> go<00:03:02.970> buy<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.150> PC

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
essentially when I want to go buy a PC

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.530 
essentially when I want to go buy a PC
i'ii<00:03:04.370> ieave<00:03:05.370> i<00:03:05.550> my<00:03:05.730> graphics<00:03:06.150> cards<00:03:06.420> my

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
a GPU graphics i cannot do so because

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.380 
a GPU graphics i cannot do so because
windows<00:03:13.380> 10<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:13.739> retarded<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.730> again<00:03:15.180> i'm

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
windows 10 is retarded so again i'm

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.880 
windows 10 is retarded so again i'm
going<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.660> show<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.170> i'm<00:03:16.410> going<00:03:16.800> to

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
going to show you this i'm going to

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.040 
going to show you this i'm going to
switch<00:03:17.130> off<00:03:17.400> my<00:03:17.459> pc<00:03:18.060> as<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.390> can<00:03:18.510> see<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.690> am<00:03:18.959> on

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
switch off my pc as you can see I am on

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.110 
switch off my pc as you can see I am on
Windows<00:03:19.440> 10<00:03:19.730> right<00:03:20.730> there<00:03:22.670> there<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:23.760> go

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
Windows 10 right there there you go

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.699 
Windows 10 right there there you go
so<00:03:24.900> now<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.050> am<00:03:25.290> going<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.500> shut<00:03:25.769> off<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:25.920> PC<00:03:26.570> and

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
so now I am going to shut off the PC and

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.660 
so now I am going to shut off the PC and
then<00:03:28.709> I'm<00:03:28.830> going<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.010> start<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.370> back<00:03:29.489> up<00:03:30.080> and

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
then I'm going to start it back up and

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.100 
then I'm going to start it back up and
this<00:03:32.670> time<00:03:32.730> I'm<00:03:33.120> going<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.269> put<00:03:33.450> but<00:03:33.570> I<00:03:33.750> want<00:03:34.050> to

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
this time I'm going to put but I want to

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.620 
this time I'm going to put but I want to
put<00:03:34.230> PCIe<00:03:34.769> as<00:03:35.130> my<00:03:35.519> primary<00:03:35.790> display<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:36.390> again

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
put PCIe as my primary display so again

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.290 
put PCIe as my primary display so again
I've<00:03:36.780> got<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:37.080> GPU<00:03:37.500> down<00:03:37.739> there<00:03:38.010> PCIe<00:03:38.760> up<00:03:39.090> there

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
I've got a GPU down there PCIe up there

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.360 
I've got a GPU down there PCIe up there
that's<00:03:39.450> my<00:03:39.570> graphics<00:03:39.989> card<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.320> that's<00:03:40.920> my

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
that's my graphics card and that's my

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.900 
that's my graphics card and that's my
inbuilt<00:03:41.880> graphics<00:03:42.600> card<00:03:42.810> on<00:03:42.930> my<00:03:43.110> Intel<00:03:43.910> three

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
inbuilt graphics card on my Intel three

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.479 
inbuilt graphics card on my Intel three
seven<00:03:45.209> seven<00:03:45.360> okay<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.410> tight<00:03:46.950> on<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.160> PC

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
seven seven okay so tight on the PC

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.320 
seven seven okay so tight on the PC
again<00:03:48.380> that's<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.590> GPU<00:03:50.190> over<00:03:50.489> there<00:03:50.670> again

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
again that's the I GPU over there again

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.199 
again that's the I GPU over there again
it<00:03:52.290> should<00:03:52.590> be<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.860> default<00:03:53.030> monitor<00:03:54.030> at<00:03:54.120> the

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
it should be the default monitor at the

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.199 
it should be the default monitor at the
moment<00:03:54.510> because<00:03:54.630> it's<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.560> GPU<00:03:56.220> is<00:03:56.459> selected<00:03:57.120> as

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
moment because it's a GPU is selected as

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.550 
moment because it's a GPU is selected as
default<00:03:59.090> so<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.270> can<00:04:00.390> see<00:04:00.510> BIOS<00:04:00.990> is<00:04:01.230> at<00:04:01.500> the

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
default so you can see BIOS is at the

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.030 
default so you can see BIOS is at the
bottom<00:04:01.830> screw

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
bottom screw

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.740 
bottom screw
of<00:04:02.159> them<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.180> am<00:04:03.420> going<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:03.629> go<00:04:03.719> to<00:04:04.640> their

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
of them so I am going to go to their

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.190 
of them so I am going to go to their
graphics<00:04:06.750> options<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.409> now<00:04:07.680> change<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.159> PCIe

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
graphics options and now change to PCIe

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.509 
graphics options and now change to PCIe
now<00:04:10.200> I'm<00:04:10.290> going<00:04:10.439> to<00:04:10.500> go<00:04:10.620> save<00:04:11.069> and<00:04:11.370> make

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
now I'm going to go save and make

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.179 
now I'm going to go save and make
changes<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:12.750> now<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:13.349> primary<00:04:13.739> display<00:04:13.920> will

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
changes so now the primary display will

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.550 
changes so now the primary display will
be<00:04:14.219> PCIe<00:04:14.790> which<00:04:15.569> will<00:04:15.780> come<00:04:16.019> up<00:04:16.169> from<00:04:16.440> the

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
be PCIe which will come up from the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.460 
be PCIe which will come up from the
primary<00:04:16.979> display<00:04:17.220> which<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.699> my<00:04:17.910> UNIX<00:04:18.780> monitor

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
primary display which is my UNIX monitor

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.090 
primary display which is my UNIX monitor
up<00:04:19.650> there<00:04:19.919> which<00:04:20.639> is<00:04:20.729> connected<00:04:21.120> by<00:04:21.239> DVI<00:04:22.009> so<00:04:23.009> as

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
up there which is connected by DVI so as

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.830 
up there which is connected by DVI so as
you<00:04:23.190> can<00:04:23.280> see<00:04:23.340> right<00:04:23.669> now<00:04:23.850> it's<00:04:24.150> booting<00:04:24.720> up

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
you can see right now it's booting up

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.499 
you can see right now it's booting up
now<00:04:25.710> just<00:04:25.949> bear<00:04:26.250> this<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.610> mind<00:04:26.639> look<00:04:27.150> I'm<00:04:27.449> just

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
now just bear this in mind look I'm just
