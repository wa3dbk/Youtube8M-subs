that child good vision in both eyes for
a<00:01:56.399> hundred<00:01:56.700> years<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.270> think<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.439> most

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
a hundred years I think the most

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.679 
a hundred years I think the most
important<00:01:59.460> thing<00:01:59.490> when<00:01:59.820> meeting<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.180> child<00:02:00.450> is

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
important thing when meeting a child is

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.530 
important thing when meeting a child is
to<00:02:01.469> address<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.640> child<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.390> most

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
to address the child as the most

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.990 
to address the child as the most
