 bernardo before diego alves and jucilei 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.820
 if I'm not mistaken, it's the ones I 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.980
 I know 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.020
 right at the very beginning of the game and the site 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.100
 crossed the line to osvaldo taboão 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.410
 making goal 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.500
 There I die, you do not play ball. 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.600
 far gone with her by the hand 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.510
 I just stole the ball with the sandro 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.160
 left the defender in longing afterwards 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.500
 left before 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.409
 I sent for rain as I usually do. 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.140
 to say is that there a big toe in the corner already 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.570
 making 1-0 for us is 15 minutes 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.210
 very good thing and then to change one 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.090
 little in the routine the guy is done 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.860
 the back of the back and scored a goal 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.990
 rebound 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.180
 I left out in the face of the goal and the guy 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.650
 gets very very very nervous in front 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.890
 The goal is not to see him there. 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.540
 Calm number of the world beat 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.610
 in goal 2 to 1 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.619
 then I tried to get the ball out there the duck 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.420
 came all the way 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.970
 I got the ball again and I tried 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.640
 take the ball now, do it this way 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.189
 being in favor and the ball left for the guy 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.439
 again 2 to 1 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.530
 the guy does not score and who does not 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.570
 people know have a saying that takes 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.380
 the disenchantment in the last 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.299
 departures 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.149
 took advantage to make the second goal 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.850
 I played in the goalie then I did 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.680
 a bullshit there almost renato 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.530
 augusto made the goal of our great media 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.770
 buddy and I do not even know the name of the guy 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.229
 right but beauty there I threw it or the side 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.340
 have hatch to have unfortunately had to 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.260
 ball did not come in 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.269
 Assad does not hit too much 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.579
 well on the ball, right but it was more the fault 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:21.299
 my than something else I know that 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:23.310
 He left there, he tried to kick 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.739
 the ball took in the hand of the goalkeeper the goalkeeper 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.019
 got the ball in reality and I ended up 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.659
 slapping mirallas and vermalen 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:34.049
 who is an excellent quarterback 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.739
 Very well, I was there to expand the people. 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.260
 to 1 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.769
 And then he came from that kick is mine. 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.319
 I almost did not leave the place there, I ended up giving 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.989
 this step also afterwards to the 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.640
 arrival of a big toe that he biriba 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.599
 I tried to make a foul goal with him 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.920
 but also he hit badly and then 85 through 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.510
 that opened the door 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.540
 launched in gossip and hoping 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.530
 waiting who came the osvaldo nodded in the 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:05.069
 Goalkeeper's counterpart 5 11 87 had time 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.769
 The more you play, the more you play. 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.840
 big the steering wheel kicked the keeper there 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.139
 trying to get to you by the guy's bay 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.980
 and the ball entered 6 to 1 and to close the 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.870
 coffin 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.709
 I threw him on the touch of 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.870
 class to make 7 to 1 the 90 minutes and 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.669
 guarantee our victory 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.160
 very good very important victory 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:29.730
 because we are going to win the 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.579
 title and boast there 9.9 that's what the 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.609
 balance 560 million 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.099
 a victory of the title and there already coming back 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:41.099
 our club has our barbarism 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.720
 place of the osvaldo and our matador who 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.030
 we will take this team it's kind 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.370
 haunted in with extraordinary remy 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.500
 front very fast 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.810
 Let's see how we got there by bush. 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.660
 at three minutes throwing a bullet 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.239
 appeared there for already tried the mark 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.459
 He could not do it and then I played 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.220
 mirallas experience in marabá the guy 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.199
 picked up went ahead of the defender 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.780
 dominated did what he wanted and ended up beating 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.680
 of plaque to open the board for people 1 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.840
 to 0 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.849
 I then went from this release to 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.340
 the debate with said the goal the defender 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.099
 took the ball but it looks like it has a magnet 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.039
 on the foot of the guy, and ended up 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:22.440
 people 2 to 0 and then the guy came kicked 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:26.600
 felipe bublitz lab rebound got 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:30.740
 hold and then at 32 he kicked 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.330
 and another rebound is not complaining about rebounds 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.160
 while I do too but I stayed 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.590
 very brave and take rebound goal 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.060
 although in that game the guy had me 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.580
 attacking and had two 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.800
 chances we made the goals there and 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.230
 then make the guy he even had 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.100
 this excellent opportunity that the round 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.660
 got to take away that if not already 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.840
 given to draw even in the first 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.750
 time we went to the second time he 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.660
 attacking another opportunity to the 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.240
 It was there and then he said he did not give it 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.520
 and we have to attack a little too the 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.380
 the açaí managed to head the 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.240
 Check that got the ball in here. 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.660
 goal and kick and the ball did not go 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.180
 also then I crossed the area and who 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.030
 appeared was the great vermalen cabeciou 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.690
 was not good at first but at second 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.540
 you can guarantee there 3 to 1 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.180
 from bag in very good defender wins 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.890
 several balls by the height and weight of this 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.740
 cut this left you even with 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:34.880
 mirallas for him to cross again and who 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:37.370
 was there to say in 41 to us people book 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.960
 Our face there, the game was very difficult. 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.760
 why are we making two goals 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.750

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.060
 angry né 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:48.620
 we ended up doing 4 to 1 after 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:52.640
 mirallas threw there pro of nanny do the 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.950
 hatch trick from him 5 to 1 and also the 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.530
 paulinho must follow dan harris if he throws 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.840
 and look that goes through the goalkeeper who 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.480
 side up I put replay and thamy that

 on the ball good side the important thing 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.550
