 preparation for the match tomorrow 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.520
 before the striped chivas of guadalajara 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.680
 where by the way josé jesús corona 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.090
 trained normally with the box 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.500

 giménez and of course it was tackled 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.690
 on the subject national team in 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.039
 Within hours will be announced the 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.989
 chepo convened by the 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.370
 tower for him during ivory coast and 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.890
 chaco giménez could be one of the 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.690
 men that appears in this list 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.350
 I am a person 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.530
 very correct 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.800
 and it's not going to change my way of being 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.390
 I'm really going to dedicate myself to work 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.640
 I have to be better every day on the cross 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.620
 blue and to have a chance to 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.870
 selection and if that opportunity comes 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.329
 I will try to take advantage of it is a moment 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.090
 where 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:05.260
 I would like to be 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.850
 to help if it's my turn to help I'm going to 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.150
 help where I belong and if not 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.920
 also being a fan more really is 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.979
 a moment where we have to support 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.630
 between all and take forward all by 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.010
 true gentlemen the chaco says that it is not 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.020
 the lion mesi that will not be a revulsive 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.280
 for this Mexican national team and 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.260
 that is not required in addition to be 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.520
 naturalized in this that could be your 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.520
 first call to national team 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.030
 I really am one more player of the bunch 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.700
 so really if it's my turn to be 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.210
 called I will go with the same expectation 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:44.230
 that I did for 14 years my career 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.940
 to add to give joy to the group of 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.940
 when you have to concentrate 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.560
 will push the team 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.090
 welcome to and commitment the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.090
 commitment is a letter of introduction 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.040
 mine and that I will keep it until the day 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.640
 make it my last football match 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.280
 and it seems that no no is not logical 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.020
 I am Mexican like everyone else and 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.260
 because they are going to demand more from me than from 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.620
 the others I think is not fair but 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.740
 really if it's your opinion do not think 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.330
 that way I respect him and nothing else 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.830
 finally from lady I tell you that 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.170
 blue cross has sent a statement 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.330
 where he asks that teófilo gutiérrez that 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.670
 the Colombian returns to Mexico for 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.380
 report immediately with the machine 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.510
 celeste this because the river plate is not 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.760
 he paid the money he owed to Cruz Azul 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.440
 for the transfer of the Colombian player 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.020
 who by the way was also not summoned 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.670
 already by his national coach for the 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.920
 fifa date ie it's raining 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.060
 on wet to teófilo gutiérrez sir 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.140
 that is the report that I have them 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.090
 I send a greeting very good afternoon 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.739

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.739
