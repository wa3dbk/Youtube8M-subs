00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.720
 kept under cover transportation 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:13.520
 studies show that more than 80% of the heat enters the house through the roof 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.740
 happens because before the day the roof hit and by the flight of more than 70 degrees 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.169
 centigrade 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.329
 This occurs both for concrete shingles 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.659
 as for ceramic tiles 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:32.579
 so the roof transmits heat into the house on account of 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.570
 action 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.620
 are invisible commands from the radio or microwave and despite 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.090
 harmlessly we traverse almost all of the beautiful materials to enhance the interior of the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.030
 house and its occupants 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.050
 same concrete slab 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.290
 It is very common in Brazilian cases what lies on the descent and 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.090
 radiate heat into the house during the afternoon and evening when 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.540
 should be fresh the solution to this problem is the advantage and 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.410
 undercoat which is produced with true aluminum 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.430
 polished high purity 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.760
 the only material 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.700
 which has the property of reflecting up to 95% of these heat waves you already 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.600
 stopped to think because his thermos bottle in aluminum inside 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.030
 moreover the flash can still choose is a protection for your roof against 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.290
 the entrance of water over event 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.190
 and also protect against pop entry in the dry months 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.270
 in the winter months when the heat tends to come from inside the house to the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.960
 exterior 'check out the fashion opportunities keep the heat inside the house 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.460
 beto can not wait 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.670
 pure summer and more comfortable in winter 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.680
 I dictate the installation of transport 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.360
 must be made prior to pickup 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.950
 after installed 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.820
 no clay 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.620
 these tips and other forms from the bottom up on the roof 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.450
 if the version of an aluminum phase is used, recom- 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.509
 sleep inside the house 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:20.439
 this ministry attributes of dirt with the time of the beatles Sergio is 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.439
 view of soil reflection during installation 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:32.089
 diogo the minimum overlap 20 transport sheets is that 10 centimeters 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:33.219
 between the sea 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.649
 but another 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:39.069
 Diogo sits on the ceiling from the bottom to the top of the roof. 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.850
 overlapping was such that an eventual return of water 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.850
 had left the eaves without entering the house 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.539
 on cairo should be applied 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:03:01.659
 thin tip that is nothing more than an up brigade along the cairo 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.150
 to facilitate the installation of transport before cutting a kick 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.040
 against kaytto in the following five meters and 10 centimeters this allows 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.469
 trainee employers died 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.909
 as it is installed 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.979
 occupied between docks of the port has three functions during the installation had to 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:26.859
 bruise can not walk without falling 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.359
 and without ruining 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.749
 the port furthermore 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.400
 he created an opening for the air intake 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.559
 so win by the derale for integration of the roof 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.029
 because finally against cairo and admits that a drip water bill skirt 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:47.029
 by the real without watering all the victims 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:56.059
 the situation formally preached on the counter ramp and the TVs are seated 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.129
 normally 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.820
 it is not recommended passed 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.639
 this was the day of the year the roof production 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.169
 covering the bottom line and there 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.929
 you should leave a forum opening 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:15.309
 about 2 5 to 3 centimeters at this point to allow ventilation 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.309
 from the roof by the bottom line and spigot 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:19.919
 made with 8 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.139
 The upper figs allow the hot and humid air to escape from the roof to the 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.139
 entry of dry and fresh air by the 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.749
 Earl There is a window of the bus got to transtur city 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:36.070
 ledger died 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.960
 can be cut in that region 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.139
 using 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.719
 with a stylus 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:46.460
 this allows the entrance of light without compromising with the thermal comfort
