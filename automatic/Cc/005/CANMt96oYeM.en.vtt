training the video you just saw though I

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.400 
training the video you just saw though I
mean<00:02:11.019> dela<00:02:11.200> thing<00:02:11.440> for<00:02:11.709> 30<00:02:12.010> 45<00:02:12.400> at<00:02:14.640> 171<00:02:16.350> 70.8<00:02:17.350> I

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
mean dela thing for 30 45 at 171 70.8 I

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.840 
mean dela thing for 30 45 at 171 70.8 I
believe<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:17.950> was<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:19.510> was<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.720> PR<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.790> was

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
believe I was that was a PR that was

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.850 
believe I was that was a PR that was
stronger<00:02:22.420> than<00:02:22.450> what<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.959> pulled<00:02:23.320> two<00:02:23.620> weeks

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
stronger than what I pulled two weeks

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.120 
stronger than what I pulled two weeks
ago<00:02:24.190> at<00:02:24.730> what<00:02:25.570> I<00:02:25.600> want<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.930> say<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.260> was<00:02:26.350> 175

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
ago at what I want to say it was 175

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.130 
ago at what I want to say it was 175
pounds<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:27.880> it's<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.180> really<00:02:28.450> really<00:02:28.930> good

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
pounds so it's a really really good

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.050 
pounds so it's a really really good
indicator<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.769> i'm<00:02:30.640> actually<00:02:30.790> getting

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
indicator that i'm actually getting

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.949 
indicator that i'm actually getting
stronger<00:02:31.540> in<00:02:31.810> some<00:02:31.840> ways<00:02:32.320> while<00:02:32.920> cutting

stronger in some ways while cutting

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.009 
stronger in some ways while cutting
tomorrow<00:02:34.959> most<00:02:35.860> likely<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.340> be<00:02:36.489> squatting<00:02:37.019> if

tomorrow most likely to be squatting if

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.650 
tomorrow most likely to be squatting if
my<00:02:38.260> back<00:02:38.530> feels<00:02:38.830> up<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.220> if<00:02:39.549> not<00:02:40.390> i'll

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660

most part current macros once again i
lowered<00:03:04.630> them<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.810> little<00:03:04.990> bit<00:03:05.250> i'm<00:03:06.250> currently

eating<00:03:07.290> 180<00:03:08.290> carbs<00:03:08.800> all<00:03:09.099> my<00:03:09.220> training<00:03:09.490> days

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
eating 180 carbs all my training days

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.330 
eating 180 carbs all my training days
200<00:03:11.770> grams<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:12.130> protein<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:14.040> roughly<00:03:15.040> 40

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
200 grams of protein and roughly 40

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.850 
200 grams of protein and roughly 40
grams<00:03:15.520> of<00:03:15.700> fat<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.380> comes<00:03:17.500> out<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.800> be

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
grams of fat so it comes out to be

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:25.110 
grams of fat so it comes out to be
calories<00:03:18.370> around<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:21.090> think<00:03:22.090> it's<00:03:22.240> like<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:24.120> want

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
calories around I think it's like I want

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.400 
calories around I think it's like I want
to<00:03:25.180> say<00:03:25.270> just<00:03:25.450> on<00:03:25.600> our<00:03:25.630> two<00:03:25.840> thousand<00:03:26.200> I'm<00:03:26.290> not

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
to say just on our two thousand I'm not

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.020 
to say just on our two thousand I'm not
one<00:03:26.560> percent<00:03:26.950> sure<00:03:27.130> I'll<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.400> go<00:03:27.520> look<00:03:27.700> back<00:03:27.880> at

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
one percent sure I'll to go look back at

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.300 
one percent sure I'll to go look back at
that<00:03:28.200> but<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.230> mean<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.560> feel<00:03:29.740> pretty<00:03:29.950> good<00:03:30.160> with

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
that but I mean I feel pretty good with

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.870 
that but I mean I feel pretty good with
that<00:03:30.510> hungry<00:03:31.510> but<00:03:31.780> not<00:03:32.380> starving<00:03:32.890> I'm<00:03:33.310> keeping

that hungry but not starving I'm keeping

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.300 
that hungry but not starving I'm keeping
my<00:03:33.940> strength<00:03:34.270> really<00:03:34.600> well<00:03:34.780> so<00:03:35.350> I'm<00:03:36.040> just

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
my strength really well so I'm just

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.620 
my strength really well so I'm just
going<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.490> keep<00:03:36.670> those<00:03:36.850> numbers<00:03:37.240> the<00:03:37.270> way<00:03:37.480> they

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
going to keep those numbers the way they

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.320 
going to keep those numbers the way they
are<00:03:37.780> for<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.140> next<00:03:38.640> two<00:03:39.640> weeks<00:03:39.670> then<00:03:40.120> when

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
are for the next two weeks then when

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.130 
are for the next two weeks then when
piqui<00:03:40.750> comes<00:03:41.050> i'll<00:03:41.440> do<00:03:41.680> a<00:03:42.310> carb<00:03:43.210> load<00:03:43.510> which

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
piqui comes i'll do a carb load which

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.780 
piqui comes i'll do a carb load which
i'll<00:03:44.290> probably<00:03:44.500> end<00:03:44.650> up<00:03:44.770> eating<00:03:44.920> like<00:03:45.190> 500

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
i'll probably end up eating like 500

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.700 
i'll probably end up eating like 500
carbohydrates<00:03:46.420> a<00:03:46.600> few<00:03:46.780> days<00:03:46.930> before<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.440> comp

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
carbohydrates a few days before the comp

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.890 
carbohydrates a few days before the comp
and<00:03:48.520> then<00:03:48.610> i'll<00:03:48.730> lower<00:03:48.940> them<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.450> then<00:03:49.540> on<00:03:49.720> the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
and then i'll lower them and then on the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.120 
and then i'll lower them and then on the
day<00:03:50.020> of<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.170> competition<00:03:50.320> i'll<00:03:50.950> probably

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
day of the competition i'll probably

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.090
