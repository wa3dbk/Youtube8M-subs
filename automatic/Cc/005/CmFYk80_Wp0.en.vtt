of the wrapper and acts as a lens pouch
I<00:00:31.900> don't<00:00:32.590> use<00:00:32.739> it<00:00:32.770> that<00:00:32.890> much<00:00:33.070> because<00:00:33.340> I<00:00:33.460> have

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
I don't use it that much because I have

next up is a damage
of<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:15.780> lens<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> lens<00:01:16.560> hood<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:19.470> I

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
of the lens with the lens hood on so I

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.200 
of the lens with the lens hood on so I
was<00:01:20.130> having<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.400> little<00:01:20.460> bit<00:01:20.580> trouble<00:01:21.000> but

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
was having a little bit trouble but

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:30.040 
was having a little bit trouble but
there<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:26.690> this<00:01:27.690> is<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.930> comparison<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
there it is this is a comparison of the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.770 
there it is this is a comparison of the
Nikon<00:01:31.050> 40<00:01:31.380> min<00:01:31.590> 40<00:01:31.820> millimeter<00:01:32.820> f28<00:01:33.300> micro

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.980 
lens versus the Sigma 7300 blends the
7300<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.320> about<00:01:40.530> two<00:01:40.830> times<00:01:40.979> bigger<00:01:41.369> than<00:01:41.580> it

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
7300 is about two times bigger than it

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.359 
7300 is about two times bigger than it
the<00:01:42.990> bell<00:01:43.170> quality<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> Nikon<00:01:44.040> 40

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the bell quality of the Nikon 40

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.770 
the bell quality of the Nikon 40
millimeter<00:01:44.929> f28<00:01:45.929> macro<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:47.030> it's<00:01:48.030> decent<00:01:48.600> it's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
millimeter f28 macro is it's decent it's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.469 
millimeter f28 macro is it's decent it's
not<00:01:48.929> the<00:01:49.080> best<00:01:49.259> I've<00:01:49.500> seen<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:50.429> it<00:01:51.210> gets<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
not the best I've seen but it gets the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.490 
not the best I've seen but it gets the
job<00:01:51.509> done<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.479> there's<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.020> two<00:01:58.170> lenses

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
job done and so there's the two lenses

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.669 
job done and so there's the two lenses
with<00:01:58.710> their<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.100> lens<00:01:59.520> hoods<00:01:59.789> on<00:02:03.560> next<00:02:04.560> we

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
with their like lens hoods on next we

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.249 
with their like lens hoods on next we
have<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.069> focus<00:02:05.310> mode<00:02:05.610> which<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.060> manual<00:02:07.050> and

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
have the focus mode which is manual and

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.609 
have the focus mode which is manual and
auto<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.880> then<00:02:08.880> also<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.479> manual<00:02:10.440> mode

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
auto and then also we have manual mode

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.400 
auto and then also we have manual mode
and<00:02:10.830> then<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.760> focus<00:02:12.120> modes<00:02:12.360> are<00:02:12.540> full<00:02:12.900> which

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
and then the focus modes are full which

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.240 
and then the focus modes are full which
so<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.250> do<00:02:14.580> your<00:02:14.819> full<00:02:15.500> macro<00:02:16.500> focus<00:02:17.069> and

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
so you can do your full macro focus and

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.170 
so you can do your full macro focus and
then<00:02:18.140> we<00:02:19.140> also<00:02:19.320> have<00:02:19.650> infinity<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.489> zero<00:02:21.000> point

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
then we also have infinity to zero point

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.800 
then we also have infinity to zero point
two<00:02:21.420> meters<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:23.000> there's<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.060> little<00:02:24.329> focus

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
two meters and there's a little focus

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.600 
two meters and there's a little focus
window<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:30.350> here's<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.560> lens<00:02:31.799> without<00:02:32.070> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
window and here's the lens without the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.670 
window and here's the lens without the
earth<00:02:33.000> without<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.780> lens<00:02:34.079> is<00:02:34.320> there<00:02:34.530> anything

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
earth without the lens is there anything

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.949 
earth without the lens is there anything
on<00:02:34.890> I'm<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.519> demonstrating<00:02:36.060> how<00:02:36.660> big<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
on I'm just demonstrating how big the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.069 
on I'm just demonstrating how big the
aperture<00:02:37.350> can<00:02:37.530> get<00:02:37.850> natural<00:02:38.850> lenses<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.870> the

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
aperture can get natural lenses in the

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.970 
aperture can get natural lenses in the
lenses<00:02:40.610> it's<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.640> pretty<00:02:41.880> small<00:02:42.680> but<00:02:43.680> they're

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
lenses it's a pretty small but they're

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.310 
lenses it's a pretty small but they're
really<00:02:44.190> high<00:02:44.370> quality<00:02:45.079> produces<00:02:46.079> pretty

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
really high quality produces pretty

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.760 
really high quality produces pretty
great<00:02:46.500> images

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.770 

next<00:02:52.770> is<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.069> quick<00:02:53.280> demonstration<00:02:53.460> of<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.390> 40

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
next is a quick demonstration of the 40

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.699 
next is a quick demonstration of the 40
versus<00:02:55.140> 1855<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.600> 1855<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:58.050> slightly<00:02:58.380> bigger

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
versus 1855 and 1855 is slightly bigger

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.410 
versus 1855 and 1855 is slightly bigger
but<00:02:59.069> not<00:02:59.130> much<00:02:59.430> bigger<00:03:01.819> nice<00:03:02.819> I'm<00:03:03.000> going<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.300> be

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
but not much bigger nice I'm going to be

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.559 
but not much bigger nice I'm going to be
doing<00:03:03.630> unboxing<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:05.100> Lexar<00:03:05.670> 16<00:03:06.180> gigabyte

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
doing unboxing of the Lexar 16 gigabyte
