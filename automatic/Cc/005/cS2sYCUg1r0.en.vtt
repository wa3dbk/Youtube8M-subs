 that passes technique is very cheap but has 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.630
 some people still insist on 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.580
 try to pass home - made technique and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.499
 Today I'm going to show you here how I feel. 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.589

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:31.650

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.090
 oil 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:47.450
 can only have some other than what 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.479
 It's similar, right? 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.390
 I did this with one another and tested 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:00.560
 if you put the oil puts a little more 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:05.280
 it's very dry put look just tinker 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.220
 feel good and caring can also put 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.299
 too much oil to not get too soft and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.660
 oil, right? 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:20.160
 the processor cup here is already 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.060
 stirred you see how we got 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:29.010
 it seems like last year the technique of truth 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:33.170
 né spartak is bought and she is very good 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.170
 also works very well and processor 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.459
 with very good 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.760
 reminding me that I 'm not 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.329
 blaming me for blaming 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.790
 for any damage to your computer 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:51.450
 even because the person can do it 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.370
 the wrong way and they ended up 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.670
 but if I do everything right I think 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.370
 there will be no error already has a process 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.370
 Last mika enable you to see what's left 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.060
 very similar to the other 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.519
 after spending only pay occurs and 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.690
 to fit on the motherboard, I'm not 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.630
 demonstrating that the motherboard but 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.940
 works the same and that's it 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.579
 galera liked the video clip sign up 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.590
 write to the channel because it has 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.709
 few written is not that I intend 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.799
 to grow with the channel and who I liked 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.310
 also helps a lot and that's until the 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.310
