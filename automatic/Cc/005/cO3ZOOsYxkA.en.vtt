and<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.690> want<00:00:33.839> to<00:00:33.929> start<00:00:34.140> with<00:00:34.199> death<00:00:34.409> and

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
and you want to start with death and

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.759 
and you want to start with death and
decay<00:00:34.909> followed<00:00:35.909> up<00:00:36.030> by<00:00:36.059> plague<00:00:36.449> blood<00:00:39.769> reason

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
decay followed up by plague blood reason

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:42.889 
decay followed up by plague blood reason
being<00:00:40.949> is<00:00:41.309> death<00:00:41.909> and<00:00:42.059> decay<00:00:42.149> actually<00:00:42.690> deals

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
being is death and decay actually deals

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.959 
being is death and decay actually deals
damage<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.620> when<00:00:43.769> he<00:00:43.979> puts<00:00:44.370> his<00:00:44.429> bubble<00:00:44.819> up

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
damage so when he puts his bubble up

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.790 
damage so when he puts his bubble up
there<00:00:45.300> it'll<00:00:45.870> help<00:00:46.019> take<00:00:46.229> that<00:00:46.260> bubble<00:00:46.679> off

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
there it'll help take that bubble off

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.559 
there it'll help take that bubble off
faster<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.670> as<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.909> could<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.329> ability

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:51.569 
faster so as you could see this ability

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:53.090 
faster so as you could see this ability
hit<00:00:51.839> him<00:00:51.929> once<00:00:52.199> then<00:00:52.409> death<00:00:52.589> and<00:00:52.710> decay<00:00:52.799> hit

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
hit him once then death and decay hit

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.729 
hit him once then death and decay hit
him<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.309> then<00:00:53.399> those<00:00:53.999> two<00:00:54.899> attacks<00:00:55.379> actually

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
him and then those two attacks actually

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.219 
him and then those two attacks actually
were<00:00:56.429> two<00:00:56.579> attacks<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.350> dropped<00:00:58.350> his<00:00:58.679> uh

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
were two attacks and dropped his uh

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.660 
were two attacks and dropped his uh
dropped<00:01:01.229> as<00:01:01.319> well<00:01:01.440> then<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.129> basically<00:01:02.549> just

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
bit and of course that would be your

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.130 
bit and of course that would be your
squirrel<00:02:00.569> so<00:02:01.569> you<00:02:01.630> want<00:02:01.869> to<00:02:01.959> start

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
squirrel so you want to start

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.349 
squirrel so you want to start
immediately<00:02:02.500> with<00:02:02.679> your<00:02:02.709> extra<00:02:03.340> plating<00:02:03.759> it's

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
immediately with your extra plating it's

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:08.550 
immediately with your extra plating it's
important<00:02:06.509> somewhere<00:02:07.509> around<00:02:07.599> this<00:02:07.869> time<00:02:08.080> his

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
important somewhere around this time his

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.160 
important somewhere around this time his
shield<00:02:09.099> should<00:02:09.399> either<00:02:09.549> be<00:02:09.789> only<00:02:10.179> one<00:02:10.690> he

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
shield should either be only one he

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.720 
shield should either be only one he
doesn't<00:02:11.410> hit<00:02:11.590> just<00:02:11.769> fell<00:02:11.890> off<00:02:12.069> but<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.549> will

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
doesn't hit just fell off but it will

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.319 
doesn't hit just fell off but it will
have<00:02:12.910> either<00:02:13.060> one<00:02:13.420> more<00:02:13.629> round<00:02:13.900> or<00:02:15.209> it'll<00:02:16.209> be

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
have either one more round or it'll be

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:17.699 
have either one more round or it'll be
where<00:02:16.660> we<00:02:16.780> are<00:02:16.900> now<00:02:17.049> where<00:02:17.230> he<00:02:17.319> doesn't<00:02:17.590> have

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
where we are now where he doesn't have

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.369 
where we are now where he doesn't have
it<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.160> it's<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.400> perfect<00:02:18.760> time<00:02:18.879> for<00:02:18.940> wind-up<00:02:19.660> so

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
it so it's a perfect time for wind-up so

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.380 
it so it's a perfect time for wind-up so
try<00:02:20.920> your<00:02:21.129> best<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.400> get<00:02:21.519> that<00:02:21.670> wind<00:02:21.910> up<00:02:22.090> as

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
try your best to get that wind up as

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.479 
try your best to get that wind up as
soon<00:02:22.690> as<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.900> can<00:02:23.170> before<00:02:23.470> he<00:02:23.769> can<00:02:24.129> apply<00:02:24.430> this

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
soon as you can before he can apply this

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.589 
soon as you can before he can apply this
shield<00:02:25.420> again<00:02:29.670> as<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.819> can<00:02:30.910> see<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.209> just

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
shield again as you can see that just

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.140 
shield again as you can see that just
about<00:02:31.959> one<00:02:32.170> shot<00:02:32.530> him<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.950> then<00:02:33.730> since<00:02:33.970> we're

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
about one shot him and then since we're

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.180 
about one shot him and then since we're
faster<00:02:34.510> we'll<00:02:34.660> just<00:02:34.840> punch<00:02:35.799> him<00:02:35.920> in<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.010> face
