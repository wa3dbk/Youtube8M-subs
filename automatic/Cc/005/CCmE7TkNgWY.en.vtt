 trainings and for them today 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.470
 events became a kind of dedication 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.619
 hawks now of course but from achievements 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.640

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.640
 together 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.879
 generally decide when made 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.870
 and it’s already stated, but I think it’s 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.620
 one of the main 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.050
 Well, the directions are made at the selection 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.020

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.969

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.030

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.250

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.740
 young hockey players and they handed people to 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.280
 avant-garde hockey club even gave us

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.970

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:49.390
 because it develops children 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.560
 patriotism of the city club is brought up 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.750
 so funny malchevsky somehow not 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.420
 causing such optimism some purpose 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.710
 must be someone to become idols for them 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.039

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.649

 say therefore here for them it is so 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.049
 In general, of course it is necessary that they 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.480
 some small success was going to be 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.850
 success will not leave them any interest 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.830

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.870

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.590
