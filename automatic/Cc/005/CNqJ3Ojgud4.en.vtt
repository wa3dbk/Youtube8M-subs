00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.700 
hi everyone this is Terry with sweet
stitching<00:00:03.000> embroidery<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:03.570> design<00:00:03.899> today

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
stitching embroidery and design today

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.800 
stitching embroidery and design today
I'm<00:00:04.950> going<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.339> show<00:00:05.609> you<00:00:05.640> how<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.060> adjust<00:00:06.359> the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
I'm going to show you how to adjust the

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.070 
I'm going to show you how to adjust the
full<00:00:07.109> compensation<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:08.340> so<00:00:08.940> what<00:00:09.150> Pro<00:00:09.480> so

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
full compensation and so what Pro so

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.720 
full compensation and so what Pro so
that<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.320> can<00:00:10.530> make<00:00:10.679> stitching<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.340> little<00:00:11.610> bit

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
that you can make stitching a little bit

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.570 
that you can make stitching a little bit
wider<00:00:12.059> if<00:00:13.070> something<00:00:14.070> looks<00:00:14.190> like<00:00:14.370> it's<00:00:14.519> a

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
wider if something looks like it's a

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.460 
wider if something looks like it's a
little<00:00:14.730> bit<00:00:14.910> too<00:00:15.179> thin<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.570> can<00:00:15.990> picking<00:00:16.350> it

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
little bit too thin you can picking it

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.140 
little bit too thin you can picking it
up<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.710> little<00:00:16.800> bit<00:00:17.010> by<00:00:17.279> just<00:00:17.520> adjusting<00:00:17.670> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
up a little bit by just adjusting the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.279 
up a little bit by just adjusting the
pull<00:00:18.359> compensation

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
pull compensation

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.460 
pull compensation
I<00:00:19.320> usually<00:00:19.830> don't<00:00:20.160> change<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.640> density

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
I usually don't change the density

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
I usually don't change the density
normally<00:00:22.470> if<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.949> just<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.220> little<00:00:23.279> bit

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
normally if I do it just a little bit

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.640 
normally if I do it just a little bit
it's<00:00:23.730> enough<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.689> where<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.260> doesn't<00:00:25.289> really

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
it's enough to where it doesn't really

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.560 
it's enough to where it doesn't really
make<00:00:25.830> any<00:00:25.859> difference<00:00:26.210> so<00:00:27.210> I've<00:00:27.300> got<00:00:27.449> my

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
make any difference so I've got my

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.019 
make any difference so I've got my
design<00:00:27.900> here<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> screen<00:00:28.670> and<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.789> want<00:00:29.939> to

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
design here on the screen and I want to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.860 
design here on the screen and I want to
go<00:00:30.119> up<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.359> tools<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:32.120> left<00:00:33.120> click<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.510> adjust

go up to tools in left click on adjust

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.200 
go up to tools in left click on adjust
density<00:00:34.350> or<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.829> use<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> shortcut<00:00:35.250> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
density or I can use the shortcut of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.930 
density or I can use the shortcut of
just<00:00:36.600> pressing<00:00:36.960> my<00:00:37.230> control<00:00:37.710> button<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.309> the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.020 
change the full compensation I will do
it<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> entire<00:01:07.799> design<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.640> only<00:01:08.790> want

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.600 
the only one that I'm wanting to change
the<00:01:20.040> full<00:01:20.250> compensation<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.470> or<00:01:22.470> yeah<00:01:23.369> they're

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the full compensation on or yeah they're

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.649 
the full compensation on or yeah they're
full<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.710> then<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.610> want<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.150> master

full and then if we want to do master
also<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.770> stitching<00:01:29.280> down<00:01:29.430> here<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.689> hold

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
also the stitching down here I can hold

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.380 
also the stitching down here I can hold
down<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> control<00:01:31.860> button<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:33.329> can

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
down the control button and I can

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.080 
down the control button and I can
left-click<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.079> number<00:01:34.439> two<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.670> now<00:01:35.820> both

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
left-click on the number two so now both

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.569 
left-click on the number two so now both
these<00:01:36.450> are<00:01:36.659> highlighted<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.100> now<00:01:38.310> when<00:01:38.490> I

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
these are highlighted so now when I

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.210 
these are highlighted so now when I
adjust<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.299> full<00:01:39.509> compensation<00:01:39.900> I'll<00:01:40.650> be

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
adjust the full compensation I'll be

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.380 
adjust the full compensation I'll be
able<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:42.500> do<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.799> both<00:01:43.829> these<00:01:44.159> words<00:01:44.460> so

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
able to do it for both these words so

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.740 
able to do it for both these words so
let's<00:01:45.659> go<00:01:45.810> period<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.380> adjust<00:01:46.740> density<00:01:47.750> full

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
let's go period to adjust density full

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.560 
let's go period to adjust density full
compensation<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:50.180> let's<00:01:51.180> go<00:01:51.420> up<00:01:51.600> twice<00:01:53.570> okay

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
compensation and let's go up twice okay

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.490 
compensation and let's go up twice okay
we'll<00:01:55.079> do<00:01:55.259> that

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
we'll do that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.499 
we'll do that
okay<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.700> see<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.090> didn't<00:02:00.360> really

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
okay and you can see it didn't really

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.420 
okay and you can see it didn't really
make<00:02:00.750> much<00:02:00.990> difference<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.829> if<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.040> click<00:02:02.100> on

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
make much difference but if I click on

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.550 
make much difference but if I click on
do<00:02:04.759> it<00:02:05.759> does<00:02:06.030> change<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.509> little<00:02:06.659> bit<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.530> let's

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
do it does change a little bit so let's

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.559 
do it does change a little bit so let's
try<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.039> again<00:02:08.190> let's<00:02:08.700> do<00:02:08.849> hold<00:02:09.300> down<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
go up to four this time that's about

go up to four this time that's about
what<00:02:21.710> I<00:02:21.740> normally<00:02:21.860> do<00:02:22.430> three<00:02:22.730> or<00:02:22.790> four<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.830> hit
