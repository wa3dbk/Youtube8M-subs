00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.570
 hello friends welcome to the garage 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.320
 It gives a lot of taste as always be 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.170
 with you 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.100
 again we're going to talk about three 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:51.050
 new cars we will start with the new 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:55.340
 ford fiesta 2014 we will continue with the sling 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:59.840
 hybrid cr-z and we'll finish with the 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.180
 nissan pathfinder 2013 that there was not 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.560
 had the opportunity to drive up 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:11.570
 a short time ago but let's start with the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:15.200
 party 2014 as you know the party 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:19.610
 a new generation of people came around 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.870
 of 3 years 34 years and it was three more years 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.790
 well and it was that it began to manufacture in 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.320
 mexico at the ford plant in 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.270
 cuautitlÃ¡n that car has been that new 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.149
 special generation has been awarded 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.470
 in the world and has good reasons for 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.420
 that's not especially 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.420
 we can call it in some way the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.760
 chassis although in cars the great 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.040
 most no longer has tubular chassis like 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.690
 previously but the platform the base 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.510
 of the body 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.810
 let's say what goes around what forms 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.159
 your body 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.439
 it is very good very solid and it is a 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.310
 body that by offering a level of 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.130
 very high torsional stiffness makes 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.979
 trust the handling of the car is also 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.920
 very good are the bodies that have 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.940
 little torsional rigidity that you raise a cap 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.100
 a bump in after a curve and twist 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.410
 They also distort the handling of the car 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.210
 they make it more difficult than 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.090
 wheels are stuck on the floor 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.360
 hinder the work of suspension 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.210
 of almost all the elements and by 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.700
 course also of the driver then 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.610
 a good platform is the basis for a 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.820
 good car and the party has it that is 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.390
 kept for 2014 in fact it's a 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.310
 mid-life change there are no changes 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.420
 radicals in the new party not the most 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.090
 perceptible is of course the frontal 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.470
 the front of the car now 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.980
 we see there that 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.980
 that new grill that ford premiere in 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.050
 the armchair and is putting in 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.210
 practically all its range already we have it 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.940
 in the focus also only in the version 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.000
 I do not doubt that he will arrive in the focus 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.550
 normal in a relatively short time and 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.820
 now he arrives at the party he has 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.550
 all his lovers and his detractors not to 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.420
 everyone seems fine to me yes I think 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.130
 a particularly nice car and for 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.430
 was also some changes in the 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.180
 back and inside 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.640
 we see fort's effort to improve 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.310
 the materials in which 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.650
 how the interior of the car is built 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.380
 not the seat fabric board 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.850
 etcetera and if it improves 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:52.040
 we must say put some tension 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.320
 to perceive what those improvements are 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.180
 plastics of linings boards 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.580
 doors as I said seat cloth 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.160
 etcetera in general you sit in the 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.110
 new party and the feeling that you 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.640
 transmits is from a car a little more 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.740
 refined even a little more expensive than 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.550
 What is it 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:12.820
 now in the version that we tested the s the 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:17.260
 auto is maintained with the same engine 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:21.450
 before 1.6 liters 120 horses and with a 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.730
 gearbox 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.190
 and automatic in the case of the car that 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.870
 we are going to have a six manual 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.870
 five- speed speeds sorry 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:35.620
 and this is automatic 6 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.720
 has double clutch is actually a 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.160
 box that works in automatic mode what 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.860
 postpone entering with the automatic box 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:46.150
 traditional but it's not automatic itself 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.670
 in fact it is a manual box is a box 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.010
 with the traditional format in the box 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.170
 manual has crochet etc. but not 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.450
 has a clutch pedal 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.520
 you do not do what actions do 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.460
 computer for you and has double 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.400
 clutch then the double clutch the 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.280
 function is to give more speed between 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.470
 changes 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.600
 and when you have for example you go in 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.850
 second is already pre in grenada the 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.650
 third so that when you change it be more 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:19.080
 fast is this change however I repeat 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.850
 there is still a clutch or something that does not 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.730
 is driven by the driver but by 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.580
 a computer and this box suddenly 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.590
 It is not such a simple box to handle 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.270
 like the traditional automatic boxes 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:36.030
 It makes some strangers when you're in a 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.850
 let's say on a fast track on a route 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.960
 no stops and so on you go at speeds 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:45.240
 constant around do not be 180 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.980
 100 kilometers per hour is everything more or 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.480
 less well when you start to vary the 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:53.370
 speed the box starts to do 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.610
 some strangers and there is medium difficult 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.760
 you're in town and you start and suddenly 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.650
 the car jumps there are little things there 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.810
 half weird with that box so I 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:09.260
 I prefer the manual version then the 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:12.650
 party management remains a management 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.150
 weird at least with the automatic box 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.130
 the good news is that the box is still 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:21.260
 manual that gives you more performance takes away 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.320
 some comfort but nothing more performance 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:28.220
 to the car more control of course to the 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:32.390
 load driver has a motor of a 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.670
 liter turbo with more power than that 1.6 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.400
 liters a liter your group has 123 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:41.750
 horses for mexico turbo engines 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:45.320
 work very well because they fight the 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.990
 main the main characteristic of 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.490
 the Mexican soil that is the altitude of 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.940
 the big cities not here in 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:56.780
 Guadalajara 1,600 meters or the 2200 df 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:59.540
 or in toluca 3000 is not easy for a 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.880
 auto move for example in toluca with 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.580
 3,000 meters altitude the car loses 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.870
 30 percent of its power only 120 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:12.880
 party horses are transformed into 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:14.770
 less than 90 or is it really a 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.490
 considerable loss with the turbo that does not 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:23.729
 happens because the turbo does not use the air of 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:25.860
 the atmosphere to breathe but the air 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:28.110
 that comes from the engine itself the loss is 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.839
 much smaller and it's a loss just before 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.939
 of the tour the car must maintain the 

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:34.830
 same prices ford has not announced them 

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:37.169
 still but the good news is 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.599
 hopefully and come that turbo engine is not 

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:41.150
 announced hopefully and come in the future 

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:44.309
 near and will also come the 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:47.400
 sports st with him I think that there 

00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:49.830
 let's have the party in all its 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.539
 capacity because the platform is very 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.909
 good to resist that so 

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:56.939
 soon it's just a more aesthetic change 

00:07:53.909 --> 00:08:01.879
 what else are we going to a cut and 

00:07:56.939 --> 00:08:01.879
 We come back with the Honda Cr-Z Hybrid
