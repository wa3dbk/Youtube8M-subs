00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.340
 hello everyone with you again phoenix and in 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.250
 this video, I will show the battle on the robin 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:19.590
 standard fight where I have 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:26.849
 9 236 just light here I am going to the center 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:29.820
 bush and even flew t71 but you are ahead 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.169
 understand why he did not lit up I think 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.020
 what he doesn't have 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.330
 so passive light like mine 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.280
 I stand enlightened caste from the horn and 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:44.730
 cost masking masking cost and 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.380
 so I dos cries from his can 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.130
 because I am worth fighting brotherhood 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:57.170
 so female carriage cartoons full to me a 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:57.170
 full page 3 girls and I have 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.600
 masking on the crew that is, 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.150
 me - 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.190
 camouflage net all percent combat 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.020
 fraternity all this increases themselves 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:16.909
 tank statistics and plus does the same 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.909
 masking perk downloaded not themselves 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:27.869
 drivers well and chickened out Uzumaki fire 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.909
 so very everything is simple just you take 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.740
 stand in this bush in the center of these 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.200
 the heights of the country from that side 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.950
 some advice will light you up there 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.470
 Evening another look and you just stand 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.020
 stand and all of you as you see now with me 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.990
 t71 start shooting because of what it 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.119
 He will merge because my shot 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.630
 completely disguise and to go away 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.069
 resigning us five seconds and bye light bulb 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.899
 register from and rolls back 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:02:02.080
 diaries go piste circle and then another 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:09.340
 here's a look 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:11.860
 and all its overwhelm you understand that this 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.570
 and there are two options either you merge 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.790
 in front that means you don't bring anyone 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.740
 spring if you play on alt 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.080
 and here for example passively color so 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.370
 even if you do not type damage in me 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.490
 as much experience as with damage to the feet a chance 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.220
 wins in this case is very leafy 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.550
 because as we see no one 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.450
 brightens our team as powerfully as 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.260
 I will light 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.800
 their team that is enemy and for 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:46.540
 account by the outbreak of 9,200 damage was inflicted 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:49.750
 that's half almost yes yes somewhere around 40 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.260
 percent of total hp their not commands then 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:57.940
 there is on our team this h 'save myself 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:02.530
 due to the fact that they only fired already 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:05.290
 according to goals they are obtained and filled 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.970
 Damage took more frags so 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.780
 way you understand passivity 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.180
 this or hpc color is a very necessary thing 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:20.800
 almost all players forget almost 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:24.130
 what on any alter forgets what 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.650
 He needs to shine expect and not trouble 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.560
 small for it give a lot of experience i 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.480
 I understand, but if you want to think about it 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.970
 stats and play on this then 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.280
 shine in the light will beat 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.070
 sure to kill even some cancer 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.850
 which he doesnâ€™t know just really because 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.640
 that he is scary because he will see a 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.540
 he is not seen due to strikes in the team 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.000
 he will survive 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.129
 due to the fact that you see the enemy, he 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.989
 meet your noob 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:58.610

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.340
 I can tell him the virginity to 8 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.790
