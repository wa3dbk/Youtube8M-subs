00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
gonna give you guys some tips on how to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.260 
gonna give you guys some tips on how to
do<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.800> with<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> little<00:00:32.250> bit<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.489> style<00:00:32.820> I've

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
do it with a little bit of style I've

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.389 
do it with a little bit of style I've
got<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> lot<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.899> spring<00:00:34.260> content<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.219> way

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
got a lot of spring content on the way

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.250 
got a lot of spring content on the way
so<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.730> think<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.120> ties<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:37.020> nicely

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
so I think this ties in with it nicely

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.410 
so I think this ties in with it nicely
so<00:00:37.710> basically<00:00:38.340> what<00:00:38.610> I'm<00:00:38.700> gonna<00:00:38.820> do<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.239> show

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.650 
at all so when you're wearing a crewneck
sweatshirt<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.849> just<00:02:40.060> looks<00:02:40.269> like<00:02:40.360> you<00:02:40.540> were

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
in that single sweatshirt so something

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.680 
in that single sweatshirt so something
like<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.849> is<00:02:43.000> perfect<00:02:43.180> for<00:02:43.540> layering

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
like this is perfect for layering

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.720 
like this is perfect for layering
because<00:02:44.049> it's<00:02:44.440> hidden<00:02:44.709> around<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.459> neckline

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
because it's hidden around the neckline

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.240 
because it's hidden around the neckline
but<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.630> does<00:02:46.840> have<00:02:47.049> a<00:02:47.080> generous<00:02:47.590> length<00:02:47.890> on<00:02:48.099> it

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
but it does have a generous length on it

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.949 
but it does have a generous length on it
so<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:48.730> see<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.239> hanging<00:02:49.450> below<00:02:49.780> your
