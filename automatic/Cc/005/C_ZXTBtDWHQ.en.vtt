the<00:00:28.340> construction<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.430> this<00:00:29.610> is<00:00:29.790> a<00:00:29.820> Damascus

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the construction of this is a Damascus

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.420 
the construction of this is a Damascus
cladding<00:00:31.110> and<00:00:31.290> you'll<00:00:31.739> see<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.040> does<00:00:32.250> have

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
cladding and you'll see this does have

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.270 
cladding and you'll see this does have
some<00:00:32.489> blooming<00:00:33.090> or<00:00:33.500> patina<00:00:34.500> all<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> blade

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
some blooming or patina all on the blade

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.310 
some blooming or patina all on the blade
I<00:00:35.309> cut<00:00:35.640> some<00:00:35.880> steak<00:00:36.360> with<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.990> so<00:00:37.200> it's

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
I cut some steak with this and so it's

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.110 
I cut some steak with this and so it's
developed<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.830> patina<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.060> see

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
developed a patina and as you can see

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.090 
developed a patina and as you can see
it's<00:00:39.360> not<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.570> stainless<00:00:40.110> cladding<00:00:40.560> so<00:00:40.740> it<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:40.980> a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
it's not a stainless cladding so it is a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.280 
it's not a stainless cladding so it is a
carbon<00:00:41.540> cladding<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.630> is<00:00:42.720> a<00:00:42.840> reactive

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
carbon cladding it is a reactive

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.450 
carbon cladding it is a reactive
cladding<00:00:43.770> you've<00:00:44.550> got<00:00:45.680> real<00:00:46.680> nice<00:00:46.830> chiseled

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
cladding you've got real nice chiseled

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.750 
cladding you've got real nice chiseled
kanji<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.930> blade<00:00:49.290> and<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.280> got<00:00:50.730> a

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
kanji on this blade and it's got a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.200 
kanji on this blade and it's got a
really<00:00:51.180> subtle<00:00:51.690> effect<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.460> Damascus<00:00:54.060> so

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
really subtle effect on the Damascus so

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.620 
really subtle effect on the Damascus so
it's<00:00:54.390> not<00:00:54.540> a<00:00:55.670> tactile<00:00:56.670> type<00:00:56.910> pattern<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.480> not

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
it's not a tactile type pattern it's not

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.600 
it's not a tactile type pattern it's not
super<00:00:57.989> visible<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.710> at<00:00:58.950> the<00:00:59.010> top<00:00:59.220> here<00:00:59.250> but

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
super visible up at the top here but

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.170 
super visible up at the top here but
when<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.820> hit<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.060> cladding<00:01:00.649> edge<00:01:01.910> area<00:01:02.910> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
when you hit the cladding edge area and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.520 
when you hit the cladding edge area and
it<00:01:03.329> grinds<00:01:03.570> down<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.079> edge<00:01:04.170> you'll<00:01:04.379> see

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
it grinds down to the edge you'll see

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.109 
it grinds down to the edge you'll see
that<00:01:04.649> cladding<00:01:05.070> very<00:01:05.250> nicely<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.030> nice

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
that cladding very nicely so it's a nice

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.640 
that cladding very nicely so it's a nice
understated<00:01:06.840> effect<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:09.080> now<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.290> knife<00:01:10.470> is

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
understated effect the now this knife is

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.960 
understated effect the now this knife is
a<00:01:10.680> little<00:01:10.920> different<00:01:11.280> than<00:01:11.400> some<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:11.850> we'll

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
a little different than some but we'll

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.840 
a little different than some but we'll
talk<00:01:12.120> about<00:01:12.300> that<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:14.190> weight<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.670> this

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
talk about that so the weight on this

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.490 
talk about that so the weight on this
knife<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.240> five<00:01:15.450> point<00:01:15.750> five<00:01:15.900> ounces<00:01:16.320> these

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
knife is five point five ounces these

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.170 
knife is five point five ounces these
will<00:01:16.650> vary<00:01:16.890> based<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.520> handle<00:01:17.940> of<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
will vary based on the handle of the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.420 
will vary based on the handle of the
knife<00:01:18.290> mark<00:01:19.290> puts<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.560> variety<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.860> handles<00:01:20.220> on

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
knife mark puts a variety of handles on

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.039 
knife mark puts a variety of handles on
these<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> light<00:01:21.150> blade<00:01:21.420> considering<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
these so a light blade considering the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.350 
these so a light blade considering the
size<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:23.340> length<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.030> right<00:01:24.180> about

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
size the length on this is right about

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.870 
size the length on this is right about
250<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.710> overall<00:01:25.979> length<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.460> fifteen

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
250 and the overall length is fifteen

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.700 
250 and the overall length is fifteen
point<00:01:26.909> four<00:01:27.570> inches<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.229> will<00:01:28.350> vary<00:01:28.530> by

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
point four inches and that will vary by

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.039 
point four inches and that will vary by
handle<00:01:29.100> again<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.490> well<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.390> spine<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
handle again as well the spine at the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.460 
handle again as well the spine at the
base<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.530> about<00:01:32.100> three<00:01:32.400> point<00:01:32.670> five<00:01:33.290> so<00:01:34.290> it's

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
base is about three point five so it's

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.760 
base is about three point five so it's
fairly<00:01:34.740> thick<00:01:35.990> again<00:01:36.990> there<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.470> go

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
fairly thick again there we go

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.740 
fairly thick again there we go
it's<00:01:38.070> fairly<00:01:38.460> thick<00:01:38.700> right<00:01:38.909> out<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
it's fairly thick right out of the the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.080 
it's fairly thick right out of the the
Tang<00:01:40.049> right<00:01:40.350> out<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> handle<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:41.850> then

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
Tang right out of the handle but then

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
Tang right out of the handle but then
thins<00:01:42.869> down<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.650> one<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.400> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
thins down and one of the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.800 
thins down and one of the
characteristics<00:01:45.060> that's<00:01:45.240> really<00:01:45.479> nice<00:01:45.600> on

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
characteristics that's really nice on

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.240 
characteristics that's really nice on
this<00:01:45.900> blade<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.290> look<00:01:46.439> how<00:01:46.560> thin<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:46.890> gets

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
this blade is look how thin that gets

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.730 
this blade is look how thin that gets
towards<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.790> edge<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.900> really<00:01:49.170> does<00:01:49.409> thin

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
towards the edge so it really does thin

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800 
towards the edge so it really does thin
down<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> nice<00:01:50.400> continuous<00:01:50.909> distal<00:01:51.570> taper

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
down and a nice continuous distal taper

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.100 
down and a nice continuous distal taper
all<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> way<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.470> very<00:01:52.530> thin<00:01:52.799> tip<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.110> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
all the way to a very thin tip and the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.630 
all the way to a very thin tip and the
blade<00:01:55.350> height<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.860> one<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.220> quite<00:01:56.400> a<00:01:56.430> bit

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
blade height on this one is quite a bit

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.010 
blade height on this one is quite a bit
shorter<00:01:56.939> than<00:01:57.090> some<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.450> other<00:01:57.570> ones<00:01:57.780> so

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
shorter than some of the other ones so

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.630 
shorter than some of the other ones so
that<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.380> think<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.950> bit<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.220> anomaly

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
that I think this is a bit of anomaly

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.460 
that I think this is a bit of anomaly
I'll<00:01:59.939> talk<00:02:00.210> about<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.630> one<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.049> second

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
I'll talk about this one it's a second

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.710 
I'll talk about this one it's a second
that<00:02:01.710> mark<00:02:01.920> sold<00:02:02.130> me<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.150> one's<00:02:03.360> forty

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
that mark sold me so this one's forty

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.850 
that mark sold me so this one's forty
four<00:02:03.869> point<00:02:04.110> eight<00:02:04.259> but<00:02:04.470> I'll<00:02:04.590> leave<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
four point eight but I'll leave the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.080 
four point eight but I'll leave the
other<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.189> believe<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.580> other<00:02:05.670> ones<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
other I believe the other ones on the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.910 
other I believe the other ones on the
side<00:02:06.299> are<00:02:06.450> more<00:02:06.900> like<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> forty<00:02:07.380> six<00:02:07.560> range

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
side are more like the forty six range

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.580 
side are more like the forty six range
so<00:02:08.280> maybe<00:02:08.759> forty<00:02:09.119> seven<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.409> little

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
so maybe forty seven so this is a little

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.929 
so maybe forty seven so this is a little
bit<00:02:10.769> shorter<00:02:11.129> maybe<00:02:11.310> than<00:02:11.549> some<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.879> guess

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:11.939 
bit shorter maybe than some I guess

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.399 
bit shorter maybe than some I guess
they'll<00:02:12.209> vary<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.510> little<00:02:12.659> bit

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
they'll vary a little bit

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.440 
they'll vary a little bit
this<00:02:13.709> particular<00:02:14.069> knife<00:02:14.400> just<00:02:14.760> full

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
this particular knife just full

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.270 
this particular knife just full
disclosure<00:02:15.569> is<00:02:16.169> a<00:02:16.200> second<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.829> marks

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
disclosure is a second that marks

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.000 
disclosure is a second that marks
me<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.970> without<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> handle<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.350> got<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> bit

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
me and without a handle it's got a bit

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.670 
me and without a handle it's got a bit
of<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.220> defect<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.050> Damascus<00:02:22.050> cladding

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
of a defect in the Damascus cladding

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.500 
of a defect in the Damascus cladding
right<00:02:22.830> here<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.610> particular<00:02:23.790> one<00:02:24.150> also

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
right here and this particular one also

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.800 
right here and this particular one also
had<00:02:25.100> wasn't<00:02:26.100> relieved<00:02:26.850> too<00:02:27.150> nicely<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
had wasn't relieved too nicely on the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.720 
had wasn't relieved too nicely on the
left<00:02:28.020> side<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.410> blade<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.400> had<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.610> do

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
left side of the blade so I had to do

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.400 
left side of the blade so I had to do
some<00:02:29.880> work<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.690> then<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.350> one

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
some work on that and then this one

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.550 
some work on that and then this one
actually<00:02:31.709> came<00:02:32.040> with<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.280> salty<00:02:33.030> bent<00:02:33.290> tip<00:02:34.290> that

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
actually came with a salty bent tip that

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.900 
actually came with a salty bent tip that
I<00:02:34.590> ground<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.069> left<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.459> little<00:02:35.610> bit<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.850> the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
I ground on I left a little bit of the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.610 
I ground on I left a little bit of the
tip<00:02:36.120> there<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.600> see<00:02:36.780> if<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.989> would<00:02:37.080> work<00:02:37.140> okay

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
tip there to see if it would work okay

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.229 
tip there to see if it would work okay
before<00:02:37.800> grinding<00:02:38.130> down<00:02:38.430> too<00:02:38.610> much<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.120> and

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
before grinding down too much of it and

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.790 
before grinding down too much of it and
I<00:02:39.720> had<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.930> straighten<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.350> front<00:02:40.380> part<00:02:40.770> of

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
I had to straighten the front part of

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.229 
I had to straighten the front part of
the<00:02:40.890> blade<00:02:41.100> slightly<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.790> had<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> number

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
the blade slightly so this had a number

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.500 
the blade slightly so this had a number
of<00:02:42.300> issues<00:02:42.450> but<00:02:42.630> hey<00:02:43.020> it's<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.260> second<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.130> if<00:02:45.060> an

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
of issues but hey it's a second so if an

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.840 
of issues but hey it's a second so if an
a1<00:02:46.050> version<00:02:46.860> blade<00:02:47.069> that's<00:02:47.280> not<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> second

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
a1 version blade that's not a second

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.940 
a1 version blade that's not a second
we'll<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.239> none<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.989> those<00:02:49.080> issues<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.739> this

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
we'll have none of those issues so this

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.350 
we'll have none of those issues so this
one<00:02:50.160> was<00:02:50.340> something<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.790> could<00:02:50.970> play<00:02:51.150> with<00:02:51.180> a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
one was something I could play with a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.440 
one was something I could play with a
little<00:02:51.630> bit<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:52.709> terms<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.489> performance<00:02:53.700> it's

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
little bit in terms of performance it's

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.600 
little bit in terms of performance it's
a<00:02:54.810> really<00:02:55.380> nice<00:02:55.530> performing<00:02:56.070> blade<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.459> got

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
a really nice performing blade it's got

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.580 
a really nice performing blade it's got
a<00:02:56.640> very<00:02:56.880> flat<00:02:57.239> overall<00:02:57.720> profile<00:02:58.170> as<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.440> can

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
a very flat overall profile as you can

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.740 
a very flat overall profile as you can
see<00:02:58.709> with<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.950> long<00:02:59.160> flat<00:02:59.489> spot<00:02:59.790> on<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.239> not

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
see with a long flat spot on it and not

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.880 
see with a long flat spot on it and not
much<00:03:00.989> belly<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:02.870> it's<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.989> very<00:03:04.200> thin<00:03:04.500> blade<00:03:04.739> at

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
much belly and it's a very thin blade at

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.229 
much belly and it's a very thin blade at
the<00:03:04.920> edge<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.400> thing<00:03:05.640> does<00:03:05.850> go<00:03:06.060> through

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
the edge this thing does go through

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.290 
the edge this thing does go through
ingredients<00:03:06.810> very<00:03:07.110> very<00:03:07.800> nicely<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.850> tip<00:03:09.090> is

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
ingredients very very nicely that tip is

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.470 
ingredients very very nicely that tip is
super<00:03:09.780> thin<00:03:10.470> it's<00:03:11.370> actually<00:03:11.760> fairly<00:03:12.060> flexible

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
super thin it's actually fairly flexible

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.550 
super thin it's actually fairly flexible
at<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.140> tip<00:03:14.780> because<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.019> a<00:03:16.050> pretty<00:03:16.319> thin

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
at the tip because it is a pretty thin

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.830 
at the tip because it is a pretty thin
blade<00:03:16.860> but<00:03:17.519> it's<00:03:17.760> stiff<00:03:18.000> enough<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.330> go

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
blade but it's stiff enough to go

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.059 
blade but it's stiff enough to go
through<00:03:18.870> things<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.380> wouldn't<00:03:19.620> put<00:03:19.890> anything

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
through things I wouldn't put anything

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.850 
through things I wouldn't put anything
real<00:03:20.910> heavy<00:03:21.120> on<00:03:21.360> this<00:03:21.570> or<00:03:22.320> through<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.709> with

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
real heavy on this or through it with

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.890 
real heavy on this or through it with
this<00:03:23.010> blade<00:03:23.280> but<00:03:23.549> it's<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:24.030> real<00:03:24.720> nice

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
this blade but it's a real nice

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.330 
this blade but it's a real nice
performing<00:03:25.470> blade<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:25.920> it's<00:03:26.040> got<00:03:26.190> some

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
performing blade so it's got some

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.620 
performing blade so it's got some
interesting<00:03:26.579> characteristics<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.510> it's

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
interesting characteristics and it's

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.539 
interesting characteristics and it's
really<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.840> nice<00:03:27.989> looking<00:03:28.380> blade<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
really a nice looking blade the

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.770 
really a nice looking blade the
out-of-the-box<00:03:29.820> edge<00:03:30.180> I'm<00:03:30.329> not<00:03:30.450> even<00:03:30.660> going

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
out-of-the-box edge I'm not even going

to<00:03:30.840> comment<00:03:31.049> on<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.470> because<00:03:31.530> it<00:03:31.769> was<00:03:31.829> a

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
to comment on this because it was a

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.009 
to comment on this because it was a
second<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.549> put<00:03:32.790> my<00:03:32.880> own<00:03:32.910> edge<00:03:33.180> on<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.660> it

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
second so I put my own edge on it and it

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.240 
second so I put my own edge on it and it
got<00:03:34.170> very<00:03:34.200> very<00:03:35.100> sharp<00:03:35.670> very<00:03:36.600> quickly<00:03:37.320> so<00:03:38.100> it's

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
got very very sharp very quickly so it's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.940 
got very very sharp very quickly so it's
a<00:03:38.340> it's<00:03:38.610> a<00:03:38.700> nice<00:03:38.850> sharpening<00:03:39.360> steel<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:40.049> it's

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
a it's a nice sharpening steel and it's

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.009 
a it's a nice sharpening steel and it's
a<00:03:41.160> very<00:03:41.430> interesting<00:03:41.489> blade<00:03:42.390> he's<00:03:42.660> putting<00:03:42.930> a

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
a very interesting blade he's putting a

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.360 
a very interesting blade he's putting a
variety<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.380> handles<00:03:43.799> on<00:03:44.010> these<00:03:44.190> as<00:03:44.459> well<00:03:45.180> so

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
variety of handles on these as well so

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.500 
variety of handles on these as well so
don't<00:03:47.370> pay<00:03:47.579> too<00:03:47.640> much<00:03:47.760> attention<00:03:47.910> if<00:03:48.390> you've

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
don't pay too much attention if you've

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.090 
don't pay too much attention if you've
seen<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.750> tang<00:03:49.109> this<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.410> my<00:03:49.530> first<00:03:49.769> full

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
seen that tang this is my first full

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.340 
seen that tang this is my first full
handle<00:03:50.489> install<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.540> made<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.900> opening<00:03:52.260> a

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
handle install and I made the opening a

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.840 
handle install and I made the opening a
little<00:03:52.470> bit<00:03:52.650> bigger<00:03:52.859> and<00:03:53.130> my<00:03:53.310> sealed<00:03:53.609> it<00:03:53.760> up

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
little bit bigger and my sealed it up

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.569 
little bit bigger and my sealed it up
with<00:03:54.060> some<00:03:54.299> epoxy<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.980> it's<00:03:56.130> not<00:03:56.250> quite<00:03:56.459> as

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
with some epoxy so it's not quite as

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.670 
with some epoxy so it's not quite as
clean<00:03:56.820> as<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.030> full-on<00:03:57.600> handle<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.350> somebody

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
clean as a full-on handle that somebody

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.020 
clean as a full-on handle that somebody
knows<00:03:58.799> what<00:03:58.950> they're<00:03:59.100> doing<00:03:59.400> as<00:03:59.579> far<00:03:59.609> as<00:03:59.820> the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
knows what they're doing as far as the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.670 
knows what they're doing as far as the
install<00:04:00.329> goes<00:04:00.600> but<00:04:01.230> there<00:04:01.440> you<00:04:01.500> have<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.650> very

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
install goes but there you have a very

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.220 
install goes but there you have a very
interesting<00:04:02.160> blade<00:04:02.660> these<00:04:03.660> are<00:04:03.840> really<00:04:04.079> nice

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
interesting blade these are really nice

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.710 
interesting blade these are really nice
blades<00:04:04.590> actually<00:04:05.060> markedly<00:04:06.060> likes<00:04:06.359> them<00:04:06.510> over

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
blades actually markedly likes them over

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.599 
blades actually markedly likes them over
the<00:04:06.810> actual<00:04:06.959> Matsumoto<00:04:07.530> KS<00:04:07.950> for<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.220> number<00:04:08.549> of

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
the actual Matsumoto KS for a number of

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.759 
the actual Matsumoto KS for a number of
reasons<00:04:08.730> including<00:04:09.359> a<00:04:09.780> Ogami<00:04:10.079> super<00:04:10.500> steel

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
reasons including a Ogami super steel

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.800 
reasons including a Ogami super steel
and<00:04:11.310> they're<00:04:11.459> really<00:04:11.579> nice<00:04:11.760> grinds<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.510> it's

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
and they're really nice grinds and it's

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.479 
and they're really nice grinds and it's
a<00:04:12.870> nice<00:04:13.019> thin<00:04:13.320> blade<00:04:13.590> especially<00:04:14.070> at<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.250> tip

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
a nice thin blade especially at the tip

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.990 
a nice thin blade especially at the tip
so<00:04:15.180> there<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.870> have<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.049> Ikeda<00:04:16.739> Damascus<00:04:17.519> AAS

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
so there you have the Ikeda Damascus AAS

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.859 
so there you have the Ikeda Damascus AAS
Giotto<00:04:18.570> 250<00:04:19.440> millimeter
