okay<00:00:01.439> so<00:00:02.010> more<00:00:02.760> about<00:00:03.060> bloating<00:00:04.069> guys<00:00:05.089> this<00:00:06.089> is

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
okay so more about bloating guys this is

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.900 
okay so more about bloating guys this is
for<00:00:06.480> example<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:07.350> any<00:00:07.470> structure<00:00:08.250> that<00:00:08.639> you

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
for example the any structure that you

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.140 
for example the any structure that you
want<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.660> see<00:00:10.290> or<00:00:10.500> you<00:00:10.650> want<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.010> visualize<00:00:11.490> so

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
want to see or you want to visualize so

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.780 
want to see or you want to visualize so
basically<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.500> target<00:00:14.190> DNA<00:00:14.460> that

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
basically this is the target DNA that

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.300 
basically this is the target DNA that
you<00:00:14.940> want<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.360> visualize<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:16.740> let's<00:00:16.949> see<00:00:17.130> this

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
you want to visualize and let's see this

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.189 
you want to visualize and let's see this
DNA<00:00:17.730> have<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:19.279> GCT<00:00:20.390> whatever<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.570> codon

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
DNA have this GCT whatever the codon

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.890 
DNA have this GCT whatever the codon
let's<00:00:22.859> say<00:00:23.630> CGC<00:00:24.630> let's<00:00:25.320> make<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.980> tea<00:00:26.900> see

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
let's say CGC let's make you a tea see

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.640 
let's say CGC let's make you a tea see
whether<00:00:28.230> right<00:00:28.619> now<00:00:29.900> how<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:30.929> will<00:00:31.260> see<00:00:31.500> this

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
whether right now how you will see this

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.700 
whether right now how you will see this
segment<00:00:32.600> how<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.660> will<00:00:33.840> see<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.230> segment

segment how we will see this segment

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.440 
segment how we will see this segment
from<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> last<00:00:35.219> video<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.700> know<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.120> will<00:00:36.239> see

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
from the last video you know we will see

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.090 
from the last video you know we will see
the<00:00:36.570> segment<00:00:36.960> by<00:00:37.110> basically<00:00:37.559> southern

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the segment by basically southern

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.650 
the segment by basically southern
applause<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.610> maybe<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:39.000> can<00:00:39.210> put<00:00:39.420> here

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
applause so maybe we can put here

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.690 
applause so maybe we can put here
southern<00:00:40.790> how<00:00:42.290> guys<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.620> know<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.250> my<00:00:44.430> DNA

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
southern how guys I know this is my DNA

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.930 
southern how guys I know this is my DNA
interest<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.600> know<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.110> target<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.579> what<00:00:47.910> I

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
interest so I know this target so what I

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.160 
interest so I know this target so what I
will<00:00:48.149> make<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:49.079> will<00:00:49.140> make<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> lab<00:00:50.989> okay<00:00:51.989> I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
will make I will make in the lab okay I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.360 
will make I will make in the lab okay I
will<00:00:52.710> make<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.340> lab<00:00:53.550> DNA<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:55.140> own<00:00:55.469> DNA

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
will make in the lab DNA my own DNA

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.110 
will make in the lab DNA my own DNA
segment<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.629> guys<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:59.100> made<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
segment this is guys we made this in the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.619 
segment this is guys we made this in the
lab<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.680> my<00:01:01.680> own<00:01:01.890> DNA<00:01:02.160> segment<00:01:02.879> will<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.359> just

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
lab and my own DNA segment will be just

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.899 
lab and my own DNA segment will be just
opposite<00:01:04.140> or<00:01:04.409> basically<00:01:04.799> complementary<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
opposite or basically complementary to

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.969 
opposite or basically complementary to
the<00:01:06.000> segment<00:01:06.450> complimentary<00:01:07.110> antipodal<00:01:07.650> so

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the segment complimentary antipodal so

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.149 
the segment complimentary antipodal so
in<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> state<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.700> G<00:01:09.000> here<00:01:09.390> will<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:11.689> gta2

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
in the state of G here will be see gta2

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.580 
in the state of G here will be see gta2
right<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.909> if<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.570> will<00:01:15.689> see<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> codon

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
right if you if you will see the codon

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.710 
right if you if you will see the codon
basically<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.549> complimentary<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.450> cheaper

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
basically just complimentary and cheaper

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.999 
basically just complimentary and cheaper
also<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.320> time<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.740> will<00:01:19.979> make<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:21.799> okay<00:01:22.799> in

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
also this time I will make this okay in

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.109 
also this time I will make this okay in
lab<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:25.159> I<00:01:26.159> will<00:01:26.310> call<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.820> segment

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
lab and I will call this segment

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.179 
lab and I will call this segment
basically<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.110> made<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> lab<00:01:29.009> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
basically that I made it in the lab I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.840 
basically that I made it in the lab I
will<00:01:29.340> call<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.790> prop<00:01:31.700> okay

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
will call it a prop okay

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.899 
will call it a prop okay
and<00:01:32.939> then<00:01:33.540> what<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.110> will<00:01:34.409> do<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.130> my<00:01:35.369> DNA

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
and then what I will do this is my DNA

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.719 
and then what I will do this is my DNA
segment<00:01:36.420> basically<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.740> made<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.430> which

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
segment basically that I made it which

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.600 
segment basically that I made it which
is<00:01:38.970> C<00:01:39.720> again<00:01:40.400> GT<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.820> G<00:01:42.570> what<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.530> will<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:43.979> try

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
is C again GT a G what I will do I try

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.980 
is C again GT a G what I will do I try
to<00:01:44.670> attach<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:47.000> think<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.270> kind<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.570> radio

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to attach I think it's a kind of radio

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.789 
to attach I think it's a kind of radio
labeled<00:01:49.439> phosphate<00:01:50.009> material<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.560> guess<00:01:52.560> it's

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
labeled phosphate material I guess it's

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.929 
labeled phosphate material I guess it's
ready<00:01:53.040> labeled<00:01:53.490> phosphate<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.840> idea<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.939> this

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
ready labeled phosphate the idea is this

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.149 
ready labeled phosphate the idea is this
fluorescent<00:01:57.750> animal<00:01:58.170> will<00:01:58.409> give<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> color

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
fluorescent animal will give you a color

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.469 
fluorescent animal will give you a color
in<00:02:00.119> order<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.630> see<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.770> bands<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:03.000> basically

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
in order to see the bands so basically

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.499 
in order to see the bands so basically
you<00:02:04.049> will<00:02:04.259> do<00:02:04.469> two<00:02:04.710> steps<00:02:05.009> first<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.299> will

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
you will do two steps first you will

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.880 
you will do two steps first you will
make<00:02:06.750> your<00:02:07.049> own<00:02:07.320> DNA<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.970> try<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.030> attach

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
make your own DNA and try to attach

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.820 
make your own DNA and try to attach
phosphate<00:02:10.890> or<00:02:11.099> radio<00:02:11.790> labeled<00:02:12.180> phosphate

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
phosphate or radio labeled phosphate

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.400 
phosphate or radio labeled phosphate
your<00:02:14.010> or<00:02:14.220> DNA<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:14.970> basically<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:15.900> radio

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
your or DNA so basically this radio

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.160 
your or DNA so basically this radio
labeled<00:02:18.260> prop<00:02:20.480> read<00:02:21.480> your<00:02:21.600> label<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.990> prop

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
labeled prop read your label the prop

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.620 
labeled prop read your label the prop
and<00:02:22.470> then<00:02:23.010> here<00:02:23.280> let's<00:02:23.700> say<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> lot

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
and then here let's say you have a lot

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.960 
and then here let's say you have a lot
of<00:02:24.660> DNA<00:02:25.260> segments<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.220> blotting<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.760> lot

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
of DNA segments and the blotting a lot

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.820 
of DNA segments and the blotting a lot
here<00:02:27.300> yeah<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.690> will<00:02:27.840> do<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.050> little<00:02:28.320> phoresis

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
here yeah you will do a little phoresis

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.220 
here yeah you will do a little phoresis
basically<00:02:29.580> you'll<00:02:30.210> do<00:02:30.450> Ellicott<00:02:30.840> row<00:02:30.990> for

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
basically you'll do Ellicott row for

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.920 
basically you'll do Ellicott row for
esa's<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.280> get<00:02:32.430> row<00:02:32.550> for<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.240> you

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
esa's and in you get row for is the you

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.410 
esa's and in you get row for is the you
will<00:02:34.080> see<00:02:34.260> these<00:02:34.410> along<00:02:35.160> basically<00:02:35.940> will<00:02:36.270> not

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
will see these along basically will not

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.270 
will see these along basically will not
series<00:02:36.810> signal<00:02:37.110> but<00:02:37.680> it'll<00:02:37.890> be<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.040> lot<00:02:38.220> of

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
series signal but it'll be a lot of

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.240 
series signal but it'll be a lot of
signal<00:02:38.790> then<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.510> will<00:02:39.690> just<00:02:39.960> put<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.920> probe

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
signal then you will just put the probe

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.100 
signal then you will just put the probe
that<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:41.700> made<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.270> will<00:02:42.420> put<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.960> will

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
that you made it you will put you will

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.340 
that you made it you will put you will
try<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.410> separate<00:02:43.980> your<00:02:44.220> prop<00:02:44.670> all<00:02:45.000> over<00:02:45.720> this

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
try to separate your prop all over this

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.020 
try to separate your prop all over this
is<00:02:46.680> small<00:02:47.070> segment<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.730> don't<00:02:47.940> know

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
is small segment and you don't know

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.820 
is small segment and you don't know
which<00:02:48.210> segment<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.050> need<00:02:49.200> basically

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
which segment that you need basically

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.610 
which segment that you need basically
the<00:02:50.670> prop<00:02:50.970> let's<00:02:51.300> say<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.870> probable<00:02:52.290> call

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
the prop let's say the probable call

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.820 
the prop let's say the probable call
here<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:54.330> is<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.480> segment<00:02:54.830> basically

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
here so this is the segment basically

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.490 
here so this is the segment basically
target<00:02:56.400> or<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.790> segment<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.300> interest<00:02:57.870> so

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
target or the segment of interest so

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.890 
target or the segment of interest so
basically<00:02:58.890> let's<00:02:59.190> say<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.550> prod<00:02:59.910> will<00:03:00.510> just

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
basically let's say the prod will just

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.440 
basically let's say the prod will just
bind<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:01.890> segment<00:03:02.240> complementary<00:03:03.240> and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
bind to this segment complementary and

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.250 
bind to this segment complementary and
mg<00:03:04.280> parallel<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:06.270> this<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.660> segment<00:03:06.900> of

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
mg parallel so this is the segment of

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.650 
mg parallel so this is the segment of
interest<00:03:07.860> how<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.459> will<00:03:08.820> see<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.270> approach

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
interest how you will see this approach

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.160 
interest how you will see this approach
how<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.500> will<00:03:10.770> see<00:03:11.040> because<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:12.240> cannot<00:03:12.900> see

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
how you will see because you cannot see

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.140 
how you will see because you cannot see
this<00:03:13.290> approach<00:03:13.740> without<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.430> radio<00:03:14.550> labeled

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
this approach without the radio labeled

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.750 
this approach without the radio labeled
phosphate<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.080> it<00:03:16.200> has<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.650> be<00:03:16.800> radio<00:03:17.280> labeled

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
phosphate so it has to be radio labeled

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.420 
phosphate so it has to be radio labeled
which<00:03:18.300> is<00:03:18.480> why<00:03:18.690> phosphate<00:03:19.200> or<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.590> forget

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
which is why phosphate or I forget

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.520 
which is why phosphate or I forget
phosphate<00:03:20.910> from<00:03:21.060> iodine<00:03:21.480> but<00:03:21.959> basically<00:03:22.290> it's

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
phosphate from iodine but basically it's

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.790 
phosphate from iodine but basically it's
just<00:03:22.560> radio<00:03:23.040> label<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:23.790> after<00:03:24.450> this<00:03:24.680> so<00:03:25.680> in

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
just radio label so after this so in

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.280 
just radio label so after this so in
this<00:03:25.920> case<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.370> will<00:03:26.489> see<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:28.019> case

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
this case you will see so in this case

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.479 
this case you will see so in this case
you<00:03:28.680> will<00:03:28.800> be<00:03:28.830> able<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.760> visualize<00:03:31.489> your

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
you will be able to visualize your

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.400 
you will be able to visualize your
original<00:03:33.150> DNA<00:03:33.450> which<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.870> basically<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:34.350> is

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
original DNA which is basically this is

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.790 
original DNA which is basically this is
the<00:03:34.590> first<00:03:34.800> one<00:03:35.010> which<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:36.050> GATC<00:03:37.050> because<00:03:37.620> it's

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
the first one which is GATC because it's

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.120 
the first one which is GATC because it's
just

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
just

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.090 
just
complimentary<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.060> M<00:03:39.239> cheaper<00:03:39.570> oh<00:03:40.040> okay<00:03:41.040> so

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
complimentary and M cheaper oh okay so

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.550 
complimentary and M cheaper oh okay so
you<00:03:41.340> will<00:03:41.670> make<00:03:42.000> this<00:03:42.239> in<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.720> lab<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.230> probe

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
you will make this in the lab so probe

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.310 
you will make this in the lab so probe
is<00:03:43.890> now<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.370> can<00:03:44.970> very<00:03:45.209> easy<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.630> define<00:03:46.080> the

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
is now it can very easy to define the

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.490 
is now it can very easy to define the
probe<00:03:46.560> for<00:03:46.830> me<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.130> probe<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.519> just<00:03:47.790> the

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
probe for me the probe is just the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.030 
probe for me the probe is just the
segment<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.620> DNA

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
segment of DNA

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.400 
segment of DNA
basically<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.910> is<00:03:50.940> single-stranded<00:03:51.540> if<00:03:52.260> you

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
basically it is single-stranded if you

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.620 
basically it is single-stranded if you
will<00:03:52.530> see<00:03:52.709> just<00:03:52.890> single<00:03:53.280> stranded<00:03:53.790> segment<00:03:54.510> of

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
will see just single stranded segment of

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.050 
will see just single stranded segment of
DNA<00:03:54.840> we<00:03:55.500> made<00:03:55.800> it<00:03:56.010> in<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.280> lab<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.640> then<00:03:57.030> we

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
DNA we made it in the lab and then we

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.780 
DNA we made it in the lab and then we
just<00:03:57.420> attach<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:58.709> your<00:03:58.890> labeled<00:03:59.250> material

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
just attach that your labeled material

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.790 
just attach that your labeled material
with<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.030> just<00:04:00.390> for<00:04:00.630> visualization<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:01.680> then

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
with it just for visualization and then

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.250 
with it just for visualization and then
you<00:04:01.950> will<00:04:02.100> put<00:04:02.280> this<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.519> probe<00:04:03.080> within<00:04:04.080> this

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
you will put this a probe within this

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.710 
you will put this a probe within this
electro<00:04:04.800> phoretic<00:04:05.040> membrane<00:04:05.730> once<00:04:06.390> it<00:04:06.570> will

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
electro phoretic membrane once it will

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.660 
electro phoretic membrane once it will
bind<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.320> segment<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.070> this<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.489> segment

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
bind to a segment so this is the segment

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.670 
bind to a segment so this is the segment
of<00:04:09.000> interest<00:04:09.390> just<00:04:09.840> take<00:04:10.080> this<00:04:10.260> segment

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
of interest just take this segment

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.780 
of interest just take this segment
extract<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.430> visualize<00:04:12.420> it
