00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.070
 ignition in total mode with key 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.560
 the system can not only be switched on 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.720
 all modes with the keyboard but 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.130
 even using the reader is the key to 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.439
 proximity 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.960
 the reader is a device that comes 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.449
 installed in an electric plate like 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.769
 was any switch for 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.600
 turn the lights on and off 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.820
 the key is that device 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.850
 proximity that is brought closer to the reader 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.210
 allows the control unit to be recognized 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.309
 of the person who is operating the key 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.340
 it is completely spain and without 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.309
 electrical contacts are not tampered with 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.949
 and as appropriate, special inserts can 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.280
 be replaced with others of different 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.230
 color to diversify users o 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.210
 assign keys to different functions 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.760
 we now take confidence with the led of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.549
 reader alert 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.600
 the LEDs are five and each will give us one 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.580
 precise information on the plant 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.700
 first we see below a blue LED 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.009
 that flashes continuously is the light of 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.950
 courtesy indicating the point where 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.350
 we're going to approach the key 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.610
 but let's go in order starting from the first one 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.369
 up 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.979
 the first is a green LED that informs us 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.520
 on the status of the French windows and doors 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.400
 sensors if it is on it indicates that all 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.680
 protected points are closed and therefore 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.340
 we can easily switch on 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.399
 the system by inserting the protections 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.570
 now we're going to turn on the system 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.939
 we will approach the key to the part 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.710
 bottom of the reader where the LED is 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.170
 blue always flashing 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.100
 first there will be recognition 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.960
 of the correct key code 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.510
 displayed with momentary ignition 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.930
 of all the LEDs and with the sound of the 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.479
 citizen inside the reader himself 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.420
 we will keep in place the key is just 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.160
 will turn on the red led we will move away 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.290
 the key 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.489
 we turned on the system in mode 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.620
 total 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.290
 we learned that the lighting of the LED 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.989
 red indicates the insertion of 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.989
 protections in total mode
