00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:03.996
 I have many American customers. 

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:08.130
 I like her lifestyle. 

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:10.736
 For example, you are not as curious as you are. 

00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:13.251
 You are curious and fat. 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.686
 Hello friends. My name is Javier Wong. 

00:00:19.896 --> 00:00:24.831
 I live and work in Lima, Peru. And my specialty is ceviche. 

00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:27.396
 Here are just a few of his awards. 

00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:32.646
 At Ceviche you can really perfect simplicity. 

00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:38.950
 I make my ceviche with fewer and fewer ingredients. 

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:43.738
 One more ingredient less, and I could die in peace. 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.173
 On my menus you will find only sole. 

00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:50.655
 Sole is the only fish I use. 

00:00:50.996 --> 00:00:52.538
 Nice animal, right? 

00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:56.160
 I use octopus because of the many tastes. 

00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:58.385
 The most important thing is sole. 

00:00:59.353 --> 00:01:03.945
 Ceviche needs 5 ingredients. 5 like the number of fingers on your hand. 

00:01:04.608 --> 00:01:08.606
 Namely: fish, salt, onions, pepper ... 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.151
 Lime and a lot of love. So you make the best ceviche in the world. 

00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:17.658
 I'm going to make a ceviche that anyone can imitate 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.850
 because it's the simplest dish. 

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.121
 Tell me more about the individual steps. 

00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:27.926
 You already filmed that? Can not you cut that? 

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.975
 But you should explain the steps in front of the camera. 

00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:37.385
 Oh man, what a jerk, this guy here. 

00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:41.056
 You have to peel the outermost layers of the onion. 

00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:45.123
 So you get a sweetish and less austere taste. 

00:01:45.816 --> 00:01:50.135
 The fish just has to be very fresh. 

00:01:50.613 --> 00:01:55.240
 You have to fillet him with the necessary respect. 

00:01:55.401 --> 00:02:01.711
 Because yesterday he fought heroically for his life. 

00:02:03.543 --> 00:02:08.720
 Then mix with salt, pepper and a lot of love. 

00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:16.776
 You have to find the balance between salt and lime. 

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:20.218
 So there are two secrets ... 

00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:23.933
 Not correct! And even if they exist, you will not hear anything from me, Gringo. 

00:02:24.438 --> 00:02:26.486
 There is nothing secret here. I just say the truth. 

00:02:29.075 --> 00:02:31.720
 If Gringos can not even do that, they are really stupid. 

00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:36.096
 Peruvian ceviche is something very special. 

00:02:36.258 --> 00:02:39.323
 There is no bad ceviche in Peru. 

00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:42.745
 Every ceviche tastes good here. 

00:02:42.906 --> 00:02:45.446
 The limes of chulucanas are exceptional. 

00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:48.860
 They do not grow anywhere else, not even in other parts of Peru. 

00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:52.883
 How would you do ceviche in the US? 

00:02:53.045 --> 00:02:56.633
 With fish. With what else? 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.453
 - And the lime? - Oh, it gets really interesting. 

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:07.346
 Here is the right amount of acid needed. 

00:03:07.508 --> 00:03:11.688
 How much, I will not tell you. Can you make-up.
