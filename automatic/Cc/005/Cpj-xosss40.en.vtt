00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.849
 hi the log tarots and welcome to 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.170
 this new video 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.250
 today we will see our 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.259
 last card 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.000
 our last major arcana map 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.260
 the mast so I decided actually seems 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.369
 decided to present it one last 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.680
 I could easily have the present in 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.660
 first but well here go go 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.310
 last pass so everything is in 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.320
 like that even though I often present it 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.090
 first then yes small note 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.329
 interesting we see that 1 to 1 cartridge 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.870
 but the breakdown number actually she had 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.899
 a number 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.960
 but it's a number that has been lost 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.860
 but at the same good a number I'm going 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.660
 do some mystery 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.420
 come to class with me we talk about it 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.050
 during classes often a little bit 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.600
 before the product 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.199
 ok then the map of the mas the map of the farmhouse 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.960
 in positive in his lived will speak to us 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.520
 of two years in positive as negative 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.410
 even heard will talk to us about having a 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.539
 project in fact to have an idea in mind 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.960
 to also have some form of notice that 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.900
 found a little at the mountebank in the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.320
 positive there the the person is going to be motivated 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.799
 by her project she is going to want to 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.189
 achieve 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.450
 she believes she's going she's gonna really get 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.520
 give a lot for his project because 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.259
 that she and for her she is 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.460
 persuaded that it's good for her then 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.799
 maybe a little bit too 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.229
 daily there is a little head in the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.939
 clouds also from time to time but he 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.409
 there is really good will we are 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.960
 we really want to go 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.119
 and suddenly in action in what will 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.829
 to be done is someone who will go 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.119
 it's someone who will give himself the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.770
 means what's missing a little bit at 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.790
 the mountebank the mountebank does not darken 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.579
 really actually they as long as they 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.340
 experiment the alma will really darken 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.630
 he will give himself the means he goes he 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.119
 will not be afraid he will not hesitate to 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.310
 cross borders explored 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.360
 the unknown will really launch into 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.710
 things that do not know in 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.230
 places he does not know he goes there 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.530
 really it goes to the bottom 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.210
 he goes for it he will not do island in 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.130
 negative 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.560
 we often have this idea also of projects 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.380
 which stands out except that in fact we're going 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.900
 talk about the people who in their lived are 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.180
 bounded are stubborn who are stubborn a 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.410
 child at their head 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.000
 they are not aware of the fact 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.310
 reality they are so obsessed with 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.020
 what they have in the skull that any good 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.160
 meaning they are lacking it may be 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.170
 also for that we are often told 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.910
 that this map is the map of the madman and 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.220
 suddenly in his action mas will run away 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.510
 he fled he was going he was going 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.710
 a leak a leak ahead me I say 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.970
 often it is a flight ahead especially 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.700
 in couples when we see the husband 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.700
 who is represented by his at I think 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.420
 he has already prepared his suitcase 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.820
 actually usually the person 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.580
 confirms that sir has already thought of 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.510
 take his cliques and his slaps 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.680
 madam also huh it works too for 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.000
 madam no no sexism hockey and 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.930
 often it will also talk to him about 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.920
 disempower then not like not 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.690
 like our sun I do not know if you 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.190
 you remember in the video card for 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.900
 the sun we had already talked about a 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.860
 form of lack of grip 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.070
 responsibility but in the sense that we 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.290
 accused the other there is not the case there 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.810
 So we are not accusing you do not accuse 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.520
 at all in fact we do not care much 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.620
 clearly it's happening that I do not care 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.640
 it does not interest me that but it does not 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.080
 not concern I take business I 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.670
 even wondering if it's his fault 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.450
 him no it's not my fault it's not 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.030
 of my fault it is the fault of 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.140
 no one I do not care that does not exist and 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.569
 in fact in 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.350
 an extreme negative we will talk about 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.610
 people who go into exile who who 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.540
 actually hunt herself who can 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.970
 to be hunted at 6 May but in the lived 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.560
 we see through the experience in the idea 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.810
 to be limited to thinking about things that 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.190
 exceed the others we'll see suddenly 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.080
 that in fact we are going to mass exile 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.760
 self-exiled we will self hunt we will 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.750
 link the two where we are at this moment 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:58.530
 there we make of us a kind of pariah in 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.600
 reject from society one marginal and one 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.709
 no longer finds your place our culture 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.110
 pass since the others can not 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.250
 understand it but we do not feel 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.580
 go if you remember in the map of 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.110
 world 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.760
 the moment we find two places and we 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.050
 find our utility we see the impact 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.000
 that we have on others we see 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.120
 the impact that others have on us and at this 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.310
 moment there it is said that if you sink I 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.900
 I'm gone with you, said the boat 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.380
 I do not care I followed the fury 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.930
 me 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.490
 so we really have 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.050
 completely different to see even though 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.290
 basically the principle remains the 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.080
 even 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.970
 so here for this last map we 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.590
 bought our major arcana there would be 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.550
 still so much to do we have 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.870
 the sixteen honors and the 40 miners I 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.160
 am honestly not sure about doing them 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.479
 according to envy perhaps perhaps the 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.710
 sixteen honor because I like a lot 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.500
 these cards I have a lot of affection 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.750
 for her so we'll see I'll see 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.340
 according to my program from my 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.479
 planning in any case that's always is 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.110
 he I hope it brought you 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.460
 some small information 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.710
 on the meaning of the cards of the months the meaning 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.450
 that I give them of course there 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.890
 is only one meaning these four 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.500
 meaning among hundreds 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.840
 there are many more but here we go 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.969
 these stories to find a little bit the 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.819
 common core the 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:11.719
 the kernel for each of these cards 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:12.649
 as for us, well I give you 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:15.079
 see you soon for 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:17.389
 other videos a lot of topics are 

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:18.619
 still discussed and will still be addressed and 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.699
 then bah by then as usual 

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:21.699
 take care of yourself
