to<00:03:31.199> emphasize<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> few<00:03:31.980> things<00:03:32.639> individually<00:03:34.669> I

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
to emphasize a few things individually I

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.159 
to emphasize a few things individually I
think<00:03:36.120> just<00:03:36.569> kind<00:03:36.629> of<00:03:36.750> learn<00:03:36.870> how<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:36.989> play

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
think just kind of learn how to play

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.649 
think just kind of learn how to play
your<00:03:37.290> game<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:38.400> learn<00:03:38.519> fairly<00:03:39.060> quickly<00:03:39.299> what

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
your game you learn fairly quickly what

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.229 
your game you learn fairly quickly what
we<00:03:40.169> need<00:03:40.379> to<00:03:40.470> focus<00:03:40.680> on<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.340> what<00:03:41.909> you<00:03:42.000> kind<00:03:42.120> of

we need to focus on and what you kind of

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.750 
we need to focus on and what you kind of
need<00:03:42.389> to<00:03:42.540> eliminate<00:03:42.690> just<00:03:43.620> kind<00:03:43.979> of<00:03:44.010> being

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
need to eliminate just kind of being

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.520 
need to eliminate just kind of being
efficient<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.479> sticking<00:03:46.139> to<00:03:46.260> what<00:03:46.379> you're

that<00:05:27.220> opportunity<00:05:27.820> obviously<00:05:27.940> it<00:05:28.300> didn't<00:05:28.510> pan

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
that opportunity obviously it didn't pan

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.360

but<00:05:32.520> like<00:05:33.520> I<00:05:33.610> said<00:05:33.820> it<00:05:33.940> in<00:05:34.419> retrospect<00:05:34.720> that

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
but like I said it in retrospect that

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.600 
but like I said it in retrospect that
doesn't<00:05:35.320> mean<00:05:35.410> a<00:05:35.440> whole<00:05:35.620> lot<00:05:35.650> but<00:05:36.010> like<00:05:36.310> it<00:05:36.430> was

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
doesn't mean a whole lot but like it was

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.310 
doesn't mean a whole lot but like it was
nice<00:05:36.790> to<00:05:36.970> give<00:05:37.240> us<00:05:37.360> that<00:05:37.540> opportunity<00:05:37.570> or<00:05:38.169> at

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
nice to give us that opportunity or at

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.480 
nice to give us that opportunity or at
least<00:05:38.470> contribute<00:05:38.919> to<00:05:39.040> giving<00:05:39.250> us<00:05:39.340> that

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
least contribute to giving us that

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.700 
least contribute to giving us that
opportunities<00:05:40.150> is<00:05:40.750> that<00:05:40.990> that<00:05:41.200> goal<00:05:41.440> and

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
opportunities is that that goal and

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.990 
opportunities is that that goal and
higher<00:05:41.950> build-up<00:05:42.340> was<00:05:42.490> obviously<00:05:42.880> a<00:05:42.970> huge

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
higher build-up was obviously a huge

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.750
