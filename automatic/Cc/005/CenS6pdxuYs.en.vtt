00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
as you can see so if you immediately

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.490 
as you can see so if you immediately
want<00:03:33.909> to<00:03:33.940> focus<00:03:34.299> to<00:03:34.419> a<00:03:34.449> particular<00:03:34.900> area<00:03:35.079> you

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
want to focus to a particular area you

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.119 
want to focus to a particular area you
can<00:03:35.799> always<00:03:36.040> hit<00:03:36.400> touch<00:03:36.609> tap<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.720> focus

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
can always hit touch tap to focus

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.800 
can always hit touch tap to focus
functionality<00:03:39.129> and<00:03:39.760> let<00:03:39.940> me<00:03:40.060> just<00:03:40.090> walk<00:03:40.540> back

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
functionality and let me just walk back

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.189 
functionality and let me just walk back
now<00:03:41.019> so<00:03:41.829> this<00:03:42.069> should<00:03:42.220> be<00:03:42.340> ready<00:03:42.989> recording<00:03:43.989> if

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
now so this should be ready recording if

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:51.350 
now so this should be ready recording if
you<00:03:44.229> are<00:03:44.500> walking

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.850 

so<00:03:52.360> this<00:03:52.750> should<00:03:52.900> be<00:03:52.960> an<00:03:53.260> early<00:03:53.500> about<00:03:53.710> the

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
so this should be an early about the

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.320 
so this should be an early about the
video<00:03:54.130> recording<00:03:54.520> with<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.820> redmi<00:03:55.120> 2<00:03:55.300> prime

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
video recording with the redmi 2 prime

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.800 
video recording with the redmi 2 prime
in<00:03:56.170> outdoor<00:03:56.470> conditions<00:03:57.450> now<00:03:58.450> these<00:03:58.660> were

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
in outdoor conditions now these were

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.570 
in outdoor conditions now these were
shot<00:03:58.990> in<00:03:59.140> semi<00:03:59.410> indoor<00:03:59.710> conditions<00:03:59.890> and<00:04:00.400> here

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
shot in semi indoor conditions and here

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.950 
shot in semi indoor conditions and here
you<00:04:00.700> have<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:00.910> be<00:04:00.940> careful<00:04:01.390> otherwise<00:04:01.510> the

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
you have to be careful otherwise the

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.390 
you have to be careful otherwise the
picture<00:04:02.260> can<00:04:02.440> come<00:04:02.650> out<00:04:02.800> to<00:04:02.890> be<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:03.040> little<00:04:03.280> bit

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
picture can come out to be a little bit

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.790 
picture can come out to be a little bit
shaky<00:04:04.120> I<00:04:04.150> would<00:04:04.420> say<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:05.020> it<00:04:05.170> was<00:04:05.320> sort<00:04:05.620> of<00:04:05.680> a

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
shaky I would say and it was sort of a

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.830 
shaky I would say and it was sort of a
hit<00:04:06.010> or<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.250> miss<00:04:06.610> if<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:06.850> are<00:04:07.150> careful<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.570> can

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
hit or a miss if you are careful you can

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.810 
hit or a miss if you are careful you can
get<00:04:08.020> some<00:04:08.170> decent<00:04:08.350> shots<00:04:08.590> even<00:04:09.220> in<00:04:09.550> semi

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
get some decent shots even in semi

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.300 
get some decent shots even in semi
indoor<00:04:10.270> conditions<00:04:10.620> but<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:11.770> need<00:04:11.950> to<00:04:12.100> have

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
indoor conditions but you need to have

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.400 
indoor conditions but you need to have
stable<00:04:13.030> hands<00:04:13.510> and<00:04:13.690> as<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:13.990> can<00:04:14.110> see<00:04:14.260> these

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
stable hands and as you can see these

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.080 
stable hands and as you can see these
are<00:04:14.620> some<00:04:14.650> decent<00:04:15.070> shots<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.670> some<00:04:15.820> indoor

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
are some decent shots and some indoor

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.479 
are some decent shots and some indoor
conditions<00:04:16.209> but<00:04:16.750> here<00:04:17.260> again<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:18.040> was<00:04:18.459> a

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
conditions but here again it was a

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.400 
conditions but here again it was a
little<00:04:18.730> bit<00:04:18.940> shaky<00:04:19.329> also<00:04:19.660> in<00:04:19.870> terms<00:04:20.260> of

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
little bit shaky also in terms of

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.410 
little bit shaky also in terms of
exposure<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.040> semi<00:04:21.370> indoor<00:04:21.670> conditions<00:04:21.790> it

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
exposure and semi indoor conditions it

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.200 
exposure and semi indoor conditions it
was<00:04:22.630> not<00:04:22.840> doing<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.230> great<00:04:23.800> shop<00:04:24.370> in<00:04:24.580> my<00:04:24.700> opinion

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
was not doing a great shop in my opinion

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.750 
was not doing a great shop in my opinion
and<00:04:25.420> here<00:04:26.140> I<00:04:26.170> use<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.710> flash<00:04:26.950> and<00:04:27.280> certainly

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
and here I use the flash and certainly

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.820 
and here I use the flash and certainly
the<00:04:28.000> flash<00:04:28.390> does<00:04:28.810> add<00:04:29.110> a<00:04:29.140> little<00:04:29.440> bit<00:04:29.710> of

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
the flash does add a little bit of

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.490 
the flash does add a little bit of
yellow<00:04:30.130> tint<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.300> pictures<00:04:31.960> when<00:04:32.170> you<00:04:32.320> use

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
yellow tint to the pictures when you use

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.700 
yellow tint to the pictures when you use
it<00:04:32.860> now<00:04:33.810> these<00:04:34.810> pictures<00:04:35.200> were<00:04:35.350> shot<00:04:35.590> in

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
it now these pictures were shot in

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.470 
it now these pictures were shot in
completely<00:04:36.370> artificial<00:04:36.760> lighting<00:04:37.120> in<00:04:37.360> my

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
completely artificial lighting in my

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.690 
completely artificial lighting in my
office<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:38.140> as<00:04:38.530> you<00:04:38.620> can<00:04:38.770> see<00:04:38.920> it<00:04:39.010> can<00:04:39.460> take

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
office and as you can see it can take

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.580 
office and as you can see it can take
some<00:04:39.910> decent<00:04:40.330> shots<00:04:40.390> but<00:04:40.960> you<00:04:41.110> have<00:04:41.290> to<00:04:41.440> be

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
some decent shots but you have to be

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.800 
some decent shots but you have to be
careful<00:04:42.070> because<00:04:42.460> in<00:04:42.790> sometimes<00:04:43.240> in<00:04:43.450> terms<00:04:43.480> of

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
careful because in sometimes in terms of

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.780 
careful because in sometimes in terms of
exposure<00:04:44.260> I<00:04:44.350> did<00:04:44.620> notice<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:44.980> exposure<00:04:45.490> went

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
exposure I did notice the exposure went

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.940 
exposure I did notice the exposure went
really<00:04:46.150> heavy<00:04:46.630> and<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.230> have<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.500> be<00:04:47.620> careful

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
really heavy and you have to be careful

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.409 
really heavy and you have to be careful
otherwise<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.430> pictures<00:04:48.760> will<00:04:49.000> come<00:04:49.030> out<00:04:49.300> to

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
otherwise the pictures will come out to

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.570 
otherwise the pictures will come out to
be<00:04:49.450> shaky<00:04:49.870> also<00:04:50.410> in<00:04:50.500> terms<00:04:50.740> of<00:04:50.860> exposure<00:04:51.310> and

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
be shaky also in terms of exposure and

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.580 
be shaky also in terms of exposure and
artificial<00:04:51.880> light<00:04:52.030> I<00:04:52.390> was<00:04:52.630> not<00:04:52.870> that<00:04:53.110> happy

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
artificial light I was not that happy

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.650 
artificial light I was not that happy
the<00:04:54.040> pictures<00:04:54.340> would<00:04:54.460> dull<00:04:54.850> and<00:04:55.150> as<00:04:55.419> you<00:04:55.510> can

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
the pictures would dull and as you can

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.180 
the pictures would dull and as you can
see<00:04:55.810> there<00:04:56.169> is<00:04:56.290> a<00:04:56.320> lot<00:04:56.530> of<00:04:56.560> shake<00:04:56.950> in<00:04:57.100> the

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
see there is a lot of shake in the

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.520 
see there is a lot of shake in the
pictures<00:04:57.520> if<00:04:57.640> you're<00:04:57.790> not<00:04:57.970> careful<00:04:58.380> but<00:04:59.380> if

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
pictures if you're not careful but if

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.260 
pictures if you're not careful but if
you<00:04:59.620> have<00:04:59.770> stable<00:05:00.160> hands<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.700> can<00:05:00.910> certainly

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
you have stable hands you can certainly

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.940 
you have stable hands you can certainly
take<00:05:01.630> some<00:05:01.870> pictures<00:05:02.140> even<00:05:02.290> an<00:05:02.530> artificial

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
take some pictures even an artificial

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.430 
take some pictures even an artificial
light<00:05:03.370> thing<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:03.820> here<00:05:04.300> flash<00:05:04.690> was<00:05:04.900> disabled

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
light thing and here flash was disabled

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.219 
light thing and here flash was disabled
and<00:05:05.530> here<00:05:05.860> I<00:05:05.890> enable<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.580> flash<00:05:07.270> again<00:05:08.050> the

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
and here I enable the flash again the

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.080 
and here I enable the flash again the
flash<00:05:08.470> is<00:05:08.710> not<00:05:08.950> that<00:05:09.160> aggressive<00:05:09.340> in<00:05:09.760> indoor

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
flash is not that aggressive in indoor

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.909 
flash is not that aggressive in indoor
lighting<00:05:10.300> conditions<00:05:10.990> in<00:05:11.140> my<00:05:11.290> opinion

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
lighting conditions in my opinion

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.130 
lighting conditions in my opinion
frankly<00:05:12.850> speaking<00:05:13.000> in<00:05:13.390> indoor<00:05:13.660> lighting<00:05:13.870> I

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
frankly speaking in indoor lighting I

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.690 
frankly speaking in indoor lighting I
didn't<00:05:14.380> expect<00:05:14.770> it<00:05:14.890> to<00:05:14.919> do<00:05:15.190> a<00:05:15.220> little<00:05:15.580> bit

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
didn't expect it to do a little bit

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.030 
didn't expect it to do a little bit
better<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:17.020> front-facing<00:05:17.350> camera<00:05:17.950> an

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
better the front-facing camera an

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.409 
better the front-facing camera an
outdoor<00:05:18.400> lighting<00:05:18.700> conditions<00:05:19.180> does<00:05:19.390> a

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
outdoor lighting conditions does a

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.570 
outdoor lighting conditions does a
decent<00:05:19.900> job<00:05:20.050> for<00:05:20.260> a<00:05:20.290> 2<00:05:20.500> megapixel<00:05:21.070> shooter<00:05:21.100> and

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
decent job for a 2 megapixel shooter and

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.850 
decent job for a 2 megapixel shooter and
but<00:05:22.450> again<00:05:22.630> it's<00:05:22.900> not<00:05:23.050> very<00:05:23.410> sharp<00:05:23.710> you<00:05:23.770> have

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
but again it's not very sharp you have

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.980 
but again it's not very sharp you have
to<00:05:24.070> be<00:05:24.160> careful<00:05:24.610> even<00:05:25.300> in<00:05:25.419> semi<00:05:25.660> indoor

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
to be careful even in semi indoor

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.810 
to be careful even in semi indoor
conditions<00:05:26.169> it<00:05:26.680> does<00:05:27.040> a<00:05:27.070> decent<00:05:27.430> job<00:05:27.760> but

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
conditions it does a decent job but

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.120 
conditions it does a decent job but
again<00:05:28.180> I<00:05:28.300> won't<00:05:28.450> say<00:05:28.690> its<00:05:28.870> outstanding<00:05:29.350> and<00:05:29.830> by

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
again I won't say its outstanding and by

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.710 
again I won't say its outstanding and by
default<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.610> beautification<00:05:31.030> option<00:05:31.630> is

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
default the beautification option is

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.409 
default the beautification option is
enabled<00:05:32.050> so<00:05:32.440> I<00:05:32.860> would<00:05:33.130> say<00:05:33.340> just<00:05:33.580> tone<00:05:33.910> it<00:05:33.940> down

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
enabled so I would say just tone it down

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.360 
enabled so I would say just tone it down

an front-facing camera is ready to prime

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.350 
an front-facing camera is ready to prime
and<00:05:38.919> this<00:05:39.010> isn't<00:05:39.160> completely<00:05:40.000> artificial

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
and this isn't completely artificial

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.140 
and this isn't completely artificial
like<00:05:40.690> a<00:05:40.720> conveyor<00:05:41.200> off<00:05:41.560> first<00:05:42.220> and<00:05:42.430> one<00:05:42.970> thing

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
like a conveyor off first and one thing

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.550 
like a conveyor off first and one thing
that<00:05:43.330> I've<00:05:43.479> noticed<00:05:43.660> is<00:05:43.990> that<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.380> video

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
that I've noticed is that the video

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
only up to 720p not full HD so what do I

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.320 
only up to 720p not full HD so what do I
feel<00:05:50.979> about<00:05:51.220> the<00:05:51.400> camera<00:05:51.729> performance<00:05:52.150> on

the sample shots the rear facing camera
in<00:05:56.110> outdoor<00:05:56.290> conditions<00:05:56.979> does<00:05:57.430> a<00:05:57.460> very<00:05:57.760> good

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
in outdoor conditions does a very good

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.880 
in outdoor conditions does a very good
job<00:05:58.060> even<00:05:58.690> the<00:05:58.930> good<00:05:59.050> thing<00:05:59.229> is<00:05:59.380> that<00:05:59.410> even

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
job even the good thing is that even

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
to be in

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.620 
to be in

nice and they have very good detail in
ample<00:06:05.170> lighting<00:06:05.410> but<00:06:05.980> when<00:06:06.160> we<00:06:06.280> moved<00:06:06.490> to

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
ample lighting but when we moved to

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.890 
ample lighting but when we moved to
indoor<00:06:06.970> lighting<00:06:07.180> and<00:06:07.420> a<00:06:07.450> hide<00:06:07.570> efficient

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
indoor lighting and a hide efficient

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.050 
indoor lighting and a hide efficient
lighting<00:06:08.110> I<00:06:08.410> was<00:06:08.740> not<00:06:09.040> that<00:06:09.340> impressed<00:06:09.760> with

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
lighting I was not that impressed with

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.060 
lighting I was not that impressed with
this<00:06:10.210> camera<00:06:10.450> yes<00:06:10.810> you<00:06:11.170> can<00:06:11.380> take<00:06:11.560> some<00:06:11.740> decent

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
this camera yes you can take some decent

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.220 
this camera yes you can take some decent
shots<00:06:12.130> but<00:06:12.640> most<00:06:13.210> of<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:13.450> times<00:06:13.660> the<00:06:13.930> pictures

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 
shots but most of the times the pictures

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.780 
shots but most of the times the pictures
might<00:06:14.410> come<00:06:14.680> out<00:06:14.800> to<00:06:14.920> be<00:06:14.950> blurry<00:06:15.280> so<00:06:15.550> you<00:06:15.610> have

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
might come out to be blurry so you have

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.060 
might come out to be blurry so you have
to<00:06:15.910> take<00:06:16.060> multiple<00:06:16.630> shots<00:06:16.690> in<00:06:17.350> fact<00:06:17.770> I<00:06:17.890> would

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
to take multiple shots in fact I would

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.120 
to take multiple shots in fact I would
say<00:06:18.100> the<00:06:18.730> original<00:06:19.210> read<00:06:19.450> me<00:06:19.600> one<00:06:19.960> did<00:06:20.680> a<00:06:20.860> lot

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
say the original read me one did a lot

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.190 
say the original read me one did a lot
better<00:06:21.460> in<00:06:21.760> the<00:06:21.820> camera<00:06:22.540> department<00:06:23.080> in

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
better in the camera department in

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.590 
better in the camera department in
artificial<00:06:23.710> lighting<00:06:24.070> here<00:06:24.670> it<00:06:24.880> was<00:06:25.030> not<00:06:25.330> that

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
artificial lighting here it was not that

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.690 
artificial lighting here it was not that
great<00:06:25.870> yes<00:06:26.140> we<00:06:26.410> have<00:06:26.710> flash<00:06:27.010> and<00:06:27.280> in<00:06:27.370> fact<00:06:27.580> I

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
great yes we have flash and in fact I

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.460 
great yes we have flash and in fact I
would<00:06:27.880> say<00:06:27.910> many<00:06:28.480> of<00:06:28.630> the<00:06:28.720> times<00:06:28.960> the<00:06:29.230> flash

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
would say many of the times the flash

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.350 
would say many of the times the flash
does<00:06:29.770> not<00:06:29.980> fire<00:06:30.280> in<00:06:30.490> artificial<00:06:30.820> lightning

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
does not fire in artificial lightning

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.180 
does not fire in artificial lightning
and<00:06:31.570> hence<00:06:32.200> the<00:06:32.380> picture<00:06:32.680> come<00:06:32.890> out<00:06:33.040> to<00:06:33.160> be

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
and hence the picture come out to be

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.940 
and hence the picture come out to be
really<00:06:33.460> dull<00:06:34.120> and<00:06:34.330> soft<00:06:34.870> but<00:06:35.170> when<00:06:35.860> you

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
really dull and soft but when you

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.650 
really dull and soft but when you
manually<00:06:36.340> toggle<00:06:36.760> the<00:06:36.850> flash<00:06:37.060> the<00:06:37.330> pictures

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660 
manually toggle the flash the pictures

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.660 
manually toggle the flash the pictures
come<00:06:37.810> out<00:06:37.930> to<00:06:38.050> be<00:06:38.080> a<00:06:38.320> lot<00:06:38.770> better<00:06:39.040> but<00:06:39.310> again<00:06:39.460> I

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
come out to be a lot better but again I

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.610 
come out to be a lot better but again I
did<00:06:40.060> notice<00:06:40.240> that<00:06:40.390> if<00:06:40.750> you<00:06:40.810> enable<00:06:41.080> the<00:06:41.320> flash

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
did notice that if you enable the flash

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.980 
did notice that if you enable the flash
there<00:06:42.220> is<00:06:42.340> a<00:06:42.370> slight<00:06:42.670> yellow<00:06:42.700> tint<00:06:43.600> to<00:06:43.840> the

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
there is a slight yellow tint to the

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.810 
there is a slight yellow tint to the
pictures<00:06:44.860> now<00:06:45.280> if<00:06:45.400> we<00:06:45.490> move<00:06:45.670> to<00:06:45.790> the

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
pictures now if we move to the

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.550 
pictures now if we move to the
front-facing<00:06:46.300> camera<00:06:46.930> in<00:06:47.170> outdoor

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
front-facing camera in outdoor

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.350 
front-facing camera in outdoor
conditions<00:06:48.100> it's<00:06:48.490> okay<00:06:48.940> I<00:06:48.970> would<00:06:49.090> say<00:06:49.270> it's

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
conditions it's okay I would say it's

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.050 
conditions it's okay I would say it's
not<00:06:49.420> spectacular<00:06:50.200> just<00:06:50.890> okay<00:06:51.250> but<00:06:51.430> again<00:06:51.760> when

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
not spectacular just okay but again when

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.430 
not spectacular just okay but again when
we<00:06:52.150> move<00:06:52.360> to<00:06:52.390> indoor<00:06:52.870> lighting<00:06:53.110> and<00:06:53.380> an

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
we move to indoor lighting and an

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.290 
we move to indoor lighting and an
artificial<00:06:53.860> lighting<00:06:54.160> again<00:06:54.670> the<00:06:54.940> camera

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
artificial lighting again the camera

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.760 
artificial lighting again the camera
performance<00:06:55.750> with<00:06:55.900> the<00:06:55.990> front-facing<00:06:56.380> camera

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
performance with the front-facing camera

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.680 
performance with the front-facing camera
was<00:06:56.950> also<00:06:57.190> not<00:06:57.400> good<00:06:57.640> in<00:06:57.760> fact<00:06:58.090> the<00:06:58.300> video<00:06:58.420> that

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
was also not good in fact the video that

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.060 
was also not good in fact the video that
we<00:06:58.810> took<00:06:58.930> with<00:06:59.080> the<00:06:59.110> front-facing<00:06:59.560> camera<00:06:59.950> in

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
we took with the front-facing camera in

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.620 
we took with the front-facing camera in
indoor<00:07:00.340> lighting<00:07:00.520> conditions<00:07:01.060> was<00:07:01.210> really

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
indoor lighting conditions was really

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.930 
indoor lighting conditions was really
really<00:07:01.870> soft<00:07:02.470> so<00:07:02.920> I<00:07:02.950> would<00:07:03.250> say<00:07:03.430> the

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 
really soft so I would say the

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.820 
really soft so I would say the
rear-facing<00:07:04.150> camera<00:07:04.870> performance<00:07:05.320> is<00:07:05.530> good

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 
rear-facing camera performance is good

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.770 
rear-facing camera performance is good
in<00:07:05.950> outdoor<00:07:06.430> lighting<00:07:06.850> but<00:07:07.270> again<00:07:07.480> when<00:07:07.660> we

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:07.780 
in outdoor lighting but again when we

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.030 
in outdoor lighting but again when we
move<00:07:07.960> to<00:07:08.110> indoor<00:07:08.500> lighting<00:07:08.710> and<00:07:08.950> an

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.040 
move to indoor lighting and an

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.380 
move to indoor lighting and an
artificial<00:07:09.430> lighting<00:07:09.730> the<00:07:10.150> camera

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.390 
artificial lighting the camera

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.960 
artificial lighting the camera
performance<00:07:10.990> is<00:07:11.140> just<00:07:11.410> very<00:07:11.680> average<00:07:12.340> and<00:07:12.550> I

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:12.970 
performance is just very average and I

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.880 
performance is just very average and I
would<00:07:13.180> say<00:07:13.330> if<00:07:13.480> we<00:07:13.510> start<00:07:13.690> to<00:07:14.110> rate<00:07:14.320> compare<00:07:14.740> it

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:14.890 
would say if we start to rate compare it

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.770 
would say if we start to rate compare it
yes<00:07:15.370> it's<00:07:15.580> still<00:07:15.850> better<00:07:16.090> than<00:07:16.300> the<00:07:16.360> lenovo

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:16.780 
yes it's still better than the lenovo

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.920 
yes it's still better than the lenovo
a6000<00:07:17.620> plus<00:07:17.860> but<00:07:18.370> again<00:07:18.580> I<00:07:18.790> did<00:07:19.030> expect<00:07:19.450> a<00:07:19.570> lot

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:19.930 
a6000 plus but again I did expect a lot
