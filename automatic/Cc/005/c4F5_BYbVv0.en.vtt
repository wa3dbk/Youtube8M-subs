first and foremost I'm going to start

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.100 
first and foremost I'm going to start
from<00:00:07.470> top<00:00:07.680> down<00:00:07.709> so<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:09.299> antenna<00:00:09.599> up<00:00:09.719> dude

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
from top down so the antenna up dude

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.770 
from top down so the antenna up dude
so<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.440> got<00:00:10.679> mine<00:00:10.889> installed<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.780> magnetic

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
so I got mine installed a magnetic

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.900 
so I got mine installed a magnetic
content<00:00:13.080> on<00:00:13.169> the<00:00:13.259> roof<00:00:13.410> ran<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.490> cable<00:00:14.610> on

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
content on the roof ran the cable on

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.400 
content on the roof ran the cable on
down<00:00:16.099> it<00:00:17.099> taped<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.519> to<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:19.820> frame<00:00:21.140> ran<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.289> in

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
down it taped it to the frame ran it in

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.109 
down it taped it to the frame ran it in
through<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.689> vent<00:00:24.689> window<00:00:25.019> here<00:00:25.820> and<00:00:26.820> then

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
through the vent window here and then

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:39.010 
through the vent window here and then
from<00:00:27.330> then<00:00:27.509> on<00:00:27.539> it's<00:00:27.660> just<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.259> the<00:00:28.380> inside<00:00:37.010> so

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
from then on it's just on the inside so

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.860 
from then on it's just on the inside so
basically<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.380> my<00:00:40.530> unit<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.870> Cobra

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
basically this is my unit it's a Cobra

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.100 
basically this is my unit it's a Cobra
1903<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.940> pretty<00:00:45.270> basic<00:00:47.510> first<00:00:48.510> off<00:00:48.750> let's

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
1903 it's a pretty basic first off let's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.160 
1903 it's a pretty basic first off let's
start<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.830> cord<00:00:50.630> antenna<00:00:51.630> cord<00:00:51.900> comes

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
start with the cord antenna cord comes

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.150 
start with the cord antenna cord comes
around<00:00:52.470> it<00:00:52.680> plugs<00:00:53.220> into<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.580> back<00:00:53.760> room<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
around it plugs into the back room and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.300 
around it plugs into the back room and
from<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> back<00:00:56.520> you've<00:00:57.360> got<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.130> you<00:00:59.130> got

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
from the back you've got this so you got

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.250 
from the back you've got this so you got
your<00:00:59.430> Bob<00:00:59.640> actual<00:01:00.390> power<00:01:00.600> cord<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.140> your

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
your Bob actual power cord and your

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.939 
your Bob actual power cord and your
ground<00:01:01.560> so<00:01:02.310> for<00:01:02.790> my<00:01:02.880> ground<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
ground so for my ground I just have a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.459 
ground so for my ground I just have a
screw<00:01:05.219> here<00:01:05.429> and<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.750> ran<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.899> up<00:01:07.020> into<00:01:07.320> there

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
screw here and I ran it up into there

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:11.029 
screw here and I ran it up into there
and<00:01:07.679> screwed<00:01:08.189> her<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> power<00:01:10.710> I

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
and screwed her in and for the power I

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:14.630 
and screwed her in and for the power I
already<00:01:12.030> had<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.619> direct<00:01:13.619> feed<00:01:13.920> line<00:01:14.189> don't

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
already had a direct feed line don't

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.679 
already had a direct feed line don't
like<00:01:14.850> see<00:01:15.060> my<00:01:15.240> battery<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:16.350> my<00:01:16.499> radio<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:18.149> so

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
like see my battery for my radio and so

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.209 
like see my battery for my radio and so
I<00:01:18.929> just<00:01:19.259> came<00:01:19.499> in<00:01:19.770> here<00:01:20.840> spliced<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.469> wire

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
I just came in here spliced it in a wire

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.179 
I just came in here spliced it in a wire
not<00:01:23.399> there<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.109> came<00:01:25.109> in<00:01:25.320> eventually<00:01:26.039> I'm

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
not there and came in eventually I'm

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.109 
not there and came in eventually I'm
thinking<00:01:26.579> about<00:01:28.369> running<00:01:29.369> my<00:01:30.560> antenna<00:01:31.560> cord

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
thinking about running my antenna cord

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.450 
thinking about running my antenna cord
through<00:01:33.119> one<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.359> these<00:01:33.509> holes<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:34.460> like

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
through one of these holes here like

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.599 
through one of these holes here like
bringing<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.149> on<00:01:36.270> around<00:01:37.109> down<00:01:37.319> through<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.549> to

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
bringing it on around down through so to

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.279 
bringing it on around down through so to
clean<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.359> inside<00:01:39.719> here<00:01:39.929> so<00:01:40.109> it's<00:01:40.200> not

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
clean up the inside here so it's not

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.160 
clean up the inside here so it's not
just<00:01:40.350> dangling<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.909> only<00:01:42.179> issue<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.569> that<00:01:42.810> at

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
just dangling the only issue is that at

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.249 
just dangling the only issue is that at
the<00:01:43.319> moment<00:01:43.369> there's<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.460> big<00:01:45.119> end<00:01:45.420> where<00:01:46.109> it

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the moment there's a big end where it

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.410 
the moment there's a big end where it
plugs<00:01:46.590> into<00:01:46.889> the<00:01:47.039> back<00:01:47.219> on<00:01:47.429> there<00:01:47.609> that<00:01:48.179> can't

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
plugs into the back on there that can't

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.819 
plugs into the back on there that can't
get<00:01:48.539> through<00:01:48.749> any<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.960> these<00:01:49.079> holes<00:01:49.319> yet<00:01:49.590> so

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
get through any of these holes yet so

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.219 
get through any of these holes yet so
I'm<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.039> gonna<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.569> probably<00:01:51.569> man<00:01:51.960> up

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
I'm just gonna have to probably man up

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.889 
I'm just gonna have to probably man up
and<00:01:52.380> buy<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.799> bigger<00:01:53.789> drill<00:01:54.119> bit<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.689> can

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
and buy a bigger drill bit so I can

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.039 
and buy a bigger drill bit so I can
finish<00:01:55.409> her<00:01:55.679> up<00:01:56.569> so<00:01:57.569> back<00:01:58.289> onto<00:01:58.530> here<00:01:59.929> come<00:02:00.929> on

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
finish her up so back onto here come on

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.510 
finish her up so back onto here come on
down<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.380> here

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
down in here

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.719 
down in here
if<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.600> look<00:02:03.840> back<00:02:04.140> there<00:02:04.470> you<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.220> see<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
if you look back there you can see the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.960 
if you look back there you can see the
