00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.810
 in another session came here today 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.440
 together in the northern part of the reef test the new sedan renault the subject and 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.030
 no one better than he had a mechanic the technical consultant and 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.789
 automobiles 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.130
 is the situation may be near the goal 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.910
 was carried out as well as 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.110
 we need to prepare to be so close by when I go there 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.240
 Yes, I'll tell all of you that if you were to be made with 110 horses of 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.250
 power 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.920
 aiming highlighted the good handling of the car and is known as strengths 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.920
 visibility say that there are 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.370
 has a good internal space 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.940
 the marches are very well staggered well positioned 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.110
 the visibility of the car is also very good 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.550
 safe direction sr 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.080
 the manu mal singer 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.880
 I accompany this more tactical text with digital air conditioning with 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.490
 They are new latin 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.060
 the ic of comfort and safety have also pleased this year 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.930
 some safety aspects such as double air bag 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.590
 the total debt the driver told the passenger 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.290
 Electric rearview controls this is a convenience with shaking is 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.860
 really a car is well aligned with the most current technologies wasting time 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.100
 this morning showing good view 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.659
 The highlight of the day is on my back with chrome accents that 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.720
 consume more energy in your car 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.730
 according to the center he could be more dashing is a drawing owner of the car he 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.060
 it looks like it could be a bit more modern inside a chest a text from another 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.660
 direct competitor in the market today 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.660
 it seemed to me a more pleasant drawing more daring another point to 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.959
 improve is the inter- 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.339
 I realize a certain lack of government 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:19.019
 So 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.879
 by a segment car of the compact sedans proposes a luxury car 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.859
 a little more social where we already expect a little more comfort 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:31.079
 my impression is that it is little of everything land 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.299
 we notice a lot of the common external noise and sound insulation 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.369
 his 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:38.369
 was a little short of what should be the safety car 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.250
 but nothing that compromises matter to the point of becoming comfortable condition 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.279
 goal 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.669
 but this is the cat's French finances 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:53.299
 they're proof of the 5 compact sedan so it's good 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.419
 I think that today it is confronted with its market price and presented the 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.439
 mutual benefit cost ratio 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.120
 for those who like to have a compact sedan I'd say it's a 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.119
 good option c 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:18.159
 now
