00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:13.990 
studied Verdi a lot and that that taught
him<00:01:09.920> how<00:01:10.190> to<00:01:11.649> contrast<00:01:12.649> the<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.580> chorus

that<00:02:18.340> has<00:02:19.340> in<00:02:20.209> my<00:02:20.480> opinion<00:02:21.099> faded<00:02:22.099> a<00:02:22.159> little

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
that has in my opinion faded a little

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.270 
that has in my opinion faded a little
bit<00:02:22.610> because<00:02:22.909> it<00:02:23.690> takes<00:02:24.019> a<00:02:24.170> tremendous<00:02:24.379> amount

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
bit because it takes a tremendous amount

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.100 
bit because it takes a tremendous amount
of<00:02:26.170> discipline<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.409> be<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.340> precise

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
of discipline to be that precise

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.649 
of discipline to be that precise
normally<00:02:30.110> when<00:02:30.290> you're<00:02:30.440> moving<00:02:30.680> quickly<00:02:30.950> you

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
normally when you're moving quickly you

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.790 
normally when you're moving quickly you
even<00:02:32.659> in<00:02:32.780> life<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.170> want<00:02:33.349> to<00:02:33.409> cut<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> corner

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
even in life you want to cut a corner

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.229 
even in life you want to cut a corner
you're<00:02:34.040> in<00:02:34.159> a<00:02:34.250> hurry<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.550> get<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.909> office

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
you cut the corner and in in ballet you

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.360 
you cut the corner and in in ballet you
shouldn't<00:02:38.810> cut<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.019> corner<00:02:39.319> you<00:02:39.409> still<00:02:39.650> have

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
shouldn't cut the corner you still have

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.850 
shouldn't cut the corner you still have
in<00:02:40.760> his<00:02:41.209> choreography<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.989> still<00:02:42.260> want<00:02:42.500> to

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
in his choreography you still want to

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.100 
in his choreography you still want to
make<00:02:43.069> everything<00:02:43.400> as<00:02:43.640> precise<00:02:44.030> but<00:02:44.810> just

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
make everything as precise but just

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.130 
make everything as precise but just
faster<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:45.950> that's<00:02:46.220> really<00:02:46.459> hard

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
faster and that's really hard

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:59.710 
faster and that's really hard
you

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720
