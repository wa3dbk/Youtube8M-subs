00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
a lamp in there with a heat bulb in

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.210 
a lamp in there with a heat bulb in
there<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> little<00:01:20.909> hundred<00:01:21.299> 25<00:01:21.689> watts<00:01:21.990> so

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
there just a little hundred 25 watts so

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.260 
there just a little hundred 25 watts so
but<00:01:23.220> for<00:01:23.400> right<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.909> should<00:01:24.090> work

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
but for right now this should work

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.929 
but for right now this should work
pretty<00:01:24.450> good<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:25.250> got<00:01:26.250> their<00:01:26.430> heated<00:01:26.729> water

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
pretty good I got their heated water

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.039 
pretty good I got their heated water
pail<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.329> was<00:01:30.479> about<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.750> six

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
pail out here and there was about a six

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.719 
pail out here and there was about a six
inch<00:01:31.200> space<00:01:31.530> between<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.100> fence<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
inch space between the fence and the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.450 
inch space between the fence and the
actual<00:01:33.060> doghouse<00:01:33.860> when<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> put<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.310> this

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
actual doghouse when I put it in this

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.950 
actual doghouse when I put it in this
spring<00:01:35.790> when<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.939> moved<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> kennel<00:01:36.600> out<00:01:36.689> here

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
spring when I moved the kennel out here

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.950 
spring when I moved the kennel out here
so<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.470> took<00:01:37.680> him<00:01:37.890> shoved<00:01:38.540> straw<00:01:39.540> all<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
so I just took him shoved straw all the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.420 
so I just took him shoved straw all the
way<00:01:40.049> back<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:42.860> think<00:01:43.860> that'll<00:01:44.070> work<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
way back I think that'll work for the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.760 
way back I think that'll work for the
good<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.939> would<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.750> insulated<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.290> top<00:01:46.500> but

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
good I would have insulated the top but

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.980 
good I would have insulated the top but
snow<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> great<00:01:47.700> insulator<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.479> we'll<00:01:48.780> just

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
