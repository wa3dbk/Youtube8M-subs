00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.650
 Chili sauce very easy to make from 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:26.970
 This way they are delicious right away 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.130
 I will show you my way of doing them 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.210
 these are the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.770
 occupy a pound and a half ribs of 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.790
 pig pork ribs about two 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.700

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.570
 automatic about four 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.280
 Two chilies but this is 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.220
 optional because they can use chile 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.050
 serrano chile jalapeÃ±o and I have a 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.130
 chile guajillo that I already have it here 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.600
 hydrated a pinch of parsley a pinch 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:06.290
 of thyme dad who is also optional 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:11.200

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.079
 oil and also a clove of garlic 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.630

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.549

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.399
 oil and there we will add our 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:29.590
 pork ribs we are going to season them 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:31.560
 with pepper and salt we are going to fry them there 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.060
 to sear our ribs for 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.040
 approximately about 10 to 15 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.530
 minutes 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.230
 and after they are golden brown 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.890

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:57.030
 and with the already roasted our tomatoes 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.440

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.620
 about a cup of water depends 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.050

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.140

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.030
