 easy the ingredients are the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.800
 following

00:00:50.080 --> 00:01:07.390
 [Music] 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.550
 we add half the sugar and 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:19.850
 we keep mixing 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:22.040
 [Music] 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.770
 then we add the rest of the 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:30.730
 sugar and we keep mixing 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.730
 [Music] 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.329
 we take a small part of the milk and 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.400
 add it to the mixture beat very 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:02:02.520
 well and we reserve 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:02:04.960
 [Music] 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.420
 in a pot we heat the rest of the 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.039
 milk we add the orange shell and 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:18.200
 the vanilla 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:20.310
 [Music] 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.410
 we mix very well until the milk 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.940
 start to boil you have to mix to 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.950
 that the milk does not stick to the edge and 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.900
 burn this you can do it to fire 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.459
 medium or if they want to do it faster 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.080
 place the fire high but they are 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.410
 pending that the milk is not going to 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.770
 burn 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.910
 [Music] 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.240
 [Applause] 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.620
 [Music] 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:48.910
 [Applause] 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:50.680
 [Music] 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.540
 now this part is very important 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.520
 they have to mix the milk that is 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.530
 hot with the egg mixture that 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.720
 we did previously but they have to 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.160
 beat energetically because if not 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.560
 we make this the egg can be cooked 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.970
 forming clots we do this for 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.860
 that the mixture is cooking 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.010
 homogeneous way 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.569
 [Music] 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.200
 We are adding little by little the milk and 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.200
 mixing well 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.599
 [Music] 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.840
 when we have mixed everything we carry 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:22.199
 fire again and we keep beating 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.199
 [Music] 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.640
 cook on medium heat until it starts 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:32.760
 boil 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:35.140
 [Music] 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.530
 after he breaks the ship, but by 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:49.900
 one more minute 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:52.340
 [Music] 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.950
 They hold the fire and let the 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.849
 custard cream 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.849
 [Music] 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.610
 think that an attack of this texture is 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.610
 homogeneous smooth and smooth 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.300
 and our pastry cream is ready 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.740
 they can store it in the fridge and then 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.740
 use it for any preparation 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.169
