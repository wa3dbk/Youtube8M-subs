00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:04.640 
softness is power when it's used

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.420 
softness is power when it's used
appropriately<00:00:05.680> tension<00:00:06.680> in<00:00:06.770> the<00:00:06.859> body<00:00:07.009> cuts

off<00:00:07.609> power<00:00:07.870> the<00:00:08.870> closer<00:00:09.139> attention<00:00:09.320> is<00:00:09.710> to<00:00:09.830> the

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
off power the closer attention is to the

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.499 
off power the closer attention is to the
point<00:00:10.190> of<00:00:10.309> impact<00:00:10.700> so<00:00:10.910> in<00:00:11.059> other<00:00:11.150> words<00:00:11.300> if<00:00:11.389> I'm

tensing<00:00:12.200> it<00:00:12.320> my<00:00:12.440> wrists<00:00:12.889> to<00:00:13.580> hit<00:00:13.790> then<00:00:14.330> you're

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
tensing it my wrists to hit then you're

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.640 
tensing it my wrists to hit then you're
really<00:00:14.630> hitting<00:00:14.870> from<00:00:15.080> your<00:00:15.200> risk<00:00:15.410> to<00:00:15.589> your

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
fist and what happens is most people you

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.609 
fist and what happens is most people you
can<00:00:17.390> hit<00:00:17.480> them<00:00:17.570> as<00:00:17.660> hard<00:00:17.720> as<00:00:17.960> you<00:00:18.050> want<00:00:18.079> with

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
that they won't like it but they can

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.100 
that they won't like it but they can
take<00:00:21.410> it<00:00:21.619> most<00:00:22.220> of<00:00:22.399> the<00:00:22.460> time<00:00:22.730> now<00:00:23.660> that<00:00:23.960> is

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
take it most of the time now that is

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.650 
take it most of the time now that is
different<00:00:24.259> than<00:00:24.590> putting<00:00:24.739> in<00:00:25.009> tension<00:00:25.610> to<00:00:26.540> the

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
different than putting in tension to the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.389 
different than putting in tension to the
end<00:00:26.779> of<00:00:26.899> your<00:00:26.989> fist<00:00:27.290> I'm<00:00:27.860> not<00:00:27.980> talking<00:00:28.340> about

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:28.399 
end of your fist I'm not talking about

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.269 
end of your fist I'm not talking about
intention<00:00:29.059> I'm<00:00:29.180> talking<00:00:29.480> about<00:00:29.540> tension<00:00:30.320> and

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
intention I'm talking about tension and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.470 
intention I'm talking about tension and
so<00:00:31.399> if<00:00:31.489> the<00:00:31.610> tensions<00:00:32.000> there<00:00:32.119> and<00:00:32.270> it's<00:00:32.360> cut

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
so if the tensions there and it's cut

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.640 
so if the tensions there and it's cut
off<00:00:32.599> you're<00:00:32.809> just<00:00:32.870> hitting<00:00:33.140> them<00:00:33.320> with<00:00:33.380> the

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
off you're just hitting them with the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.970 
off you're just hitting them with the
end<00:00:33.950> of<00:00:34.280> your<00:00:34.430> hand<00:00:34.790> and<00:00:35.290> it's<00:00:36.290> just<00:00:36.500> not<00:00:36.680> much

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
end of your hand and it's just not much

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.500

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.700 
more force than I'm hit for me at least
at<00:00:38.810> the<00:00:38.840> moment<00:00:38.930> than<00:00:39.230> what<00:00:39.350> I'm<00:00:39.440> hitting<00:00:39.650> my

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
tossing it and I tossing it notice that

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.540 
tossing it and I tossing it notice that
was<00:04:57.800> a<00:04:57.830> lot<00:04:58.039> stronger<00:04:58.370> of<00:04:59.300> a<00:04:59.740> push<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:00.770> him<00:05:01.220> even

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
was a lot stronger of a push to him even

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.439 
was a lot stronger of a push to him even
though<00:05:01.580> it<00:05:01.699> was<00:05:01.820> less<00:05:02.000> to<00:05:02.150> use<00:05:02.270> now<00:05:02.389> the

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
though it was less to use now the

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.779 
though it was less to use now the
lighter<00:05:02.750> you<00:05:03.050> go<00:05:03.289> while<00:05:04.190> keeping<00:05:04.490> your<00:05:04.639> mind

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
lighter you go while keeping your mind

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
intent that way of just here you go that

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.439 
intent that way of just here you go that
will<00:05:09.139> be<00:05:09.259> that<00:05:09.470> much<00:05:09.710> more<00:05:10.030> juice<00:05:11.030> now<00:05:11.270> that

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
will be that much more juice now that

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.150 
will be that much more juice now that
time<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:11.780> put<00:05:11.990> power<00:05:12.259> into<00:05:12.680> it<00:05:12.710> right<00:05:15.160> think

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
time you put power into it right think

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.740 
time you put power into it right think
about<00:05:16.370> getting<00:05:16.639> your<00:05:16.759> hands<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:17.330> him<00:05:17.539> and

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
still being light and continuing through

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.659 
still being light and continuing through
as<00:05:21.470> your<00:05:21.770> hands<00:05:21.949> get<00:05:22.130> to<00:05:22.250> him<00:05:22.340> so<00:05:22.370> you<00:05:22.460> don't

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
as your hands get to him so you don't

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.300 
as your hands get to him so you don't

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
melting across the floor and then the

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.219 
melting across the floor and then the
more<00:05:44.680> softer<00:05:45.680> water<00:05:46.360> no<00:05:47.360> effort<00:05:47.690> quality<00:05:48.139> you

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
more softer water no effort quality you

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.149 
more softer water no effort quality you
can<00:05:48.409> make<00:05:48.560> it<00:05:48.740> the<00:05:48.979> better<00:05:49.190> it<00:05:49.370> is

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
can make it the better it is

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.830 
can make it the better it is
notice<00:05:52.159> that<00:05:52.280> had<00:05:52.490> a<00:05:52.520> lot<00:05:52.729> more<00:05:52.970> to<00:05:53.240> it<00:05:53.270> and<00:05:53.479> yet

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
notice that had a lot more to it and yet

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.649 
notice that had a lot more to it and yet
you<00:05:54.110> use<00:05:54.349> less<00:05:54.909> that's<00:05:55.909> so<00:05:56.210> and<00:05:56.360> then<00:05:56.479> he'll

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:56.659 
you use less that's so and then he'll

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:57.969
