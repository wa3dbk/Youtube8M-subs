00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.590
 who the basics on the mountain bike 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.510
 dominated'd like, of course, 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.470
 go on and new challenges 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.290
 search 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.460
 catch people on a parking deck at that 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:39.750
 de and relieve 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.250
 We can ideally train the bike 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.950
 the practice on a pan track 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.330
 speak a route with many small ones 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.750
 quantities in a row and adjoining 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.930
 bends our bends while bending 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.560
 and sorry, what's her stressful name 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.120
 did press it in the living like 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.750
 relieve the wheel so we waves 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.970
 get back well at the kemtrack 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.430
 driving is the poor and leg work of 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.619
 importantly we must loose in 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.930
 be extremities around with the poor and 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.890
 legs to balance the hills or 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.140
 get the momentum 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.820
 You can also use many pump track systems 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.979
 driven with every bike 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.320
 important is now in the saddle completely 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.660
 deep , the suspension is relatively hard 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.570
 And you will remember no matter if your job 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.789
 or a duo or mountain bike 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.039
 everyone can then drip with a few and 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.830
 have a nice challenge 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.970
 on the mountain bike it is technical 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.789
 ways to master 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.399
 We have tight curves remaining 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:43.259
 tv roots and have to look that we 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:45.539
 with flo and fun for 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.030
 Steep descents are very important 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.850
 We stay centrally above the bottom bracket 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.729
 the wheel easily adapted to us 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.770
 The tendency to slope used to be frequent 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.080
 said as he always said above was that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.950
 you try to take that back there 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.069
 we avoid 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.310
 the poor remain bowed and thus have 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.869
 We also have enough traction on the bikes 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.959
 to steep and technical portals too 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.390
 mastering it is important to the learned 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.940
 to apply basic brake exercises and 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.160
 feeling both brakes associations with 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.110
 you do not jot down with and 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.040
 the steep slopes slide in the back wheel 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.040
 slips under 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:30.069
 Darnell often wait for us drops terrain 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.989
 edges or small cracks 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.750
 since it is important that the front wheel 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.450
 not immediately says we can 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.620
 use dynamic high back pulse 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.060
 to keep the front wheel high 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.849
 during the flight phase will be back 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.940
 central and can then with poor and 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.440
 legs cushion the impact drops 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.790
 you should first at a 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.489
 Train curb 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.930
 then you can terrain in the forest 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.590
 apply the whole step 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.590
 step by step
