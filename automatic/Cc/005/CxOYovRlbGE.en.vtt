00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.780
Today I will be making coconut burfi with a little twist

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.940
adding some walnuts.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.530
It makes it really good crunch.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.560
Coconut burfi is really good to serve anytime of the day.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.420
Holidays are coming.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.700
So coconut burfi will be very good you can make it in advance.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.920
Coconut burfi stays good outside for about a week.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.160
Or you can refrigerate for a month.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.920
But they taste better if you serve them at room temperature.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.680
The recipe I am giving will make about 24 pieces.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.140
So we need 1 cup of whipping cream or heavy cream.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.240
1 cup of milk powder

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740
1 cup of sugar

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.060
1/2 cup of coconut powder

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.480
1/2 cup of crushed walnuts

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.220
1/4 teaspoon of cardamom powder

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.860
So I have heat on medium.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.620
And I am going to boil the milk first.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.840
And wait till milk is boiled.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.980
Milk is boiling. So time to add the sugar.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.900
And just mix it so it dissolves.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.780
So we are going to make sugar syrup.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.080
It is very important to keep the right thickness of the syrup.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.650
It will take about 6-7 minutes.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.530
And we will boil it on medium heat.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.760
Don’t boil on high heat.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.340
So after 6 minutes you can check it.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.940
It should be one thread or I use the candy thermometer.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.880
If syrup get too thick then your coconut burfi will too hard and dry.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:44.760
If it stays less and so you will be boiling more with the milk powder

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.339
and it will become little bit chewy.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.161
This has been boiling for about 3 minutes.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.910
I have to wait 3-4 more minutes.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.989
So this is how you will see all the bubbles
coming on the top.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.920
Sugar is almost ready it’s up to one thread

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.380
Or 230 degrees fahrenheit.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.360
So you can see the another way to check

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.020
is by feeling it you should have the thread.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.120
This has been on for 6 minutes already.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.060
So as you see it’s already on 230 degrees or one thread.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.820
So let’s take out the thermometer.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.280
And we will add the milk powder.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.560
And we need to stir just for about 2-3 minutes.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.960
So this is almost ready.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.780
As you see it has started leaving the sides.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.280
And after you put the coconut

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.400
and walnuts, it will get little bit thicker.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.320
We don’t want to dry it too much otherwise burfi will become dry.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.860
So as you see if I turn it and it leaves the side.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.900
So it’s time to add the coconut powder.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.980
Keep mixing.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.340
Cardamom powder

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.400
And walnuts.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.820
As you see it has all together.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.860
It’s time to turn on the plate which I have already greased it.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.500
I like to cut little bit thicker pieces and in the squares.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.860
It will take about 5 minutes before we can cut them in the pieces.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.240
It has to cool off.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.920
Coconut burfi has been sitting for about 5-6 minutes.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.260
It has cooled off little bit.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.721
So we can cut them in the pieces.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.940
But before we take out from the plate it has to be completely dry.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.880
So that should take half an hour more.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.160
Coconut burfi looks great.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.539
I am really ready to try.

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:42.119
But I will wait till it dries up so I can pick up the piece.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.319
How about you?

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.300
So thank you for watching.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.920
And I will see you again.
