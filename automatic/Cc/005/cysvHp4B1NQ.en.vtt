00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
was with the pusher problem what I'm

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.090 
was with the pusher problem what I'm
gonna<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.280> now<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.869> put<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.110> EDF<00:01:28.590> unit<00:01:28.979> on

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
gonna do now is put the EDF unit on

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.830 
gonna do now is put the EDF unit on
little<00:01:29.490> pusher<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> little<00:01:30.330> motor<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.720> was<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
little pusher a little motor it was a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
22:08 - e8 with a little freecell 1300

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.420 
22:08 - e8 with a little freecell 1300
milliamp<00:01:36.869> pack<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.410> so<00:01:38.009> what<00:01:38.100> I'm<00:01:38.190> gonna<00:01:38.280> do

milliamp pack on it so what I'm gonna do

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.639 
milliamp pack on it so what I'm gonna do
now<00:01:38.550> is<00:01:38.580> put<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.910> EDF<00:01:39.300> on<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> probably

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
now is put the EDF on it with a probably

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.410 
now is put the EDF on it with a probably
of<00:01:40.800> three<00:01:41.070> or<00:01:41.160> four<00:01:41.190> solid<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.030> we'll<00:01:42.149> see<00:01:42.300> what

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
of three or four solid so we'll see what

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.810 
of three or four solid so we'll see what
happens<00:01:42.720> now<00:01:42.930> well<00:01:43.800> that<00:01:44.040> was<00:01:44.160> a<00:01:44.190> test<00:01:44.490> like

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
happens now well that was a test like

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.719 
happens now well that was a test like

this screams a lot of the guys said it's
probably<00:01:48.030> doing<00:01:48.240> pulsar<00:01:48.660> miles<00:01:48.960> an<00:01:49.110> hour<00:01:49.259> with

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
probably doing pulsar miles an hour with

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.340 
probably doing pulsar miles an hour with
the<00:01:49.740> little<00:01:50.190> freecell<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.910> it<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.350> this

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the little freecell in it and this

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.020 
the little freecell in it and this
little<00:01:52.410> push<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:52.830> prop<00:01:53.160> so<00:01:53.490> what<00:01:53.729> I'm<00:01:53.789> gonna<00:01:53.880> do

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030

before I fly it but I'm gonna put the

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.059 
before I fly it but I'm gonna put the
EDF<00:02:03.750> unit<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.289> it<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.590> I'll<00:02:04.679> make<00:02:04.830> another
