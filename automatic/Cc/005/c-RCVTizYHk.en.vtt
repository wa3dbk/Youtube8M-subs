00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
there's the Samsung Galaxy s3 I've done

eight point eight miles temperatures
about<00:00:37.070> three<00:00:37.570> point<00:00:38.570> seven<00:00:38.900> degrees<00:00:39.050> not

quite near calibrating my instantaneous
speed<00:00:43.040> in<00:00:43.370> rpm<00:00:43.519> are<00:00:43.940> zero<00:00:44.180> at<00:00:44.330> the<00:00:44.420> moment

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
speed in rpm are zero at the moment

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.799 
speed in rpm are zero at the moment
because<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:44.960> bikes<00:00:45.290> parked<00:00:45.650> I<00:00:46.720> don't<00:00:47.720> know

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
because the bikes parked I don't know

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.020 
because the bikes parked I don't know
how<00:00:47.900> to<00:00:47.960> control<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.620> software<00:00:48.800> yet<00:00:49.220> but<00:00:49.910> when

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
how to control the software yet but when

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.610 
how to control the software yet but when
you're<00:00:50.180> moving<00:00:50.330> you<00:00:50.690> do<00:00:50.839> get<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:51.080> lot<00:00:51.410> of

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
you're moving you do get a lot of

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.500 
you're moving you do get a lot of
information<00:00:51.890> on<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.400> speed<00:00:52.670> too<00:00:52.940> much<00:00:53.150> I<00:00:53.360> need

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
information on the speed too much I need

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.670 
information on the speed too much I need
to<00:00:53.600> customize<00:00:53.750> that<00:00:55.809> yet<00:00:56.809> that<00:00:57.019> switched<00:00:57.440> to

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
to customize that yet that switched to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.640 
to customize that yet that switched to
cadence<00:00:58.070> average<00:00:58.900> so<00:00:59.900> it<00:00:59.960> may<00:01:00.080> have<00:01:00.199> forced

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
cadence average so it may have forced

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.010 
cadence average so it may have forced
the<00:01:00.949> I<00:01:04.119> don't<00:01:05.119> know<00:01:05.239> because<00:01:05.479> know<00:01:05.600> how<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.810> use

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
the I don't know because know how to use

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.960 
the I don't know because know how to use
a<00:01:06.049> software<00:01:06.380> but<00:01:06.590> there<00:01:06.740> it<00:01:06.799> is<00:01:07.010> working

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
a software but there it is working

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:29.560 
a software but there it is working
nicely<00:01:08.150> on<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.720> bike<00:01:08.930> with<00:01:09.619> a<00:01:09.680> samsung<00:01:10.280> galaxy

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.169 

so<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.600> found<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.560> map<00:01:32.070> view<00:01:34.729> at<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> top<00:01:36.030> of

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
so I found the map view at the top of

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.020 
so I found the map view at the top of
the<00:01:36.240> map<00:01:36.420> view<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:37.520> cycles<00:01:38.520> through<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.729> few

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the map view it cycles through a few

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.109 
the map view it cycles through a few
indications<00:01:39.689> one<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.710> which<00:01:40.860> 10.6<00:01:41.789> for<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
indications one of which 10.6 for the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.889 
indications one of which 10.6 for the
average<00:01:42.420> male<00:01:43.110> flower<00:01:43.409> 49<00:01:44.130> makes<00:01:44.909> running<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
average male flower 49 makes running the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.130 
average male flower 49 makes running the
maximum<00:01:46.470> cadence<00:01:47.130> from<00:01:47.280> 34<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.869> three

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
maximum cadence from 34 is like three

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.990 
maximum cadence from 34 is like three
when<00:01:49.289> I<00:01:49.319> was<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.619> tripping<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> sensor<00:01:50.700> with

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
when I was just tripping the sensor with

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.449 
when I was just tripping the sensor with
the<00:01:51.119> magnet<00:01:51.530> for<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.619> average<00:01:52.709> cadence<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
the magnet for the average cadence of

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:55.460 
the magnet for the average cadence of
six<00:01:53.729> denying<00:01:54.209> is<00:01:54.420> probably<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.810> bit<00:01:54.959> high<00:01:55.170> but

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
six denying is probably a bit high but

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:08.210 
six denying is probably a bit high but
it's<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:02.689> point<00:02:03.689> eight<00:02:04.380> wires<00:02:05.209> so<00:02:07.099> there<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.190> are

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
it's a point eight wires so there we are

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.670 
it's a point eight wires so there we are
just<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:10.670> don't<00:02:11.670> know<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.299> how<00:02:13.200> many<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
just I don't know is how many of the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.870 
just I don't know is how many of the
function<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.280> our<00:02:14.489> GPS<00:02:15.180> generated
