you<00:01:54.479> put<00:01:54.690> it<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:54.870> the<00:01:55.080> old<00:01:55.440> wire<00:01:55.820> there's<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
you put it on the old wire there's a

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.730 
you put it on the old wire there's a
there's<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.510> lot<00:01:57.690> of<00:01:57.840> room<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.049> there<00:01:58.380> they<00:01:58.620> have

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
there's a lot of room in there they have

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.950 
there's a lot of room in there they have
to<00:01:58.890> fill<00:01:59.190> up<00:01:59.280> with<00:01:59.370> solder<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.790> whatnot<00:02:00.090> on

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
to fill up with solder and whatnot on

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.160 
to fill up with solder and whatnot on
this<00:02:01.140> new<00:02:01.320> wire<00:02:02.060> it's<00:02:03.060> tough<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.510> fit<00:02:03.720> on<00:02:03.869> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
this new wire it's tough to fit on and

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.080 
this new wire it's tough to fit on and
it<00:02:04.290> fills<00:02:04.530> up<00:02:04.650> everything<00:02:05.159> there's<00:02:05.700> no<00:02:05.850> gaps

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
it fills up everything there's no gaps

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.380 
it fills up everything there's no gaps
no<00:02:07.080> nothing<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:08.819> know<00:02:08.909> there's<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> lot<00:02:09.209> more

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
no nothing so we know there's a lot more

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.600 
no nothing so we know there's a lot more
wire<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.899> one<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.739> I'll<00:02:10.830> go<00:02:10.950> get<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> lot

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
wire in this one and I'll go get a lot

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.470 
wire in this one and I'll go get a lot
better<00:02:12.019> conductivity<00:02:13.019> so<00:02:13.739> now<00:02:14.299> I'll<00:02:15.299> start

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
better conductivity so now I'll start

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.720 
better conductivity so now I'll start
popping<00:02:17.290> up<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.470> door<00:02:17.650> sills<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.490> I<00:02:18.520> have<00:02:18.640> to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
popping up the door sills and I have to

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.690 
popping up the door sills and I have to
take<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.000> box<00:02:19.180> out<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:20.530> give<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.489> power

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
take the box out to to give the power

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.460 
take the box out to to give the power
wire<00:02:21.940> run<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.900> back<00:02:24.989> time<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.140> take<00:02:26.319> out

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
wire run to the back time to take out

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:40.490 
wire run to the back time to take out
the<00:02:26.620> box

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.640 

Oh

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.160 

kind<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.459> looked<00:02:46.640> at<00:02:46.790> when<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.090> built<00:02:48.050> this

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
kind of looked at when I built this

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.840 
kind of looked at when I built this
thing<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:48.590> never<00:02:48.980> actually<00:02:49.130> measured<00:02:49.550> how<00:02:49.640> wide

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
thing I never actually measured how wide

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.059 
thing I never actually measured how wide
the<00:02:50.000> door<00:02:50.180> was<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:51.230> it's<00:02:51.350> kind<00:02:51.530> of<00:02:51.590> lucky<00:02:51.890> to

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069

it's<00:02:56.959> mounted<00:02:57.380> I<00:02:57.580> guess<00:02:58.660> one<00:03:00.040> point<00:03:01.040> out<00:03:01.160> one

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
it's mounted I guess one point out one

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.000 
it's mounted I guess one point out one
here<00:03:01.610> there's<00:03:02.480> one<00:03:02.569> on<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.780> other<00:03:02.870> side

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
here there's one on the other side

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.100 
here there's one on the other side
that's<00:03:04.010> five<00:03:04.220> on<00:03:04.370> top<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.670> bolts<00:03:05.110> sending

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
that's five on top of the bolts sending

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.130 
that's five on top of the bolts sending
you<00:03:06.200> bolt<00:03:06.380> it<00:03:06.470> down

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140

and now the button note that i'll solder

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.910 
and now the button note that i'll solder
terminal<00:04:23.300> on<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.750> end<00:04:23.870> of<00:04:23.930> this<00:04:24.020> so<00:04:24.860> i<00:04:24.890> can

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
terminal on the end of this so i can

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.310 
terminal on the end of this so i can
text<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.490> battery<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.210> then<00:04:26.450> i've

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
text to the battery and then i've

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.720 
text to the battery and then i've
already<00:04:27.440> got<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.680> hole<00:04:28.310> drilled<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:28.610> my

which was a real pain in the butt I was
one<00:07:09.750> of<00:07:09.840> the<00:07:09.900> first<00:07:10.020> things<00:07:10.290> I<00:07:10.410> installed<00:07:10.770> and

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:10.920 
one of the first things I installed and

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.030 
one of the first things I installed and
I<00:07:10.950> did<00:07:11.130> that<00:07:11.280> kind<00:07:11.700> of<00:07:12.290> stupidly<00:07:13.290> we<00:07:13.680> could<00:07:13.830> say

I did that kind of stupidly we could say
but<00:07:14.700> hopefully<00:07:15.630> within<00:07:15.810> the<00:07:15.870> next<00:07:15.960> couple<00:07:16.140> of

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
but hopefully within the next couple of

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.500 
but hopefully within the next couple of
weeks

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:17.510

weeks
I'm<00:07:18.510> thinking<00:07:18.810> about<00:07:18.900> getting<00:07:19.230> some<00:07:19.940> custom

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 
I'm thinking about getting some custom

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.150 
I'm thinking about getting some custom
fiberglass<00:07:21.120> speaker<00:07:21.750> pods<00:07:21.960> built<00:07:22.230> for<00:07:23.010> those

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 
fiberglass speaker pods built for those

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.250 
fiberglass speaker pods built for those
right<00:07:23.430> now<00:07:23.580> there's<00:07:23.850> a<00:07:23.910> little<00:07:24.690> piece<00:07:25.080> that

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.260 
right now there's a little piece that

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.690 
right now there's a little piece that
goes<00:07:25.350> on<00:07:25.530> top<00:07:25.710> of<00:07:25.830> this<00:07:25.920> so<00:07:26.310> these<00:07:26.430> should<00:07:26.640> be

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:26.700 
goes on top of this so these should be

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.640 
goes on top of this so these should be
covered<00:07:27.120> but<00:07:27.270> that's<00:07:27.420> out<00:07:27.570> right<00:07:27.750> now<00:07:27.900> a<00:07:28.140> lot

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.650 
covered but that's out right now a lot

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.810 
covered but that's out right now a lot
of<00:07:28.680> thing<00:07:28.830> about<00:07:28.950> doing<00:07:29.250> is<00:07:29.340> building<00:07:29.520> some

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:29.820 
of thing about doing is building some

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.420 
of thing about doing is building some
pods<00:07:30.030> they'll<00:07:30.630> come<00:07:30.960> and<00:07:31.200> face<00:07:31.800> right<00:07:32.040> at<00:07:32.220> you

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.430 
pods they'll come and face right at you

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.100 
pods they'll come and face right at you
