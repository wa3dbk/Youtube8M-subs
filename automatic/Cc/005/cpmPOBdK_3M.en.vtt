we<00:01:20.920> might<00:01:21.130> get<00:01:22.799> Sunday<00:01:23.799> it's<00:01:24.009> actually<00:01:24.429> Sunday

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
we might get Sunday it's actually Sunday

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.450 
we might get Sunday it's actually Sunday
it's<00:01:25.240> expected<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.810> we<00:01:29.109> might<00:01:29.320> get<00:01:29.500> 50<00:01:29.950> or<00:01:29.979> 60

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
it's expected so we might get 50 or 60

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.349 
it's expected so we might get 50 or 60
miles<00:01:30.700> before<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:31.539> next<00:01:31.719> front<00:01:32.049> hits<00:01:34.380> well

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
miles before the next front hits well

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.429 
miles before the next front hits well
you<00:01:37.359> know<00:01:37.479> we<00:01:37.630> might<00:01:37.840> get<00:01:38.020> clear<00:01:38.259> of<00:01:38.289> the

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
you know we might get clear of the

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.660 
you know we might get clear of the
islands<00:01:38.799> we<00:01:38.890> could<00:01:39.039> probably<00:01:39.130> get<00:01:39.399> clear<00:01:39.640> of

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
islands we could probably get clear of

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.789 
islands we could probably get clear of
the<00:01:39.820> island<00:01:40.179> before<00:01:40.390> we<00:01:41.109> start<00:01:41.350> getting<00:01:41.530> any

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
the island before we start getting any

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.190 
the island before we start getting any
serious<00:01:42.340> easterlies<00:01:43.210> that<00:01:43.509> before<00:01:43.960> we<00:01:44.049> get

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
serious easterlies that before we get

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.319 
serious easterlies that before we get
really<00:01:44.409> strong<00:01:44.740> trades<00:01:45.130> like<00:01:45.399> 30<00:01:45.700> knots<00:01:45.969> I

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
really strong trades like 30 knots I

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.270 
really strong trades like 30 knots I
think<00:01:47.229> we<00:01:47.319> could<00:01:47.469> probably<00:01:47.530> get<00:01:47.829> clear<00:01:48.100> in<00:01:48.130> the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
think we could probably get clear in the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.649 
think we could probably get clear in the
island<00:01:48.579> before<00:01:48.670> we<00:01:48.939> got<00:01:49.119> there<00:01:49.359> but<00:01:49.509> we'd

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
island before we got there but we'd

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.010 
island before we got there but we'd
still<00:01:49.929> be<00:01:50.579> sailing<00:01:51.579> north<00:01:51.850> we'd<00:01:52.749> still<00:01:52.990> be

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
still be sailing north we'd still be

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.270 
still be sailing north we'd still be
sailing<00:01:53.409> on<00:01:53.499> a<00:01:53.560> leash<00:01:54.189> or<00:01:54.569> with<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.979> know<00:01:57.069> on<00:01:57.249> a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
know down to our number three jib trying

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.140 
know down to our number three jib trying
not<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.609> get<00:03:30.850> blown<00:03:31.150> off<00:03:31.299> to<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.630> west<00:03:31.840> too<00:03:32.049> far

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
not to get blown off to the west too far

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.550

once you're out clear the land it's

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.420 
once you're out clear the land it's
doable<00:03:37.299> so<00:03:37.690> how<00:03:37.870> far<00:03:38.200> might<00:03:38.620> maybe<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:39.160> get

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
doable so how far might maybe to get

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:47.550 
doable so how far might maybe to get
blown<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.359> west<00:03:42.810> Oh<00:03:43.810> No<00:03:44.230> hundreds<00:03:44.799> oh<00:03:46.560> okay

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
course so west easily in those

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.400 
course so west easily in those
conditions<00:04:00.790> but<00:04:01.090> but<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.660> looks<00:04:01.900> like<00:04:02.140> what

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
conditions but but it looks like what

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.050 
conditions but but it looks like what
you<00:04:02.620> know<00:04:02.739> it<00:04:02.950> looks<00:04:03.220> like<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.819> and

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
you know it looks like and and

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.120 
you know it looks like and and
historically<00:04:04.750> has<00:04:04.959> always<00:04:05.170> been<00:04:05.500> light<00:04:05.829> air

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
historically has always been light air

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.520 
historically has always been light air
up<00:04:06.370> there<00:04:06.609> yeah<00:04:07.090> it's<00:04:07.540> just<00:04:07.720> right<00:04:07.930> now<00:04:07.989> for

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
up there yeah it's just right now for

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.309 
up there yeah it's just right now for
some<00:04:08.680> reason<00:04:08.739> there's<00:04:09.400> this<00:04:09.930> strongly<00:04:10.930> trade

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
some reason there's this strongly trade

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.710 
some reason there's this strongly trade
rhythm<00:04:11.620> thing<00:04:11.829> going<00:04:12.069> on<00:04:12.389> which<00:04:13.389> is<00:04:13.540> unusual

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
rhythm thing going on which is unusual

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.990 
rhythm thing going on which is unusual
so<00:04:14.590> but<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.850> strong<00:04:16.269> trade<00:04:16.720> winds<00:04:16.989> blowing
