00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.529

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.800
 now times the models 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.469

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.129

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.620
 rally champion and profi on 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.210
 dirt roads is experiencing the world 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.800
 Grand Prix with around to its counterpart 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.280
 prove that on other roads 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.110
 prove good to cope 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.909
 Processing the model is in great 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.590
 and completely identical to the single buck 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.420
 version to buy in the shop 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.869
 the only small difference is here 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.820
 create 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.950
 for comparison to an older one 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.780
 brought this is the writing on 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.060
 underbody which is right at the old one 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.590
 version much smaller as the left 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.060
 seems to be now generally like this 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.500
 I have already done that in time 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.299
 Often seen in the newer models 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.460
 that the writing on the underbody is bigger 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:46.200
 otherwise the models are identical 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.200

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.150
