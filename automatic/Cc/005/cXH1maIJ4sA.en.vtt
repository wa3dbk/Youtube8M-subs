00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
okay so here we have the box for our 750

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.900 
okay so here we have the box for our 750
guys<00:00:19.260> back<00:00:19.619> plate<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.130> do<00:00:20.279> like<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.730> new

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
guys back plate I do like the new

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.030 
guys back plate I do like the new
packaging<00:00:22.279> EVGA<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.369> doing<00:00:27.410> ok<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.890> get

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
packaging EVGA is doing ok so we get

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.850 
packaging EVGA is doing ok so we get
some<00:00:29.310> instruction<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.960> installation

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
some instruction for installation

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.139 
some instruction for installation
although<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.579> think<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:32.850> gonna<00:00:32.970> be<00:00:33.060> pretty

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
although I think it's gonna be pretty

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.280 
although I think it's gonna be pretty
easy<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.770> unit<00:00:35.040> itself<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:36.120> imagine<00:00:36.899> it

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
easy and the unit itself I imagine it

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.650 
easy and the unit itself I imagine it
also<00:00:37.440> comes<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:37.860> some<00:00:38.420> different<00:00:39.420> screws

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
also comes with some different screws

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.690 
also comes with some different screws
these<00:00:39.870> are<00:00:40.050> important<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.800> imagine<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.340> can't

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
these are important I imagine I can't

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.580 
these are important I imagine I can't
use<00:00:41.969> these<00:00:42.239> stock<00:00:42.600> screws<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.050> come<00:00:43.200> with<00:00:43.410> it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
use these stock screws that come with it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:58.389 
use these stock screws that come with it
not<00:00:43.950> these<00:00:44.160> these<00:00:45.090> ones<00:00:45.570> oh<00:00:52.370> it's<00:00:53.370> absorbable

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.610 

fantastic-looking<00:01:00.109> still<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.409> cart

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
fantastic-looking still go on the cart

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.759 
fantastic-looking still go on the cart
just<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.489> make<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.629> look<00:01:03.870> amazing

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
just like that and make it look amazing

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.680 
just like that and make it look amazing
so<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.640> first<00:01:05.850> thing<00:01:06.060> we're<00:01:06.210> going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.570> need

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
so the first thing we're going to need

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.200 
so the first thing we're going to need
to<00:01:06.870> do<00:01:07.050> is<00:01:08.300> remove<00:01:09.300> the<00:01:10.580> these<00:01:11.580> screws<00:01:11.970> right

to do is remove the these screws right

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.540 
to do is remove the these screws right
here<00:01:12.240> remove<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.440> these<00:01:13.979> four<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:15.300> one

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.680 

alright<00:01:20.550> it's<00:01:20.760> important<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.420> part<00:01:21.660> of

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
alright it's important in this part of

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.900 
alright it's important in this part of
the<00:01:21.750> installation<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.560> note<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:23.310> 5

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
the installation to note that all 5

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.050 
the installation to note that all 5
screws<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.480> been<00:01:24.540> removed<00:01:24.660> and<00:01:25.610> if<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.880> were

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
screws have been removed and if you were

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.870 
screws have been removed and if you were
to<00:01:27.330> lift<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.260> the<00:01:28.410> PCB<00:01:28.800> by<00:01:29.070> itself<00:01:29.490> it

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
to lift up on the PCB by itself it

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.690 
to lift up on the PCB by itself it
probably<00:01:30.590> would<00:01:31.590> come<00:01:31.830> undone<00:01:32.280> which

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
probably would come undone which

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.510 
probably would come undone which
wouldn't<00:01:33.090> be<00:01:33.240> good<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:33.540> all<00:01:33.690> so<00:01:34.380> next<00:01:34.560> we're

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
wouldn't be good at all so next we're

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.310 
wouldn't be good at all so next we're
gonna<00:01:35.640> get<00:01:35.790> these<00:01:36.000> new<00:01:36.330> screws<00:01:36.690> out<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.200> are

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
gonna get these new screws out that are

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.920 
gonna get these new screws out that are
longer<00:01:37.620> it<00:01:38.340> looks<00:01:38.550> like<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.120> all<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.690> screws

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
longer it looks like so all the screws

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.810 
longer it looks like so all the screws
we<00:01:40.080> just<00:01:40.410> took<00:01:40.620> out<00:01:40.830> we're<00:01:41.070> gonna<00:01:41.160> put<00:01:41.490> over

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
we just took out we're gonna put over

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.760 
we just took out we're gonna put over
here<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.880> I'll<00:01:45.030> I'm<00:01:46.020> gonna<00:01:46.170> put<00:01:46.320> them<00:01:46.440> back<00:01:46.560> in

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
here and I'll I'm gonna put them back in

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.380 
here and I'll I'm gonna put them back in
this<00:01:46.830> exact<00:01:47.190> ziplock<00:01:47.700> when<00:01:47.880> I'm<00:01:48.000> done<00:01:48.240> with

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
this exact ziplock when I'm done with

00:01:48.390 --> 00:02:04.050 
this exact ziplock when I'm done with
them

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.789 

then<00:02:05.060> we're<00:02:05.659> gonna<00:02:05.750> put<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.320> backplate<00:02:06.770> on

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
then we're gonna put the backplate on

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.949 
then we're gonna put the backplate on
I'm<00:02:07.220> going<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:07.430> keep<00:02:07.610> this<00:02:07.880> plastic<00:02:08.209> film<00:02:08.750> on

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
I'm going to keep this plastic film on

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.809 
I'm going to keep this plastic film on
it<00:02:09.140> for<00:02:09.410> right<00:02:09.530> now<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:10.039> I<00:02:10.069> don't<00:02:10.130> scuff<00:02:10.610> up<00:02:10.759> the

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
it for right now so I don't scuff up the

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.620 
it for right now so I don't scuff up the
backplate<00:02:11.420> while<00:02:11.660> I'm<00:02:12.580> installing<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:16.630> we're

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
backplate while I'm installing it we're

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.880 
backplate while I'm installing it we're
going<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.810> use<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.110> new<00:02:18.260> screws<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:18.800> were

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
going to use the new screws that were

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.790 
going to use the new screws that were
included<00:02:19.690> I'm<00:02:20.690> pretty<00:02:21.140> sure<00:02:21.349> they're<00:02:21.530> just<00:02:21.560> a

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
included I'm pretty sure they're just a

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.809 
included I'm pretty sure they're just a
little<00:02:22.099> bit<00:02:22.250> longer

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
little bit longer

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:37.479 
little bit longer
oops<00:02:33.940> okay<00:02:34.940> now<00:02:35.120> I'm<00:02:35.209> gonna<00:02:35.330> tighten<00:02:36.459> all<00:02:37.459> the

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
oops okay now I'm gonna tighten all the

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.809 
oops okay now I'm gonna tighten all the
way<00:02:40.209> making<00:02:41.209> sure<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.930> use<00:02:41.980> cross<00:02:42.980> patterns<00:02:43.489> so

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
way making sure to use cross patterns so

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.140 
way making sure to use cross patterns so
you<00:02:44.150> get<00:02:44.930> even<00:02:45.890> distribution<00:02:46.220> of<00:02:46.670> force<00:02:49.150> and

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
you get even distribution of force and

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.600 
you get even distribution of force and
then<00:02:50.360> don't<00:02:50.720> forget<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:51.080> put<00:02:51.410> this<00:02:52.280> fifth

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
then don't forget to put this fifth

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.339 
then don't forget to put this fifth
screw<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.090> over<00:02:53.299> here<00:02:53.540> some<00:02:53.780> people<00:02:53.900> do<00:02:54.170> that

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
screw and over here some people do that

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:06.400 
screw and over here some people do that
and<00:02:54.590> then<00:02:54.890> their<00:02:55.040> card<00:02:55.310> flops<00:02:55.940> around

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.740 

all<00:03:06.980> right<00:03:07.280> that's<00:03:07.550> pretty<00:03:08.090> much<00:03:08.240> perfect

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
all right that's pretty much perfect

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.970 
all right that's pretty much perfect
right<00:03:08.900> there<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.350> I'm<00:03:09.440> going<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.590> go<00:03:09.710> ahead<00:03:09.800> and

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
right there so I'm going to go ahead and
