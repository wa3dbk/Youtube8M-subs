okay<00:01:08.950> so<00:01:09.010> I'm<00:01:09.250> sure<00:01:09.460> most<00:01:09.610> of<00:01:09.790> you<00:01:09.910> were

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
okay so I'm sure most of you were

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.340 
okay so I'm sure most of you were
probably<00:01:10.150> thinking<00:01:10.810> well<00:01:11.050> it's<00:01:11.260> an

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
probably thinking well it's an

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.810 
probably thinking well it's an
international<00:01:11.950> truck<00:01:12.160> it's<00:01:12.340> gonna<00:01:12.490> have<00:01:12.700> an

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
international truck it's gonna have an

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.970 
international truck it's gonna have an
international<00:01:13.450> engine<00:01:13.810> in<00:01:13.930> it<00:01:14.080> well<00:01:14.800> that

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
international engine in it well that

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.270 
international engine in it well that
wasn't<00:01:15.280> quite<00:01:15.370> the<00:01:15.460> case<00:01:15.610> with<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.090> model<00:01:16.390> 180

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
wasn't quite the case with the model 180

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.080 
wasn't quite the case with the model 180
originally<00:01:18.280> when<00:01:18.430> this<00:01:18.550> truck<00:01:18.790> was<00:01:18.910> in

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
originally when this truck was in

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.750 
originally when this truck was in
prototype<00:01:19.600> form<00:01:19.960> it<00:01:20.230> had<00:01:20.740> an<00:01:20.950> experimental

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
prototype form it had an experimental

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.730 
prototype form it had an experimental
international<00:01:22.450> engine<00:01:22.810> in<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.050> which<00:01:23.530> was<00:01:23.710> a

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
international engine in it which was a

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.670 
international engine in it which was a
model<00:01:24.070> DVT<00:01:24.700> 1089<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.720> produced<00:01:26.410> 500

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
model DVT 1089 and produced 500

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.600 
model DVT 1089 and produced 500
horsepower<00:01:27.450> now<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:29.470> truck<00:01:29.830> underwent<00:01:30.460> a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
horsepower now this truck underwent a

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.150 
horsepower now this truck underwent a
lot<00:01:30.670> of<00:01:30.970> field<00:01:31.390> testing<00:01:31.600> before<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.770> went<00:01:32.950> into

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
lot of field testing before it went into

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160 
lot of field testing before it went into
full<00:01:33.340> production<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:34.270> was<00:01:34.450> marketed<00:01:34.870> and

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
full production and was marketed and

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.250 
full production and was marketed and
during<00:01:36.160> its<00:01:36.310> field<00:01:36.610> testing<00:01:37.260> international

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
during its field testing international

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.859 
during its field testing international
engineers<00:01:38.800> decided<00:01:39.220> that<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:40.240> International

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
engineers decided that the International

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.510 
engineers decided that the International
engine<00:01:41.200> was<00:01:41.350> just<00:01:41.560> not<00:01:41.770> producing<00:01:42.040> enough

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
engine was just not producing enough

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.120 
engine was just not producing enough
power<00:01:43.000> for<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.450> truck<00:01:43.810> so<00:01:44.650> what<00:01:44.860> they<00:01:44.979> decided

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
power for the truck so what they decided

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.640 
power for the truck so what they decided
to<00:01:45.460> do<00:01:45.670> was<00:01:45.700> swap<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.570> International<00:01:47.320> engine

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
to do was swap the International engine

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.390 
to do was swap the International engine
out<00:01:47.800> for<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.369> more<00:01:48.610> powerful<00:01:48.990> Detroit<00:01:49.990> 12v<00:01:50.619> 71

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
out for a more powerful Detroit 12v 71

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.450 
out for a more powerful Detroit 12v 71
now<00:01:52.270> keep<00:01:52.509> in<00:01:52.660> mind<00:01:52.869> this<00:01:52.990> is<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.290> early<00:01:53.560> 1960s

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
now keep in mind this is the early 1960s

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.490 
now keep in mind this is the early 1960s
we're<00:01:54.610> talking<00:01:54.970> about<00:01:55.060> here<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:56.020> Magnum<00:01:56.350> this

time international did not build a large

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.420 
time international did not build a large
enough<00:01:58.930> engine<00:01:59.290> to<00:01:59.410> power<00:01:59.649> a<00:01:59.800> truck<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.280> this

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
enough engine to power a truck of this

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.080 
enough engine to power a truck of this
size<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.840> also<00:02:02.710> keep<00:02:02.920> in<00:02:03.009> mind<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.729> model
