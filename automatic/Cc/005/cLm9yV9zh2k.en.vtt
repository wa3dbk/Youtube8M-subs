00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
structure of the cake a little bit

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.940 
structure of the cake a little bit
better<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.990> hold<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> butter<00:01:49.530> cream<00:01:49.770> frosting

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
to do is fold in our strawberries

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.050 
to do is fold in our strawberries
since<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.740> called<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.070> strawberry<00:01:56.610> ombre

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
since this is called a strawberry ombre

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.550 
since this is called a strawberry ombre
cake<00:01:57.300> I<00:01:57.450> definitely<00:01:57.900> wanted<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.230> try<00:01:58.500> to

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
cake I definitely wanted to try to

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.470 
cake I definitely wanted to try to
incorporate<00:01:58.920> strawberries<00:01:59.760> into<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.180> recipe

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
incorporate strawberries into the recipe

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.450 
incorporate strawberries into the recipe
so<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:00.870> got<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> strawberry<00:02:01.560> extract<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.190> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
so we got the strawberry extract and the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.840 
so we got the strawberry extract and the
fresh<00:02:02.670> strawberries<00:02:03.240> definitely<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> home<00:02:04.290> run

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
fresh strawberries definitely a home run

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.030 
fresh strawberries definitely a home run
okay<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:05.910> this<00:02:06.150> batter<00:02:06.420> makes<00:02:06.810> 8<00:02:07.140> cups<00:02:07.800> of

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
okay so this batter makes 8 cups of

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.340 
okay so this batter makes 8 cups of
batter<00:02:08.400> remember<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:09.000> always<00:02:09.180> level<00:02:09.930> off<00:02:10.080> all

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
batter remember to always level off all

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.870 
batter remember to always level off all
of<00:02:10.470> your<00:02:10.619> measurements<00:02:10.830> when<00:02:11.310> baking<00:02:11.670> so

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
of your measurements when baking so

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.970 
of your measurements when baking so
we're<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.300> have<00:02:12.420> four<00:02:12.660> layers<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.680> each

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
we're going to have four layers so each

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.310 
we're going to have four layers so each
layer<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.400> going<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.670> be<00:02:14.850> two<00:02:15.120> cups<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:16.140> take

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
layer is going to be two cups you take

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.110 
layer is going to be two cups you take
two<00:02:16.530> cups<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.950> batter<00:02:17.160> put<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.700> separate

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120

finally<00:03:57.640> we're<00:03:57.790> just<00:03:57.940> going<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.120> blend<00:03:58.330> in

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
finally we're just going to blend in

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.330 
finally we're just going to blend in
some<00:03:58.780> powdered<00:03:59.140> sugar<00:03:59.170> into<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.860> frosting

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
some powdered sugar into the frosting

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.010 
some powdered sugar into the frosting
and<00:04:00.610> you<00:04:01.120> can<00:04:01.240> do<00:04:01.330> it<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:01.480> little<00:04:01.570> bit<00:04:01.780> at<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:01.930> time

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
and you can do it a little bit at a time

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.750 
and you can do it a little bit at a time
so<00:04:02.380> you<00:04:02.440> don't<00:04:02.590> get<00:04:02.770> sugar<00:04:03.190> all<00:04:03.430> over<00:04:03.460> the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
so you don't get sugar all over the

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.050 
so you don't get sugar all over the
place<00:04:04.890> once<00:04:05.890> my<00:04:06.040> frosting<00:04:06.490> was<00:04:06.610> done<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:06.820> could

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
place once my frosting was done I could

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.910 
place once my frosting was done I could
work<00:04:07.240> with<00:04:07.270> it<00:04:07.510> immediately<00:04:07.990> and<00:04:08.290> my<00:04:08.620> cakes

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
cake is absolutely no joke and I

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.730 
cake is absolutely no joke and I
definitely<00:05:04.120> wanted<00:05:04.690> a<00:05:04.780> frosting<00:05:05.230> that<00:05:05.260> wasn't

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
definitely wanted a frosting that wasn't

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.890 
definitely wanted a frosting that wasn't
overly<00:05:06.190> sweet<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.730> where<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.000> would<00:05:07.180> overpower

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
overly sweet to where it would overpower

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.340 
overly sweet to where it would overpower
the<00:05:08.350> cake<00:05:08.560> so<00:05:08.890> I<00:05:09.300> watched<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.480> sugar<00:05:10.810> content

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
the cake so I watched the sugar content

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.990 
the cake so I watched the sugar content
in<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.530> cake<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.310> frosting<00:05:12.490> so<00:05:12.850> that

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
in the cake and the frosting so that

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.390 
in the cake and the frosting so that
they<00:05:13.120> would<00:05:13.300> pair<00:05:13.570> together<00:05:13.780> really<00:05:14.169> well

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
they would pair together really well

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.740 
they would pair together really well
