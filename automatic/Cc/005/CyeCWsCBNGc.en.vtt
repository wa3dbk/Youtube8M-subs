mixture into my jars using the canning
funnel<00:02:19.570> usually<00:02:20.570> two<00:02:20.870> full<00:02:21.200> ladles<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.770> then

funnel usually two full ladles and then

funnel usually two full ladles and then
a<00:02:22.130> little<00:02:22.220> bit<00:02:22.730> more<00:02:24.040> we'll<00:02:25.040> get<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.520> the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
a little bit more we'll get you the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.070 
a little bit more we'll get you the
desired<00:02:26.030> result<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:26.570> don't<00:02:26.750> want<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.960> go<00:02:27.020> all

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
desired result you don't want to go all

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.360 
desired result you don't want to go all
the<00:02:27.170> way<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.530> top<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.920> want<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.190> leave

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
the way to the top you want to leave

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.460 
the way to the top you want to leave
eighth<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.210> an<00:02:29.330> inch<00:02:29.420> head<00:02:29.720> space<00:02:29.960> I<00:02:30.200> have<00:02:30.440> a

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
eighth of an inch head space I have a

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.010 
eighth of an inch head space I have a
little<00:02:30.650> more<00:02:30.920> head<00:02:31.160> space<00:02:31.430> there<00:02:31.850> then<00:02:32.570> some

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
little more head space there then some

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.590 
little more head space there then some
people<00:02:33.200> usually<00:02:33.560> use<00:02:34.040> but<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:35.060> think<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.450> little

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
people usually use but I think a little

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.360 
people usually use but I think a little
more<00:02:35.690> headspace<00:02:36.140> is<00:02:36.200> better<00:02:36.590> especially<00:02:36.860> when

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
more headspace is better especially when

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.340 
more headspace is better especially when
you<00:02:37.490> go<00:02:37.640> go<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.120> Cannock<00:02:38.540> because<00:02:38.810> sometimes

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
you go go to Cannock because sometimes

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.490 
you go go to Cannock because sometimes
all<00:02:40.130> that<00:02:40.460> sugary<00:02:40.970> mess<00:02:41.120> will<00:02:41.780> release<00:02:42.290> from

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
all that sugary mess will release from

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.760 
all that sugary mess will release from
the<00:02:42.620> jar<00:02:42.890> as<00:02:43.130> its<00:02:43.790> ceiling<00:02:44.210> and<00:02:44.600> I'd<00:02:45.530> rather

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
the jar as its ceiling and I'd rather

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.070 
the jar as its ceiling and I'd rather
have<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.220> not<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:46.670> sticky<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.360> I'd<00:02:47.900> rather

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
have it not so sticky and I'd rather

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.840 
have it not so sticky and I'd rather
have<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.410> little<00:02:48.590> more<00:02:48.830> headspace<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:51.850> what

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
have a little more headspace so what

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
have a little more headspace so what
we're<00:02:53.000> going<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.209> do<00:02:53.390> is<00:02:53.480> we're<00:02:53.570> just<00:02:53.600> going<00:02:53.780> to

we're going to get one we're going to
get<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.560> little<00:03:33.950> bit<00:03:34.250> in<00:03:34.520> this<00:03:34.640> pot<00:03:34.970> in<00:03:35.570> this

get a little bit in this pot in this

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.680 
get a little bit in this pot in this
particular<00:03:36.080> jar<00:03:36.590> weather<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.570> then<00:03:38.570> we're

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
particular jar weather and then we're

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.300 
particular jar weather and then we're
going<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.870> go<00:03:40.030> put<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.090> away<00:03:41.800> quick<00:03:42.800> that<00:03:43.010> way

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
going to go put that away quick that way

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.540 
going to go put that away quick that way
and<00:03:44.180> get<00:03:44.870> rid<00:03:44.990> of<00:03:45.050> that<00:03:45.110> did<00:03:45.500> that<00:03:45.530> put<00:03:46.250> them<00:03:46.430> in

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
and get rid of that did that put them in

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.090 
and get rid of that did that put them in
the<00:03:46.610> sink<00:03:46.850> now<00:03:47.060> we<00:03:47.390> have<00:03:47.510> our<00:03:47.600> hot<00:03:47.870> lids<00:03:48.230> here

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.530 

now<00:03:52.100> normally<00:03:52.490> I<00:03:52.520> would<00:03:52.760> like<00:03:52.910> them<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.120> soak<00:03:53.420> a

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
now normally I would like them to soak a

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.300 
now normally I would like them to soak a
little<00:03:53.570> bit<00:03:53.900> longer<00:03:54.080> but<00:03:54.470> I<00:03:54.710> think<00:03:55.070> they'll<00:03:55.220> be

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
little bit longer but I think they'll be

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.940 
little bit longer but I think they'll be
fine<00:03:55.550> that<00:03:55.760> water<00:03:55.940> was<00:03:56.060> really<00:03:56.330> hot<00:03:56.710> and<00:03:57.710> we're

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
fine that water was really hot and we're

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.140 
fine that water was really hot and we're
going<00:03:58.100> to<00:03:58.160> get<00:03:58.310> those<00:03:58.460> right<00:03:58.700> into<00:03:59.030> that

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
going to get those right into that

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
going to get those right into that
boiling<00:03:59.510> pot<00:03:59.930> there<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:01.480> this<00:04:02.480> year<00:04:02.720> I<00:04:02.750> didn't

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
boiling pot there and this year I didn't

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.890 
boiling pot there and this year I didn't
mention<00:04:03.530> earlier<00:04:03.650> this<00:04:04.220> is<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.670> lid<00:04:05.210> lifter<00:04:05.660> and

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
mention earlier this is a lid lifter and

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.170 
mention earlier this is a lid lifter and
has<00:04:06.170> a<00:04:06.200> magnet<00:04:06.740> on<00:04:06.860> it<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.190> just<00:04:07.220> helps<00:04:07.670> you<00:04:07.820> not

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
has a magnet on it it just helps you not

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.740
