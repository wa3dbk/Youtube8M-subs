00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:13.129
 Hello and welcome to today's video tutorial I want you 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.210
 to show the possibility of using so-called Photoshop 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.810
 celtic xte fencing 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.330
 You can not achieve appropriate sketches objectively when recording 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.499
 had available 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.869
 you can at least that is limited 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.839
 need to reach with Photoshop 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:30.630
 next to Vienna 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.430
 In the blog post reported there are contracts to push the next 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.640
 possibilities 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.720
 I want to present to Euro today a possibility relative 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.620
 is easier 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.070
 Preliminary tests are important percent that you can hone levels in the whole hype 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.380
 create course 7 you pay attention 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.200
 that approximately counts the optical laws of a pen objective 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.940
 correspond 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.120
 we 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.729
 First, first duplicate our background layer and then go 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.850
 Emine the so-called masking SMO duos 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.630
 and within this masking mode we use a relatively small amount 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.070
 Opacity here 34 percent 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.720
 Every evening he goes around the same as he does 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.090
 Want to get Cha from the foreground 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.450
 and around 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.850
 At first, that's what they saw as relative 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.880
 that means we have to hit 8 9 that the masters we put on them here 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.490
 only in the outer areas 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.820
 a switchover 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.240
 um has in the inner areas 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.160
 but then 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.780
 close to the 100 percent then that is in the outer areas paint 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.590
 we again over it with the brush 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.179
 we reach a force of 34 percent the areas that matter to us 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.530
 appear in the middle of the Moskva the game was just a few times pro 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.549
 and then come in our range of 100 percent 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.590
 painted on our mask 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.960
 let's think again of the masking Sun mode 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.700
 go once per cent in which to reverse in the range of selection 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.729
 and then we've already got our finished 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:17.969
 the background layer that had been copied in advance we mask now 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.949
 click on the masters once and invest that's very important 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:27.339
 that kicker for love to Holmes way with the controller Forster 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:29.259
 + the key 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:34.119
 Then in the second step we leave this mask and click here 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.019
 front field on the enemy picture 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.479
 so the next step 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:42.709
 he is in it correct that we book the appropriate filter 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.989
 the ISM is named a soft subscription year in our case year 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.959
 To mitigate depth of field 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.659
 What's funny is actually creating depth but not deeper 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.720
 Sheep but there probably has more Lord 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.579
 So, like something overslept 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:58.689
 and 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.079
 around the 8, the selection that is displayed at now 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.390
 here it is important that we at the deep displacement reason of the source too 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.549
 the levels dimensions go because if we did not do that we would 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.619
 he completes the complete filter on the 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:17.479
 we do not want to use a full image, so we go here 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:21.539
 on the layer mask and we can already see the area we have previously masked 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:26.789
 Schaaf Pfund's continued to appear in the kindergartens in preventing it easily 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:27.779
 and sheep 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:31.319
 and the filter depth of field softens it keeps its effect 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:36.199
 how strong the whole thing should be pronounced she arrived 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.699
 around here by the radio or by the vault of the 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.839
 The size of your iris depends on the size of the image 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:49.189
 a little rumble we confirm the whole with rookie and «greed» 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:52.269
 even our finished 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.480
 As always, the Photoshop is not exaggerating so we are here with the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.709
 If necessary, the force can also go down a bit 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:59.939
 a matter of taste 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.379
 around and if you look at the whole 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.469
 100 percent and a larger picture of Coke then you see that if you are in 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:10.039
 Apron clean 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.989
 Only a slight overhang in the outer area of ​​the master 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.459
 created with a grippy DEK force 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.459
 that the whole really a very realistic 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:24.700
 Of course you should not forget that it is a real mushroom shift 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.100
 Objective does not come but it is a very good effect and the whole 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.469
 At least to simulate things in Photoshop 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:36.639
 I wish you a lot of fun Vettel fun while copying Cheese up 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.659
 not even
