00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
they flash freeze it and then they

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.479 
they flash freeze it and then they
vacuum<00:00:51.270> seal<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.620> much<00:00:52.860> fresh<00:00:53.219> or

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
these variants that are frozen when

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.020 
these variants that are frozen when
they're<00:00:58.590> fresh<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.129> could<00:00:59.309> smell<00:00:59.609> them<00:00:59.850> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
they're fresh you could smell them and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.790 
they're fresh you could smell them and
tell<00:01:00.239> if<00:01:00.840> they're<00:01:01.020> going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.289> good<00:01:01.500> or<00:01:01.590> not

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
like right here within the durian it's a

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.120 
like right here within the durian it's a
straight<00:01:41.369> line<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:42.119> down<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:43.140> normally<00:01:43.979> if

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
straight line going down and normally if

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.490 
straight line going down and normally if
the<00:01:44.159> durians<00:01:44.700> pre-split<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.990> means<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.380> was

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the durians pre-split that means it was

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.679 
the durians pre-split that means it was
ripe<00:01:46.740> when<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.130> fell<00:01:47.280> off<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.430> tree<00:01:47.820> or<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.570> was

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
ripe when it fell off the tree or it was

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.719 
ripe when it fell off the tree or it was
ripe<00:01:48.930> when<00:01:49.500> they<00:01:49.649> froze<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.310> before<00:01:50.640> they

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
ripe when they froze it before they

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.940 
ripe when they froze it before they
shipped<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.329> US<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.170> that's<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.799> way

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
shipped it to the US and that's the way

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.399 
shipped it to the US and that's the way
you<00:01:53.100> want<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.450> want<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.930> find<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.290> with

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
you want it so you want to find it with

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.030 
you want it so you want to find it with
this<00:01:55.500> one

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
this one

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.650 
this one
so<00:01:56.340> there's<00:01:56.490> three<00:01:56.760> things<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.180> look<00:01:57.210> for

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
so there's three things to look for

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.450 
so there's three things to look for
whether<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.740> when<00:01:58.950> you're<00:01:59.070> getting<00:01:59.190> them

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
whether you when you're getting them

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.100 
whether you when you're getting them
frozen<00:01:59.760> the<00:02:00.060> first<00:02:00.330> thing<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.720> are<00:02:00.990> they

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
frozen the first thing is are they

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.920 
frozen the first thing is are they
already<00:02:01.380> split<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.490> second<00:02:02.940> thing<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.300> at<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
already split the second thing is at the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.270 
already split the second thing is at the
top<00:02:04.350> here<00:02:05.210> do<00:02:06.210> they<00:02:06.360> make<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> straight<00:02:07.020> line

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
top here do they make a straight line

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.800 
top here do they make a straight line
between<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.610> spikes<00:02:08.940> because<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.600> means

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
between the spikes because that means

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.000 
between the spikes because that means
when<00:02:09.930> they<00:02:10.020> throw<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.290> out<00:02:10.410> they'll<00:02:10.619> open<00:02:10.800> up

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
when they throw it out they'll open up

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.430 
when they throw it out they'll open up
pretty<00:02:11.250> easy<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:12.660> then<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.960> third<00:02:13.170> thing<00:02:13.200> is

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
pretty easy and then the third thing is

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.530 
pretty easy and then the third thing is
you<00:02:13.560> want<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.860> try<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.070> smell<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.580> now<00:02:15.390> when

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540
