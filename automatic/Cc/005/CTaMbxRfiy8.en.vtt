00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.090
 good 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.129
 Hello 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.820
 ah 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.110
 and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.710
 How is everything that is rock am anonymous 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.540
 I bring a new video more for my channel 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.390
 this time we are in call of duty black 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.650
 ops' and in call of duty black ops 1 and 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.000
 good people to say is that you are 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.500
 watching before your screen is a 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.479
 quite pretty good departure from 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.300
 Victor de Mercal or triple consumption with 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.130
 ak-47 playing totally alone just like 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.840
 you know that the game vÃ­ctor always tends 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.460
 play almost always only by totally 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.080
 alone and good this live a game of 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.850
 113 casualties in lockdown with the k 47 with the 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.950
 camouflage I do not know if it's like a tiger is 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.810
 as as loose from you degree but good 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.190
 is taking weapons from the ground the game 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.259
 lasted well more about ten minutes 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.660
 but I've cut out the parts that I think 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.430
 which are the most interesting so that 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.560
 the game is heavy and you listen 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.660
 what I have to say today and good 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.619
 people that tell you is dominating more in 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.090
 the comments 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.190
 the previous video of the burn sub zero 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.929
 and so that she did explain that she was asking 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.820
 whose opinion is not about what it would be if 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.580
 you want to see on the channel and basically 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.710
 are the two that repeated the most are not 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.259
 those that more the more that more 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.210
 repeated was the series to steal your game 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.560
 perfect in weapons game I think is a 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.450
 which is quite seen but good 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.340
 as you have lost 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.570
 then I'm going to do that, it's going to be the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.219
 series of one of the series that goes to 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.409
 be active from the week that 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.149
 comes in the channel you want to give it a 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.500
 a little bit of time so you can start 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.989
 the series and now that the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.250
 next week with the series and another one 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.860
 the series that was also repeated a lot 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.080
 is road to that in infected that can 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.239
 be the truth quite interesting and 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.430
 pretty funny and it's going to be the second 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.349
 series that will be active in the channel 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.090
 that is not going to do first a number and 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.280
 then another will be the two series 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.780
 active at the same time in the channel I'm going 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.150
 to explain why not my channel 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.830
 basically those who are here 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.420
 for quite some time this one 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.790
 have been here for quite some time I want to say 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.440
 since before summer they are subscribers 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.819
 that only good that they are in my 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.400
 channel because they like the car audio 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.410
 and because good because they did not want 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.750
 keep watching white 2 because they wanted 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.400
 see the current batch and I on my channel 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.160
 he offered them that content so he 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.599
 subscribe to my channel, but not good 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.130
 when the summer started, with the 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.450
 training especially with the promotion of 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.510
 Alpha, many people have not come 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.360
 who wants to see black ops 2 and that's why 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.760
 so I 'm going to 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.830
 to have the two series be activated at 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.330
 same time on the channel that is not going 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.400
 to leave the old instructors 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.830
 thrown away as you imagine a company not 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.360
 that movistar is making such an offer 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.920
 because you are in another company 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.630
 perhaps you have the same offer for the 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.730
 simple fact that I already captured 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.320
 I do not want to do that, I'm just what 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.290
 contrary to that, if not only it would go up 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.000
 the perfect broken trail series and I 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.560
 I went up to rob you that the infected 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.780
 that can also be fun and for 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.550
 that's the fact that I'm going to upload the 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.990
 dose that is time that yes give me time to 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.120
 I can take a couple of episodes of 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.310
 each series that surely for the 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.320
 and start next week and good 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.120
 people from the things that I had to 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.470
 commenting is that also in a video 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.000
 surely in the video that you have to 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.790
 have on Sunday is worth going to have 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.050
 a very good game this Sunday and the 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.610
 Saturday I will also have a game 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.760
 pretty good the two are going to be playing 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.290
 totally alone and to tell you that the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.880
 Sunday game surely talk 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.510
 about the call of duty advanced warfare 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.950
 OK 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.440
 such are my opinion are things 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.390
 tranquility is now I will give my opinion 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.200
 on various issues have come about whether 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.640
 not the cinema mod 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.870
 about what I think there is not 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.060
 our cinema mode as I told you 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.160
 about what I think of the skills and 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.170
 all that subject and give in my opinion more 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.580
 extensively on all this I stated 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.049
 I have luckily it seems to me that since 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.070
 I made him the opinion video of this 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.410
 is the other to read has not spoken again 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.280
 of the subject when it has been a channel of 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.380
 news I am not a district channel the 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.690
 Attentive to the things that come out that yes 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.669
 prestige is that if such I am not a channel 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.200
 so if a channel of games my channel is 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.790
 based on the items not the news 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.830
 but I also want to have something 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.419
 informed only all the information 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.250
 that I am going to explain on Sunday because 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.340
 You see, you will have heard from others 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.530
 channels that are news specialists and 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.570
 this kind of thing but good always the 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.860
 more information door or own 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.690
 personal opinion that can be very 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.000
 interesting for you to know what 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.500
 what do I think about the game and what 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.090
 good to tell you that's what I had 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.290
 to comment on in today's video 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.270
 we remember that we have the channel of gift 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.310
 Victor is the destruction that good 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.860
 always say pass some new more 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.719
 It never hurts 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.069
 and that you give warmth to your channel and good 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:09.639
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:11.590
 repeated the 10 saying you're going to 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.710
 have before if rutte is an asset 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.090
 infected min to steal your game 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.860
 perfect the weapon game on white 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.150
 then two and then there was also a series 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.639
 that we have asked for a lot that was the 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.080
 steal your double than playing only in life 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.240
 and what to say is that that series also 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.830
 they are active but good will be those that 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.569
 James in physical life is twice as much as a 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.770
 light then you will have the double and 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.080
 is I'm not going to do in a style of 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.639
 Roissy goes out then and it's done and 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.159
 comments that the video on Sunday 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.750
 you see to have all the information that 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:39.699
 has left the warfare bread more my 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.990
 own personal opinion on the subject 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.520
 so I hope you liked the 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.590
 video like favorites and all that theme 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.900
