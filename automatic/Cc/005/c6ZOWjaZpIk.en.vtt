we're<00:02:38.340> starting<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.580> build<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.849> timeline

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
we're starting to build the timeline

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.089 
we're starting to build the timeline
that<00:02:39.360> my<00:02:39.870> backup<00:02:40.230> window<00:02:40.470> started<00:02:40.800> at<00:02:40.920> 1:00

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
that my backup window started at 1:00

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.830 
that my backup window started at 1:00
and<00:02:41.310> at<00:02:41.970> 104

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
and at 104

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.540 
and at 104
the<00:02:42.959> first<00:02:43.170> machine<00:02:43.470> started<00:02:43.830> backing<00:02:43.980> up<00:02:44.280> so

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
the first machine started backing up so

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.190 
the first machine started backing up so
this<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:45.209> apparently<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.810> very<00:02:45.989> first

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
this is apparently the very first

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.350 
this is apparently the very first
machine<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.530> backed<00:02:46.860> up<00:02:47.010> last<00:02:47.250> night<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:48.209> all

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
machine that backed up last night of all

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.290 
machine that backed up last night of all
my<00:02:48.510> systems<00:02:50.989> okay<00:02:52.819> so<00:02:53.819> now<00:02:54.000> we<00:02:54.060> have

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
my systems okay so now we have

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.449 
my systems okay so now we have
established<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.870> timeline<00:02:55.350> how<00:02:56.220> does<00:02:56.340> that

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
established the timeline how does that

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.820 
established the timeline how does that
compare<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.769> backup<00:02:58.769> properties<00:03:00.650> it's<00:03:01.650> on<00:03:01.739> a

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
compare to backup properties it's on a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.580 
compare to backup properties it's on a

that you could just bring up and you can

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.400 
that you could just bring up and you can
see<00:03:14.610> when<00:03:14.970> my<00:03:15.060> last<00:03:15.180> backup<00:03:15.569> was<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:15.900> 1:05<00:03:16.380> a.m.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
let's go back to the server back as you

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.180 
let's go back to the server back as you
can<00:03:36.930> get<00:03:37.049> by<00:03:37.170> double-clicking<00:03:37.440> there<00:03:37.890> as<00:03:37.980> well

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
can get by double-clicking there as well

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.440 
can get by double-clicking there as well
and<00:03:38.519> then<00:03:38.609> double<00:03:38.880> click<00:03:39.030> here<00:03:39.060> in<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.299> last

and then double click here in the last
entry<00:03:43.310> but<00:03:44.310> notice<00:03:44.609> you<00:03:44.730> don't<00:03:44.850> get<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.329> the

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
entry but notice you don't get the the

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.530 
entry but notice you don't get the the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
time of glass backup other than right

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.880 
time of glass backup other than right
there<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:49.049> code<00:03:49.200> at<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.380> top<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.680> list

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
there that code at the top of the list

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.680 
there that code at the top of the list
and<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.549> can<00:03:50.609> see<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.880> moves<00:03:51.060> around<00:03:51.239> for<00:03:51.630> the

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
and you can see it moves around for the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.440 
and you can see it moves around for the
night<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:52.260> each<00:03:52.350> night<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.620> little<00:03:52.890> different

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
night so each night a little different

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.840 
night so each night a little different
okay<00:03:54.450> so<00:03:54.840> on<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.829> same<00:03:56.070> survey<00:03:56.430> it's<00:03:56.549> local

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
okay so on that same survey it's local

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.699 
okay so on that same survey it's local
file<00:03:57.030> system<00:03:57.450> has<00:03:57.540> client<00:03:58.019> computer<00:03:58.350> backups

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
file system has client computer backups

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.319 
file system has client computer backups
and<00:03:59.220> if<00:04:00.090> we<00:04:00.269> log<00:04:00.600> here<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:01.820> scroll<00:04:02.820> back<00:04:02.880> to

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
and if we log here and scroll back to

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.630 
and if we log here and scroll back to
the<00:04:03.480> early<00:04:04.850> morning<00:04:05.850> hours<00:04:06.000> there<00:04:06.600> as<00:04:06.840> well

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
the early morning hours there as well

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.370 
the early morning hours there as well
you<00:04:08.640> can<00:04:08.940> see<00:04:09.090> I've<00:04:09.209> highlighted<00:04:09.480> a

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
you can see I've highlighted a

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.190 
you can see I've highlighted a
clustering<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.519> files<00:04:11.850> it<00:04:12.090> wrote<00:04:12.299> during<00:04:12.989> that

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
clustering of files it wrote during that

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.099 
clustering of files it wrote during that
half<00:04:13.319> hour<00:04:13.500> interval<00:04:14.660> ok<00:04:15.660> so<00:04:15.720> again<00:04:15.900> this

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
half hour interval ok so again this

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.229 
half hour interval ok so again this
matches<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.590> timeline<00:04:16.799> pretty<00:04:17.190> well<00:04:17.370> as<00:04:17.549> well

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.150 

ok<00:04:21.239> what's<00:04:21.510> left<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.840> look<00:04:21.989> at<00:04:22.310> well

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
ok what's left to look at well

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.100 
ok what's left to look at well
it's<00:04:24.310> done<00:04:24.520> doing<00:04:24.730> that<00:04:24.850> work<00:04:25.120> how<00:04:25.720> does<00:04:25.780> it

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
it's done doing that work how does it

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.840 
it's done doing that work how does it
trigger<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.560> back<00:04:26.710> up<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.010> next<00:04:27.070> day<00:04:27.280> well

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
trigger the back up the next day well

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.910 
trigger the back up the next day well
it's<00:04:28.060> not<00:04:28.180> doing<00:04:28.330> wiggling<00:04:28.900> or<00:04:29.230> magic<00:04:29.530> packets

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
go at 126 a.m. tonight so not at 105

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.240 
go at 126 a.m. tonight so not at 105
it's<00:05:19.750> a<00:05:19.840> little<00:05:20.020> later<00:05:20.200> so<00:05:20.560> apparently<00:05:21.070> some

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
it's a little later so apparently some

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.400 
it's a little later so apparently some
other<00:05:21.400> machine<00:05:21.790> has<00:05:22.000> snuck<00:05:22.600> in<00:05:22.810> before<00:05:23.110> me<00:05:23.230> for

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
other machine has snuck in before me for

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.170 
other machine has snuck in before me for
tonight<00:05:23.560> so<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.400> seems<00:05:24.580> to<00:05:24.640> have<00:05:24.790> some<00:05:24.940> sort<00:05:25.150> of

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
tonight so it seems to have some sort of

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.870 
tonight so it seems to have some sort of
algorithm<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.980> move<00:05:26.980> around<00:05:27.160> when<00:05:27.640> a<00:05:27.670> machine

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.370 
is backed up each night you just have a
quick<00:05:32.170> look<00:05:32.440> here<00:05:32.490> it's<00:05:33.490> saying<00:05:33.760> every<00:05:34.120> day

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
quick look here it's saying every day

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.200 
quick look here it's saying every day
but<00:05:35.380> again<00:05:35.680> if<00:05:36.370> we<00:05:36.520> look<00:05:36.640> at<00:05:36.730> this<00:05:36.820> tomorrow

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
but again if we look at this tomorrow

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.690 
but again if we look at this tomorrow
it'll<00:05:37.510> be<00:05:37.630> different<00:05:38.110> it<00:05:38.500> just<00:05:38.530> changes<00:05:39.340> every

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
it'll be different it just changes every

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.180 
it'll be different it just changes every
time<00:05:40.110> so<00:05:41.110> it<00:05:41.200> seems<00:05:41.440> the<00:05:41.530> agent<00:05:41.860> is<00:05:41.950> kind<00:05:42.130> of

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
time so it seems the agent is kind of

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.770 
time so it seems the agent is kind of
