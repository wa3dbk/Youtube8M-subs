and I go quit system preferences and

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.170 
and I go quit system preferences and
then<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.660> go<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.920> system<00:02:25.920> preferences<00:02:26.130> there<00:02:27.060> we

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
then I go to system preferences there we
