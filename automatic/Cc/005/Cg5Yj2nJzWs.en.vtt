 well let's get down to work and 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.380
 let's start with this video these are the 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.100
 ingredients that need a little 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:19.740
 under a butter egg are left for 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:24.060
 beat tantita nutmeg shrimp 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.159
 Parmesan cheese and of course the effect 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.049
 chi minh or the paste to make your chip 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.030
 The first thing we are going to do is put 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.090
 cook the pasta we will put to boil 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.549
 little water like a liter and we're going to 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.920
 burn little oil and then the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.170
 paste the oil is so that it does not stick 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.399
 the pasta and we're going to leave it there more or 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.340
 less about 20 minutes until it sew 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:50.880
 completely 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:53.039
 [Music] 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.930
 for which we will also need 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.670
 two tablespoons of butter the vaccine 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.939
 melt in a pan and we're going to 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.990
 add a cup of cream to beat it 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.990
 we mix very well 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.490
 we add little salt and a little pin 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.330
 of nutmeg 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.580
 [Music] 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.320
 then we are going to add it either 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.750
 quarter cup or half a cup of cheese 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.750
 Parmesan already depends on your taste if you 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.530
 like a lot or a little 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.610
 [Music] 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.610
 [Applause] 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.030
 we add a flame of eggs and the 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.990
 very very good guys 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.210
 [Music] 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.760
 and in the end he decides to add a little bit 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.860
 under this is completely optional if 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.380
 you do not like it I did not add it happening to the 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.660
 shrimp I'm going to put some oil in 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.420
 a pan and I'm going to put them clearly is 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.490
 super simple we are not going to flip and 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.330
 we are going to cook them until they are like that 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.170
 as rositas 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.240
 already after 20 minutes let's review 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.520
 our pasta since it is well cooked what 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.500
 let's strain to me the truth is 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.680
 He lost the colander then we took it off 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.790
 Water 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.489
 [Music] 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.590
 and that's it, that's how we have this 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.500
 feast and alfredo that is very rich and 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.090
 this means it is very easy to prepare 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.280
 already at the end we put the pasta 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.950
 we add the creampie you can also 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.040
 add more parmesan if you like and 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.260
 final because the shrimp I hope that you 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.200
