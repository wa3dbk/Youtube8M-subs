something completely different we'll

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.799

but<00:00:54.230> i<00:00:54.350> do<00:00:54.469> believe<00:00:54.829> personally<00:00:55.190> that<00:00:55.489> we

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
but i do believe personally that we

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.490 
but i do believe personally that we
following<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.420> black<00:00:56.629> ops<00:00:56.899> storyline

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
following the black ops storyline

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.350 
following the black ops storyline
continuing<00:00:58.129> on<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.460> black<00:00:58.700> ops<00:00:58.940> 3<00:00:59.210> however

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
continuing on to black ops 3 however

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.529 
continuing on to black ops 3 however
there<00:01:00.020> is<00:01:00.200> not<00:01:00.559> as<00:01:00.739> much<00:01:00.770> room<00:01:01.430> as<00:01:01.670> what<00:01:02.239> we<00:01:02.360> may

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
there is not as much room as what we may

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.479 
there is not as much room as what we may
think<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:02.989> if<00:01:03.350> we're<00:01:03.559> actually<00:01:03.739> taking<00:01:04.160> a<00:01:04.369> look

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
think so if we're actually taking a look

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.859 
think so if we're actually taking a look
at<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.699> storyline<00:01:05.119> and<00:01:05.239> all<00:01:05.420> that<00:01:05.660> kind<00:01:05.840> of

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
at the storyline and all that kind of

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.840 
at the storyline and all that kind of
stuff<00:01:05.930> seeing<00:01:06.710> at<00:01:06.860> where<00:01:07.100> we<00:01:07.190> can<00:01:07.340> go<00:01:07.490> with<00:01:07.759> the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
stuff seeing at where we can go with the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.210 
stuff seeing at where we can go with the
2015<00:01:08.509> title<00:01:08.930> now<00:01:09.050> a<00:01:09.080> lot<00:01:09.410> of<00:01:09.440> people<00:01:09.770> are<00:01:09.950> in

into the future that will be going back

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.370 
into the future that will be going back
to<00:01:14.149> where<00:01:14.330> advanced<00:01:14.690> warfare<00:01:14.960> was<00:01:15.140> in<00:01:15.320> the

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
2050s or continuing back where black ops

2050s or continuing back where black ops
2<00:01:18.380> was<00:01:18.590> almost<00:01:19.130> like<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.520> consecutive<00:01:20.030> string

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
2 was almost like a consecutive string

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.340 
2 was almost like a consecutive string
of<00:01:20.780> events<00:01:20.900> going<00:01:21.380> into<00:01:21.799> 20<00:01:22.220> 25<00:01:22.640> or<00:01:22.970> 20-26<00:01:23.750> risk

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350

us<00:01:24.470> a<00:01:24.560> little<00:01:24.770> theory<00:01:25.040> with<00:01:25.250> that<00:01:25.549> here<00:01:25.880> in<00:01:26.000> a

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
us a little theory with that here in a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.359 
us a little theory with that here in a
second<00:01:26.509> but<00:01:26.689> however<00:01:26.869> i<00:01:27.080> do<00:01:27.290> believe<00:01:27.740> that<00:01:28.189> if

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
second but however i do believe that if

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.010 
second but however i do believe that if
you're<00:01:28.670> worried<00:01:28.970> about<00:01:29.030> going<00:01:29.330> too<00:01:29.630> far<00:01:29.869> into

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
you're worried about going too far into

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.690 
you're worried about going too far into
the<00:01:30.140> future<00:01:30.259> you<00:01:30.680> don't<00:01:30.860> have<00:01:31.040> to<00:01:31.250> worry<00:01:31.430> too

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
the future you don't have to worry too

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.640 
the future you don't have to worry too
much<00:01:31.729> now<00:01:32.210> again<00:01:32.360> one<00:01:32.780> more<00:01:32.930> time<00:01:32.990> before<00:01:33.380> it

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
much now again one more time before it

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.230 
much now again one more time before it
gets<00:01:33.799> too<00:01:33.950> far<00:01:34.220> into<00:01:34.400> this<00:01:34.610> theories<00:01:35.090> and

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
gets too far into this theories and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.240 
gets too far into this theories and
stuff<00:01:35.570> like<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:35.780> this<00:01:36.439> is<00:01:36.590> all<00:01:36.799> that<00:01:36.830> that<00:01:37.070> is

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
stuff like that this is all that that is

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.830 
stuff like that this is all that that is
just<00:01:37.280> theories<00:01:37.939> it's<00:01:38.150> not<00:01:38.390> in<00:01:38.540> any<00:01:38.720> way<00:01:38.810> shape

further ado let's start with the one
theory<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:51.650> a<00:01:51.710> lot<00:01:51.979> of<00:01:52.009> people<00:01:52.130> have<00:01:52.490> been

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
starting to take traction on not so much

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.490 
starting to take traction on not so much
more<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.030> mainstream<00:01:56.390> theories<00:01:57.200> but

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
more so mainstream theories but

something that is still gaining a little

that's only one of four options in terms

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.020 
that's only one of four options in terms
of<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.629> black<00:03:11.840> ops<00:03:12.079> 2<00:03:12.379> endings<00:03:12.889> now<00:03:13.310> what<00:03:13.790> do<00:03:14.000> I

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
of the black ops 2 endings now what do I

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.479 
of the black ops 2 endings now what do I
believe<00:03:14.720> will<00:03:15.169> happen<00:03:15.349> with<00:03:15.769> black<00:03:15.980> ops<00:03:16.189> 3

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
believe will happen with black ops 3

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.099 
believe will happen with black ops 3
again<00:03:16.790> as<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.120> said<00:03:17.150> it's<00:03:17.540> just<00:03:17.599> a<00:03:17.840> placeholder

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
again as I said it's just a placeholder

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.050 
again as I said it's just a placeholder
black<00:03:18.590> ops<00:03:18.769> 3<00:03:18.950> isn't<00:03:19.159> anything<00:03:19.340> confirmed<00:03:19.819> but

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
black ops 3 isn't anything confirmed but

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.429 
black ops 3 isn't anything confirmed but
I<00:03:20.209> do<00:03:20.329> believe<00:03:20.659> that's<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:20.989> route<00:03:21.230> we're

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
I do believe that's the route we're

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:22.960 
I do believe that's the route we're
going<00:03:21.769> and<00:03:21.889> I<00:03:22.250> don't<00:03:22.430> believe<00:03:22.489> that<00:03:22.639> is<00:03:22.790> going

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
going and I don't believe that is going

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.909 
going and I don't believe that is going
to<00:03:23.060> be<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.180> direct<00:03:23.689> correlation<00:03:23.959> following

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919 
to be a direct correlation following

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.190 
to be a direct correlation following
black<00:03:25.310> ops<00:03:25.549> 2<00:03:25.879> but<00:03:26.419> rather<00:03:26.599> we're<00:03:26.959> gonna<00:03:27.079> be

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
black ops 2 but rather we're gonna be

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.899 
black ops 2 but rather we're gonna be
going<00:03:27.260> back<00:03:27.590> in<00:03:27.799> time<00:03:28.069> again<00:03:28.489> that's<00:03:28.699> where

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
going back in time again that's where

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.490 
going back in time again that's where
I'm<00:03:29.030> saying<00:03:29.329> to<00:03:29.479> a<00:03:29.510> lot<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.780> people<00:03:29.989> don't

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
I'm saying to a lot of people don't

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.140 
I'm saying to a lot of people don't
really<00:03:30.739> worry<00:03:31.010> about<00:03:31.099> going<00:03:31.519> too<00:03:31.790> far<00:03:32.000> into

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
really worry about going too far into

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.460 
really worry about going too far into
the<00:03:32.269> future<00:03:32.359> because<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:32.870> think<00:03:32.959> we're<00:03:33.440> done

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
the future because I think we're done

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.740 
the future because I think we're done
going<00:03:33.889> into<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.459> future<00:03:34.669> with<00:03:35.359> this<00:03:35.540> next

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
going into the future with this next

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.240 
going into the future with this next
Call<00:03:36.019> of<00:03:36.049> Duty<00:03:36.319> title<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:36.799> don't<00:03:37.040> think<00:03:37.159> we're

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
Call of Duty title I don't think we're

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.649 
Call of Duty title I don't think we're
necessarily<00:03:37.340> going<00:03:37.849> to<00:03:37.970> be<00:03:38.060> going<00:03:38.269> back<00:03:38.479> as

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
necessarily going to be going back as

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.569 
necessarily going to be going back as
far<00:03:38.720> as<00:03:39.019> World<00:03:39.379> War<00:03:39.440> two<00:03:39.799> though<00:03:40.340> the

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
far as World War two though the

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.369 
far as World War two though the
storyline<00:03:41.000> did<00:03:41.269> somewhat<00:03:41.750> tie<00:03:41.930> into<00:03:42.290> the

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
storyline did somewhat tie into the

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.170 
storyline did somewhat tie into the
black<00:03:42.620> ops<00:03:42.889> story<00:03:43.250> I<00:03:43.459> don't<00:03:43.940> think<00:03:44.090> that

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
black ops story I don't think that

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.699 
black ops story I don't think that
that's<00:03:44.239> going<00:03:44.419> to<00:03:44.479> be<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.690> case<00:03:44.900> again<00:03:45.440> like<00:03:45.680> I

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
that's going to be the case again like I

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.830 
that's going to be the case again like I
said<00:03:45.799> there<00:03:46.159> are<00:03:46.280> way<00:03:46.579> too<00:03:46.609> many<00:03:46.909> options<00:03:47.269> with

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
said there are way too many options with

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.199 
said there are way too many options with
the<00:03:47.930> black<00:03:48.139> ops<00:03:48.379> 2<00:03:48.590> storyline<00:03:49.040> for<00:03:49.459> options

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
the black ops 2 storyline for options

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.670 
the black ops 2 storyline for options
that<00:03:50.329> you<00:03:50.389> can<00:03:50.419> have<00:03:50.629> most<00:03:50.959> players<00:03:51.229> didn't

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
that you can have most players didn't

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.920 
that you can have most players didn't
play<00:03:51.889> the<00:03:52.069> game<00:03:52.250> more<00:03:52.609> than<00:03:52.790> once<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.569> lot<00:03:53.900> of

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
play the game more than once so a lot of

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.689 
play the game more than once so a lot of
them<00:03:54.079> only<00:03:54.290> experienced<00:03:54.949> one<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.430> four

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:55.699 
them only experienced one of the four

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:57.550 
them only experienced one of the four
endings<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.329> split<00:03:56.599> endings<00:03:56.900> really<00:03:57.409> were<00:03:57.530> a

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
endings the split endings really were a

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.439 
endings the split endings really were a
nice<00:03:57.829> addition<00:03:58.129> to<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.489> game<00:03:58.790> but<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.299> could

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
nice addition to the game but it could

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.180 
nice addition to the game but it could
never<00:03:59.629> keep<00:03:59.959> one<00:04:00.379> starting<00:04:00.859> point<00:04:01.069> and

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
never keep one starting point and

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.670 
never keep one starting point and
pinpointed<00:04:02.060> on<00:04:02.180> one<00:04:02.510> specific<00:04:02.750> area<00:04:03.109> now

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
pinpointed on one specific area now

pinpointed on one specific area now
recently<00:04:03.979> I<00:04:04.220> was<00:04:04.609> going<00:04:04.909> back<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.359> watching

all of the cut scenes from the black ops
2<00:04:07.909> campaign<00:04:08.449> because<00:04:08.870> I<00:04:09.049> honestly<00:04:09.349> just<00:04:09.590> love

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010

the<00:04:10.189> campaign<00:04:10.579> in<00:04:10.790> general<00:04:11.209> in<00:04:11.329> that<00:04:11.569> game<00:04:11.810> I

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
the campaign in general in that game I

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.599 
the campaign in general in that game I
felt<00:04:12.470> like<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.739> cut<00:04:12.949> scenes<00:04:13.159> weren't<00:04:13.400> very

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
felt like the cut scenes weren't very

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.610 
felt like the cut scenes weren't very
well<00:04:13.879> done<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.180> it<00:04:14.510> explained<00:04:15.109> a<00:04:15.229> lot<00:04:15.439> but

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
well done and it explained a lot but

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.979 
well done and it explained a lot but
also<00:04:15.769> kept<00:04:16.159> a<00:04:16.250> lot<00:04:16.519> of<00:04:16.579> things<00:04:16.820> cryptic<00:04:17.359> one<00:04:17.900> of

believe that we could be looking in the
right<00:06:21.170> direction<00:06:21.350> whether<00:06:21.830> or<00:06:22.010> not<00:06:22.130> we've

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
right direction whether or not we've

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.370 
right direction whether or not we've
found<00:06:22.580> the<00:06:22.790> actual<00:06:22.940> key<00:06:23.480> to<00:06:23.960> what<00:06:24.170> we're

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
found the actual key to what we're

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.530 
found the actual key to what we're
looking<00:06:24.710> for<00:06:24.740> that<00:06:25.550> is<00:06:25.760> something<00:06:26.000> that<00:06:26.180> we

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
looking for that is something that we

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.300 
looking for that is something that we
won't<00:06:26.780> know<00:06:26.960> for<00:06:26.990> a<00:06:27.260> little<00:06:27.500> bit<00:06:27.710> right<00:06:28.130> now

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
won't know for a little bit right now

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.040 
won't know for a little bit right now
since<00:06:28.640> there<00:06:28.820> is<00:06:28.970> nothing<00:06:29.420> out<00:06:29.570> there<00:06:29.750> it<00:06:29.870> is

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
since there is nothing out there it is

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.080 
since there is nothing out there it is
all<00:06:30.290> speculation<00:06:30.590> but<00:06:31.310> i<00:06:31.340> do<00:06:31.430> believe<00:06:31.610> now<00:06:32.030> we

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
all speculation but i do believe now we

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.700 
all speculation but i do believe now we
may<00:06:32.570> be<00:06:32.630> looking<00:06:32.870> in<00:06:33.230> the<00:06:33.350> right<00:06:33.500> direction

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
may be looking in the right direction

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.740 
may be looking in the right direction

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.560 
the video here today I believe
personally<00:06:37.550> we're<00:06:37.820> gonna<00:06:37.910> be<00:06:38.000> following<00:06:38.180> the

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
personally we're gonna be following the

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.020 
personally we're gonna be following the
black<00:06:38.810> ops<00:06:39.080> 3<00:06:39.350> storyline<00:06:39.830> now<00:06:40.400> going<00:06:40.610> back<00:06:40.730> to

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
black ops 3 storyline now going back to

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.270 
black ops 3 storyline now going back to
see<00:06:41.210> what<00:06:41.330> Mason<00:06:41.750> was<00:06:41.900> up<00:06:42.080> to<00:06:42.260> for<00:06:42.710> the<00:06:42.740> 36

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
see what Mason was up to for the 36

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.190 
see what Mason was up to for the 36
years<00:06:43.550> that<00:06:43.670> he<00:06:43.790> was<00:06:44.000> missing<00:06:44.270> and<00:06:44.600> in<00:06:44.960> terms

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200 
years that he was missing and in terms

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.140 
years that he was missing and in terms
of<00:06:45.320> a<00:06:45.440> setting<00:06:45.800> or<00:06:45.950> era<00:06:46.220> I<00:06:46.490> do<00:06:46.610> believe<00:06:46.880> it's

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
of a setting or era I do believe it's

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.550 
of a setting or era I do believe it's
going<00:06:47.300> to<00:06:47.480> be<00:06:47.630> a<00:06:47.660> modern

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
going to be a modern

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.740 
going to be a modern
now<00:06:48.830> one<00:06:49.190> final<00:06:49.520> time<00:06:49.940> I<00:06:50.150> can't<00:06:50.389> stress<00:06:50.630> this

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
now one final time I can't stress this

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.570 
now one final time I can't stress this
enough<00:06:50.810> this<00:06:51.470> is<00:06:51.620> only<00:06:51.860> theories<00:06:52.430> and

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
enough this is only theories and

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.330 
enough this is only theories and
speculation<00:06:53.450> there<00:06:53.930> is<00:06:54.050> absolutely<00:06:54.770> no<00:06:55.070> proof

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
speculation there is absolutely no proof

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.460 
speculation there is absolutely no proof
to<00:06:55.400> confirm<00:06:56.000> any<00:06:56.270> of<00:06:56.419> this<00:06:56.600> nor<00:06:57.139> is<00:06:57.260> there<00:06:57.440> any

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470 
to confirm any of this nor is there any

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.710 
to confirm any of this nor is there any
to<00:06:57.860> deny<00:06:58.160> it<00:06:58.220> so<00:06:58.520> right<00:06:58.970> now<00:06:59.030> we're<00:06:59.389> just<00:06:59.419> left

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
to deny it so right now we're just left

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.300 
to deny it so right now we're just left
to<00:06:59.840> think<00:07:00.080> that's<00:07:00.410> what<00:07:00.650> we're<00:07:00.770> doing<00:07:00.800> here<00:07:01.220> in

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
to think that's what we're doing here in

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.010 
to think that's what we're doing here in
this<00:07:01.400> video<00:07:01.700> but<00:07:01.970> that's<00:07:02.570> we're<00:07:02.720> going<00:07:02.840> to<00:07:02.900> end

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
this video but that's we're going to end

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.090

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
that will be going back with a black ops

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.260 
that will be going back with a black ops
3<00:07:09.290> to<00:07:09.500> a<00:07:09.530> modern<00:07:09.950> setting<00:07:10.190> covering<00:07:11.000> what

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.270 
3 to a modern setting covering what

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.600 
3 to a modern setting covering what
Mason<00:07:11.720> was<00:07:11.930> up<00:07:12.139> to<00:07:12.320> for<00:07:12.590> those<00:07:12.680> 36<00:07:13.250> years<00:07:13.460> that

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610 
Mason was up to for those 36 years that

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.370 
Mason was up to for those 36 years that
he<00:07:13.700> was<00:07:13.910> missing<00:07:14.210> from<00:07:14.750> the<00:07:14.930> black<00:07:15.139> ops

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
he was missing from the black ops

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.140 
he was missing from the black ops
storyline<00:07:15.830> because<00:07:16.040> really<00:07:16.280> that<00:07:16.370> is<00:07:16.669> a<00:07:16.700> big

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.150 
storyline because really that is a big

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.820

hole<00:07:17.450> in<00:07:17.480> the<00:07:17.780> story<00:07:18.050> that<00:07:18.200> we<00:07:18.320> have<00:07:18.470> no

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830
