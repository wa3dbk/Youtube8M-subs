General Motors we hear a lot about
hybrids<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.230> there's<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> number<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.770> them<00:00:55.860> on

hybrids and there's a number of them on

hybrids and there's a number of them on
the<00:00:56.160> road<00:00:56.340> today<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.859> hybrid<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:58.980> it's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the road today this is hybrid but it's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.189 
the road today this is hybrid but it's
not<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.340> same<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.359> ones<00:01:00.539> we've<00:01:00.780> gotten<00:01:01.109> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
not the same as the ones we've gotten to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.349 
not the same as the ones we've gotten to
know<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> last<00:01:01.739> few<00:01:01.890> years<00:01:01.980> now<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.910> Chevy

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359

percent<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> time<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:07.020> most<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> time

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.980 
percent of the time so most of the time
you<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.010> about<00:01:08.159> 40<00:01:08.700> miles<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.299> electric<00:01:09.720> range

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
you get about 40 miles of electric range
