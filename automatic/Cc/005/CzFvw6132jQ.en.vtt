00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:15.469
 also an old acquaintance the ultra 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.290
 raptor of the sportive shoe for 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.840
 Ultra fund par excellence sneakers 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.510
 super tested but today we have come here 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.390
 to tell you details explained their 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.730
 intimacies in short we have 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.540
 here we have in the first case a first 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.199
 moment a fiction sole with the x of 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.260
 green color that is probably the rubber 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.870
 with better wear adherence than those 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.899
 the brand the sportive factory but that 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.730
 they apply because technology decides 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.530
 Apply on a sneaker like this 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.949
 Well, this technology that they call 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.620
 intact break system which is the impact 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.860
 existing if you are observers you see that 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.780
 here is a kind of plate this is a 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.270
 plate that is stuck in this helmet 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.030
 is stuck between soles and that we 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.880
 favor us basically two favors 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.410
 important aspects 1 the resistance to 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.210
 the lateral torsion therefore the 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.630
 shoe is tremendously 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.810
 stable and then absorb a percentage 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.040
 of the very important impact 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.230
 approximately the manufacturer tells us 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.750
 that 20 percent of the impact that 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.050
 comes under the sole does not reach us 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.120
 under our foot more details of the 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.980
 Sneaker is a shoe with only one 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.870
 density that means that it 's so 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.350
 soft the heel part as in the 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.880
 part of output and that has a drop 8 is 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.210
 a drop 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.369
 generous good is an average drop so that 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.020
 let us understand more details of the 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.329
 shoe in the heel portion 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.890
 if you are observers you see that there 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:55.340
 mounted a kind of 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.260
 a kind of reinforcement made in this 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.960
 kind of plastic that gives it hardness 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.330
 what is the idea that holds us very well 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.010
 on our heel that holds us very 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.610
 well on our achilles heel in 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.459
 this area and avoid injuries by 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.120
 ankle sprains this also we 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.700
 It gives a lot of stability more details 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.070
 of the shoe if you look at the tacos 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.160
 they are very open there are spaces 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.980
 basically empty the idea basically 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.100
 is that when we step on mud it releases and 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.010
 the anp is clean because this cue and not 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.570
 for we have out there and also the tacos 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.670
 are placed in such a way that 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.130
 they work very correctly in 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.560
 lateral slides of both a 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.380
 side as of another in traction in rise 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.580
 and obviously in braking both in the 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.700
 heel part 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.340
 like in the front the part of 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.190
 above the upper of the shoe is 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.750
 protected on one side by a band 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.140
 made with a similar material 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.710
 that will protect us from scratches and 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.950
 of the lateral blows and on this 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.590
 this protection we mount a very upper 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.900
 open with the idea of ​​perspiring what 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.090
 possible maximum there is also a series of 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.030
 activators that are going to make us 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.880
 our foot our bridge in concrete 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.530
 is very well caught very well adapted 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.570
 to our shoe liberating us 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.110
 completely the front of the foot 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:28.110
 since in addition to having a broad form 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.560
 has the ability to catch our 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:35.660
 bridge and release our fingers more 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:40.110
 details if I unzipped it and I open it 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.510
 you will see that riding a species we would say 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.520
 average in this area to avoid 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.580
 entrance of stones and racks with 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.980
 a tongue that comes from inside very 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.320
 generous and very padded 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.959
 they also assemble an ortoli template 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.340
 on a last that is not only wide 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.860
 but it is very 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.720
 therefore it adapts to any kind of 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.560
 sometimes you know that we put on 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.000
 sneakers that have a lot of bridge and 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.830
 we noticed that bridge so very 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.690
 uncomfortable then with a sneaker like 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.209
 this is not going to happen to you and in the part of 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.590
 heel instead of having a textile finish 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.190
 we have a kind of finish with a 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.810
 synthetic leather that when our 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.449
 Sneakers moves slightly on 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.790
 our heel is going to slip and it's not going to 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.880
 drag our sock causing 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:30.090
 the discomfort of the little blisters 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.830
 more to tell you is a shoe 375 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.560
 grams the unit that's not very 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.970
 light and it's a shoe that yes very 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.350
 interesting for those people who 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.900
 you can be between 65 85 or even 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.900
 90 kilos the strong treatment very 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.060
 very stable cushion very thought 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.750
 for ultrafondo but good that I've already 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.280
 counted before grief see you and we talk 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.530
 see you in upcoming videos you know 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.360
 you can write to us and ask what 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.360
 you think opportune we see you already is
