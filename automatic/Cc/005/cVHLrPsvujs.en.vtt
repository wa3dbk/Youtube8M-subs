00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
about upgrading and getting better but

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.959 
about upgrading and getting better but
it's<00:01:58.530> very<00:01:58.740> simple<00:01:59.070> game<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.670> it's<00:01:59.790> still

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it's very simple game but it's still

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.639 
it's very simple game but it's still
somehow<00:02:00.240> addictive<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.500> definitely

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
somehow addictive so I definitely

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.950 
somehow addictive so I definitely
recommend<00:02:01.920> checking<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.610> out<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.119> before<00:02:03.780> I

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.810 
recommend checking it out and before I
