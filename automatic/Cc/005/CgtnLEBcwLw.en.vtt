00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
contact a local plastics company and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.999 
contact a local plastics company and
they're<00:01:59.640> able<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.909> cut<00:02:00.240> me<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.810> custom<00:02:01.619> piece<00:02:01.829> of

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
they're able to cut me a custom piece of

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.950 
they're able to cut me a custom piece of
acrylic<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:02.640> about<00:02:02.820> 1/8<00:02:03.149> inch<00:02:03.450> thick<00:02:03.600> as

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
acrylic that's about 1/8 inch thick as

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.469 
acrylic that's about 1/8 inch thick as
you<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.079> see<00:02:04.350> there<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:06.149> exact

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
you can see there and the exact

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.789 
you can see there and the exact
dimensions<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.049> what<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> needed<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.680> to

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
dimensions of what I needed just to

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.040 
dimensions of what I needed just to
cover<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.250> workbench<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.569> guessing

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
cover this workbench and I'm guessing

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.050 
cover this workbench and I'm guessing
that<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.289> will<00:02:10.500> hopefully<00:02:10.649> protect<00:02:11.610> this

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
that this will hopefully protect this

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.610 
that this will hopefully protect this
workbench<00:02:12.450> because<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.959> wasn't<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.260> very<00:02:13.440> good

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
workbench because it wasn't a very good

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.890 
workbench because it wasn't a very good
quality<00:02:13.800> underneath<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.910> countertop<00:02:15.599> here<00:02:15.840> I

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
quality underneath a countertop here I

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.240 
quality underneath a countertop here I
knew<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.319> was<00:02:16.410> going<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.620> get<00:02:16.709> scratched<00:02:17.010> up

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
knew that was going to get scratched up

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.520 
knew that was going to get scratched up
and<00:02:17.459> really<00:02:18.450> looked<00:02:18.660> like<00:02:18.720> crap<00:02:19.080> after<00:02:19.500> a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
and really looked like crap after a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.100 
and really looked like crap after a
while<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.099> hopefully<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.239> acrylic<00:02:21.540> top<00:02:21.900> will

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
while so hopefully this acrylic top will

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.290 
while so hopefully this acrylic top will
really<00:02:22.379> prevent<00:02:23.099> any<00:02:23.310> kind<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.610> scratches<00:02:24.150> or

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
really prevent any kind of scratches or

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.000 
really prevent any kind of scratches or
dings<00:02:24.900> or<00:02:25.170> anything<00:02:25.410> like<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.560> out<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
dings or anything like that out of the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.580 
dings or anything like that out of the
toner<00:02:26.220> top<00:02:26.550> Ramy<00:02:27.140> $25<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.319> that<00:02:28.410> local

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
number and there's the information on it

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.479 
number and there's the information on it
comes<00:03:26.370> with<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:27.049> requires<00:03:28.049> t8<00:03:28.709> bulbs<00:03:29.010> there's

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
comes with the requires t8 bulbs there's

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.089 
comes with the requires t8 bulbs there's
three<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.760> them<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.349> you<00:03:31.349> can<00:03:31.560> choose

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
three of them and you can choose

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.009 
three of them and you can choose
different<00:03:32.340> types<00:03:32.760> of<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:35.459> t8<00:03:35.819> bulbs<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.569> chose

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
different types of the t8 bulbs I chose

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.220 
different types of the t8 bulbs I chose
that<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.500> daylight<00:03:38.280> deluxe<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.989> reason

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
that the daylight deluxe and the reason

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.390 
that the daylight deluxe and the reason
for<00:03:40.409> that<00:03:40.470> is<00:03:40.680> because<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.980> was<00:03:41.069> more<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.310> a

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
for that is because it was more of a

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.180 
for that is because it was more of a
white<00:03:41.640> light<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:42.870> can<00:03:43.019> also<00:03:43.140> get<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.680> soft

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
white light you can also get the soft

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.440 
white light you can also get the soft
white<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.940> cool<00:03:45.629> white<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:45.930> believe<00:03:46.379> as<00:03:46.560> well

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
white and cool white I believe as well

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.899 
white and cool white I believe as well
that's<00:03:48.450> 32<00:03:48.840> Watts<00:03:49.200> 48<00:03:49.799> inches<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:50.580> like<00:03:50.849> I

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
that's 32 Watts 48 inches and like I

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.070 
that's 32 Watts 48 inches and like I
said<00:03:51.150> it<00:03:51.409> three<00:03:52.409> of<00:03:52.530> them<00:03:52.650> in<00:03:52.709> each<00:03:52.860> of<00:03:53.040> them<00:03:53.159> so

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
said it three of them in each of them so

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.110 
said it three of them in each of them so
and<00:03:55.080> then<00:03:55.319> we<00:03:55.860> also<00:03:56.010> have<00:03:56.370> for<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.640> shelvings
