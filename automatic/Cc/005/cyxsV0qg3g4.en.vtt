hey<00:00:08.460> everybody<00:00:08.880> when<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.570> started<00:00:10.050> this<00:00:10.230> Arbor

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
hey everybody when I started this Arbor

trellis for this container garden I knew

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.810 
trellis for this container garden I knew
I<00:00:13.349> wasn't<00:00:13.740> going<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.130> want<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.370> have<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.639> come

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
I wasn't going to want to have to come

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.000 
I wasn't going to want to have to come
out<00:00:15.000> here<00:00:15.240> twice<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> day<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.020> try<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.470> keep<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
out here twice a day to try to keep the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.480 
out here twice a day to try to keep the
containers<00:00:17.609> moist<00:00:18.470> being<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.740> containers

containers moist being in containers
they<00:00:21.029> easily<00:00:21.449> dry<00:00:22.170> out<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.400> needed<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.820> way

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
they easily dry out and we needed a way

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.820 
they easily dry out and we needed a way
to<00:00:24.000> make<00:00:24.330> sure<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> plant<00:00:25.260> stayed<00:00:25.590> well

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
to make sure that the plant stayed well

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.700 
to make sure that the plant stayed well
water<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:27.090> seemed<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.570> me<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.140> least

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
water it seemed to me that the least

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.070 
water it seemed to me that the least
expensive<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.640> best<00:00:29.910> solution<00:00:30.420> was<00:00:30.599> going<00:00:30.900> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
expensive and best solution was going to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.280 
expensive and best solution was going to
be<00:00:31.260> drip<00:00:31.619> irrigation<00:00:32.300> but<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.780> never<00:00:33.989> done

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
be drip irrigation but I have never done

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.950 
be drip irrigation but I have never done
drip<00:00:34.590> irrigation<00:00:35.100> before<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.149> most<00:00:36.420> that

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
drip irrigation before the most that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.810 
drip irrigation before the most that
I've<00:00:37.079> ever<00:00:37.350> come<00:00:37.649> close<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.460> simply

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
I've ever come close to that is simply

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.270 
I've ever come close to that is simply
buying<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.329> soaker<00:00:39.899> hose<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.860> use<00:00:40.980> with<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
buying a soaker hose to use with the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.750 
buying a soaker hose to use with the
garden<00:00:41.550> last<00:00:41.790> year<00:00:42.469> so<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.860> went<00:00:44.309> over<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
garden last year so I went over to the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.610 
garden last year so I went over to the
hardware<00:00:45.120> store<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.510> took<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.930> look<00:00:46.050> at<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.410> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
hardware store and took a look at it and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.650 
hardware store and took a look at it and
I<00:00:46.739> couldn't<00:00:46.980> understand<00:00:47.460> why<00:00:47.660> drip

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
I couldn't understand why drip

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.090 
I couldn't understand why drip
irrigation<00:00:49.140> might<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> little<00:00:49.980> bit

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
irrigation might be a little bit

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.729 
irrigation might be a little bit
intimidating<00:00:50.820> there<00:00:51.570> are<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.050> many<00:00:52.230> different

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
intimidating there are so many different

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.130 
intimidating there are so many different
parts<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.280> pieces<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.760> go<00:00:54.059> together<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.960> that

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
parts and pieces to go together so that

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.020 
parts and pieces to go together so that
you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.590> configure<00:00:55.980> your<00:00:56.129> setup<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.910> way

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
you can configure your setup the way

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.970 
you can configure your setup the way
that<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.420> need<00:00:57.660> but<00:00:58.410> if<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> don't<00:00:58.800> know

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that you need but if you don't know

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.150 
that you need but if you don't know
where<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.370> start<00:00:59.699> it<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.629> be<00:01:00.719> intimidating<00:01:01.160> so

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
where to start it can be intimidating so

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.039 
where to start it can be intimidating so
let<00:01:02.280> me<00:01:02.370> show<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.640> what<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> did<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.180> fix<00:01:03.629> up<00:01:03.870> our

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
let me show you what I did to fix up our

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.700 
let me show you what I did to fix up our
container<00:01:04.949> garden<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.580> drip<00:01:05.790> irrigation

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
container garden with drip irrigation

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.719 
container garden with drip irrigation
thankfully<00:01:07.710> when<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.010> bought<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.369> home<00:01:08.610> it

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
thankfully when we bought this home it

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.730 
thankfully when we bought this home it
was<00:01:08.850> easy<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> determine<00:01:09.930> where<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.110> wanted<00:01:10.619> to

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
was easy to determine where I wanted to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.640 
was easy to determine where I wanted to
garden<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.600> because<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> orientation

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
garden to be because of the orientation

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.960 
garden to be because of the orientation
of<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> Sun<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> lay<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.820> land

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
of the Sun and the lay of the land

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.539 
of the Sun and the lay of the land
because<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.409> had<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.890> water<00:01:17.159> spigot

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
because of that we had a water spigot

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.149 
because of that we had a water spigot
installed<00:01:18.299> where<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.439> knew<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.799> would<00:01:19.950> want

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
installed where we knew we would want

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.950 
installed where we knew we would want
the<00:01:20.310> garden<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.970> there's<00:01:21.150> water<00:01:21.360> very<00:01:21.659> close

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the garden so there's water very close

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.350 
the garden so there's water very close
by<00:01:22.939> to<00:01:23.939> connect<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.810> I'm<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.070> first

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
by to connect to this I'm going to first

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.140 
by to connect to this I'm going to first
split<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.720> line<00:01:27.930> using<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.130> Wye<00:01:29.340> splitter<00:01:29.880> that

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
split the line using a Wye splitter that

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.870 
split the line using a Wye splitter that
way<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:31.200> still<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> hose<00:01:32.070> available<00:01:32.700> to

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
way I can still have a hose available to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.569 
way I can still have a hose available to
me<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.060> manual<00:01:33.689> watering<00:01:33.930> as<00:01:34.350> well<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.340> using

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
me for manual watering as well as using

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.640 
me for manual watering as well as using
one<00:01:35.759> for<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.750> timer<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> drip

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
one for the timer and the drip

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.859 
one for the timer and the drip
irrigation<00:01:38.060> now<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.119> will<00:01:39.360> see<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.780> have

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
irrigation now you will see that I have

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.660 
irrigation now you will see that I have
applied<00:01:40.140> teflon<00:01:40.920> tape<00:01:41.159> throughout<00:01:41.520> the

applied teflon tape throughout the
entire<00:01:42.030> video<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.720> I'll<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:42.899> make<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.320> point

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
entire video but I'll just make a point

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.999 
entire video but I'll just make a point
that<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.220> make<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.610> easier<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.119> yourself<00:01:45.390> by

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
that you make it easier on yourself by

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.230 
that you make it easier on yourself by
wrapping<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.189> around<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.640> threads<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
wrapping it around the threads in the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.950 
wrapping it around the threads in the
same<00:01:48.570> direction<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.799> are<00:01:49.829> going<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.720> screw<00:01:51.720> on

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
same direction you are going to screw on

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.740 
same direction you are going to screw on
your<00:01:52.320> hose<00:01:53.040> or<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.579> next<00:01:53.880> connector<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.540> line

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
your hose or the next connector in line

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.289 
your hose or the next connector in line
so<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:56.040> spin<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.369> around<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.820> right<00:01:56.969> I

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
so just spin it around to the right I

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.660 
so just spin it around to the right I
always<00:01:57.840> find<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.229> 3<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> good<00:01:59.100> number<00:01:59.310> it's

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
always find that 3 is a good number it's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.630 
always find that 3 is a good number it's
never<00:01:59.939> too<00:02:00.270> little<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:01.439> stop<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.189> water<00:02:02.369> and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
never too little to stop the water and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.280 
never too little to stop the water and
it's<00:02:02.729> never<00:02:02.909> too<00:02:03.180> much<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.810> can't<00:02:04.049> fit

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
it's never too much that you can't fit

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.560 
it's never too much that you can't fit
the<00:02:04.619> next<00:02:04.890> connector<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.820> next<00:02:06.299> thing<00:02:06.450> in

our setup is going to be the timer this
is<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> same<00:02:09.660> timer<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.140> used<00:02:10.470> last<00:02:10.709> year<00:02:10.950> in

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
is the same timer I used last year in

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.840 
is the same timer I used last year in
the<00:02:11.250> garden

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770

and<00:02:29.100> I'm<00:02:29.640> going<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.910> attach<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.510> garden<00:02:30.930> hose

and I'm going to attach the garden hose

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.470 
and I'm going to attach the garden hose
here<00:02:31.800> rather<00:02:32.310> than<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.790> components<00:02:33.360> you'll

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
here rather than the components you'll

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.660 
here rather than the components you'll
see<00:02:33.720> next<00:02:34.170> because<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.160> having<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
see next because I like having the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.970 
see next because I like having the
garden<00:02:36.030> hose<00:02:36.210> being<00:02:36.600> what<00:02:37.080> goes<00:02:37.290> from<00:02:37.710> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
garden hose being what goes from the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.130 
garden hose being what goes from the
actual<00:02:38.370> hose<00:02:38.580> spigot<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.570> garden<00:02:39.990> and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
actual hose spigot to the garden and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.230 
actual hose spigot to the garden and
maybe<00:02:40.680> there's<00:02:40.950> nothing<00:02:41.310> really<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:42.030> it

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
maybe there's nothing really to that it

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.030 
maybe there's nothing really to that it
just<00:02:42.450> makes<00:02:42.630> me<00:02:42.870> feel<00:02:43.140> better<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.650> can't<00:02:43.860> really

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
just makes me feel better I can't really

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.860 
just makes me feel better I can't really
give<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.490> good<00:02:44.850> reason<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.360> why<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.600> should

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
give you a good reason on why you should

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.740 
give you a good reason on why you should
do<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.380> this<00:02:46.560> order<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:48.180> next<00:02:48.510> thing<00:02:48.720> that

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
do it in this order the next thing that

well the next thing we'll install is the

well the next thing we'll install is the
pressure<00:03:14.520> regulator<00:03:15.000> now<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.720> should<00:03:16.080> say<00:03:16.110> that

pressure regulator now I should say that

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.400 
pressure regulator now I should say that
both<00:03:17.220> would<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.880> pressure<00:03:18.720> regulator<00:03:19.320> and

to the individual plants now as you can
see<00:04:23.700> I<00:04:23.729> have<00:04:24.030> all<00:04:24.180> these<00:04:24.300> components

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
see I have all these components

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.510 
see I have all these components
on<00:04:25.240> one<00:04:25.690> side<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.290> Arbor<00:04:26.650> but<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:27.220> need<00:04:27.430> to

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
on one side of the Arbor but I need to

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.120 
on one side of the Arbor but I need to
get<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.730> water<00:04:27.940> to<00:04:28.120> both<00:04:28.300> sides<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:29.020> for<00:04:29.680> me<00:04:29.830> I

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
get the water to both sides and for me I

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.800 
get the water to both sides and for me I
think<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.520> best<00:04:30.699> solution<00:04:31.240> is<00:04:31.330> going<00:04:31.540> to<00:04:31.690> be

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
think the best solution is going to be

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.650 
think the best solution is going to be
to<00:04:32.620> run<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.830> transmission<00:04:33.460> line<00:04:33.639> from<00:04:33.820> one<00:04:34.330> side

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
to run a transmission line from one side

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.550 
to run a transmission line from one side
to<00:04:35.020> another<00:04:35.130> up<00:04:36.130> and<00:04:36.460> around<00:04:36.729> the<00:04:36.880> trellis

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
to another up and around the trellis

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.930 
to another up and around the trellis
rather<00:04:38.560> than<00:04:38.860> putting<00:04:39.070> it<00:04:39.280> across<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.790> floor

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
rather than putting it across the floor

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.409 
rather than putting it across the floor
where<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.510> might<00:04:40.750> somehow<00:04:41.590> be<00:04:41.770> tripped<00:04:42.520> on<00:04:42.790> or

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
where it might somehow be tripped on or

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.590 
where it might somehow be tripped on or
cut<00:04:43.840> or<00:04:44.110> damaged<00:04:44.590> in<00:04:44.830> some<00:04:44.860> way<00:04:45.130> I'm<00:04:45.880> going<00:04:46.540> to

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
cut or damaged in some way I'm going to

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.080 
cut or damaged in some way I'm going to
use<00:04:46.780> these<00:04:47.080> zip<00:04:47.410> ties<00:04:47.440> to<00:04:47.680> connect<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.760> tubing

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
use these zip ties to connect the tubing

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.390 
use these zip ties to connect the tubing
to<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.479> Arbor<00:04:49.870> but<00:04:50.080> I'm<00:04:50.590> being<00:04:50.800> careful<00:04:51.130> not

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
to the Arbor but I'm being careful not

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.969 
to the Arbor but I'm being careful not
to<00:04:51.729> over-tighten<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.870> zip<00:04:53.080> tie<00:04:53.290> which<00:04:53.740> could

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
to over-tighten the zip tie which could

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.340 
to over-tighten the zip tie which could
pinch<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.639> restrict<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.150> flow<00:04:55.449> of<00:04:55.900> water

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
pinch and restrict the flow of water

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.650 
pinch and restrict the flow of water
through<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.919> tubing<00:04:57.280> now<00:04:57.970> when<00:04:58.120> I<00:04:58.150> get<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.540> the

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
through the tubing now when I get to the

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.430 
through the tubing now when I get to the
other<00:04:58.900> side<00:04:59.320> I<00:04:59.790> can<00:05:00.930> extended<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.020> tubing

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
other side I can extended the tubing

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.790 
other side I can extended the tubing
across<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.460> Arbor<00:05:04.260> horizontally<00:05:05.260> for<00:05:05.620> now<00:05:05.770> I

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
across the Arbor horizontally for now I

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.860 
across the Arbor horizontally for now I
just<00:05:06.040> need<00:05:06.490> to<00:05:06.550> support<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:07.240> tubing<00:05:07.570> enough

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
just need to support the tubing enough

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.530 
just need to support the tubing enough
so<00:05:08.050> I<00:05:08.080> can<00:05:08.410> measure<00:05:08.770> how<00:05:09.070> much<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.520> need<00:05:09.790> so<00:05:10.450> I'm

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
so I can measure how much I need so I'm

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.420 
so I can measure how much I need so I'm
not<00:05:10.660> going<00:05:10.810> to<00:05:10.870> put<00:05:11.050> too<00:05:11.080> many<00:05:11.410> zip<00:05:11.770> ties<00:05:12.010> on<00:05:12.280> to

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
not going to put too many zip ties on to

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.310 
not going to put too many zip ties on to
hold<00:05:12.639> this<00:05:12.790> up<00:05:13.090> but<00:05:13.540> we'll<00:05:13.720> put<00:05:13.900> some<00:05:14.110> more<00:05:14.260> on

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
hold this up but we'll put some more on

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.529 
hold this up but we'll put some more on
later<00:05:14.710> once<00:05:15.220> I<00:05:15.370> reach<00:05:15.550> the<00:05:15.790> end<00:05:15.820> of<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.330> line

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
later once I reach the end of the line

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.560 
later once I reach the end of the line
I'm<00:05:16.840> going<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.650> terminate<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.520> line<00:05:18.760> at<00:05:19.090> an

I'm going to terminate the line at an

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
admit err so I'm just going to make sure

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.750 
admit err so I'm just going to make sure
that<00:05:22.720> I<00:05:22.780> don't<00:05:22.930> cut<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.770> line<00:05:23.800> right<00:05:24.310> at<00:05:24.580> the

all I had to do is repeat that process
numerous<00:06:56.560> times<00:06:56.910> 17<00:06:57.910> times<00:06:57.940> actually<00:06:58.840> because

numerous times 17 times actually because

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.219 
numerous times 17 times actually because
we<00:06:59.560> have<00:06:59.800> 16<00:07:00.639> containers<00:07:01.570> that<00:07:01.840> we're<00:07:01.990> using

we have 16 containers that we're using

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:05.310 
we have 16 containers that we're using
to<00:07:02.530> garden<00:07:02.889> in<00:07:03.070> and<00:07:03.280> also<00:07:04.210> a<00:07:04.240> potted<00:07:04.780> Kiwi<00:07:05.289> that

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320 
to garden in and also a potted Kiwi that

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.920 
to garden in and also a potted Kiwi that
I<00:07:05.620> am<00:07:05.770> growing<00:07:06.280> up<00:07:06.580> this<00:07:06.789> trellis<00:07:07.120> here<00:07:07.750> you

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
I am growing up this trellis here you

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.960 
I am growing up this trellis here you
can<00:07:08.080> see<00:07:08.259> how<00:07:08.470> all<00:07:08.680> of<00:07:08.830> the<00:07:08.949> emitters<00:07:09.370> work<00:07:09.699> and

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
can see how all of the emitters work and

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.420 
can see how all of the emitters work and
I<00:07:10.419> really<00:07:10.870> do<00:07:11.080> hope<00:07:11.349> that<00:07:11.410> one<00:07:11.860> emitter<00:07:12.220> is

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430 
I really do hope that one emitter is

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.400 
I really do hope that one emitter is
enough<00:07:12.820> for<00:07:13.000> this<00:07:13.150> container<00:07:13.570> and<00:07:13.960> I<00:07:14.169> think

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.410 
enough for this container and I think

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.469 
enough for this container and I think
that<00:07:14.560> it<00:07:14.650> will<00:07:14.800> be<00:07:15.039> but<00:07:15.580> if<00:07:15.729> for<00:07:15.910> some<00:07:15.970> reason

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 
that it will be but if for some reason

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:18.270 
that it will be but if for some reason
we<00:07:16.599> find<00:07:16.900> out<00:07:17.110> that<00:07:17.289> there's<00:07:17.560> just<00:07:17.889> not<00:07:18.070> enough

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 
we find out that there's just not enough

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.370 
we find out that there's just not enough
moisture<00:07:18.729> getting<00:07:19.300> to<00:07:19.419> the<00:07:19.539> corners<00:07:19.960> I'll<00:07:20.229> be

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:20.380 
moisture getting to the corners I'll be

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.870 
moisture getting to the corners I'll be
sure<00:07:20.560> to<00:07:20.590> let<00:07:20.800> you<00:07:20.979> guys<00:07:21.130> know<00:07:21.190> in<00:07:21.580> another

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:21.880 
sure to let you guys know in another
