00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
well they have a lot of good training

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.370

programs<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.210> Spain<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.750> France<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.200> so

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
programs in Spain and France and so

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.319

forth<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:31.920> very<00:01:32.100> difficult<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.759> get<00:01:33.299> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
forth so it's very difficult to get a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.749 
forth so it's very difficult to get a
gauge<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.900> how<00:01:33.960> good<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.549> for

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
gauge of how good you have to be so for

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.609 
gauge of how good you have to be so for
her<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.939> think<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.600> importance<00:01:37.049> now<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
her I think the importance now is to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.899

to 40 colleges in the US and that number

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.710 
to 40 colleges in the US and that number
will<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.439> whittled<00:01:46.890> down<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.130> about<00:01:47.700> 10<00:01:48.119> but

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
will be whittled down to about 10 but

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.149
