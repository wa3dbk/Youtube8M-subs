playing directly of the Wii U new

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.709 
playing directly of the Wii U new
controller<00:00:58.050> screen<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.940> best<00:01:00.480> way

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719

controller screen and it's the best way
a<00:01:00.750> comfortable<00:01:01.350> way<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:02.100> play<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.390> gyro

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
a comfortable way to play with the gyro

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.460 
a comfortable way to play with the gyro
cause<00:01:05.250> we've<00:01:05.460> implemented<00:01:05.820> again<00:01:06.470> every

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
cause we've implemented again every

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.289 
cause we've implemented again every
movement<00:01:07.680> floor<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.400> making<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.939> real<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.270> real

life

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
life

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:41.440 
life
exactly<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.890> produced<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> game

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.840 

so<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.930> all<00:01:43.140> turns<00:01:43.350> 45<00:01:43.979> degrees<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.670> on

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
so if you all turns 45 degrees on the on

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.210 
so if you all turns 45 degrees on the on
the<00:01:44.970> right<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.750> character<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> game

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.940 

just<00:01:50.780> one<00:01:51.780> point<00:01:52.020> here<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.410> is<00:01:52.530> what<00:01:52.679> we<00:01:52.770> call

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
just one point here this is what we call

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.130 
just one point here this is what we call
spatial<00:01:53.280> gameplay<00:01:53.940> now<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.600> reason<00:01:54.990> it's

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
spatial gameplay now the reason it's

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.320 
spatial gameplay now the reason it's
important<00:01:55.649> for<00:01:55.800> this<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.190> basically<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:57.149> have

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
important for this is basically you have

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.290 
important for this is basically you have
the<00:01:57.479> horizontal<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.140> vertical<00:01:58.789> 360<00:01:59.789> but<00:02:00.240> you

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
the horizontal the vertical 360 but you

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.600 
the horizontal the vertical 360 but you
have<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.630> sort<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.929> stuff<00:02:01.140> erekle<00:02:02.070> sort<00:02:02.550> of

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
have this sort of stuff erekle sort of

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.070 
have this sort of stuff erekle sort of
dimension<00:02:03.179> to<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> gameplay<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.869> you're

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
dimension to the gameplay that you're

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.169 
dimension to the gameplay that you're
playing<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.070> unique<00:02:05.399> way<00:02:05.640> for<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.880> flan

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
playing so it's a unique way for a flan

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.910 
playing so it's a unique way for a flan
to<00:02:06.420> look<00:02:06.570> around<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.200> things<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.800> in

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
to look around to see things so in

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.919 
to look around to see things so in
different<00:02:08.009> situations<00:02:08.880> you<00:02:09.360> actually<00:02:09.690> really

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
different situations you actually really

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:21.819 
different situations you actually really
get<00:02:10.019> a<00:02:10.080> new<00:02:10.289> experience<00:02:10.769> from<00:02:11.100> it

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:41.780 

coochie-coochie-coo

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.589 

so<00:02:42.500> this<00:02:43.500> really<00:02:43.739> has<00:02:43.860> more<00:02:44.159> more<00:02:45.150> immersion

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
so this really has more more immersion

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.000 
so this really has more more immersion
through<00:02:45.810> controls<00:02:46.260> right<00:02:46.500> because<00:02:46.799> your

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
through controls right because your

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.009 
through controls right because your
conceit<00:02:47.909> flow<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.269> right<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.629> the<00:02:48.750> middle<00:02:48.780> of

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
conceit flow is right in the middle of

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.229 
conceit flow is right in the middle of
the<00:02:49.110> action<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.920> concentrating<00:02:50.849> under<00:02:51.090> on

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
the action and concentrating under on

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.360 
the action and concentrating under on
the<00:02:51.329> new<00:02:51.450> control<00:02:51.780> screen<00:02:52.110> now<00:02:53.099> we're<00:02:53.280> going

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
the new control screen now we're going

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.220 
the new control screen now we're going
to<00:02:53.430> show<00:02:53.579> you<00:02:53.610> how<00:02:53.909> we<00:02:53.970> can<00:02:54.269> also<00:02:54.629> make<00:02:54.989> more

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
to show you how we can also make more

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.729 
to show you how we can also make more
proceed<00:02:56.269> through<00:02:57.269> control<00:02:57.689> so<00:02:58.260> we<00:02:58.440> thought<00:02:58.560> to

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
proceed through control so we thought to

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.309 
proceed through control so we thought to
actually<00:02:58.920> use<00:02:59.310> the<00:03:00.060> accelerometer<00:03:00.540> feature

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
actually use the accelerometer feature

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.270 
actually use the accelerometer feature
of<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:02.430> new<00:03:02.909> Wii<00:03:03.239> U<00:03:03.420> controller<00:03:04.129> to<00:03:05.129> make

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
of the new Wii U controller to make

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.940 
of the new Wii U controller to make
things<00:03:05.579> that<00:03:05.760> if<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.090> move<00:03:06.269> very<00:03:06.720> fast<00:03:07.230> your

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
things that if you move very fast your

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.399 
things that if you move very fast your
controller<00:03:08.549> then<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.750> game<00:03:09.930> will<00:03:10.049> know<00:03:10.230> it

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
controller then the game will know it

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.220 
controller then the game will know it
and<00:03:10.620> will<00:03:10.890> accelerate<00:03:11.280> your<00:03:11.430> movement

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
and will accelerate your movement

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.050 
and will accelerate your movement
5-step<00:03:16.010> those<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.159> you<00:03:17.310> familiar<00:03:17.819> with

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
5-step those of you familiar with

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.390 
5-step those of you familiar with
playing<00:03:18.420> first-person<00:03:18.780> shooters<00:03:19.349> know<00:03:20.190> how

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
playing first-person shooters know how

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.430 
playing first-person shooters know how
difficult<00:03:20.670> this<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.269> go<00:03:21.569> around<00:03:21.659> 180

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
difficult this is to go around 180

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.190 
difficult this is to go around 180
degrees<00:03:22.889> with<00:03:23.730> these<00:03:24.239> new<00:03:24.450> set<00:03:24.629> of<00:03:24.659> controls

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
degrees with these new set of controls

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:35.300 
degrees with these new set of controls
sitting<00:03:25.859> in<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.040> back<00:03:33.859> now<00:03:34.859> would<00:03:34.920> be<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.159> good

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
sitting in the back now would be a good

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.890 
sitting in the back now would be a good
time<00:03:35.549> to<00:03:35.579> jet<00:03:35.879> back

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.020 

you<00:03:40.900> can<00:03:41.050> see<00:03:41.200> they're<00:03:41.349> all<00:03:41.530> looking<00:03:41.890> down<00:03:42.130> on

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
you can see they're all looking down on

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.240 
you can see they're all looking down on
the<00:03:43.330> controller<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:43.810> then<00:03:44.020> looking<00:03:44.290> up<00:03:44.500> it's

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
the controller and then looking up it's

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.880 
the controller and then looking up it's
really<00:03:45.580> as<00:03:45.790> Adrian<00:03:46.300> were<00:03:46.450> saying<00:03:46.690> about<00:03:46.890> the

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
really as Adrian were saying about the

00:03:47.890 --> 00:04:08.580 
really as Adrian were saying about the
space<00:03:48.130> around<00:03:48.310> you

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.610 

so<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.950> be<00:04:10.070> very<00:04:10.850> complete<00:04:11.330> and<00:04:11.630> very<00:04:12.260> precise

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
so to be very complete and very precise

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.460 
so to be very complete and very precise
about<00:04:12.650> this<00:04:13.070> it's<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.940> combination<00:04:14.210> of<00:04:14.750> the

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
about this it's the combination of the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.710 
about this it's the combination of the
gyro<00:04:15.890> feature<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.880> accelerometer<00:04:17.420> feature

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
gyro feature the accelerometer feature

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.870 
gyro feature the accelerometer feature
and<00:04:18.190> both<00:04:19.190> sticks<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:21.560> gives<00:04:21.920> you<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.400> very

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
and both sticks that gives you a very

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.550 
and both sticks that gives you a very
promising<00:04:23.210> first<00:04:24.110> person<00:04:24.350> shooter

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
promising first person shooter

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.290 
promising first person shooter
controller<00:04:24.920> that's<00:04:25.040> only<00:04:25.460> possible<00:04:26.120> with

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
controller that's only possible with

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:48.480 
controller that's only possible with
this<00:04:26.450> you<00:04:26.870> willyou<00:04:27.200> controller

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:05:00.390 

nice

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.900 

results<00:05:02.800> that's<00:05:03.800> the<00:05:03.919> nest<00:05:04.100> again<00:05:04.430> let's<00:05:04.789> try

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
results that's the nest again let's try

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:21.100 
results that's the nest again let's try
to<00:05:05.000> use<00:05:05.210> it

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.560 

so<00:05:22.110> we've<00:05:22.260> also<00:05:22.410> have<00:05:23.190> our<00:05:23.430> set<00:05:23.700> of<00:05:23.910> distress

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
so we've also have our set of distress

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.140 
so we've also have our set of distress
signals<00:05:24.900> in<00:05:25.170> the<00:05:25.290> game<00:05:25.470> and<00:05:25.740> Jen<00:05:26.520> flame<00:05:26.820> things

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
signals in the game and Jen flame things

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.050 
signals in the game and Jen flame things
and<00:05:27.390> everything<00:05:28.550> let's<00:05:29.550> go<00:05:29.700> see<00:05:29.880> what's

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
and everything let's go see what's

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:50.830 
and everything let's go see what's
inside

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:06:10.560 

come<00:05:51.840> on<00:05:52.020> come<00:05:52.260> on

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.880 

so<00:06:11.570> that<00:06:12.050> concludes<00:06:12.320> the<00:06:12.740> the<00:06:13.340> first<00:06:13.610> car
