we<00:00:04.609> did<00:00:04.880> some<00:00:05.029> experiments<00:00:05.689> with<00:00:05.840> resveratrol

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
we did some experiments with resveratrol

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.730 
we did some experiments with resveratrol
which<00:00:07.130> is<00:00:07.340> one<00:00:07.939> of<00:00:07.970> the<00:00:08.090> ingredients<00:00:08.870> of<00:00:09.469> red

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
which is one of the ingredients of red

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.760 
which is one of the ingredients of red
wine<00:00:09.770> which<00:00:10.340> is<00:00:10.490> felt<00:00:10.760> to<00:00:10.850> be<00:00:10.940> beneficial

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
wine which is felt to be beneficial

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.480 
wine which is felt to be beneficial
producing<00:00:12.770> what's<00:00:12.949> called<00:00:13.129> the<00:00:13.219> French

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
producing what's called the French

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.519

paradox or reason why French people

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.019 
paradox or reason why French people
don't<00:00:15.859> get<00:00:16.010> as<00:00:16.100> much<00:00:16.309> heart<00:00:16.640> disease<00:00:17.000> or

just<00:00:25.010> giving<00:00:25.190> this<00:00:25.490> substance<00:00:26.480> we<00:00:26.660> thought<00:00:26.900> we

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
just giving this substance we thought we

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
actually give the animals red wine and

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.470 
actually give the animals red wine and
to<00:00:30.770> see<00:00:30.949> if<00:00:31.039> it<00:00:31.130> was<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.369> resveratrol<00:00:31.699> or<00:00:32.329> the

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
to see if it was the resveratrol or the

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.720 
to see if it was the resveratrol or the
alcohol<00:00:33.020> we<00:00:33.230> fed<00:00:33.680> another<00:00:33.980> group<00:00:34.219> of<00:00:34.340> animals

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
alcohol we fed another group of animals

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.639 
alcohol we fed another group of animals
vodka<00:00:35.390> which<00:00:35.539> is<00:00:35.690> essentially<00:00:36.170> pure<00:00:36.409> alcohol

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
vodka which is essentially pure alcohol

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.130 
vodka which is essentially pure alcohol
we<00:00:37.280> like<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:37.640> do<00:00:37.730> experiments<00:00:38.390> in<00:00:38.539> pigs

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
we like to do experiments in pigs

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.649 
we like to do experiments in pigs
because<00:00:39.620> they're<00:00:40.010> very<00:00:40.219> similar<00:00:40.699> to<00:00:40.730> human

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:41.659 
because they're very similar to human

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.569 
because they're very similar to human
heart<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.199> human<00:00:42.530> blood<00:00:42.979> vessels<00:00:43.399> in<00:00:43.519> the

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
heart and the human blood vessels in the

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.450 
heart and the human blood vessels in the
circulation<00:00:44.179> we<00:00:44.899> feed<00:00:45.109> the<00:00:45.319> pigs<00:00:45.859> a<00:00:46.010> high-fat

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
circulation we feed the pigs a high-fat

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.579 
circulation we feed the pigs a high-fat
diet<00:00:46.789> because<00:00:47.479> that<00:00:47.780> we<00:00:47.899> found<00:00:48.199> that<00:00:48.379> this

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
diet because that we found that this

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.059 
diet because that we found that this
more<00:00:49.399> closely<00:00:49.699> represents<00:00:50.229> what<00:00:51.229> we<00:00:51.769> see<00:00:51.949> in

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:52.069 
more closely represents what we see in

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:53.950 
more closely represents what we see in
patients<00:00:52.639> to<00:00:52.969> our<00:00:53.089> amazement<00:00:53.359> we<00:00:53.719> saw<00:00:53.899> the

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
patients to our amazement we saw the

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.110 
patients to our amazement we saw the
same<00:00:54.289> beneficial<00:00:54.949> effects<00:00:55.280> in<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.609> red<00:00:55.789> wine

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
same beneficial effects in the red wine

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.229 
same beneficial effects in the red wine
as<00:00:57.079> we<00:00:57.350> did<00:00:57.530> this<00:00:57.769> rare<00:00:58.039> tolo<00:00:58.339> for<00:00:59.149> the

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
as we did this rare tolo for the

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.729 
as we did this rare tolo for the
resveratrol<00:00:59.569> we<00:01:00.019> gave<00:01:00.199> about<00:01:00.440> a<00:01:00.469> hundred

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
resveratrol we gave about a hundred

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.840 
resveratrol we gave about a hundred
times<00:01:01.129> more<00:01:01.639> than<00:01:01.909> we<00:01:02.359> gave<00:01:02.569> in<00:01:02.839> the<00:01:03.049> red<00:01:03.229> wine

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
times more than we gave in the red wine

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.730 
times more than we gave in the red wine
what<00:01:04.850> was<00:01:04.970> also<00:01:05.299> surprising<00:01:06.020> was<00:01:06.440> that<00:01:06.470> when

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
what was also surprising was that when

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.560 
what was also surprising was that when
we<00:01:06.890> give<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.370> animals<00:01:07.850> vodka<00:01:08.420> was

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
we give the animals vodka was

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.359 
we give the animals vodka was
essentially<00:01:08.960> pure<00:01:09.200> alcohol<00:01:09.409> we<00:01:09.770> saw<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.009> same

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
essentially pure alcohol we saw the same

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.520 
essentially pure alcohol we saw the same
beneficial<00:01:11.030> effects<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:12.110> when<00:01:12.229> we<00:01:12.350> took<00:01:12.469> a

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
beneficial effects but when we took a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.550 
beneficial effects but when we took a
more<00:01:12.799> close<00:01:13.240> closer<00:01:14.240> look<00:01:14.630> we<00:01:14.810> found<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:15.350> the

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
more close closer look we found that the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.529 
more close closer look we found that the
mechanisms<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.490> reasons<00:01:16.880> why<00:01:17.119> we're<00:01:17.390> seeing

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
mechanisms the reasons why we're seeing

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.569 
mechanisms the reasons why we're seeing
the<00:01:17.750> beneficial<00:01:18.320> effects<00:01:18.590> are<00:01:18.770> different<00:01:19.520> in

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
the beneficial effects are different in

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.999 
the beneficial effects are different in
the<00:01:20.149> red<00:01:20.329> wine<00:01:20.659> we<00:01:21.289> didn't<00:01:21.530> see<00:01:21.649> any<00:01:21.799> more

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
the red wine we didn't see any more

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.999 
the red wine we didn't see any more
blood<00:01:22.280> vessels<00:01:22.729> growing<00:01:23.299> but<00:01:23.750> we<00:01:23.869> did<00:01:24.109> see<00:01:24.140> the

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
blood vessels growing but we did see the

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.830 
blood vessels growing but we did see the
blood<00:01:25.219> vessels<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:25.729> existed<00:01:26.329> they<00:01:26.780> were

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
blood vessels that existed they were

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.080 
blood vessels that existed they were
dilated<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:27.799> increased<00:01:28.250> blood<00:01:28.520> flow<00:01:28.579> to<00:01:28.850> the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
dilated so increased blood flow to the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.209 
dilated so increased blood flow to the
heart<00:01:29.119> muscle<00:01:29.299> that<00:01:29.780> way<00:01:30.020> with<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.380> vodka<00:01:30.950> we

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
heart muscle that way with a vodka we

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.279 
heart muscle that way with a vodka we
didn't<00:01:31.520> see<00:01:31.640> increased<00:01:32.119> as<00:01:32.299> a<00:01:32.329> dilatation<00:01:32.899> but

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
didn't see increased as a dilatation but

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.319 
didn't see increased as a dilatation but
we<00:01:33.439> saw<00:01:33.649> more<00:01:33.950> blood<00:01:34.219> vessels<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:34.820> the

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
we saw more blood vessels so the

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.050 
we saw more blood vessels so the
beneficial<00:01:36.049> effects<00:01:36.710> seem<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.070> be<00:01:37.219> similar

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
beneficial effects seem to be similar

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.330 
beneficial effects seem to be similar
but<00:01:38.210> for<00:01:38.659> different<00:01:38.840> reasons<00:01:39.219> from<00:01:40.219> the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
but for different reasons from the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.310 
but for different reasons from the
moderate<00:01:40.850> amount<00:01:41.119> of<00:01:41.299> alcohol<00:01:41.539> we<00:01:41.929> gave<00:01:42.140> the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
moderate amount of alcohol we gave the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.169 
moderate amount of alcohol we gave the
animals<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:43.070> actually<00:01:43.399> see<00:01:43.579> saw<00:01:43.939> these

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
animals we actually see saw these

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.510 
animals we actually see saw these
beneficial<00:01:44.630> effects<00:01:45.079> now<00:01:45.710> if<00:01:45.799> you<00:01:45.920> look<00:01:46.100> at<00:01:46.310> it

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
beneficial effects now if you look at it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.330 
beneficial effects now if you look at it
in<00:01:46.820> terms<00:01:46.850> of<00:01:47.270> blood<00:01:47.509> alcohol<00:01:48.020> level<00:01:48.409> if<00:01:49.159> a

in terms of blood alcohol level if a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.719 
in terms of blood alcohol level if a
patient<00:01:50.329> were<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.979> ingest<00:01:51.979> this<00:01:52.100> much<00:01:52.399> red
