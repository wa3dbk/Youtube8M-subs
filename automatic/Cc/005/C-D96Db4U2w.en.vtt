00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
the series of problems that originate

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.870 
the series of problems that originate
from<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.150> opening<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:10.400> in<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.550> problem

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
from the opening and in this problem

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.760 
from the opening and in this problem
white<00:00:12.540> checkmates<00:00:13.320> black<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.769> four<00:00:14.099> moves<00:00:14.460> and

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
white checkmates black in four moves and

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.590 
white checkmates black in four moves and
whatever<00:00:16.770> white<00:00:17.190> does<00:00:17.490> black<00:00:17.820> has<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.270> mirror

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
whatever white does black has to mirror

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.340 
whatever white does black has to mirror
that<00:00:18.810> move

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
that move

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.540 
that move
for<00:00:20.279> example<00:00:20.850> night<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.359> three<00:00:22.070> black<00:00:23.070> has<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
for example night of three black has to

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.820 
for example night of three black has to
play<00:00:23.730> Knight<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.029> 6<00:00:24.330> or<00:00:25.019> if<00:00:26.150> III<00:00:27.500> black<00:00:28.500> has<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
play Knight of 6 or if III black has to

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.880 
play Knight of 6 or if III black has to
play<00:00:29.010> e6<00:00:30.740> so<00:00:32.600> why<00:00:33.600> don't<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.870> pause<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.530> video

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
play e6 so why don't you pause the video

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.729 
play e6 so why don't you pause the video
right<00:00:35.309> now<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.910> see<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:36.989> can<00:00:37.140> find<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.530> mate

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
right now and see if you can find a mate

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.220 
right now and see if you can find a mate
and<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:38.190> where<00:00:38.489> white<00:00:39.149> check<00:00:39.540> check<00:00:40.050> mates

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
and for where white check check mates

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.650 
and for where white check check mates
black<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.980> four<00:00:41.219> moves<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:42.030> black<00:00:42.300> having

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
black and four moves with black having

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.380 
black and four moves with black having
to<00:00:42.870> mirror<00:00:43.170> every<00:00:43.469> move<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.649> white<00:00:44.010> makes

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.130 

okay<00:00:48.770> so<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.800> hope<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.219> found<00:00:50.820> at<00:00:51.660> least<00:00:51.840> one

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
okay so I hope you found at least one

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.540 
okay so I hope you found at least one
solution<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.770> turns<00:00:52.949> out<00:00:53.070> there's<00:00:53.219> three

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
solution it turns out there's three

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.979 
solution it turns out there's three
solutions<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.210> problem<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.719> I'll<00:00:54.840> show

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
solutions to this problem and I'll show

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.319 
solutions to this problem and I'll show
you<00:00:55.050> each<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.730> first<00:00:56.879> one<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.180> one<00:00:57.300> I

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
you each one and the first one the one I

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.369 
you each one and the first one the one I
like<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> most<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.250> c4<00:01:00.440> c5<00:01:02.870> queen<00:01:03.870> two<00:01:04.110> eight

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
like the most is c4 c5 queen two eight

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.750 
like the most is c4 c5 queen two eight
four<00:01:05.299> Queen<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.479> a5<00:01:08.060> queens<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.270> c6

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
four Queen to a5 queens of c6

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.620 
four Queen to a5 queens of c6
Queen<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.939> c3<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.369> quintic<00:01:14.369> c8<00:01:14.760> checkmate

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
Queen to c3 and quintic c8 checkmate

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.910 
Queen to c3 and quintic c8 checkmate
so<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.290> hope<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:17.880> saw<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.500> here's

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
so I hope you saw that one and here's

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.270 
so I hope you saw that one and here's
the<00:01:20.100> other<00:01:20.130> two<00:01:20.610> let's<00:01:20.970> reset<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:22.280> this

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the other two let's reset and this

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.789 
the other two let's reset and this
second<00:01:24.030> one<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> third<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.590> are

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
second one and the third one are

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.490 
second one and the third one are
actually<00:01:25.920> very<00:01:26.280> similar<00:01:26.720> d4<00:01:29.060> d5<00:01:31.310> Queen<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.460> d3

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
actually very similar d4 d5 Queen to d3

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.370 
actually very similar d4 d5 Queen to d3
Queen<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.680> d6<00:01:35.960> Queen<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.110> f5<00:01:38.630> Queen<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.750> f4<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
Queen to d6 Queen to f5 Queen to f4 and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.580 
Queen to d6 Queen to f5 Queen to f4 and
Queen<00:01:41.310> takes<00:01:41.460> bishop<00:01:41.939> checkmate<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:44.060> the

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
Queen takes bishop checkmate and the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:53.319 
Queen takes bishop checkmate and the
final<00:01:46.850> solution<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.380> d4<00:01:49.380> d5<00:01:51.590> Queen<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.860> d3

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
final solution is d4 d5 Queen to d3

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.999 
final solution is d4 d5 Queen to d3
pointing<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> d6<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.380> why<00:01:55.439> don't<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.680> pause

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
pointing to d6 and why don't you pause

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.370 
pointing to d6 and why don't you pause
the<00:01:56.040> video<00:01:56.490> here<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.390> see<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.170> find

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the video here and see if you can find

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.100 
the video here and see if you can find
the<00:01:58.649> final<00:01:59.189> solution<00:01:59.759> it's<00:02:00.450> very<00:02:00.659> similar<00:02:00.960> to

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the final solution it's very similar to

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.130 
the final solution it's very similar to
the<00:02:01.320> last<00:02:01.469> solution<00:02:04.340> okay<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.479> solution

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the last solution okay so the solution

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.410 
the last solution okay so the solution
is<00:02:07.640> Queen<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.910> h3<00:02:09.560> Queen<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.679> h6<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.459> Queen

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
is Queen to h3 Queen to h6 and Queen

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.320 
is Queen to h3 Queen to h6 and Queen
takes<00:02:12.629> c8

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
takes c8

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.050 
takes c8
checkmate<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.040> hope<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.520> enjoyed<00:02:15.910> this

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
checkmate so I hope you enjoyed this

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.150 
checkmate so I hope you enjoyed this
video<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.990> uh<00:02:17.790> see<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:18.850> next<00:02:19.030> time
