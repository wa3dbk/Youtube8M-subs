and I'm told this is a asani somebody
will<00:01:18.840> correct<00:01:18.990> me<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.470> there<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.450> we're<00:01:21.960> going

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
will correct me out there so we're going

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.859 
will correct me out there so we're going
to<00:01:22.110> use<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.939> there's<00:01:23.939> snap<00:01:24.150> remark<00:01:24.479> shocks

to use that there's snap remark shocks
here<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.619> look<00:01:25.799> like<00:01:25.950> they're<00:01:26.130> rebuilt

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
here that look like they're rebuilt

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.600 
here that look like they're rebuilt
Wilson<00:01:27.060> might<00:01:27.420> use<00:01:27.659> those

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
Wilson might use those

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.420 
Wilson might use those
any<00:01:28.730> better<00:01:28.970> than<00:01:29.540> this<00:01:30.350> factory<00:01:31.070> one<00:01:31.310> is

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
any better than this factory one is

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.710 
any better than this factory one is
where<00:01:31.580> they're<00:01:31.700> similar<00:01:31.910> that<00:01:32.270> what<00:01:32.390> they<00:01:32.510> put

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
where they're similar that what they put

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.250 
where they're similar that what they put
on<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.900> streetlights<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:35.080> that's<00:01:36.080> what

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
on the streetlights and that's what

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.840 
on the streetlights and that's what
we're<00:01:36.410> doing<00:01:36.710> we're<00:01:37.040> going<00:01:37.220> to<00:01:37.370> take<00:01:37.490> kind<00:01:37.820> of

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
we're doing we're going to take kind of

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.530 
we're doing we're going to take kind of
the<00:01:37.940> average<00:01:38.300> guy<00:01:38.510> approach<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:40.540> vintage

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
the average guy approach a vintage

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.560 
the average guy approach a vintage
motocross<00:01:42.050> fine<00:01:42.290> similarly<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.850> what<00:01:44.060> the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
motocross fine similarly to what the

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.600 
motocross fine similarly to what the
average<00:01:44.720> guy<00:01:45.080> that<00:01:45.320> may<00:01:45.530> have<00:01:45.800> big<00:01:46.070> horn<00:01:46.370> back

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
average guy that may have big horn back

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.900 
average guy that may have big horn back
in<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.910> day<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.450> decided<00:01:48.140> I<00:01:48.200> want<00:01:48.410> to<00:01:48.470> try

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
in the day and decided I want to try

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.460 
in the day and decided I want to try
into<00:01:49.910> racing<00:01:50.360> but<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.870> don't<00:01:51.050> want<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.200> plunk

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
into racing but I don't want to plunk

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.390 
into racing but I don't want to plunk
down<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:52.010> grand<00:01:52.610> or<00:01:53.090> more<00:01:53.630> for<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:54.740> dedicated

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
down a grand or more for a dedicated

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.580 
down a grand or more for a dedicated
race<00:01:55.760> party<00:01:57.310> at<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.490> time<00:01:58.700> so<00:01:59.420> focus<00:02:00.290> on<00:02:00.410> this

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
race party at the time so focus on this

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.440 
race party at the time so focus on this
series<00:02:00.920> will<00:02:01.070> be<00:02:01.160> basically<00:02:01.640> somewhat

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
series will be basically somewhat

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.300 
series will be basically somewhat
performance-based<00:02:03.110> but<00:02:03.650> generally<00:02:04.130> just

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
performance-based but generally just

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.050 
performance-based but generally just
making<00:02:04.760> it<00:02:04.970> good<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.660> reliable<00:02:07.060> strictly

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
making it good and reliable strictly

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.310 
making it good and reliable strictly
dirt<00:02:08.420> bikes<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:09.229> means<00:02:09.410> probably<00:02:10.280> be

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
dirt bikes so that means probably be

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.770 
dirt bikes so that means probably be
taking<00:02:12.320> a<00:02:12.380> lights<00:02:12.709> off<00:02:12.980> gauges<00:02:13.820> expectation

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
taking a lights off gauges expectation

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.500 
taking a lights off gauges expectation
anything<00:02:15.500> that<00:02:15.920> we<00:02:16.040> don't<00:02:16.280> need<00:02:16.610> something<00:02:17.330> to

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
anything that we don't need something to

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.540 
anything that we don't need something to
replace<00:02:17.600> bars<00:02:18.140> controls<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.160> things<00:02:19.340> like

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
replace bars controls and things like

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.840 
replace bars controls and things like
that

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
that

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.610 
that
probably<00:02:20.540> take<00:02:20.690> some<00:02:20.780> liberties<00:02:21.020> here<00:02:21.470> and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
probably take some liberties here and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.800 
probably take some liberties here and
there<00:02:21.740> just<00:02:21.980> for<00:02:22.130> visa<00:02:22.340> sourcing<00:02:22.910> parts<00:02:23.180> for

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
there just for visa sourcing parts for

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.900 
there just for visa sourcing parts for
example<00:02:23.900> lifehammer<00:02:24.740> watch<00:02:25.070> probably<00:02:25.610> go<00:02:25.850> to

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
example lifehammer watch probably go to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.900 
example lifehammer watch probably go to
a<00:02:26.060> modern<00:02:26.480> up<00:02:27.070> aluminium<00:02:28.070> bar<00:02:28.310> same<00:02:28.730> with
