getting ready and preparing for the for
the<00:01:09.750> 2014<00:01:10.409> season<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.950> thought<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.369> had<00:01:11.490> some

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the 2014 season I thought we had some

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.399 
the 2014 season I thought we had some
big<00:01:11.820> plays<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.240> offense<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.960> flip<00:01:13.170> side<00:01:13.200> of

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
big plays on offense the flip side of

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.960 
big plays on offense the flip side of
that<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:13.860> busted<00:01:14.250> some<00:01:14.369> coverage<00:01:14.729> missed

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that as we busted some coverage missed

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.330 
that as we busted some coverage missed
some<00:01:15.119> tackles<00:01:15.299> got<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.590> position<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:17.159> some

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
some tackles got out of position on some

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.429 
some tackles got out of position on some
leverage<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:18.600> also<00:01:18.780> thought<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
leverage but also thought that the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.640 
leverage but also thought that the
defense<00:01:19.860> several<00:01:20.490> times<00:01:20.700> bowed<00:01:21.000> their<00:01:21.210> neck

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
defense several times bowed their neck

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.620 
defense several times bowed their neck
some<00:01:22.650> third<00:01:22.830> down<00:01:23.009> stops<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.700> thought<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:24.450> ran

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
some third down stops I thought we ran

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.420 
some third down stops I thought we ran
to<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> football<00:01:25.259> hard<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.280> lost

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
to the football hard and we lost

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.219 
to the football hard and we lost
leverage<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:27.000> couple<00:01:27.299> times<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.780> didn't<00:01:28.080> see<00:01:28.200> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
leverage a couple times I didn't see a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.630 
leverage a couple times I didn't see a
bunch<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.590> missed<00:01:28.799> tackles<00:01:28.890> we'll<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.549> go

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
bunch of missed tackles we'll have to go

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.690 
bunch of missed tackles we'll have to go
back<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.850> evaluate<00:01:31.040> but<00:01:32.040> some<00:01:32.189> guys<00:01:32.369> stepped

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
back and evaluate but some guys stepped

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.700 
back and evaluate but some guys stepped

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
both sides of the football and you know

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.940

eight weeks with them and you know with
the<00:02:21.100> new<00:02:21.280> NCAA<00:02:21.580> rule<00:02:22.060> we<00:02:22.209> can<00:02:22.360> actually<00:02:22.510> be<00:02:22.720> on

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
the new NCAA rule we can actually be on

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.870 
the new NCAA rule we can actually be on
the<00:02:22.900> field<00:02:23.050> with<00:02:23.260> them<00:02:23.380> some<00:02:23.819> without<00:02:24.819> a

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
the field with them some without a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.880 
the field with them some without a
football<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:25.750> we<00:02:25.959> we<00:02:26.319> look<00:02:26.500> forward<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:26.860> that

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
football so we we look forward to that

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.520 
football so we we look forward to that
but<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.550> think<00:02:27.819> there's<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.030> lot<00:02:28.150> of<00:02:28.209> buy-in<00:02:28.530> I've

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
but I think there's a lot of buy-in I've

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.620 
but I think there's a lot of buy-in I've
seen<00:02:29.709> a<00:02:29.739> lot<00:02:29.800> of<00:02:29.950> growth<00:02:30.239> football<00:02:31.239> team<00:02:31.420> has
