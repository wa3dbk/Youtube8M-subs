is extremely hard this one though is
manageable<00:01:00.430> um<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:02.230> this<00:01:02.470> part<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.490> Tanooki

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
manageable um so this part the Tanooki

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.810 
manageable um so this part the Tanooki
suit<00:01:04.000> is<00:01:04.299> your<00:01:04.449> friend<00:01:04.750> on<00:01:04.900> this<00:01:05.049> part<00:01:05.379> because

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
suit is your friend on this part because

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.399 
suit is your friend on this part because
there<00:01:06.820> are<00:01:06.970> lots<00:01:07.150> of<00:01:07.329> blocks<00:01:07.689> floating<00:01:08.290> in

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
there are lots of blocks floating in

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.850 
there are lots of blocks floating in
space<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:09.100> most<00:01:10.060> of<00:01:10.240> them<00:01:10.360> are<00:01:10.630> only<00:01:11.110> two<00:01:11.530> or

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
space and most of them are only two or

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.660 
space and most of them are only two or
one<00:01:12.280> with<00:01:13.000> wide<00:01:13.719> so<00:01:14.289> they're<00:01:14.950> pretty<00:01:15.219> hard<00:01:15.520> to

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
one with wide so they're pretty hard to

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.700 
one with wide so they're pretty hard to
land<00:01:15.909> on<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:16.719> if<00:01:16.840> you<00:01:16.929> have<00:01:17.049> the<00:01:17.200> Tanooki<00:01:17.679> suit

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
land on and if you have the Tanooki suit

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.489 
land on and if you have the Tanooki suit
you<00:01:18.340> can<00:01:18.490> find<00:01:18.819> your<00:01:18.939> shadow<00:01:19.329> and<00:01:19.749> you<00:01:20.319> can

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
you can find your shadow and you can

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:23.069 
you can find your shadow and you can
actually<00:01:21.299> prepare<00:01:22.299> where<00:01:22.539> you're<00:01:22.689> going<00:01:22.960> to

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
actually prepare where you're going to

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.480 
actually prepare where you're going to
land<00:01:23.319> so<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.619> don't<00:01:23.859> fall<00:01:24.069> into<00:01:24.249> space<00:01:25.350> so

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
land so you don't fall into space so

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.039 
land so you don't fall into space so
after<00:01:27.490> you<00:01:27.609> bounce<00:01:27.880> off<00:01:28.149> that<00:01:28.179> toads<00:01:28.749> head

but it's still not that hard I mean the

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.709

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.530

hard<00:02:17.019> so<00:02:17.829> now<00:02:18.189> all<00:02:18.219> we<00:02:18.549> have<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.730> do<00:02:18.999> is<00:02:19.150> defeat

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
hard so now all we have to do is defeat

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.720 
hard so now all we have to do is defeat
boom<00:02:19.870> boom<00:02:20.079> since<00:02:20.799> pompom<00:02:21.370> has<00:02:21.579> been

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
boom boom since pompom has been

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.110 
boom boom since pompom has been
vanquished<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:23.249> yeah<00:02:24.249> I<00:02:24.280> just<00:02:24.519> let<00:02:24.670> him<00:02:24.760> spin

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
vanquished and yeah I just let him spin

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.660 
vanquished and yeah I just let him spin
himself<00:02:25.299> dizzy<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.139> then<00:02:26.680> he'll<00:02:27.129> ricochet

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
himself dizzy and then he'll ricochet

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.610 
himself dizzy and then he'll ricochet
around<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:28.060> room<00:02:28.299> and<00:02:28.599> I<00:02:29.170> would<00:02:29.349> recommend

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
around the room and I would recommend

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.789 
around the room and I would recommend
just<00:02:30.010> standing<00:02:30.430> in<00:02:30.549> one<00:02:30.790> spot<00:02:30.959> because<00:02:31.959> if<00:02:32.590> you

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
just standing in one spot because if you

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.409 
just standing in one spot because if you
move<00:02:33.010> around<00:02:33.159> there's<00:02:33.609> a<00:02:33.670> higher<00:02:33.909> chance<00:02:33.939> he

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:34.419 
move around there's a higher chance he

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:36.780 
move around there's a higher chance he
can<00:02:34.540> hit<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.650> if<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.099> just<00:02:36.250> stay<00:02:36.489> in<00:02:36.609> one

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
can hit you so if you just stay in one

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.399 
can hit you so if you just stay in one
spot<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:37.239> then<00:02:37.389> jump<00:02:37.629> when<00:02:37.780> he<00:02:37.810> comes<00:02:38.079> to<00:02:38.139> near

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
spot and then jump when he comes to near

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.819 
spot and then jump when he comes to near
you<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.799> reduce<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:39.549> risk<00:02:39.969> of<00:02:40.120> dying<00:02:40.829> so

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
you you reduce the risk of dying so

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.459 
you you reduce the risk of dying so
anyway<00:02:42.310> he's<00:02:42.939> gonna<00:02:43.120> get<00:02:43.329> dizzy<00:02:43.719> again<00:02:43.840> and

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:44.469 
anyway he's gonna get dizzy again and

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.250 
anyway he's gonna get dizzy again and
we're<00:02:45.189> gonna<00:02:45.310> whack<00:02:45.609> him<00:02:45.819> I<00:02:46.060> mean<00:02:46.389> doesn't<00:02:47.079> he

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
we're gonna whack him I mean doesn't he

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.259 
we're gonna whack him I mean doesn't he
ever<00:02:47.560> learn<00:02:47.889> doesn't<00:02:48.639> he<00:02:48.699> learn<00:02:48.909> that<00:02:48.939> he

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
ever learn doesn't he learn that he

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.270 
ever learn doesn't he learn that he
shouldn't<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:50.109> spin<00:02:50.500> around<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:51.040> try<00:02:51.250> to

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
shouldn't just spin around and try to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.369 
shouldn't just spin around and try to
punch<00:02:51.609> me<00:02:51.699> cuz<00:02:52.389> then<00:02:52.569> I'll<00:02:52.689> just<00:02:52.719> get<00:02:52.989> dizzy

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
punch me cuz then I'll just get dizzy

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.869 
punch me cuz then I'll just get dizzy
and<00:02:53.409> I'll<00:02:53.560> kill<00:02:53.829> him<00:02:53.980> yeah<00:02:54.639> if<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.849> just

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
and I'll kill him yeah if you just

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.250 
and I'll kill him yeah if you just
strategically<00:02:55.919> tried<00:02:56.919> to<00:02:57.040> punch<00:02:57.280> me<00:02:57.579> and<00:02:58.260> then

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
strategically tried to punch me and then

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.199 
strategically tried to punch me and then
he<00:02:59.469> won't<00:02:59.620> lose<00:02:59.859> all<00:03:00.069> that<00:03:00.219> energy<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:00.699> get

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
he won't lose all that energy and get

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.080 
he won't lose all that energy and get
dizzy<00:03:01.859> but<00:03:02.859> I<00:03:02.889> guess<00:03:03.129> he's<00:03:03.280> not<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.669> smart

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
dizzy but I guess he's not that smart

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.640 
dizzy but I guess he's not that smart
since<00:03:04.449> we're<00:03:04.659> gonna<00:03:04.780> kill<00:03:05.019> him<00:03:05.139> right<00:03:05.319> here

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
since we're gonna kill him right here

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.640 
since we're gonna kill him right here
and<00:03:05.829> he's<00:03:06.489> gonna<00:03:06.669> explode<00:03:07.239> into<00:03:07.510> coins<00:03:07.840> whoa

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
and he's gonna explode into coins whoa

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.719 
and he's gonna explode into coins whoa
it's<00:03:09.459> like<00:03:09.579> a<00:03:09.639> pinata<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:11.530> anyway<00:03:11.980> now<00:03:12.579> we're

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:12.729 
it's like a pinata so anyway now we're

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:15.509 
it's like a pinata so anyway now we're
going<00:03:12.849> to<00:03:12.909> go<00:03:12.970> down<00:03:13.239> this<00:03:13.449> tube<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.620> on<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.400> the

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
going to go down this tube and on to the

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.939 
going to go down this tube and on to the
next<00:03:15.729> leg<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.090> our<00:03:16.299> journey<00:03:16.379> now<00:03:17.379> this<00:03:17.709> one

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
next leg of our journey now this one

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.249 
next leg of our journey now this one
uses<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.729> green<00:03:18.970> platforms<00:03:19.720> where<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:19.989> step

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:20.259 
uses the green platforms where you step

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.170 
uses the green platforms where you step
on<00:03:20.439> them<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.799> make<00:03:20.919> them<00:03:21.129> either<00:03:21.340> go<00:03:21.609> forward

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
on them to make them either go forward

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.360 
on them to make them either go forward
or<00:03:22.329> backward<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.079> there<00:03:23.829> are<00:03:23.919> these<00:03:24.009> black

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
or backward and there are these black

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.089 
or backward and there are these black
germ<00:03:24.849> things<00:03:25.239> yeah<00:03:26.229> I<00:03:26.259> don't<00:03:26.439> really<00:03:26.620> actually

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
germ things yeah I don't really actually

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.879 
germ things yeah I don't really actually
know<00:03:27.579> their<00:03:27.759> official<00:03:28.269> names<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.930> just<00:03:29.709> always

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
know their official names I just always

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.280 
know their official names I just always
calm<00:03:30.280> germs<00:03:30.759> because<00:03:31.239> they<00:03:31.810> look<00:03:31.989> like<00:03:32.109> little

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
calm germs because they look like little

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.550 
calm germs because they look like little
germs<00:03:32.829> trying<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.400> kill<00:03:33.699> you<00:03:33.879> and<00:03:34.409> anyway<00:03:35.409> they

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
germs trying to kill you and anyway they

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.280 
germs trying to kill you and anyway they
move<00:03:35.769> in<00:03:35.889> patterns<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:37.239> if<00:03:37.359> you<00:03:37.449> analyze<00:03:37.959> their

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
move in patterns so if you analyze their

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.740 
move in patterns so if you analyze their
patterns<00:03:38.769> you<00:03:39.099> will<00:03:39.280> be<00:03:39.430> able<00:03:39.579> to<00:03:39.849> dodge<00:03:40.419> them

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
patterns you will be able to dodge them

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.159 
patterns you will be able to dodge them
and<00:03:41.069> then<00:03:42.069> you<00:03:42.189> won't<00:03:42.370> get<00:03:42.639> hit<00:03:42.879> and<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:44.019> my

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
and then you won't get hit and to my

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.809 
and then you won't get hit and to my
knowledge<00:03:44.379> there<00:03:44.799> is<00:03:44.889> no<00:03:45.099> way<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.310> defeat

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
knowledge there is no way to defeat

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.020 
knowledge there is no way to defeat
those<00:03:46.090> black<00:03:46.599> trim<00:03:46.900> things<00:03:47.229> so<00:03:47.560> anyway<00:03:47.970> now<00:03:48.970> we

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
those black trim things so anyway now we

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.110 
those black trim things so anyway now we
can<00:03:49.479> whack<00:03:50.259> all<00:03:50.500> these<00:03:50.680> bombs<00:03:51.219> yep<00:03:51.669> they're

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
can whack all these bombs yep they're

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.909 
can whack all these bombs yep they're
raining<00:03:52.509> from<00:03:52.659> the<00:03:52.719> sky<00:03:53.049> so<00:03:53.349> we<00:03:53.439> have<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.709> whack

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
raining from the sky so we have to whack

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.030 
raining from the sky so we have to whack
them<00:03:54.069> away<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.689> here's<00:03:55.689> a<00:03:55.780> cool<00:03:56.079> trick<00:03:56.379> if<00:03:56.949> you

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
them away and here's a cool trick if you

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.069 
them away and here's a cool trick if you
go<00:03:57.219> to<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.459> left<00:03:57.819> of<00:03:57.969> the<00:03:58.120> platform<00:03:58.389> the<00:03:58.840> very

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
go to the left of the platform the very

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.219 
go to the left of the platform the very
left<00:03:59.379> you<00:04:00.129> will<00:04:00.280> not<00:04:00.459> get<00:04:00.729> hit<00:04:00.909> by<00:04:01.060> any<00:04:01.090> fire<00:04:01.719> so

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:02.229 
left you will not get hit by any fire so

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:05.279 
left you will not get hit by any fire so
that<00:04:02.469> is<00:04:03.040> just<00:04:03.069> plain<00:04:03.549> awesome<00:04:04.019> yeah<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.079> makes

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:05.289 
that is just plain awesome yeah it makes

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:08.009 
that is just plain awesome yeah it makes
that<00:04:05.500> part<00:04:05.769> a<00:04:06.009> whole<00:04:06.400> lot<00:04:06.609> easier<00:04:06.789> and<00:04:07.239> now

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
that part a whole lot easier and now

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.309 
that part a whole lot easier and now
this<00:04:08.859> part<00:04:09.250> is<00:04:09.430> probably<00:04:10.389> one<00:04:10.689> of<00:04:10.719> the<00:04:10.959> hardest

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
this part is probably one of the hardest
