00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
that's what it looks like so first thing

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.520 
that's what it looks like so first thing
you<00:00:36.590> want<00:00:36.829> to<00:00:36.890> do<00:00:37.070> is<00:00:37.309> go<00:00:37.520> into<00:00:37.700> Cydia<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:38.930> it

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
you want to do is go into Cydia and it

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.380 
you want to do is go into Cydia and it
takes<00:00:39.770> a<00:00:39.950> while<00:00:40.160> for<00:00:40.190> this<00:00:40.640> part<00:00:41.000> to<00:00:41.149> load

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
takes a while for this part to load

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.229 
takes a while for this part to load
right<00:00:41.660> here<00:00:41.980> not<00:00:42.980> sure<00:00:43.250> why<00:00:43.460> my<00:00:43.489> Wi-Fi<00:00:44.180> is

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
right here not sure why my Wi-Fi is

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.750 
right here not sure why my Wi-Fi is
usually<00:00:44.809> pretty<00:00:45.170> good<00:00:45.350> but<00:00:46.190> what<00:00:46.370> this<00:00:46.579> will

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
usually pretty good but what this will

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.259 
usually pretty good but what this will
let<00:00:46.910> you<00:00:47.090> do<00:00:47.270> is<00:00:47.480> create<00:00:48.170> Deeping<00:00:49.039> package<00:00:49.640> or

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
let you do is create Deeping package or

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.739 
let you do is create Deeping package or
packages<00:00:50.329> for<00:00:51.199> Cydia<00:00:51.699> if<00:00:52.699> you<00:00:53.420> don't<00:00:53.629> know

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749 
packages for Cydia if you don't know

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:55.650 
packages for Cydia if you don't know
what<00:00:53.929> those<00:00:54.170> are

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
what those are

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.819 
what those are
then<00:00:56.660> you<00:00:56.960> probably<00:00:57.260> shouldn't<00:00:57.649> be<00:00:57.710> doing

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
then you probably shouldn't be doing

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.279 
then you probably shouldn't be doing
