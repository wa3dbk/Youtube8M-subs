improvement in directing is in the
handling<00:02:08.770> system<00:02:09.190> now<00:02:09.610> listen<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:10.030> lot<00:02:10.149> of

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
handling system now listen it a lot of

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.850 
handling system now listen it a lot of
feedback<00:02:10.360> from<00:02:10.569> players<00:02:11.260> who<00:02:11.500> played<00:02:11.709> our

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
feedback from players who played our

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.650 
feedback from players who played our
game<00:02:12.040> we're<00:02:12.520> very<00:02:12.760> keen<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.030> get<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.510> much

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
game we're very keen to get and much

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.759 
game we're very keen to get and much
more<00:02:13.810> weighty<00:02:14.050> feeling<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.560> cars

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
more weighty feeling the cars

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.559 
more weighty feeling the cars
specifically<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.730> tide<00:02:16.060> physics<00:02:16.450> in

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
specifically the tide physics in

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.420 
specifically the tide physics in
relation<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.050> how<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.620> tires<00:02:17.860> respond<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
relation to how the tires respond to the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.250 
relation to how the tires respond to the
road<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:19.000> things<00:02:19.269> like<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.540> magnet<00:02:19.930> flicks<00:02:20.110> or<00:02:20.230> a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
road so things like a magnet flicks or a

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.420 
road so things like a magnet flicks or a
lot<00:02:20.380> easier<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.650> do

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.490 

and<00:02:25.969> finally<00:02:26.359> for<00:02:26.480> do<00:02:26.599> it<00:02:26.659> too<00:02:26.810> we've<00:02:27.140> now<00:02:27.290> got

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
and finally for do it too we've now got

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.110 
and finally for do it too we've now got
a<00:02:27.530> much<00:02:27.920> more<00:02:28.099> realistic<00:02:28.340> lighting<00:02:28.670> model

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
a much more realistic lighting model

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.490 
a much more realistic lighting model
which<00:02:29.299> allows<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.659> lots<00:02:30.079> of<00:02:30.230> different

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
which allows you lots of different

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.349 
which allows you lots of different
things<00:02:30.530> within<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.040> scene<00:02:31.250> or<00:02:32.000> we<00:02:32.090> have<00:02:32.209> now

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
things within the scene or we have now

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:33.369 
things within the scene or we have now
has<00:02:32.510> lots<00:02:32.689> of<00:02:32.780> nice<00:02:32.959> things<00:02:33.140> like

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
has lots of nice things like

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.530 
has lots of nice things like
environmental<00:02:33.650> fog<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.700> proper<00:02:34.969> Sun<00:02:35.209> flare

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
environmental fog and proper Sun flare

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.390 
environmental fog and proper Sun flare
all<00:02:35.989> asked<00:02:36.379> her<00:02:36.469> to<00:02:36.620> build<00:02:36.829> a<00:02:36.920> more

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
all asked her to build a more

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.399 
all asked her to build a more
comprehensible<00:02:37.849> believable<00:02:38.359> scene<00:02:38.599> you<00:02:39.260> also

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
comprehensible believable scene you also

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.410 
comprehensible believable scene you also
have<00:02:39.680> our<00:02:39.890> new<00:02:40.340> deferred<00:02:40.670> lighting<00:02:41.060> system

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
have our new deferred lighting system

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.509 
have our new deferred lighting system
which<00:02:41.629> for<00:02:41.810> my<00:02:41.900> crime<00:02:42.170> scenes<00:02:42.439> and<00:02:42.709> gives<00:02:43.430> a

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
which for my crime scenes and gives a

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.009 
which for my crime scenes and gives a
lot<00:02:43.730> more<00:02:43.849> depth<00:02:44.060> again<00:02:44.359> because<00:02:44.689> it<00:02:44.780> means<00:02:44.900> we

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
lot more depth again because it means we

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.750 
lot more depth again because it means we
can<00:02:45.170> have<00:02:45.260> hundreds<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.739> hundreds<00:02:46.129> thousands

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
can have hundreds and hundreds thousands

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.860 
can have hundreds and hundreds thousands
of<00:02:47.120> individual<00:02:47.750> rights<00:02:47.870> movement<00:02:48.230> at<00:02:48.290> scene

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.839 

well<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.560> saying<00:02:54.860> about<00:02:55.069> sneak<00:02:55.430> up<00:02:55.549> behind<00:02:55.580> the

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
well I saying about sneak up behind the

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.280 
well I saying about sneak up behind the
scenes<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.090> dirt<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.390> hope<00:02:56.720> you<00:02:56.810> enjoyed<00:02:57.049> what

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
scenes of dirt to hope you enjoyed what

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.080 
scenes of dirt to hope you enjoyed what
you<00:02:57.319> saw<00:02:57.409> and<00:02:57.769> we<00:02:58.280> very<00:02:58.549> much<00:02:58.610> look<00:02:58.670> forward<00:02:58.849> to
