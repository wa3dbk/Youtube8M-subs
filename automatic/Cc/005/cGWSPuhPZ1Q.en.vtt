00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.240

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.860
 largely 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.600
 In general, waiting for an answer, I also called the master

 in line check and everything else 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.950
 in general, as soon as I have, well, that is 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.490
 I can not say because I do not have 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.330

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.490
 light off 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.580

 Couple of weeks 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.840
 and online fell to zero 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.450
 percent 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.100
 that is, when I 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.439
 and decided to look at things happen in 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.990
 all over the world scored miserable he was online 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.210

 time and time again he is so pretty 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.620
 Spartak still holds for about a week 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.930

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.699
 then I will have to close 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.669
 Well, to which he received an answer there just as 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:13.989
 but people would copy 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.429
 first apostolic unsubscribed 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:18.289
 about what they say 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:22.479
 quote lose nothing for the viewer then 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.289
 there it turns out so 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.649
 About how to be I was counting on the fact that 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:29.159
 I will go down there are people let it remain only 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.209
 lose families 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.589
 but it turned out that 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.029
 I go in and people just go to war and 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:37.269

 constantly walked this 7 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:51.179
 Here is the percentage, that is, how would people need 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.409
 not as much server as possible 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.819
 get into the frame I do not think it's bad 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.299
 but 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.159
 percent 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.349
 so cheese cannot exist 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.459
 in this form 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.859
 how would I leave I do not guarantee that I will 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.169
 help tomorrow day after tomorrow 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.319
 month after year because 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.039
 but I have other projects I want 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:14.089
 play still singapore sharp 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:15.809
 question of closing the server with this 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.539
 It's only a matter of time. 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.089
 n people suggested I do 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:22.359
 donation to this 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.099

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.439
 one city kutaisi dollars no socks 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.599
 how would i rent a server that i 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.849
 I pay about eighty for him 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.529
 dollars per month 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:35.139
 that pretty block samoshin 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.299
 Well, that is, it is a bit but still the amount 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.349
 decent 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.699
 but also 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.719
 I think that taking money from people is people 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.540
 but in a personal allele the opinion that it is not 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.819
 I am not very beautiful 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.659
 not that unpleasant but uncomfortable 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.199
 old would not want to take money from people 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.399
 just to play it in your field 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.129
 this server 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:56.669
 it seems to me not quite 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.159
 right I just don’t know i probably so 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.519
 brought up 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.349
 and so I just have to close it 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.969
 on the left what kind of firing we get to 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:08.200
 why did you come 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.879
 2 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.870
 about just like that 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.199
 don't know me 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.289
 really nothing to say 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.979
 what a pity I need these people 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.409
 center as such 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:22.330
 that is, he 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.310
 on the eve he was just no one 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.520
 necessary to play there 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.210
 accordingly growth 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.289
 the fund we get from this as a result 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.370
 blog percentage 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.880
 actress news producer landed 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.590
 weaker such kind of news 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.059
 pro in microsoft wal singapore 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:44.479
 Sarbaeva single player that I have here in 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.059

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:48.650
 m 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.300
 The fact is that in 1.8 manipulations added 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.639
 Obviously a generator world 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.210
 and that is it is not even extended a 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.729
 added settings when creating the world 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.930
 now you can specify the height of the ocean 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.490
 power ask the panel or I rarely and for 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.699
 what do these loan parameters mean we are there 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.550
 on which fifty turned three 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.620
 pages 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.310
 percentage including height mountain height 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.830
 pamm depth and opened all all all all 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.699
 everything is all you can create introductory 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.490
 tightly such a world you can create sakoy 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.490
 Mirzo pass 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.960
 in the right 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.039
 most can in fact be removed 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.389
 brotherhood villages for your own skin 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:27.759

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.819
 her she here now all this garbage 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:37.779
 no so not like but generators 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.210
 sukhumi damn not like 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.030
 I think you know her because you know 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.199
 who has been watching for a long time 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.479
 so forcibly recently too those in the know 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.479
 and in this regard, how would I want to start with myself 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:54.770
 play monitors 1.8 when it comes out 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.930
 here actually until this time I take 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.089
 about starts my crafting 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:02.089
 selling would relax and with new forces already 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.869
 need to proceed 

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:06.770
 third season 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.830
 percentage and therefore want to finish 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.520
 second season because 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.050
 Although the percentage of heard about what will be 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.370
 then a generator adapter 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.220
 the generator so that there was no blood experience 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.139
 walls long ago 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:20.560
 that is, if the adapter is 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.210
 continued but also the map of the new season 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.430
 most likely if 3 5 and k will not be because 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.449
 it's just a rumor 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.099
 and then 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.219
 We will play in the new world although it is possible 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:35.089
 so not only did they come in 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:36.879
 new world because 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:39.210
 radd 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.520
 I have a lot of season etching 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.740
 a fair amount of resources 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.550
 and honestly can not imagine how you can 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.360
 go to level the world 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.899
 this re-create about one type 

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:52.529
 Well, in general, it will be decided that is, I do not 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:54.509
 I would like to play all ready 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:56.520
 so that in me a bunch of Kirov I have a bunch 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.659
 resources and just send zakharyana 

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:00.119
 left kilometers 

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:02.399
 already create tags you can create the world in 

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:04.309
 in the end if you want to take this 

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:05.680
 the area where he lived 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.530
 ransom then the world well to the second season and in 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.470
 map a map over a network 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.649
 any 

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:15.129
 make such a dream on steel 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:16.789
 but so on 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:18.939
 but 

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:20.349
 that is son 

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:22.300
 summarize the Danish will then 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.460
 when I have a question 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.580
 times connecting to shoulder servers 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.229
 with a view to finding regret 

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:31.449
 closes and I repeat that I am very 

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:33.139
 sorry that always seemed just not 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:34.210
 need he 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.789
 interest and plucked swept puer off the third season 

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:38.340
 starts 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.580
 immediately after the release of 1.8 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.629
 maybe even a little earlier maybe even 

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:44.449
 for 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:47.210
 I'll start playing some
