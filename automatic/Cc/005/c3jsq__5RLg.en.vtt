00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.300

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
take a black eyeliner and this whole

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.600 
take a black eyeliner and this whole
look<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.350> pretty<00:03:28.650> much<00:03:28.770> about<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.130> eyeliners

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
look is pretty much about the eyeliners

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.250 
look is pretty much about the eyeliners
that<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:29.880> use<00:03:30.120> but<00:03:30.810> you're<00:03:30.960> going<00:03:31.140> to

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
that you use but you're going to

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.470 
that you use but you're going to
tightline<00:03:32.250> your<00:03:32.490> eye<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.180> will<00:03:33.360> make

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
your eyelashes look thicker and make the

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
eyeliner and you want to line the inner

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.750

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
when you are done and the blue is very

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.570 
when you are done and the blue is very
subtle<00:04:49.320> it<00:04:49.470> just<00:04:49.650> looks<00:04:49.830> like<00:04:49.920> kind<00:04:50.340> of<00:04:50.400> like<00:04:50.460> a

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
subtle it just looks like kind of like a

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.330 
subtle it just looks like kind of like a
black<00:04:50.880> winged<00:04:51.720> liner<00:04:52.040> except<00:04:53.040> for<00:04:53.070> when

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
black winged liner except for when

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.920 
black winged liner except for when
someone<00:04:53.820> gets<00:04:53.910> a<00:04:54.030> little<00:04:54.150> bit<00:04:54.300> closer<00:04:54.510> to<00:04:54.690> your

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
someone gets a little bit closer to your

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.310 
someone gets a little bit closer to your
face<00:04:55.140> you<00:04:55.380> can<00:04:55.560> tell<00:04:55.830> that<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:56.160> is<00:04:56.340> blue<00:04:56.940> and

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
face you can tell that it is blue and

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.320 
face you can tell that it is blue and
also<00:04:58.320> blue<00:04:58.860> does<00:04:59.220> make<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.790> whites<00:05:00.030> of<00:05:00.270> your

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
eyes look a lot brighter which in theory

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.900

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
look in a mirror to touch it up so it's

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.050 
look in a mirror to touch it up so it's
better<00:06:01.560> than<00:06:01.680> a<00:06:01.740> lipstick<00:06:02.160> for<00:06:02.370> school<00:06:02.760> but
