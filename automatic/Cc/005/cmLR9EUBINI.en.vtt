00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
so right now behind the wall there's

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.030 
so right now behind the wall there's
kind<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.269> there's<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.929> big<00:00:10.139> wall<00:00:10.410> in<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.740> center

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
kind of there's a big wall in the center

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.799 
kind of there's a big wall in the center
of<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.219> map<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.580> separates<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.300> two<00:00:12.330> areas

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
of the map that separates the two areas

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.810 
of the map that separates the two areas
we<00:00:13.410> just<00:00:13.590> basically<00:00:13.679> call<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.250> beach<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.759> the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
we just basically call the beach and the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.960 
we just basically call the beach and the
base<00:00:15.890> so<00:00:16.890> right<00:00:17.070> now<00:00:17.100> I'm<00:00:17.340> kind<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.820> at<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
base so right now I'm kind of at the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.849 
base so right now I'm kind of at the
back<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.449> base<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.170> where<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
back of the base and this is where the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.590 
back of the base and this is where the
defending<00:00:20.310> team<00:00:20.490> starts<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.240> they<00:00:21.300> kind<00:00:21.480> of

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
defending team starts and they kind of

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.029 
defending team starts and they kind of
set<00:00:21.900> up<00:00:22.020> their<00:00:22.230> defense<00:00:24.949> unfortunately<00:00:25.949> in

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
set up their defense unfortunately in

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.290 
set up their defense unfortunately in

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
the camera goes into third person this

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.600 
the camera goes into third person this
is<00:00:55.970> our<00:00:56.180> new<00:00:56.360> support<00:00:56.809> weapons<00:00:57.340> that<00:00:58.340> I<00:00:58.400> was

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
these the spike grenades which is also

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.300 
these the spike grenades which is also
new<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> brute<00:01:26.579> sandbox<00:01:27.149> these<00:01:27.960> are

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
new to the brute sandbox these are

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.800 
new to the brute sandbox these are
basically<00:01:29.310> shaped-charge<00:01:29.729> grenades<00:01:30.509> so

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
basically shaped-charge grenades so

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.350 
basically shaped-charge grenades so
they'll<00:01:31.200> stick<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.770> anything<00:01:32.070> unlike<00:01:32.520> plasma

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
they'll stick to anything unlike plasma

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.330 
they'll stick to anything unlike plasma
grenades<00:01:33.659> which<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.409> only<00:01:34.530> stick<00:01:34.830> to<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
send out a shower of spikes hopefully

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.270 
send out a shower of spikes hopefully
you<00:01:42.450> know<00:01:42.740> eviscerating<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> guy<00:01:44.009> you're

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you know eviscerating the guy you're

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.890 
you know eviscerating the guy you're
going<00:01:44.399> against

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.690 

so<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:53.040> you're<00:01:53.250> playing<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.610> an

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
so what if you're playing in an

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.910 
so what if you're playing in an
objective<00:01:54.180> type<00:01:54.690> game<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.410> actually<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
objective type game this is actually the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.470 
objective type game this is actually the
gates<00:01:56.190> which<00:01:56.460> control<00:01:56.910> you'll<00:01:57.090> notice<00:01:57.330> the

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
gates which control you'll notice the

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.690 
gates which control you'll notice the
gate<00:01:57.660> is<00:01:57.780> open<00:01:58.200> right<00:01:58.350> now<00:01:58.410> but<00:01:58.800> in<00:01:58.980> a<00:01:59.460> game<00:01:59.670> of

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
gate is open right now but in a game of

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.290 
gate is open right now but in a game of
CTF<00:02:00.360> or<00:02:01.160> territories<00:02:02.160> this<00:02:03.000> would<00:02:03.180> actually

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
CTF or territories this would actually

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.380 
CTF or territories this would actually
be<00:02:03.510> closed<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.260> part<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.040> thing<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
be closed and part of the thing that the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.139 
be closed and part of the thing that the
attacking<00:02:07.020> team<00:02:07.200> would<00:02:07.470> have<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.740> do<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.220> to

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
attacking team would have to do is to

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.570 
attacking team would have to do is to
get<00:02:09.479> around<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.960> gate<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.400> actually<00:02:11.400> hit

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
get around the gate and actually hit

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.840 
get around the gate and actually hit
that<00:02:11.730> switch<00:02:12.590> once<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.770> switch<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.460> hit

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
that switch once the switch is is hit

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.850 
that switch once the switch is is hit
the<00:02:15.060> gates<00:02:15.240> open<00:02:15.690> it's<00:02:15.810> actually<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.200> much

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
the gates open it's actually a much
