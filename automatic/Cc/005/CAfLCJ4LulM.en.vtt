trains<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.400> they<00:03:00.610> have<00:03:00.730> tags<00:03:00.970> on<00:03:01.209> them<00:03:01.440> they

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
trains and they have tags on them they

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.589 
trains and they have tags on them they
shoot<00:03:02.770> torpedoes<00:03:03.459> out<00:03:03.640> at<00:03:03.760> you<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.150> they<00:03:04.330> send

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
shoot torpedoes out at you and they send

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.870 
shoot torpedoes out at you and they send
electricity<00:03:05.230> bad<00:03:05.800> thing<00:03:06.099> that's<00:03:06.340> they<00:03:06.580> send

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
electricity bad thing that's they send

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.449 
electricity bad thing that's they send
that<00:03:07.090> its<00:03:07.569> electricity<00:03:08.050> on<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.500> poles<00:03:08.830> kinda

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
that its electricity on the poles kinda

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.570 
that its electricity on the poles kinda
looks<00:03:09.580> like<00:03:09.640> popcorn<00:03:09.910> haha<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:11.170> think<00:03:11.650> but<00:03:12.400> if

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
looks like popcorn haha I think but if

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.280 
looks like popcorn haha I think but if
you<00:03:12.670> play<00:03:12.880> for<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.120> while<00:03:13.180> they<00:03:13.660> lift<00:03:13.930> up<00:03:14.140> and

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
you play for a while they lift up and

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.280 
you play for a while they lift up and
like<00:03:14.410> torpedoes<00:03:14.650> come<00:03:15.190> out<00:03:15.569> but<00:03:16.569> here's<00:03:17.200> my

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
like torpedoes come out but here's my

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.070 
like torpedoes come out but here's my
method<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:19.150> have<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.420> wait<00:03:19.540> for<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.780> trains

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
method you have to wait for the trains

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.770 
method you have to wait for the trains
to<00:03:20.260> stomp<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.769> as<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.130> know<00:03:21.340> big<00:03:22.120> things<00:03:22.450> like

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
to stomp and as you know big things like

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.390 
to stomp and as you know big things like
trains<00:03:23.110> as<00:03:23.440> soon<00:03:23.590> as<00:03:23.709> they<00:03:23.800> stop<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.220> takes

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
trains as soon as they stop it takes

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.030 
trains as soon as they stop it takes
them<00:03:24.580> awhile<00:03:24.700> start<00:03:25.360> up<00:03:25.480> again<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:26.739> if<00:03:26.920> you

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
them awhile start up again so if you

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.820 
them awhile start up again so if you
keep<00:03:27.250> doing<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:29.230> can<00:03:29.410> get<00:03:29.530> close<00:03:29.799> enough

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
keep doing that you can get close enough

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.160 
keep doing that you can get close enough
to<00:03:30.160> do<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.459> if<00:03:30.940> not<00:03:31.600> you're<00:03:31.840> just<00:03:31.930> going<00:03:32.110> to

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
to do that if not you're just going to

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.020 
to do that if not you're just going to
keep<00:03:32.230> going<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.769> going<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:33.250> boost<00:03:33.610> in<00:03:33.850> and

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
keep going and going and boost in and

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.920 
keep going and going and boost in and
wasting<00:03:34.450> cans<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:35.319> trying<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.340> catch<00:03:36.519> up<00:03:36.930> so

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
wasting cans and trying to catch up so

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.970 
wasting cans and trying to catch up so
today<00:03:38.170> here<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:39.459> they<00:03:39.670> stop<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.239> they<00:03:40.299> squeak

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
today here and they stop and they squeak

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.729 
today here and they stop and they squeak
you<00:03:41.980> try<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.430> get<00:03:42.640> as<00:03:42.850> close<00:03:43.000> as<00:03:43.120> you<00:03:43.330> can

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
you try to get as close as you can

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.250 
you try to get as close as you can
sometimes<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:44.890> doesn't<00:03:45.130> work<00:03:45.160> like<00:03:45.549> that<00:03:46.260> but

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
sometimes it doesn't work like that but

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.110 
sometimes it doesn't work like that but
I<00:03:47.470> still<00:03:47.739> think<00:03:47.950> it's<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.280> pretty<00:03:48.700> darn<00:03:49.030> good

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
I still think it's a pretty darn good

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.720 
I still think it's a pretty darn good
method<00:03:50.430> use<00:03:51.430> your<00:03:51.580> x<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:52.090> y<00:03:52.299> buttons<00:03:52.660> a<00:03:52.780> lot

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
method use your x and y buttons a lot

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.069 
method use your x and y buttons a lot
preferably<00:03:54.730> X<00:03:54.940> because<00:03:55.269> you<00:03:55.359> can<00:03:55.480> go<00:03:55.600> faster

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
preferably X because you can go faster

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.690 
preferably X because you can go faster
than<00:03:56.220> Y<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:58.600> you<00:03:59.560> can<00:03:59.769> use<00:04:00.010> those<00:04:00.190> but<00:04:00.549> just

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
than Y and you can use those but just

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:10.559 
than Y and you can use those but just
try<00:04:01.120> not<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.560> run<00:04:02.560> into<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.920> trains

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.390 

anyhow<00:04:11.319> you<00:04:11.379> can<00:04:11.530> go<00:04:11.650> on<00:04:11.709> around<00:04:11.799> in<00:04:12.069> a<00:04:12.159> circle

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
anyhow you can go on around in a circle

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.890 
anyhow you can go on around in a circle
if<00:04:12.849> you<00:04:13.510> want<00:04:13.920> which<00:04:14.920> is<00:04:14.950> actually<00:04:15.189> pretty<00:04:15.549> fun

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
if you want which is actually pretty fun

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.390 
if you want which is actually pretty fun
um<00:04:16.900> if<00:04:17.079> you<00:04:17.289> go<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.620> opposite<00:04:18.009> way<00:04:18.070> you're

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
um if you go the opposite way you're

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.099 
um if you go the opposite way you're
supposed<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.880> go<00:04:19.030> you<00:04:19.389> can<00:04:19.570> go<00:04:19.660> all<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.900> way

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
supposed to go you can go all the way

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.050 
supposed to go you can go all the way
around<00:04:20.229> the<00:04:20.650> track<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:21.190> like<00:04:21.549> see<00:04:21.759> the<00:04:21.880> front

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
around the track and like see the front

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.090 
around the track and like see the front
of<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.240> trains<00:04:22.509> I<00:04:22.780> always<00:04:23.050> think<00:04:23.199> that<00:04:23.410> was

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
of the trains I always think that was

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.129 
of the trains I always think that was
pretty<00:04:24.250> cool<00:04:26.580> but<00:04:27.580> yeah<00:04:27.729> if<00:04:28.000> this<00:04:28.240> if<00:04:28.599> like<00:04:28.930> any

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
pretty cool but yeah if this if like any

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.659 
pretty cool but yeah if this if like any
part<00:04:29.440> of<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.590> game<00:04:29.770> is<00:04:29.979> going<00:04:30.009> to<00:04:30.160> take<00:04:30.370> like<00:04:30.550> a

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
part of the game is going to take like a

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.180 
part of the game is going to take like a
really<00:04:30.940> long<00:04:31.210> time<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.509> be<00:04:31.810> it's<00:04:32.190> probably

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
really long time to be it's probably

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.439 
really long time to be it's probably
this<00:04:33.430> part<00:04:35.789> so<00:04:36.789> they<00:04:36.910> can<00:04:37.030> seem<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.330> go<00:04:37.419> on

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
this part so they can seem to go on

00:04:37.449 --> 00:05:07.080 
this part so they can seem to go on
forever<00:04:37.720> unless<00:04:38.139> you<00:04:38.849> have<00:04:39.849> a<00:04:39.880> good<00:04:40.090> method

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:14.280 

okay<00:05:07.750> but<00:05:08.250> after<00:05:09.250> this<00:05:09.520> part<00:05:10.150> is<00:05:11.310> um<00:05:13.290> the

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
okay but after this part is um the

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.470 
okay but after this part is um the
finale

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:26.300 

so<00:05:19.050> we're<00:05:20.040> almost<00:05:20.130> done<00:05:20.490> with<00:05:20.640> the<00:05:20.730> game<00:05:20.880> now

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:33.930
