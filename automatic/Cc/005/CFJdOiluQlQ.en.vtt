00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.250
 what happens alive today welcome to 365 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.310
 bboying everyday we start with the 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.570
 workouts day 323 one of the things 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.340
 that has always resisted me has been 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.529
 the worm so I was practicing 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.820
 baby to go to worm at first like 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.590
 quite because the legs go like a 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.180
 American and they come down suddenly you hurt yourself 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.039
 the trick is to put the left hand 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.989
 as a little behind the American 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.250
 and then to lift the worm you have to 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.769
 kick with the legs towards the back 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.120
 and up that way you do a dock and 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.100
 you have more strength to lift with the 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.160
 arms for the moment I decided to finish it in 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.930
 elbow halo freeze and we already passed to day 324 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.760
 that day I do not know why he had very comfortable 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.589
 milk so I was trying elche 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.239
 go by hand with one hand the truth is that 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.489
 I did not think how soon I could do it 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.400
 and later it occurred to me to practice 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.110
 elbow twister to fall standing but like 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.180
 I kept my hand stuck I decided 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.250
 upload it to night in or 2000 and already 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.979
 with power I decided to take out the swap and 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.930
 half what I still have the fear and I put 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.200
 the left hand unintentionally 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.600
 day 325 as yesterday I got out of elche was 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.220
 elbow today I wanted to get my elbow done 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.690
 I was practicing this exercise with 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.550
 two hands and then I tried it with one more 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.420
 I was already dating but have read 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.100
 be on the side and I wanted to drop it up and 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.000
 testing it occurred to me to do it by taking 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.340
 a foot 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.660
 and later on kneeling going up 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.520
 standing up and then making him be 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.650
 taking my foot later improve the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.660
 runaway football and I started trying 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.120
 trace back to a hand by spinning 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.410
 the other hand on the floor but as yet 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.240
 I could not get up because I decided 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.010
 invent a new set making a 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.400
 somersault with his hands caught and 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.400
 making a rare cold of mine day 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.400
 326 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.250
 as you see the first thing I was 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.960
 trying was from elbow twister to 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.250
 schuster elbow mill is a 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.780
 transition that I'm very cool but 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.220
 first he had to control more the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.210
 co2 cluster so I set to 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.210
 practice it separately 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.890
 and thanks to that way of falling to 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.780
 try to follow it I took out a new 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.549
 power transition I called it the trans 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.989
 north and then I was just 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.879
 doing pretty freestyle to take out 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.879
 I moved the new ones because I had space 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.660
 why 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.989
 Y 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.030
 and to finish training I made a spike 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.860
 with juniors to 15 starts that really 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.920
 I realized how bad some had 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.510
 sets and how well I had other days 327 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.430
 doing the battle with juniors is it 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.290
 happened in several ideas and one of them 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.760
 I was doing a freeze holding my thigh 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.770
 passing the hand inside the other 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.480
 leg and that turns out that it gave me a lot 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.480
 I play because I left my legs free 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.110
 and that's the one he just saw is the one 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.790
 I got out thanks to that idea since I'm 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.270
 trying a pen with the foot crossed to 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.270
 see what came out 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.050
 I did not know how the set would end but 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.970
 I was going to call it broken knee yes or yes 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.710
 and look where thank you to hurt me 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.750
 in the knee I tried to do something 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.250
 moving it away from the ground and falling into it 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.520
 point that the end of the yin set and 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.050
 yang 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.870
 so I could take advantage of it because 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.000
 precisely change it day 328 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.200
 practicing shrinking that plate that 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.640
 is what I got improvised in the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.470
 last compete and I liked quite 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.920
 although to make it simpler better to 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.920
 baby finish 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.330
 doing freestyle I realized that 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.070
 I lost halo freeze to imbert from 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.870
 mill so I was practicing what 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.700
 so that one of the 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.410
 problems he had is that he went up head 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.850
 and then to imbert and from head 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.250
 you have as much strength to climb as 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.690
 since halo freeze later I was 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.700
 trying a new way to get the 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.190
 pneumatic hammer and see what he could do 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.590
 later but the truth is that none 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.530
 option I liked nothing so we already passed 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.690
 a day to 329 was life and frank in 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.830
 master volume 2 a competition that 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.470
 it was usually done on the anniversary 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.120
 of supersonics from madrid and that we decided 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.760
 make us some years 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.650
 for fun it's just about 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.110
 go battles and before each 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.790
 battle rolls a die and the number that 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.310
 leave are the exits that you have to 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.020
 do each one and not only that but 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.690
 before each departure you have to drink 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.520
 a shot of a special cocktail that 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.590
 we call the cocktail beat night and doing 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.680
 that's how you imagine the laughs are 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.680
 insured 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:09.070
 good 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.070
 so much of Florence 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.820
 Y 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.820
 I come back 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.239
 the means 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.650
 and as you have seen if besides 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.389
 all that is added a cardboard made 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.340
 dust that breaks every two to three 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.320
 moves and makes you fall more 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.760
 fun bites one and in the end 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.560
 because all sweating just do 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.639
 battle if we simply dance doing 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.639
 the fool and having fun 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:58.360
 And now to finish stretching we'll see you in 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.360
 the next video to take care of myself I'm going 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.120
 and others do not
