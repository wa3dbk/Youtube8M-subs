they will fall into disrepair so you've

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.740 
they will fall into disrepair so you've
got<00:01:03.129> to<00:01:03.219> figure<00:01:03.339> out<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.549> way<00:01:03.729> to<00:01:03.789> use<00:01:04.239> biblical

languages every day the best way to do

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.210 
languages every day the best way to do
that<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.600> way<00:01:07.690> I<00:01:07.720> have<00:01:08.020> found<00:01:08.050> most<00:01:08.800> effective

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
that the way I have found most effective

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.370 
that the way I have found most effective
in<00:01:09.310> my<00:01:09.430> own<00:01:09.580> life<00:01:09.790> is<00:01:09.940> to<00:01:10.510> get<00:01:10.630> up<00:01:10.780> early<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:11.230> do

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
in my own life is to get up early and do

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.620 
in my own life is to get up early and do
it<00:01:11.500> before<00:01:11.770> everyone<00:01:12.130> else<00:01:12.220> starts<00:01:12.610> to<00:01:13.420> want

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
it before everyone else starts to want

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.030 
it before everyone else starts to want
your<00:01:13.750> time<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.350> your<00:01:14.440> schedule<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:14.950> your

your time and your schedule and your

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.340 
your time and your schedule and your
attention<00:01:15.520> so<00:01:16.360> I<00:01:16.390> think<00:01:16.690> that's<00:01:16.990> really<00:01:17.110> paid

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350

you<00:01:45.700> have<00:01:45.970> at<00:01:46.120> your<00:01:46.150> fingertips<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:47.190> sources

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
you have at your fingertips the sources

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.420 
you have at your fingertips the sources
and<00:01:49.140> there's<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.200> difference<00:01:50.650> in<00:01:50.890> our<00:01:51.160> field

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
and there's a difference in our field

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.030 
and there's a difference in our field
between<00:01:52.090> what<00:01:52.300> we<00:01:52.390> talk<00:01:52.570> about<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:53.710> terms<00:01:53.860> of

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
between what we talk about in terms of

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.100 
between what we talk about in terms of
what<00:01:54.190> is<00:01:54.280> primary<00:01:54.550> literature<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:55.420> what<00:01:55.990> is

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
what is primary literature and what is

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.520 
what is primary literature and what is
secondary<00:01:56.560> literature<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.450> in<00:01:58.960> our<00:01:59.170> field

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
secondary literature and so in our field

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.460 
secondary literature and so in our field
in<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.830> Bible<00:02:00.670> Bible<00:02:01.240> study<00:02:01.810> field<00:02:02.140> the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
in the Bible Bible study field the

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.130 
in the Bible Bible study field the
primary<00:02:02.980> literature<00:02:03.100> is<00:02:03.370> the<00:02:03.460> Bible

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
primary literature is the Bible

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.330 
primary literature is the Bible
secondary<00:02:05.140> literature<00:02:05.320> is<00:02:05.680> everything

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
secondary literature is everything

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.249 
secondary literature is everything
everyone<00:02:06.700> writes<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.480> wants<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.690> say<00:02:07.870> about

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
everyone writes and wants to say about

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.630 
everyone writes and wants to say about
the<00:02:08.410> Bible<00:02:08.800> okay

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
the Bible okay

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.820 
the Bible okay
now<00:02:10.450> here's<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.810> thing<00:02:11.020> this<00:02:11.319> is<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.590> advice

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
now here's the thing this is the advice

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.590 
now here's the thing this is the advice
that<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:12.220> wish<00:02:12.400> everyone<00:02:12.730> would<00:02:12.880> in<00:02:13.150> some<00:02:13.360> sense

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
that I wish everyone would in some sense

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.890 
that I wish everyone would in some sense

fall

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.649 
fall
to<00:02:14.049> some<00:02:14.260> degree<00:02:14.939> keep<00:02:15.939> the<00:02:16.150> primary

time you invest in it then use the

literature impose a worldview on the
primary<00:02:38.290> literature<00:02:38.409> that's<00:02:38.739> not<00:02:38.920> there<00:02:39.159> let

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
primary literature that's not there let

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.869 
primary literature that's not there let
the<00:02:40.180> primary<00:02:40.689> literature<00:02:41.040> critique<00:02:42.040> the

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
the primary literature critique the

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.580 
the primary literature critique the
secondary<00:02:43.359> literature<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.900> become<00:02:44.200> masters

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
secondary literature so become masters

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.830 
secondary literature so become masters
of<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.799> primary<00:02:45.189> literature<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.940> invest

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
of the primary literature and invest

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.140 
of the primary literature and invest
mostly<00:02:47.470> there<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.700> way<00:02:48.849> when<00:02:49.000> you're

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
mostly there and that way when you're

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.149 
mostly there and that way when you're
engaging<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:50.170> secondary<00:02:50.620> literature<00:02:50.739> you're

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
engaging the secondary literature you're

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.920 
engaging the secondary literature you're
not<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.280> slave<00:02:51.639> to<00:02:51.879> it<00:02:51.909> but<00:02:52.540> you're<00:02:52.690> in

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
not a slave to it but you're in

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.170 
not a slave to it but you're in
conversation<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.829> your<00:02:53.920> critique<00:02:54.250> unit<00:02:54.579> so

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
conversation and your critique unit so

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.520 
conversation and your critique unit so
you<00:02:55.269> won't<00:02:55.389> be<00:02:55.480> held<00:02:55.629> captive<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.170> everyone's

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
you won't be held captive to everyone's

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.800 
you won't be held captive to everyone's
ideas<00:02:56.980> being<00:02:57.790> tossed<00:02:58.030> back<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.480> forth<00:02:58.689> you'll

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
ideas being tossed back and forth you'll

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.140 
ideas being tossed back and forth you'll
actually<00:02:58.989> have<00:02:59.319> the<00:03:00.069> ability<00:03:00.159> to<00:03:00.489> interact<00:03:00.700> at

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
actually have the ability to interact at

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.699 
actually have the ability to interact at
a<00:03:01.180> more<00:03:01.359> critical<00:03:01.480> level<00:03:01.989> because<00:03:02.260> of<00:03:02.379> master

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
a more critical level because of master

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.770 
a more critical level because of master
with<00:03:02.829> the<00:03:02.859> primary<00:03:03.129> literature<00:03:03.819> so<00:03:04.629> that's

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
with the primary literature so that's

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.809 
with the primary literature so that's
one<00:03:04.989> thing<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.379> that's<00:03:05.500> why<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.680> think<00:03:05.819> original

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
one thing so that's why I think original

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.940 
one thing so that's why I think original
language<00:03:07.120> studies<00:03:07.510> are<00:03:07.689> important<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.439> think

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
language studies are important I think

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.190 
language studies are important I think
that's<00:03:09.370> one<00:03:09.549> of<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.700> reasons<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.200> studying

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
that's one of the reasons that studying

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.080 
that's one of the reasons that studying
grammars<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:11.709> having<00:03:12.250> resources

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
grammars and having resources

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.670 
grammars and having resources
grammatical<00:03:13.750> resources<00:03:14.170> are<00:03:14.290> important

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
grammatical resources are important

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.039 
grammatical resources are important
because<00:03:15.280> they<00:03:15.639> allow<00:03:15.670> you<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.389> have<00:03:16.480> access<00:03:16.870> to

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
because they allow you to have access to

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.119 
because they allow you to have access to
that<00:03:17.170> primary<00:03:17.439> that<00:03:17.739> are<00:03:17.829> trying<00:03:17.949> to<00:03:18.010> be

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
that primary that are trying to be

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.210 
that primary that are trying to be
changed<00:03:18.430> by<00:03:18.639> it<00:03:18.699> and<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.169> think<00:03:20.560> that's<00:03:20.829> also

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
changed by it and so I think that's also

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.640 
changed by it and so I think that's also
in<00:03:21.400> terms<00:03:21.609> of<00:03:21.760> sanctification<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.930> Christian

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
in terms of sanctification a Christian

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.879 
in terms of sanctification a Christian
sanctification<00:03:24.870> we<00:03:25.870> frequently<00:03:26.230> feel<00:03:26.650> that

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
sanctification we frequently feel that

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.089 
sanctification we frequently feel that
perhaps<00:03:27.129> were<00:03:27.370> more<00:03:27.579> edified<00:03:28.120> by<00:03:29.099> devotional

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
perhaps were more edified by devotional

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.680 
perhaps were more edified by devotional
literature<00:03:30.220> our<00:03:30.760> literature<00:03:31.090> talking<00:03:31.359> about

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
literature our literature talking about

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.809 
literature our literature talking about
the<00:03:31.840> Bible<00:03:31.989> but<00:03:32.349> really<00:03:32.889> the<00:03:33.010> Bible<00:03:33.159> that<00:03:33.579> is

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
the Bible but really the Bible that is

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.539 
the Bible but really the Bible that is
the<00:03:34.209> soil<00:03:34.569> and<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:34.989> investment<00:03:35.470> area<00:03:36.250> for

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
the soil and the investment area for

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.629 
the soil and the investment area for
sanctification<00:03:37.030> so<00:03:37.659> I<00:03:37.690> think<00:03:37.900> we<00:03:38.199> can't

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
sanctification so I think we can't

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.670 
sanctification so I think we can't
confuse<00:03:39.639> the<00:03:39.790> two<00:03:39.970> one<00:03:40.659> is<00:03:40.840> one<00:03:41.530> is

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
confuse the two one is one is
