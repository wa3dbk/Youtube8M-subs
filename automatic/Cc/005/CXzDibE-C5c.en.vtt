in<00:01:40.650> here<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.250> not<00:01:41.400> too<00:01:41.640> big<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.940> deal<00:01:42.120> with

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
in here it's not too big of a deal with

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.980 
in here it's not too big of a deal with
tomatoes<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:45.210> we're<00:01:45.330> just<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.630> break<00:01:45.840> it

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
tomatoes so we're just going to break it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.890 
tomatoes so we're just going to break it
up<00:01:46.080> just<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.410> little<00:01:46.440> bit<00:01:47.360> push<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.480> into<00:01:48.780> this

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
up just a little bit push it into this

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.550 
up just a little bit push it into this
soil<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:54.300> firm<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.230> just<00:01:55.440> a<00:01:55.530> little

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
soil and then firm it in just a little

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.020 
soil and then firm it in just a little
bit<00:01:55.890> around<00:01:56.100> there<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.430> water<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.000> well

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
bit around there and water it in well

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.000 
bit around there and water it in well
now<00:01:57.870> we're<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.170> want<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.500> stake<00:01:58.740> this

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
now we're going to want to stake this

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.460 
now we're going to want to stake this
tomato<00:01:59.370> and<00:01:59.850> we<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.540> use<00:02:00.660> a<00:02:00.690> bamboo<00:02:00.960> stick

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
tomato and we can use a bamboo stick

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.320 
tomato and we can use a bamboo stick
there<00:02:02.100> are<00:02:02.220> determinate<00:02:02.790> tomato<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.240> they

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
there are determinate tomato so they

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.360 
there are determinate tomato so they
don't<00:02:03.510> get<00:02:03.630> too<00:02:03.900> terribly<00:02:04.380> big<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.040> we<00:02:05.220> can

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
don't get too terribly big and so we can

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.640 
don't get too terribly big and so we can
just<00:02:05.550> easily<00:02:05.760> stake<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.540> or<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.230> bamboo

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
just easily stake this or the bamboo

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.920 
just easily stake this or the bamboo
stick<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.239> continue<00:02:09.349> to<00:02:11.480> put<00:02:12.480> some<00:02:12.629> string

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
stick and continue to put some string

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.240 
stick and continue to put some string
around<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.439> this<00:02:13.650> as<00:02:13.799> it<00:02:13.829> grow

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
around on this as it grow

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.030
