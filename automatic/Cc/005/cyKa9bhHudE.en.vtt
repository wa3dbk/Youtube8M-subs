00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:10.100
 You thought you saw it all, you're very 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:15.970
 wrong because in a few seconds more 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.970
 you will live a unique experience 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.170
 good people and generate spreads in 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.700
 other new videos in this case one of 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.790
 the ones that I like the most because this is 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.130
 level 33 lamp with hunter and here not 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.040
 there are tricks or cardboard 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.610
 this is doing it a little face to the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.430
 thing and throw balance to sack and how I go 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.930
 to be able to see in the video what he uses 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.330
 mostly it's the dagger of the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.000
 invisibility bending over and turning 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:57.550
 invisible and how I'm going to see icebreaker 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.560
 with which this screen is made 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.080
 tremendous if you have seen from behind I'm going 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.760
 with four or five more partners to 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.340
 other ways this was to do it only 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.410
 with the hunter but we have already taken advantage 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.990
 as they did not have that patient they do 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.420
 as I will see now with the care of the 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.920
 icebreaker that although it seems the cce 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.610
 shooting from the hip I'm going to 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.280
 agree 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.280
 the quick aim shoot aim shoot 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.840
 he had hanged the ones that you will have 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.460
 experiences in them will be very very 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.930
 easy 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.300
 well here is very careful much 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.659
 calm more and neither cover and strip to 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.939
 up to death and you 're done 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.009
 and here I will do the same doing the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.899
 videos I will not comment because this 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.240
 it's only maple stretched up 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.340
 for footwear take advantage of all this in 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.109
 the house is to make transparent the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.499
 Stab always tries to carry the load 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:51.060
 the super load also and nothing else like that 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:52.409
 that the cavity is also exposed a 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.659
 little bit of music so that the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.880
 hunter calm up without many 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.979
 comments and nothing gentlemen that 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.780
 enjoy this because to me in the way 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.840
 What I like most about having fun is 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.719
 complete without trick and nothing to sack 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.789
 taking advantage only what is the 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.770
 advantage that each role has in this case 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.440
 it would be invisibility and said 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.240
 so they are giving us a lot for 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.900
 zarco but sometime to put the thing 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.030
 more entertaining 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.819
 and good with a little music that was 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.810
 enjoy videos I hope you like it and 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.709
 now I will continue a little bit bigger 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.709
 commenting 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.210
 to 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.970
 and well, you have already seen that 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.060
 unique that is or take advantage of the 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.620
 advantage of the hunter what would be the 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.740
 invisibility transparency 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.419
 here there is no trick or trap or cardboard 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.820
 to put it somehow the only 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:52.460
 you have to work on it, you have a little bit of 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.800
 Reflect not to get nervous and here they are 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.379
 of art from two on the street is possible 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.770
 because it has no other invisibility 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:02.750
 is to marry if you see that he does not marry and not 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.550
 it works to raise the room today 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.520
 today gas rings because sometimes it stays 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.979
 as google stays stays with the 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.560
 and nothing else here since you've seen it 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:16.030
 started the first lamp until the 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:19.240
 last lamp 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.340
 that does not have does not have either very solid 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.920
 I encourage you to make it and why is that 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.650
 it's really fun so apple the first 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.780
 second do they try it because it's 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.220
 super fun and now here catch before 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.580
 the world prize less me because I have 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.290
 who came in is already helping and ready and nothing 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.240
 Gentlemen, I hope you liked the video 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.610
 who liked the shoe method 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.300
 because it 's a language and nothing favorite and 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.300
 until another
