00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
was really cool this one has four pieces

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.950 
was really cool this one has four pieces
most<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.340> them<00:02:53.430> have<00:02:53.700> five<00:02:54.030> pieces<00:02:54.360> -<00:02:54.780> eight

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.070 
most of them have five pieces - eight
pieces<00:02:56.420> because<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.750> just<00:02:57.930> the

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
pieces because this is just the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.830 
pieces because this is just the
minifigure<00:02:58.560> with<00:02:58.740> no<00:02:58.950> accessories<00:02:59.840> although

funny<00:07:07.610> thing<00:07:07.700> is<00:07:07.910> they<00:07:08.060> were<00:07:08.120> right<00:07:08.210> when<00:07:08.390> they

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.480 
funny thing is they were right when they

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.060 
funny thing is they were right when they
were<00:07:08.570> giving<00:07:08.840> these<00:07:08.930> away<00:07:09.080> they're<00:07:09.770> actually

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.070 
were giving these away they're actually

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.470 
were giving these away they're actually
giving<00:07:10.310> them<00:07:10.370> away<00:07:10.460> with<00:07:10.700> price<00:07:10.940> tags<00:07:11.240> still

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.480 
giving them away with price tags still

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.170 
giving them away with price tags still
on<00:07:11.630> them<00:07:12.310> when<00:07:13.310> you<00:07:13.430> purchase<00:07:13.790> something<00:07:13.910> so

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180 
on them when you purchase something so

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.910 
on them when you purchase something so
you<00:07:14.270> can<00:07:14.420> see<00:07:14.600> the<00:07:14.750> actual<00:07:15.020> value<00:07:15.440> of<00:07:15.470> it<00:07:15.680> which

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:15.920 
you can see the actual value of it which

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.800 
you can see the actual value of it which
is<00:07:16.100> I<00:07:16.280> think<00:07:16.370> I<00:07:16.580> believe<00:07:16.790> was<00:07:16.910> six<00:07:17.120> dollars<00:07:17.390> so

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:17.810 
is I think I believe was six dollars so

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.750 
is I think I believe was six dollars so
I<00:07:17.840> think<00:07:17.960> that's<00:07:18.230> kind<00:07:18.440> of<00:07:18.560> interesting<00:07:18.830> how

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:19.760 
I think that's kind of interesting how

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.310 
I think that's kind of interesting how
they<00:07:19.910> show<00:07:20.090> you<00:07:20.150> what<00:07:20.450> it's<00:07:20.600> worth<00:07:20.690> but<00:07:21.140> give

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320 
they show you what it's worth but give

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.120 
they show you what it's worth but give
it<00:07:21.440> you<00:07:21.560> for<00:07:21.620> free

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.130 
it you for free

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.560 
it you for free
kind<00:07:22.850> of<00:07:22.910> cool<00:07:23.060> I<00:07:23.120> think<00:07:23.330> that<00:07:23.420> was<00:07:23.510> a

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:23.570 
kind of cool I think that was a

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.630 
kind of cool I think that was a
last-minute<00:07:23.900> decision<00:07:24.310> to<00:07:25.310> get<00:07:25.430> rid<00:07:25.520> of

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:25.640 
last-minute decision to get rid of

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.610 
last-minute decision to get rid of
excessive<00:07:26.300> amounts<00:07:26.780> of<00:07:26.900> them<00:07:27.020> I'm<00:07:27.230> not<00:07:27.380> sure

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 
excessive amounts of them I'm not sure

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.440 
excessive amounts of them I'm not sure
but<00:07:28.160> it<00:07:28.250> was<00:07:28.310> really<00:07:28.490> cool<00:07:28.670> the<00:07:29.030> rest<00:07:29.210> of<00:07:29.330> them

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:29.450 
but it was really cool the rest of them

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.530 
but it was really cool the rest of them
