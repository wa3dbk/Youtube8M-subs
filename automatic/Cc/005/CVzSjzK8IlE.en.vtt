00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 
I think it's Gabriel cake because the

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:11.209 
I think it's Gabriel cake because the
finish<00:07:09.870> has<00:07:10.080> a<00:07:10.139> lot<00:07:10.529> of<00:07:10.560> the<00:07:10.770> qualities<00:07:11.190> of

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:11.219 
finish has a lot of the qualities of

finish has a lot of the qualities of
this<00:07:11.550> spirit<00:07:11.969> in<00:07:12.090> it<00:07:12.180> so<00:07:12.680> focuses<00:07:13.680> on<00:07:13.830> that

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:13.949 
this spirit in it so focuses on that

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:16.459 
this spirit in it so focuses on that
spirit<00:07:14.430> which<00:07:14.969> I<00:07:15.090> think<00:07:15.330> it<00:07:15.449> should<00:07:15.659> it's<00:07:16.229> got

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:16.469
