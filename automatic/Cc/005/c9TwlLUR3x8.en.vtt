00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.230

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 Camera on our face 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.530
 hello dear friends are nice here 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.940
 today what gabriella came from heroin 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.010
 yesterday quite a long session 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.560
 is about 3 o'clock in the morning we have to 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.109
 I still wanted to train 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.070
 times had gotten a goal for hf form 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.779
 that by now you are hopefully with 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.730
 I want to come grandmaster be 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.960
 a very heavy way down model 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.669
 david league and have not got any 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.620
 strategy and i said so 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.360
 wait until sunday that was yesterday 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.190
 and then fork past the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.570
 Stay here and be very much 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.770
 show strategy or 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.050
 Absolutely fault was from everyone 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.460
 race first one or two days 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.219
 I have two which is the easiest 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.899
 is 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.160
 there will now learn in and out 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.649
 and that's where it sounds like 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.960
 Little was done against tara 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.510
 good four games or 5 and 4 5 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.739
 7-defeat against zerg I have so 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.280
 well as anything won or i have 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.379
 all good 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.750
 once lost and against 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.879
 tempo, the year I lost everything 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.170
 up to 1 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.159
 Maybe if I'm lucky I have 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.030
 everything is lost you see something on everyone 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.579
 case again 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.500
 Something always only by the 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:16.610
 We have only one enemy on 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.590
 we can fix us, they soon 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.390
 I will be casting the forum will 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.100
 always cared about photos and meant off 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.530
 now this will be my new task 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.640
 no fun aside he is still playing 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.470
 very fresh we are also in the beta 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.700
 and yes I have strategies now and 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.720
 Of course with your video you want 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.920
 a little something to teach or a 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.560
 little bit of information 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.149
 provide what was important to me 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.409
 said hey who you have to first 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.299
 mechanics but you have to do the game 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.709
 understand fundamentally there must already 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.280
 As a charity game you have to be fast 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:44.209
 his 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.950
 multitasking apm decision making timing 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.330
 Everything is very important you get 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.520
 a lot of training with the time after easter 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.349
 and when does a point come there you can 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.099
 a lot of units bauer you can see the 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.630
 bad opponent 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.610
 but that does not suffice several times 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.360
 and now I'm in step 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.630
 two come 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.340
 gabriel top 10 grand master in the haft 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.340
 the orbiter will also play koreaner 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.890
 not only so far Europe above all 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.450
 Yesterday I gave me strategies 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.769
 I wrote down the block also 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.470
 The theme is living here so fast 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.150
 pcm a table also mist water bottle 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.010
 or front water surface so we read 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.680
 through i am gonna say ackermann 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.139
 of hardcore but what you want to with on 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.310
 give away 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:24.350
 It is important that you really 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.540
 Every small gap plays perfect 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.250
 can mean a defeat if one 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.650
 the timing supplied is to circle day and 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.880
 so on as well as he can sometimes we 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.940
 do what do you say what is important 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.299
 how would you say someone hey you 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.670
 win water take only times out 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.769
 Pay attention to what happens when 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.459
 Example against protoss if you rubbed there 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.720
 alternately, game whatever happens again 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.739
 then she has to look then comes sooner 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.090
 sends a bit different and on it 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.660
 you have to do something too 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.900
 if you make yourself to the whole list 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.739
 you should not just read down 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.470
 that would be too easy 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.900
 but you really have to be careful too 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:14.150
 opponent of the furniture for example, yourself 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:18.379
 special we had free yesterday they are 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.970
 all cruelly cruel so how are you doing 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.319
 the best you look at it 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.180
 I would have liked to learn that 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.620
 I have one of ours is already 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.450
 time and write me the whole 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.370
 that's a wheel of one 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.900
 The basic strategy you can use 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.130
 hold on one says okay so that's mine 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.280
 solid foundations like many people 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.349
 play will go and standard as Mainz 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.170
 neat cut red consultant with protoss 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.790
 but everyone understands and understands 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.170
 played and can be subject to this 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.940
 Nevertheless, I have one for example 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.590
 Here are notes 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.450
 just as you said if that 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.160
 What happens then what do I do then 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.480
 if for example you are god like that 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.120
 is because you have had to respond to the 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.769
 For example, former eBay builds or you 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.599
 Do you have to build diego and do things like that 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.160
 just that you know something you can do that 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.590
 but in which he would be better and also 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.790
 I find out that it hung the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.780
 next step for you and of course 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.920
 also very important to me you have 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.030
 not seen that live yesterday 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.380
 Of course there's video on it too 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.829
 the woman I would have today or 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.989
 by noon tomorrow write to you 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.849
 a strategy title down and scary 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.739
 many replays and whenever he loses 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.209
 look at your own barrels and 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.220
 looks what could have done better and 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.269
 write that as a short note on the 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.669
 technical work if I am now 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.500
 lose again that makes what can I do 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.580
 because make again asks you or im 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.169
 get involved myself then I write myself 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.030
 this a fine if he at me 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.570
 minutes30 again with any 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.220
 danse attacks then i have to do that 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.039
 5030 three was not enough when the 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.580
 For example, this is very important 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:42.229
 and then you stubbornly plays the office 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.190
 again and again you have to have young ones in it 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:43.889
 what people are maybe he is 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.199
 have stated 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.629
 I played so I learned 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.999
 commitments made that often overwhelmed 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.990
 the brain that has to be the moment 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.990
 think about strategy 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.360
 I have every point since you look like that 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.159
 10.12 barrick 13 same orbit hill then 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.169
 four marines will not build the bunker 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.860
 forget and who says that and then 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.930
 Now 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.490
 this and always here before 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.710
 but especially some point you come to 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.090
 where these things by heart I know 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.599
 does not have to think about what 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.159
 come now 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.629
 and you could be with her and meet her 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.490
 entertain what I play and play it 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.139
 everything is easy mother knew already 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.099
 unlearned and then I talk to him and 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.969
 it even comes we can do that too 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.379
 improve stadiums 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.939
 but that takes a bit more 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:23.189
 muscles work that does not work from 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.689
 now for the same reason, if you too 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.909
 since trained at this point give 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.680
 not on game strategy until she sits 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:30.509
 and it does not turn easy 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.150
 So you should be reasonable 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:35.639
 that is not so much knowledge now 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.939
 special our base ntt dispute 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:42.060
 Well, that's true, too 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:43.589
 again , not quite right 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.270
 I've been training with the beginning now 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:47.789
 four strategies how will i become now 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:51.270
 do not play today I think of 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:53.909
 15 is the best long takes 23 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.129
 hours until about 18 o'clock approximately 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.659
 I'll be a really great goal against 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:02.960
 lord your tip what you think best 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:06.029
 heart of the swarm three mend 1 to 1 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.979
 5 2 okay i do not have that either way 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:09.509
 bad I've been told 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.639
 he makes against the lost one 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:13.259
 later, quite a lot of people have 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.149
 turn on ricky martin i hope that 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:19.409
 not videos and 15 online oli action 

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:21.060
 already that creates an hour after that 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:23.789
 If I eat that for a minute then I am like that 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.339
 if everything is 19 19 30 years old then 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.220
 In any case, really cellar and you 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:30.500
 gabriel plays again the strategies 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.090
 I thank you many times these strategies 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.100
 it's my honor that you have something here 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.620
 I hope we see each other maybe 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.660
 next week, or even re-age 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.050
 namely time laments better kux 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.270
