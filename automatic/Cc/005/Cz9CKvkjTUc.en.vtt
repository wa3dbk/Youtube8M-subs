hey<00:00:00.269> guys<00:00:00.480> I<00:00:00.750> just<00:00:01.709> finished<00:00:02.159> this<00:00:02.250> build<00:00:02.520> it's

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hey guys I just finished this build it's

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.680 
hey guys I just finished this build it's
my<00:00:03.240> very<00:00:03.300> very<00:00:03.570> very<00:00:04.230> first<00:00:04.440> build<00:00:04.710> and

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
my very very very first build and

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.589 
my very very very first build and
basically<00:00:06.690> just<00:00:08.030> follow<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.179> along<00:00:09.240> with<00:00:09.570> a

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
basically just follow it along with a

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.720 
basically just follow it along with a
couple<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.960> plans<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.500> see<00:00:10.710> some<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
couple of plans that I see some of the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.430 
couple of plans that I see some of the
guys<00:00:11.849> post<00:00:12.210> on<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:13.400> overclockers<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:15.440> of

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
guys post on the overclockers and of

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.220 
guys post on the overclockers and of
course<00:00:16.680> there<00:00:17.150> another<00:00:18.150> place<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.990> something

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
course there another place is something

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.480 
course there another place is something
I<00:00:19.820> think<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.090> tried<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.359> stay<00:00:21.570> well<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.109> with

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
I think I tried to stay well it with

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.429 
I think I tried to stay well it with
more<00:00:23.490> functionality<00:00:24.420> than<00:00:24.810> looks<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.289> did

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
more functionality than looks but I did

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.830 
more functionality than looks but I did
kind<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:26.180> probably<00:00:27.180> go<00:00:27.300> crazy<00:00:27.449> I'm<00:00:27.689> some

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
kind of probably go crazy I'm some

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.679 
kind of probably go crazy I'm some
little<00:00:27.960> oops<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.349> don't<00:00:28.529> know<00:00:28.820> like<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.269> bought

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
little oops I don't know like I bought

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.080 
little oops I don't know like I bought
some<00:00:30.960> sleeve<00:00:31.890> cabling<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.550> got<00:00:32.730> some<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.000> my

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
some sleeve cabling and got some of my

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.540 
some sleeve cabling and got some of my
cable<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.600> sleeve<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:34.040> other<00:00:35.040> parts<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.460> it

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
cable and sleeve but other parts of it

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.880 
cable and sleeve but other parts of it
it's<00:00:35.670> not<00:00:35.850> sleeve<00:00:36.300> because<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:37.140> really<00:00:37.770> haven't

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
it's not sleeve because I really haven't

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.619 
it's not sleeve because I really haven't
figured<00:00:38.040> out<00:00:38.250> yet<00:00:38.309> if<00:00:38.730> they<00:00:38.910> if<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.329> could<00:00:39.480> get

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
figured out yet if they if I could get

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.810 
figured out yet if they if I could get
sleeved<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.410> these<00:00:40.980> particular<00:00:41.219> connectors

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
sleeved for these particular connectors

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.440 
sleeved for these particular connectors
but<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.350> think<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.440> turned<00:00:43.620> out<00:00:43.710> all<00:00:43.829> right<00:00:44.450> this

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
but I think it turned out all right this

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.029 
but I think it turned out all right this
is<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> 800<00:00:46.350> D<00:00:46.850> case<00:00:47.899> and<00:00:49.039> I<00:00:50.039> am<00:00:51.350> using<00:00:52.350> an<00:00:52.590> XPS

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
is the 800 D case and I am using an XPS

this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> largest<00:01:20.880> loop<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:21.780> still<00:01:21.990> got

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
this is the largest loop it's still got

compound<00:05:26.529> is<00:05:26.710> this<00:05:26.860> right<00:05:27.009> here<00:05:27.190> this<00:05:27.690> arctic

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
compound is this right here this arctic

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.209 
compound is this right here this arctic
silver<00:05:28.900> five<00:05:29.199> it<00:05:29.469> seems<00:05:29.680> to<00:05:29.740> be<00:05:29.830> pretty<00:05:29.949> nice

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:30.219 
silver five it seems to be pretty nice

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:32.249 
silver five it seems to be pretty nice
as<00:05:30.370> it<00:05:30.639> was<00:05:30.759> I'm<00:05:30.849> pretty<00:05:30.879> good<00:05:31.210> I<00:05:31.449> actually

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
as it was I'm pretty good I actually

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.519 
as it was I'm pretty good I actually
kind<00:05:32.590> of<00:05:32.650> took<00:05:32.830> uh<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:33.629> actually<00:05:34.629> warmed<00:05:35.319> it<00:05:35.409> up

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:35.529 
kind of took uh I actually warmed it up

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:37.890 
kind of took uh I actually warmed it up
in<00:05:35.710> a<00:05:35.830> yeah<00:05:36.039> a<00:05:36.340> heating<00:05:37.240> blanket<00:05:37.389> they<00:05:37.689> turned

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
in a yeah a heating blanket they turned

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.969 
in a yeah a heating blanket they turned
the<00:05:37.960> heat<00:05:38.020> him<00:05:38.169> Mike<00:05:38.319> it<00:05:38.439> up<00:05:38.529> and<00:05:38.680> wrapped<00:05:38.860> it

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
the heat him Mike it up and wrapped it

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:39.959 
the heat him Mike it up and wrapped it
up<00:05:39.039> in<00:05:39.159> anything<00:05:39.490> in<00:05:39.639> here<00:05:39.759> for<00:05:39.879> a<00:05:39.940> couple

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:39.969 
up in anything in here for a couple

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.029 
up in anything in here for a couple
hours<00:05:40.300> and<00:05:40.509> when<00:05:40.629> I<00:05:40.779> applied<00:05:41.409> it<00:05:41.560> it<00:05:41.680> went<00:05:41.919> on<00:05:42.009> a

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
hours and when I applied it it went on a

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.839 
hours and when I applied it it went on a
lot<00:05:42.190> easier<00:05:42.580> and<00:05:43.110> it<00:05:44.110> seemed<00:05:44.500> a<00:05:44.680> I<00:05:45.069> hope<00:05:45.520> bought

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
lot easier and it seemed a I hope bought

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:51.209 
lot easier and it seemed a I hope bought
a<00:05:45.879> lot<00:05:46.180> easier<00:05:46.629> on<00:05:47.250> the<00:05:48.389> surfaces<00:05:49.650> but<00:05:50.650> on<00:05:51.039> the

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:51.219 
a lot easier on the surfaces but on the

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:52.320 
a lot easier on the surfaces but on the
back<00:05:51.370> to<00:05:51.490> this<00:05:51.550> graphics<00:05:51.879> card<00:05:51.940> I<00:05:52.210> actually

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
back to this graphics card I actually

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.329 
back to this graphics card I actually
repeat<00:05:52.810> that<00:05:53.020> water<00:05:53.440> block<00:05:53.680> the<00:05:53.919> first<00:05:54.129> time

00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:54.339 
repeat that water block the first time

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.809 
repeat that water block the first time
and<00:05:54.639> broke<00:05:54.819> off<00:05:55.000> a<00:05:55.560> capacitor<00:05:56.560> but<00:05:57.250> lucky<00:05:57.669> for

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:57.819 
and broke off a capacitor but lucky for

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:01.800 
and broke off a capacitor but lucky for
me<00:05:58.229> where<00:05:59.229> I<00:05:59.259> worked<00:05:59.529> at<00:05:59.740> they<00:06:00.699> Davis<00:06:01.539> kind<00:06:01.719> of

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
me where I worked at they Davis kind of

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.350 
me where I worked at they Davis kind of
stuff<00:06:01.960> all<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.169> time<00:06:02.229> they<00:06:02.620> actually

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
stuff all the time they actually

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.390 
stuff all the time they actually
replaced<00:06:04.360> these<00:06:04.569> surface<00:06:04.960> mount<00:06:05.169> components

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
replaced these surface mount components

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.450 
replaced these surface mount components
all<00:06:06.400> the<00:06:06.639> time<00:06:06.819> so<00:06:07.089> I<00:06:08.099> had<00:06:09.099> one<00:06:09.279> of<00:06:09.370> the

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
all the time so I had one of the

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.790 
all the time so I had one of the
propeller<00:06:10.120> heads<00:06:10.360> at<00:06:10.479> work<00:06:10.629> take<00:06:11.440> a<00:06:11.469> look<00:06:11.710> at

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
propeller heads at work take a look at

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.279 
propeller heads at work take a look at
this<00:06:11.919> and<00:06:12.190> he<00:06:12.339> told<00:06:13.330> me<00:06:13.419> what<00:06:13.599> and<00:06:13.810> where<00:06:14.259> I

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
this and he told me what and where I

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:15.990 
this and he told me what and where I
needed<00:06:14.500> by<00:06:14.710> that<00:06:14.889> capacitor<00:06:15.430> and<00:06:15.550> I<00:06:15.639> bought<00:06:15.819> it

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
needed by that capacitor and I bought it

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.339 
needed by that capacitor and I bought it
it<00:06:16.210> was<00:06:16.240> a<00:06:18.000> $2.00<00:06:19.000> part<00:06:19.300> cost<00:06:19.750> me<00:06:19.900> about<00:06:19.990> eight

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
it was a $2.00 part cost me about eight

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:23.219 
it was a $2.00 part cost me about eight
dollars<00:06:20.800> to<00:06:20.919> shoot<00:06:21.129> the<00:06:21.250> to<00:06:21.400> me<00:06:21.870> and<00:06:22.870> I<00:06:22.960> took<00:06:23.110> it

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
dollars to shoot the to me and I took it

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:25.559 
dollars to shoot the to me and I took it
back<00:06:23.319> up<00:06:23.529> there<00:06:23.680> and<00:06:23.770> he<00:06:23.860> put<00:06:23.979> it<00:06:24.099> on<00:06:24.300> no<00:06:25.300> charge

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:25.569 
back up there and he put it on no charge

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:29.129 
back up there and he put it on no charge
and<00:06:26.789> I'm<00:06:27.789> hoping<00:06:28.120> that'll<00:06:28.300> works<00:06:28.509> okay<00:06:28.839> I<00:06:28.870> got

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
and I'm hoping that'll works okay I got

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.519 
and I'm hoping that'll works okay I got
video<00:06:30.360> so<00:06:31.360> I<00:06:31.389> guess<00:06:31.659> everything's<00:06:32.050> okay<00:06:32.289> I<00:06:32.319> got

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:32.529 
video so I guess everything's okay I got

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:36.240 
video so I guess everything's okay I got
no<00:06:32.650> leaks<00:06:33.060> didn't<00:06:34.060> have<00:06:34.180> one<00:06:34.330> leaked<00:06:34.539> I<00:06:35.250> took

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
no leaks didn't have one leaked I took

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.290 
no leaks didn't have one leaked I took
my<00:06:36.370> time<00:06:36.490> to<00:06:36.550> trying<00:06:36.909> to<00:06:36.969> make<00:06:37.180> sure

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
my time to trying to make sure

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.839 
my time to trying to make sure
everything<00:06:37.539> was<00:06:37.659> tightened<00:06:38.199> up<00:06:38.229> pretty<00:06:38.469> well

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
everything was tightened up pretty well

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.879 
everything was tightened up pretty well
but<00:06:39.849> I<00:06:40.240> did<00:06:40.750> as<00:06:40.870> best<00:06:41.080> I<00:06:41.139> could<00:06:41.199> maybe<00:06:41.620> you<00:06:41.770> guys

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:41.889 
but I did as best I could maybe you guys

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.959 
but I did as best I could maybe you guys
can<00:06:42.039> give<00:06:42.190> me<00:06:42.250> some<00:06:42.400> ideas<00:06:43.800> what<00:06:44.800> you<00:06:44.909> what<00:06:45.909> do

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:45.969 
can give me some ideas what you what do

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:48.030 
can give me some ideas what you what do
you<00:06:46.029> think<00:06:46.089> or<00:06:46.479> what<00:06:46.509> you<00:06:46.839> would<00:06:46.959> do<00:06:47.110> different

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
you think or what you would do different

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.000 
you think or what you would do different
I<00:06:48.790> do<00:06:49.210> like<00:06:49.450> these<00:06:49.660> the<00:06:50.110> idea<00:06:50.140> these<00:06:50.560> quick

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.010 
I do like these the idea these quick

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.680 
I do like these the idea these quick
disconnection<00:06:51.670> in<00:06:51.880> the<00:06:52.060> loop<00:06:52.210> so<00:06:52.480> I<00:06:52.540> can

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
disconnection in the loop so I can

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.830 
disconnection in the loop so I can
actually<00:06:52.990> quickly<00:06:53.410> disconnect<00:06:53.950> these<00:06:54.070> and

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
actually quickly disconnect these and

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.210 
actually quickly disconnect these and
wrap<00:06:55.840> it<00:06:55.990> with<00:06:56.050> a<00:06:56.110> towel<00:06:56.380> and<00:06:56.620> not<00:06:56.770> get<00:06:56.980> very

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
wrap it with a towel and not get very

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.550 
wrap it with a towel and not get very
much<00:06:57.430> water<00:06:57.610> out<00:06:57.760> of<00:06:57.880> it<00:06:58.030> at<00:06:58.150> all<00:06:58.300> and<00:06:58.930> I<00:06:59.410> can

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
much water out of it at all and I can

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.640 
much water out of it at all and I can
remove<00:06:59.920> the<00:07:00.100> the<00:07:01.000> reservoir<00:07:01.480> and<00:07:02.230> I<00:07:02.320> can<00:07:02.470> drain

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 
remove the the reservoir and I can drain

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.410 
remove the the reservoir and I can drain
it<00:07:02.770> if<00:07:02.860> need<00:07:03.070> be<00:07:03.100> or<00:07:03.280> replace<00:07:03.820> pumps<00:07:04.210> pretty

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:04.420 
it if need be or replace pumps pretty

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.880 
it if need be or replace pumps pretty
quickly<00:07:04.630> without<00:07:04.990> a<00:07:05.170> whole<00:07:05.380> lot<00:07:05.410> of<00:07:05.530> hassle

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:05.890 
quickly without a whole lot of hassle

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
quickly without a whole lot of hassle
we'll<00:07:06.010> just<00:07:06.160> fill<00:07:06.280> up<00:07:06.370> the<00:07:06.400> reservoir<00:07:06.580> and

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:06.910 
we'll just fill up the reservoir and

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.990 
we'll just fill up the reservoir and
reconnect<00:07:07.330> it<00:07:07.890> then<00:07:08.890> I'm<00:07:09.430> sure<00:07:09.610> probably<00:07:09.760> I<00:07:09.940> do

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
reconnect it then I'm sure probably I do

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.910 
reconnect it then I'm sure probably I do
bleed<00:07:10.240> again<00:07:10.600> but<00:07:12.210> this<00:07:13.210> is<00:07:13.420> it<00:07:13.860> know<00:07:14.860> what

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:14.920 
bleed again but this is it know what

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.280 
bleed again but this is it know what
y'all<00:07:15.070> think
