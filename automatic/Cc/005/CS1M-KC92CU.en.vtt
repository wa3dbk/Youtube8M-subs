00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 at sea 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.160
 what we have a 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.250
 The products of the chicco brand is a 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.020
 mark then of an average price the truth 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.180
 that the relation quality price is 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.800
 quite pretty good and good I 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.510
 I'm going to talk about my favorite products 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.980
 are the ones that I recommend you not going to 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.770
 preferred color simply the 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.720
 I'm taking the loose products that 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.360
 I recommend you start with this top coat 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.080
 is the touch that makes the masks of 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.809
 waterproof eyelashes is such that this is a 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.480
 transparent gel that good to me I do not 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.309
 like to have waterproof masks but 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.150
 when I need them to be, I apply this 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.340
 top coat over and 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.330
 great great the truth that is going very well 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.060
 of normal that this environment costs 590 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.650
 but if you find it in promotion os 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.340
 It can cost about three euros 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:07.480
 after the long lasting stick there serum 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:10.210
 I have these two the 20 that is a black 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:14.980
 mate that to make the smoky base 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.830
 eyes goes great looks very very black and 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.500
 I have this green that expedition and it is the 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.590
 number 10 and good is also very very 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.590
 pigmented are very easy to work with and 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.200
 They hold on my eyelid very much 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.630
 I always recommend using a test 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.710
 I know before but if you do not have the eyelid 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.540
 especially fatty I think that you 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.850
 they can hold up pretty well 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.210
 of normal I think they also haunt 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.010
 the 495 90 but in promotion they reach 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.930
 be three euros so I in the 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.530
 fund I take advantage of that they are at three euros and 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.509
 the same with dust shadows the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.130
 normal cost shadows around it 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:57.000
 you think six euros 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.619
 more or less and you're 490 I have a lot 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.409
 and I'm not going to teach you all just 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.500
 Well as a small sample here 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.470
 I have this one that is double is the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.770
 colors faith and has this part that is 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.990
 basically pure purpurine 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.270
 I do not use it but it is very pretty 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.760
 it's a very beautiful community and then this 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:24.840
 which is mate that is very good 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.120
 is a lovely tone does not apply and 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.040
 is number 208 then this is a 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:38.460
 shadow martel and is the 144 is this rosita 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.920
 of course, how can you 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.140
 is that they are that diet that is not seen 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.180
 but in spite of being mate that the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.870
 normally the shadow is matte give more 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.340
 Problems at the time of pigmentation 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.020
 these are going pretty well I do not know 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.960
 if all I do not have all the shadows 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.120
 Kiko mates but the ones that I have tried 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.080
 yeah they're going pretty good and then it 's 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.580
 that has emery is 137 and this is a 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.850
 past pigmented it seems that it is a 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.850
 colour 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.110
 very precious 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.090
 well also a very well given shade 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.520
 then the base of eyes of kiko is 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.520
 great is great, great, great, great 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.620
 great costs about 17 8 euros but of 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.310
 the 8 do not think that happens I do not remember that 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.680
 pass of the 8 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.560
 and apply it before the shadows do 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.170
 that lasts a lot longer and well they are 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.959
 I basically recommend it there are other 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.880
 evidence is that maybe then they are a 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.400
 little bit better but they are much more 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.180
 faces and I recommend you is therefore the 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.610
 kiko bicrim is great gives very very well 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.819
 very easy to work very comfortable to 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.430
 carry and also goes great 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.860
 I have already recommended a thousand and one times 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.790
 to a lot of people and nobody has 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.050
 complained 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.940
 so for something it will be because it is a very 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.760
 good product after products of 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.850
 lipstick lips I have the line 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.700
 I do not know what it's called but I know it's line 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.220
 since it costs 250 and well, this is 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.290
 my favorite as you can see it because 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.319
 I have it almost exhausted and it's number 11 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.130
 is this rose I think it's from my 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.430
 favorite lipstick is a color 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.169
 Very versatile 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.780
 with the look that you wear it will be 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.479
 well that looks good in a lot of 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.280
 people and good there are people who say that the 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.699
 texture they do not like much because the 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.280
 note a little sandy not mine 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:37.550
 same a creamy and 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.410
 you can see it is not the lipstick 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.650
 of highest quality you can find 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.530
 but the truth is that he did not notice any problems 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.560
 then we will be the extra bowling 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.620
 plus that are supposed to give volume to 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.240
 lip and I have not noticed that they give special 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.710
 volume but the texture of these gloss 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:00.020
 it's fantastic it's not too liquid 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.240
 neither too sticky these products I 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.440
 I think that they are a little past 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.440
 of the price I'm going to put it here 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:13.360
 They cost 790 of normal but the same if 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.710
 you find them between losses are three 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.690
 euros the truth that the kiko discount 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:21.460
 are usually very well and I take advantage 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.910
 rebates of which I am going to buy some 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.979
 here and I go I'm taking advantage and this is the 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:31.350
 number 11 just like the lipstick that 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.350
 taught and then the super range the 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:38.320
 this is the number 110 is finished very 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.110
 cover gloss finish 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:45.430
 lasts a lot the lips the truth is not 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:49.510
 eternal but has a good duration 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:52.840
 and well, there are other finishes 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.910
 within the super super line there are 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.590
 others are more transparent others that 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.660
 they are even a little more pigmented 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:03.190
 also special because I like this that 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:06.820
 I know the texture and 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.500
 how it feels on the lips I think that 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.190
 is of fairly high quality so what 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.190
 I recommend 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.980
 and finally villa I finish the enamels of 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:18.730
 kiko I'm going to teach these three in 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:24.490
 first place this is 245 and it's a 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:27.250
 purple with pink and orange glitters and 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.740
 it is a beautiful color and then two colors 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:33.660
 that have been and fish and p 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:39.610
 hyper famous this summer have been the 236 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:41.560
 what is this orange red there in the middle 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.900
 that I think is the one that taught my 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.700
 friend paula in the video of my top 5 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.500
 summer I do not stop mentioning him 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.290
 mentioned in other videos that it can not be 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:54.520
 which is very very well known I think is 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:57.850
 the 389 and it's this green blue phosphorite 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.040
 that is impressive also depends 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:03.040
 of the tastes you have depending on 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.800
 colors for the nails but if you do not 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.949
 matter what color it is 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.039
 this color is a pass telling you not to 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:15.360
 All nail polishes from Kiko are 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:18.030
 just as good, not everyone has the same 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.650
 and coverage not with the same number of 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.210
 layers will go equally well why you 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.949
 I recommend that before buying the 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.159
 nail polish always have one of 

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:30.930
 sample then try it on the nail 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:32.969
 and then see how it covers well and 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.250
 this is my video about the brand 

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:37.650
 kiko I hope you like it and that it serves you 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.449
 of help since it is a store that has 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.909
 so many things that you see, you say that 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:43.590
 I want to go in as a tepic 

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:48.080
 Burning so much with I saw so much variety 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:50.870
 Then, here are my 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.370
 little things that I like I hope that I have 

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:55.539
 liked the video and that we see in the 

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.539
 next days
