who've been the squirt and that would be

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.320 
who've been the squirt and that would be
difficult

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
difficult

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.500 
difficult
to<00:02:13.720> address<00:02:14.320> but<00:02:14.740> there's<00:02:15.280> no<00:02:15.400> doubt<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:16.330> the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
to address but there's no doubt in the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
next couple of years I'm sure the time

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.880 
next couple of years I'm sure the time
we<00:02:18.640> can<00:02:18.790> hopefully<00:02:19.030> get<00:02:19.450> an<00:02:20.020> idea<00:02:20.410> suitable

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
we can hopefully get an idea suitable

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.730 
we can hopefully get an idea suitable
for<00:02:21.070> both<00:02:21.220> countries<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.450> we<00:02:23.410> can<00:02:23.590> have<00:02:23.620> a

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
for both countries so that we can have a

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.140 
for both countries so that we can have a
game<00:02:23.980> because<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.340> was<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.760> great<00:02:24.940> rivalry

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
game because I was a great rivalry

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.720 
game because I was a great rivalry
between<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.870> countries<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.260> course<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.920> very

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
between the countries of course to very

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.000 
between the countries of course to very
close<00:02:28.030> sport<00:02:28.780> nations<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.650> think<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:29.920> would

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
close sport nations and I think it would

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.160 
close sport nations and I think it would
better<00:02:30.130> every<00:02:30.430> much<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.690> course<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:32.050> was

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
better every much and of course it was

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.020 
better every much and of course it was
muted<00:02:32.590> after<00:02:32.980> both<00:02:33.160> countries<00:02:33.460> fail<00:02:33.850> to

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
muted after both countries fail to

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.120 
muted after both countries fail to
qualify<00:02:34.120> for<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.660> euros<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:35.200> we<00:02:35.680> might<00:02:35.890> see

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
qualify for the euros that we might see

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.680 
qualify for the euros that we might see
a<00:02:36.160> return<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.670> home<00:02:36.820> internationals<00:02:37.270> this

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
a return of the home internationals this

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.570 
a return of the home internationals this
summer<00:02:37.960> would<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.650> support<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:39.130> if<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.550> ever

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
summer would you support that if I ever

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.910 
summer would you support that if I ever
came<00:02:40.210> to<00:02:40.420> light<00:02:40.570> for<00:02:41.290> England<00:02:41.680> Scotland

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
came to light for England Scotland

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.460 
came to light for England Scotland
whether<00:02:42.280> any<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:42.970> know<00:02:43.000> Ireland<00:02:43.900> wheels<00:02:44.110> I

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
whether any you know Ireland wheels I

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.320 
whether any you know Ireland wheels I
think<00:02:44.860> your<00:02:45.010> priority<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.610> always<00:02:45.820> further

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
think your priority is always further

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.900 
think your priority is always further
for<00:02:47.020> your<00:02:47.170> main<00:02:47.680> competition<00:02:48.100> such<00:02:48.640> as<00:02:48.670> the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
for your main competition such as the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.940 
for your main competition such as the
Euro<00:02:49.090> championships<00:02:49.780> in<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:49.990> world<00:02:50.140> cup<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:50.920> I

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
Euro championships in the world cup so I

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.160 
Euro championships in the world cup so I
think<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.280> always<00:02:51.610> be<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.060> priority<00:02:52.390> but<00:02:52.959> if

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
think that always be a priority but if

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.199 
think that always be a priority but if
you<00:02:53.290> can<00:02:53.470> organize<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.880> know<00:02:55.000> home

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
you can organize you know home

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.270 
you can organize you know home
international<00:02:55.780> games<00:02:55.990> in<00:02:56.260> between<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:57.070> why

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
international games in between and why

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.459 
international games in between and why
not
