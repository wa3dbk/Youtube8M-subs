00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
pretty much what we ended up doing or

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.049 
pretty much what we ended up doing or
what<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.640> ended<00:00:26.730> up<00:00:26.939> doing<00:00:27.060> was<00:00:29.150> prior<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:32.059> my

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
what I ended up doing was prior to my

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.650 
what I ended up doing was prior to my
work<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:34.010> basically<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.969> battery<00:00:36.420> here

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
work here basically this battery here

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.619 
work here basically this battery here
was<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.020> only<00:00:37.140> battery<00:00:37.620> being<00:00:38.579> used<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.510> is

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
was the only battery being used this is

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.930 
was the only battery being used this is
just<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> plain<00:00:40.050> old<00:00:40.079> 6<00:00:40.469> volt<00:00:40.680> let<00:00:41.399> acid<00:00:41.700> battery

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
just a plain old 6 volt let acid battery

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.000 
just a plain old 6 volt let acid battery
they<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.210> which<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.680> know<00:00:43.739> not<00:00:43.920> enough

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
they have which you know not enough

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.540 
they have which you know not enough
juice<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:45.329> get<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.989> whole<00:00:46.710> lot<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.950> speed

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
juice really to get a whole lot of speed

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.160 
juice really to get a whole lot of speed
on<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.700> thing<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.030> fact<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.360> was<00:00:48.480> pretty<00:00:48.870> slow

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
on this thing in fact it was pretty slow

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.310 
on this thing in fact it was pretty slow
even<00:00:49.530> with<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> little<00:00:49.920> girl<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.219> there<00:00:52.399> so<00:00:54.320> we

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
even with a little girl in there so we

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.350 
even with a little girl in there so we
doubled<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.949> by<00:00:56.250> putting<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.699> another<00:00:57.000> six

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
doubled that by putting in another six

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.380 
doubled that by putting in another six
volt<00:00:57.570> battery<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:59.000> basically<00:01:00.000> what<00:01:00.300> we

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
volt battery here and basically what we

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.670 
volt battery here and basically what we
ended<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:00.629> doing<00:01:00.780> was<00:01:00.930> why<00:01:01.350> are<00:01:01.410> these<00:01:01.620> in

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
ended up doing was why are these in

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.469 
ended up doing was why are these in
series<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:03.260> we<00:01:04.260> got<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.909> try<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.939> make<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.270> as

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
series so we got the try to make this as

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.080 
series so we got the try to make this as
less<00:01:06.659> confusing<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.110> possible<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:08.090> basically

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
less confusing as possible but basically

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.820 
less confusing as possible but basically
the<00:01:09.420> negative<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.380> vent<00:01:10.590> or<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the negative of this vent or the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.109 
the negative of this vent or the
positive<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.400> battery<00:01:11.729> goes<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
positive of this battery goes to the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.359 
positive of this battery goes to the
negative<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.750> battery<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
negative on this battery and then the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.190 
negative on this battery and then the
negative<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> positive<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.960> goes

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
negative and the positive on this goes

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.100 
negative and the positive on this goes
to<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.369> actual<00:01:17.670> car<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.270> then<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> negative

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
to the actual car and then the negative

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.380 
to the actual car and then the negative
goes<00:01:19.290> back<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.430> negative<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.270> this

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
goes back to the negative on this

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.660 
goes back to the negative on this
battery<00:01:21.950> what<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.070> does<00:01:23.220> for<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.610> is

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
battery what that does for you is

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.249 
battery what that does for you is
actually<00:01:24.030> crank<00:01:24.240> up<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.509> 12<00:01:24.750> volts<00:01:25.049> you

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
actually crank up to 12 volts you

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.719 
actually crank up to 12 volts you
actually<00:01:25.560> add<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.860> voltage<00:01:26.130> together<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.640> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
actually add the voltage together so you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.210 
actually add the voltage together so you
get<00:01:26.820> 6<00:01:27.030> plus<00:01:27.150> 6<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.960> little<00:01:28.290> over<00:01:28.979> 12

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
get 6 plus 6 and it's a little over 12

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.260 
get 6 plus 6 and it's a little over 12
actually<00:01:31.310> what<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.340> added<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> switch

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
actually what I added on was a switch

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.469 
actually what I added on was a switch
here<00:01:33.680> because<00:01:34.729> coming<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> charger

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
here because coming up with a charger

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.580 
here because coming up with a charger
for<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.750> would<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> little<00:01:37.229> bit<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.439> pain

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
for this would do a little bit of pain

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.819 
for this would do a little bit of pain
in<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.770> butt<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.369> instead<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:40.380> made<00:01:40.799> a

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
in the butt so instead I just made a

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.880 
in the butt so instead I just made a
quick<00:01:41.040> switch<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.759> spliced<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.479> here<00:01:42.890> in

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
quick switch like spliced in here in

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.340 
quick switch like spliced in here in
between<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> two<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.729> what<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.810> does<00:01:46.020> is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
between the two and what that does is

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.980 
between the two and what that does is
you<00:01:47.159> turn<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.460> off<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.119> takes<00:01:48.329> them<00:01:48.509> out<00:01:48.780> of

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
you turn it off and it takes them out of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.780 
you turn it off and it takes them out of
series<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.530> now<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.130> can<00:01:50.310> actually<00:01:50.430> charge

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
series and now you can actually charge

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.560 
series and now you can actually charge
them<00:01:51.119> individually<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:52.740> no<00:01:52.860> problems<00:01:53.570> when

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
them individually with no problems when

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.810 
them individually with no problems when
you<00:01:54.659> turn<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.899> back<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.310> full<00:01:56.579> 12

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
you turn it back on you get the full 12

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.810 
you turn it back on you get the full 12
volts<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.380> thus<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.770> go<00:01:59.490> ahead<00:01:59.670> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
volts and thus you can go ahead and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.510 
volts and thus you can go ahead and
drive<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.860> what<00:02:01.979> I'm<00:02:02.040> gonna<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.250> right<00:02:02.280> now

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
drive it so what I'm gonna do right now

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.190 
drive it so what I'm gonna do right now

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
full charge yet either so I'm gonna need

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.140 
full charge yet either so I'm gonna need
to<00:02:43.909> charge<00:02:44.120> some<00:02:44.390> more<00:02:44.569> and<00:02:44.860> should<00:02:45.860> be<00:02:46.150> even

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
to charge some more and should be even

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.420 
to charge some more and should be even
better<00:02:47.269> but<00:02:49.239> it's<00:02:50.239> actually<00:02:50.660> moving<00:02:50.810> faster

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
better but it's actually moving faster

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.580 
better but it's actually moving faster
