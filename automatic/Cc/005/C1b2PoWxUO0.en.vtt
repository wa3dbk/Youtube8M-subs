yeast and we'll add that to our mixing

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.860 
yeast and we'll add that to our mixing
bowl<00:00:30.449> I'm<00:00:31.880> just<00:00:32.880> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.149> stir<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.690> around

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
bowl I'm just going to stir that around

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.500 
bowl I'm just going to stir that around
a<00:00:34.260> little<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.829> get<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.750> yeast<00:00:36.750> mixed<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
a little to get the yeast mixed in and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.680 
a little to get the yeast mixed in and
set<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.379> dissolve<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.610> while<00:00:42.510> we're

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
set that to dissolve and while we're

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.139 
set that to dissolve and while we're
waiting<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:43.140> our<00:00:43.739> yeast<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.250> dissolve<00:00:44.670> I'm

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
waiting for our yeast to dissolve I'm

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.270 
waiting for our yeast to dissolve I'm
going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.110> separate<00:00:46.559> one<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.829> our<00:00:47.039> eggs

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
going to separate one of our eggs

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.190 
going to separate one of our eggs
because<00:00:47.640> our<00:00:47.760> recipe<00:00:48.180> calls<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.870> whole

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
because our recipe calls for one whole

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.840 
because our recipe calls for one whole
egg<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.700> egg<00:00:50.840> separated<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> we'll<00:00:53.640> just

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
egg and one egg separated so we'll just

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.920 
egg and one egg separated so we'll just
crack<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.449> egg<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.930> I'm<00:00:55.440> going<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.930> crack

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
crack that egg and I'm going to crack

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.380 
crack that egg and I'm going to crack
the<00:00:58.199> egg<00:00:58.350> open<00:00:58.620> very<00:00:59.100> carefully<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.059> this

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the egg open very carefully like this

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.170 
the egg open very carefully like this
and<00:01:00.690> let<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> bottom<00:01:01.859> shell<00:01:02.250> hold<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.940> yolk

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and let the bottom shell hold the yolk

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
and let the bottom shell hold the yolk
and<00:01:03.650> let<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.799> white<00:01:05.010> sort<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.580> drip<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.240> into

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
and let the white sort of drip out into

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.050 
and let the white sort of drip out into
our<00:01:07.380> bowl<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.220> want<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.430> make<00:01:08.580> sure<00:01:08.760> there<00:01:08.909> is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
a bowl there to catch that and we're

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.249 
a bowl there to catch that and we're
going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.890> use<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.509> white<00:01:15.509> will<00:01:15.780> save<00:01:16.049> that
