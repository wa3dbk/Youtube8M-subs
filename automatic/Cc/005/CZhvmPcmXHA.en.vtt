00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.780 

so<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.320> says<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.740> starting<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.159> crash

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
so I says it's starting of crash

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.410 
so I says it's starting of crash
Chrysler<00:01:12.390> flash<00:01:12.720> process<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:14.700> he<00:01:14.820> races<00:01:15.270> and

then<00:01:15.540> starts<00:01:15.810> flashing<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.320> now<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:17.010> always<00:01:17.700> use

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
then starts flashing it now I always use

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.460 
then starts flashing it now I always use
even<00:01:18.120> though<00:01:18.240> these<00:01:18.390> newer<00:01:18.630> Chrysler's<00:01:19.170> of

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
flash burn clip I always hook up a

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.380 
flash burn clip I always hook up a
battery<00:01:21.330> charger<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> battery<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.360> make

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
battery charger to a battery to make

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.540 
battery charger to a battery to make
sure<00:01:24.690> that<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.200> stays<00:01:25.440> uh<00:01:25.470> maintained<00:01:26.340> about

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
sure that it stays uh maintained about

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.240 
sure that it stays uh maintained about
13<00:01:27.000> volts<00:01:27.750> or<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:30.110> as<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
13 volts or so as this is going it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.270 
13 volts or so as this is going it
started<00:01:32.610> programming<00:01:33.000> here<00:01:33.560> some<00:01:34.560> some<00:01:34.979> flash

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
started programming here some some flash

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.730 
started programming here some some flash
faster<00:01:36.030> than<00:01:36.180> others<00:01:36.350> listen<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.380> think<00:01:37.590> this

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
faster than others listen I think this

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.710 
faster than others listen I think this
is<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> first<00:01:38.250> or<00:01:38.400> second<00:01:38.759> caliber<00:01:39.420> I've<00:01:39.509> done

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
is the first or second caliber I've done

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.650 
is the first or second caliber I've done
I'm<00:01:39.840> not<00:01:39.869> sure<00:01:40.850> like<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.000> said<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:45.420> need<00:01:45.630> some

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
on this showing you guys how long it

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.889 
on this showing you guys how long it
takes

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
takes

that's a flash process approximately 50%
done<00:02:23.459> or<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.120> as<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.750> goes<00:02:24.900> through<00:02:25.519> it<00:02:26.519> will

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
done or so as it goes through it will

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.430 
done or so as it goes through it will

calibration slowly successfully when

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.720 
calibration slowly successfully when
it's<00:02:30.150> all<00:02:30.239> set<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:31.130> we'll<00:02:32.130> make<00:02:32.310> sure<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.549> car

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
it's all set and we'll make sure the car

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.640 
it's all set and we'll make sure the car
starts<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.090> runs<00:02:33.269> which<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:34.380> always

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
starts and runs which is is always

00:02:34.650 --> 00:03:08.380 
starts and runs which is is always
important<00:02:35.130> too

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.580 

and<00:03:09.020> there<00:03:09.980> we<00:03:10.220> go<00:03:10.250> it's<00:03:10.520> gonna<00:03:10.670> do<00:03:10.880> a<00:03:10.910> checksum

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
and there we go it's gonna do a checksum

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.780 
and there we go it's gonna do a checksum
verification<00:03:12.590> on<00:03:12.740> a<00:03:12.770> logical<00:03:13.280> block<00:03:13.490> so<00:03:13.700> it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
verification on a logical block so it

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:26.180 
verification on a logical block so it
says<00:03:14.560> since<00:03:15.560> try<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:15.800> be<00:03:16.010> off<00:03:18.100> click<00:03:19.100> ok

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
then after a few seconds it also tells
