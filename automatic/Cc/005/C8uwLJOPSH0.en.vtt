00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
between that and the galaxy s3 so it's

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.799 
between that and the galaxy s3 so it's
got<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> nice<00:00:54.149> feel<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.449> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809

see<00:00:59.640> it's<00:00:59.820> got<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.149> jump<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.960> right<00:01:01.230> there

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
see it's got the jump in right there

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.390 
see it's got the jump in right there
and<00:01:02.129> down<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:04.460> think<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.580> says<00:01:06.260> fast

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
and down here as I think this says fast

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.030 
and down here as I think this says fast
faster<00:01:08.400> II<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.880> guess<00:01:09.619> I'm<00:01:10.619> not<00:01:10.830> sure<00:01:10.860> what

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
faster II I guess I'm not sure what

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.490 
faster II I guess I'm not sure what
company<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.729> probably<00:01:12.000> made<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.500> and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
company that is it probably made it and

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.399 
company that is it probably made it and
it's<00:01:13.860> got<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> carbon<00:01:14.670> fiber<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.780> not<00:01:16.020> it's

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
it's got the carbon fiber it's not it's

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.399 
it's got the carbon fiber it's not it's
just<00:01:16.530> rubber<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.600> could<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.720> look<00:01:18.960> at<00:01:19.229> your

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
just rubber but could the look at your

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.510 
just rubber but could the look at your
still<00:01:19.590> look<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.310> got<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
still look like a then it's got the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
still look like a then it's got the
little<00:01:20.549> white<00:01:20.939> tabs<00:01:21.299> under<00:01:21.720> there

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
little white tabs under there

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.780 
little white tabs under there
and<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:24.020> like<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.950> kind<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.400> thin<00:01:26.759> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
and I like it but it's kind of thin and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.020 
and I like it but it's kind of thin and
the<00:01:27.689> 6<00:01:27.930> pluses<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.590> all<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.340> sixes<00:01:29.759> aren't

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the 6 pluses and all the sixes aren't

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.780 
the 6 pluses and all the sixes aren't
going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.299> break<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.840> stuff<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.280> think

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
going to break and stuff but I think

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.429 
going to break and stuff but I think
it's<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.180> nice<00:01:33.299> ski<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.900> looks<00:01:34.049> pretty<00:01:34.290> good
