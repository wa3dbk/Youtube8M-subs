00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.840
 OG Flex 2 is one of the most interesting smartphones of 2015 so far, 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.360
 which forces us to take a little heavier with him. 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.680
 So, we separate 5 reasons you should take into consideration when buying it, 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.020
 since he is far from being immune to criticism. 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.479
 Come on, the G 2 International Flex comes with 32 GB of internal storage, 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.440
 while the Brazilian version has only 16GB. 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.508
 This is already a problem in itself, 

00:00:32.508 --> 00:00:37.908
 since virtually all 2015 line tops were announced with at least 32 GB. 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.620
 The thing gets worse when we look at how much of that space is available to the user: only 7 GB. 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.980
 Here it is already sold with micro SD card in some stores, and believe me, you will need, 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.180
 being a rather weird limitation in a top of the line. 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.260
 This second generation of the G Flex has a 500 mAh battery less than the original G Flex, 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.660
 screen with a resolution more than two times higher and processor much more powerful. 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.020
 The result is exactly this: a smaller autonomy, sometimes barely completing the day. 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.860
 In our tests we have seen that he behaves quite strangely at times, 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.820
 consuming enough energy even when the screen is off, getting hot even without use, 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.520
 and we expect LG to perform a software update to resolve this issue. 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.780
 The biggest problem with Snapdragon 810 is not that it gets too hot. 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.560
 Every top-of-the-line smartphone heats up: G Flex 2 is no exception here. 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.770
 The problem is that it takes a long time to cool down after running a heavier app, 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.570
 like a game. 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.240
 In addition, it gets hot even with simpler apps, 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.720
 like Whatsapp or Facebook, which barely require processing. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.060
 This is kinda uncomfortable after a while, in addition to consuming a larger amount of battery. 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.000
 One of the features we highlight of G Flex 2 is its number of extras, 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.780
 but we expected a little more in the second generation. 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.340
 It is flexible, curved and regenerative, 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.480
 characteristics that make it one of the most resistant models out there. 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.790
 So why not add a resistance against water and dust to make it even better? 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.590
 The high launch price certainly guarantees a margin to add this feature. 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.519
 The high price is bad for G Flex 2 for two reasons here. 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.999
 In Brazil, unfortunately, top-of-the-line smartphones unfortunately have already surpassed the R $ 3000 mark 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:25.399
 without any prospect that this will improve, 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.699
 which makes the item "price" a constant in our 5 reasons. 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.960
 In the case of G Flex 2 this is even more serious, since, with $ 3500, 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.660
 you take home a smartphone with 7GB of available internal memory, 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.580
 less space even than the Galaxy S4 when launched. 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.210
 These were the 5 defects of G Flex 2, but it also has many qualities. 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.786
