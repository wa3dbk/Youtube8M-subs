00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:03.559
 I saw tutorials, I'm not a letter, so it's 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.960
 again he is pleased c4 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.369
 possibly have seen it a thousand times 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:10.599
 why 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.599
 I am dedicating myself more to being what this is 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.359
 cc four tutorials to see all the advantages that they have why 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.660
 Obviously many people who know that there is no need to have offered done today there is no 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:23.859
 no difference 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:24.829
 the truth 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.519
 is that trusting 8 seems complete and simón but it taught them some 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.439
 4 cc tools 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.680
 so that other possibilities are available to download it contract is very easy i - 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.310
 there is no problem clarified 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.880
 good if the problem is illegal but 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.150
 finally all 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.150
 I have jarma form anybody this time 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.810
 this seems to be a remote control 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.810
 for the moment I have no idea what it is 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.900
 vie our city 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.120
 we want to 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.380
 advance now 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.340
 and for that we are going to turn it into a mobile click 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.340
 or movie client and opponents 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.010
 the serene - the shark 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.190
 and notice what is very important k the pivot this circuit that is done to the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.510
 pivote and es es esma menchú important for san ignacio 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.560
 per cent what we are going to see for example best where the stronger the shark 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.550
 it's not half in soletas around here more or less than the shark 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.030
 in this group you can have the strength 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.320
 it is no longer left and trampling and qihoo be 30 frame to say any one 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.570
 and we are going to 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.570
 we go to the first of arles castro shark 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.470
 a right click and create motion interpolation and / or thematically we 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.800
 create 12 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.200
 what is this the number of photographers we have but if we put something 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.960
 a second in other words 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.130
 if manaos f5 creates us more seconds for example streets about three seconds 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.910
 exact 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.810
 let's say the second 16 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.810
 power c 6 and I want this to 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.809
 nor are listed added up here 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.469
 brings out nothing more and highlights how a bird line is created 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.199
 which teaches us the tour 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:25.179
 what and eva pivot 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:28.559
 That's why the pivot was so important 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:32.419
 and what I find extraordinary with the simple selection tool coc 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.579
 the simple joke to black 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.129
 we can form these and as we inform this shirk it deserves a 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.659
 shark 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.659
 and we can do what they will do 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.869
 Burgos 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:46.769
 i after 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.019
 let's get closer to him 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.369
 different movements simply because he 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:52.829
 already 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.649
 we have everything ready 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:58.789
 and yes not what creates us in true the real name for this is a 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:01.599
 trajectory displacement 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.870
 i can see the excellent 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.769
 utility that has this 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.409
 to form things 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:10.610
 but not things 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.879
 Sherry and Chinese 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.930
 a mobile curved moving clips and so on 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.510
 that with an interpolation before it very difficult to be so narrate 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.859
 mind that is called 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.319
 Gaddafi that the Interpol 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.079
 of movement now because lantigua the one that was like an addict is now called 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.899
 classic interpolation 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:34.899
 well that was it for this tutorial we'll see you in u 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:36.989
 in an upcoming tutoring
