shots you also have to be really careful

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.400 
shots you also have to be really careful
the<00:01:27.149> ghosts<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:27.750> running<00:01:27.990> down<00:01:28.170> below

will<00:01:31.560> take<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.829> out<00:01:31.890> really<00:01:32.430> quickly<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:33.420> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
will take you out really quickly just a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.499 
will take you out really quickly just a
couple<00:01:34.439> seconds<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.159> their<00:01:35.759> line<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.090> fire<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
couple seconds in their line of fire and

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.090 
couple seconds in their line of fire and
they're<00:01:36.630> done<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:37.140> there<00:01:37.290> really<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.619> mystic

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
they're done but there really is mystic

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.620 
they're done but there really is mystic
they<00:01:38.610> don't<00:01:38.790> move<00:01:38.939> very<00:01:38.970> fast<00:01:41.149> so<00:01:42.149> take<00:01:42.509> out

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
they don't move very fast so take out

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.109 
they don't move very fast so take out
that<00:01:42.780> gunner<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:45.200> on<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.369> anti<00:01:47.369> ground<00:01:47.790> I

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
that gunner on the on the anti ground I

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.649 
that gunner on the on the anti ground I
guess<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.630> would<00:01:48.750> call<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.930> right<00:01:49.369> just

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
guess you would call it right just

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.910 
guess you would call it right just
standard<00:01:51.659> rate<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.710> actually

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
standard rate that you can actually

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.899 
standard rate that you can actually
drive<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.869> that<00:01:55.369> after<00:01:56.369> take<00:01:56.520> out<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> gunner

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
drive and that after take out the gunner

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.959 
drive and that after take out the gunner
you<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.180> run<00:01:57.390> right<00:01:57.630> up<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.790> hijack<00:01:59.790> it

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
you can run right up to it and hijack it

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.440 
you can run right up to it and hijack it
for<00:02:00.180> yourself<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:05.460> might<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.909> dodge<00:02:06.090> one

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
for yourself you might have to dodge one

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.419 
for yourself you might have to dodge one
of<00:02:06.570> his<00:02:06.689> shots<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.409> that's<00:02:07.860> not<00:02:08.070> too<00:02:08.220> hard<00:02:08.250> to

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
of his shots but that's not too hard to

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.609 
of his shots but that's not too hard to
do<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.910> I've<00:02:09.539> never<00:02:09.750> seen<00:02:10.140> them<00:02:10.289> try<00:02:10.500> to

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
do and I've never seen them try to

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.580 
do and I've never seen them try to
flatter<00:02:11.009> me<00:02:11.390> by<00:02:12.390> using<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.750> little<00:02:12.989> boost<00:02:13.320> that

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
flatter me by using a little boost that

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.039 
flatter me by using a little boost that
they<00:02:13.739> have<00:02:14.570> so<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.630> don't<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.930> worry

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
they have so you don't have to worry

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.250 
they have so you don't have to worry
about<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.350> after<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.070> getting<00:02:17.250> rate

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
about that after you getting rate

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.470 
about that after you getting rate
take<00:02:19.260> out<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.440> anti<00:02:20.430> air<00:02:20.610> raid<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
take out the anti air raid and the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.920 
take out the anti air raid and the
remaining<00:02:22.140> ghosts

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
remaining ghosts

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.630 
remaining ghosts
then<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.739> can<00:02:24.859> move<00:02:24.950> on<00:02:25.099> to<00:02:25.219> the<00:02:25.310> next<00:02:25.370> section

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
then you can move on to the next section

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.630 
then you can move on to the next section
oh<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.959> this<00:02:27.019> is<00:02:27.079> this<00:02:27.890> is<00:02:28.040> also<00:02:28.189> the<00:02:28.280> area

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
oh and this is this is also the area

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.899 
oh and this is this is also the area
