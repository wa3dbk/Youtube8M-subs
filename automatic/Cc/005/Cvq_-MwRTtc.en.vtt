00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.399
 was 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.560
 Hello and welcome to our squad first lovable region 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.210
 Today I want to be there 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.539
 as I find very entertaining and interesting to introduce autumn 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.519
 which are not suitable for everyone 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.749
 First and foremost we dedicate ourselves to the next police and words 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.199
 then comes the STX Corp. with 1006 facts are curious 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.030
 and last but not least Achmed years 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.990
 So the two 10 5 4 percent 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.070
 Cost 9 70 cents 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.760
 This app is in English which is not a disadvantage because in the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.900
 English original King I break much better anyway 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.820
 Maybe once to Barneys, in general, its character from the 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.790
 tv series how with the malware 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.890
 and his favorite color is to strengthen women 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.340
 we take these 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.890
 of woman hero while syncing hot food open a black screen 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.420
 but then we have five pages 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.420
 with sayings from the series how with the mom 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.990
 all by Barney Stinson 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.340
 all original 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.700
 of the series 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.150
 Also called Pentagon's dog is still available 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.640
 These sayings can now be selected individually 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.530
 and you can listen to the sound 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.770
 these are partly empty very funny 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.770
 Proverbs how threatening the drupes 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.940
 or 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.940
 So let's do some other manners and 4 4 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.470
 as 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.720
 or my personal favorite 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.720
 AUD 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.740
 RÃ¼ther out 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.150
 By the way, that's 51 in all 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
 + The prices have to worry outside 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.540
 but who knows the series but with that and Barney Stinson loves the way I do 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.380
 do 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.630
 Demel these fallen in any case and even if not prince please 11th 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.700
 some use for example you can remember your friends or 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.189
 Had work colleagues 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.429
 or at parties so once to express superiority 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:25.889
 As we can not come the rs6 God will be with 1000 facts about sex 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.419
 very interesting very exciting 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.419
 Pressler 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:41.469
 we can see the commuters are six piglets out of the can 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:43.919
 or even the top ten 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:47.459
 and our own favorites I have no favorites but always 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.539
 is more 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:52.849
 like Erwin sets a saying here who is a little young free 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.470
 and we already found 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.729
 namely the little dead 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:02.269
 for the French, the orgasm Synaptic Timo is the little death 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.649
 very interesting 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:08.229
 So practice this saying that they denounce such facts 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.819
 because here we can evaluate the choice between such a five 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.249
 stars 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:17.429
 After this star leave the rating will be new top ten every day 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:20.389
 compiled we can retrieve here 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.390
 We also have the option 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.929
 Add favorites 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:26.119
 Remove the district again 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:28.919
 determined saying so let favorites annoy 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.619
 and we can also directly send this fact by e-mail to our friends 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:39.759
 or simply we will shake the iPhone a 9 fact on the iPhone 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.439
 Screen open 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.329
 which is very convenient in general is that 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.199
 the individual facts are Diego's order 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.249
 1 to 1000 that means you can give the case I've just made him 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:53.609
 go through published facts 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.889
 Therefore, very clear and yes, in any case, very interesting app 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.249
 which offers a lot of fun and of course the whole potential of 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:03.029
 Stamford with 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:07.989
 for example, if you have a lightly intoxicated audience at parties 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.269
 of these facts here for the best 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.409
 Last but not least, the Terrorist comes to eight times 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.019
 who will put in a process 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.549
 So Achmed went here 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.349
 because they do not know Achmed is a fictional character bit for his 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:24.469
 Doll 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:26.719
 invented by Jeff Dornhelm 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:29.919
 this is a ventriloquist of 8 MB and other figures 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.930
 if again and again the show is on the internet or even around 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.090
 Kanzian stops 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.379
 Achmed is a terrorist 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.759
 Accordingly, the sayings are hers 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.460
 also gets a nasty APA 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.400
 Cost 9 70 cents 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.970
 The sayings here are not so easy to understand, especially if you look at them that way 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.520
 does not know each other 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.409
 because she stormed the top ten 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.089
 I'll show you two of the most famous ones once, of course 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.490
 and the little ones 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.879
 always entertaining 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:11.169
 So if you did not know Achmed you should maybe search on YouTube or 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.419
 otherwise on the internet 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.779
 Delon because the shows of the firs are always very very 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.849
 enjoyable experience and very fun and entertaining 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.509
 Also included here is things to worry about worms 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.430
 very happy very happy 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.039
 you should not take yourself too seriously 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.759
 Altogether there are 61 very funny the share certificates 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.620
 which one is called again and again 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.380
 What forgot to mention the stacks rescued which Brings loud 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.710
 Baxter is the biggest and most successful six of all time 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.600
 Of course, personally, I should not judge now I have to 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.490
 not really 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.540
