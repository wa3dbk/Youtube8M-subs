00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
camping situation so really the best

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.260 
camping situation so really the best
thing<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.680> do<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.399> drop<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:47.940> bit<00:00:48.059> of

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
thing to do is to drop a little bit of

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.660 
thing to do is to drop a little bit of
what<00:00:48.450> you're<00:00:48.600> cooking<00:00:48.840> into<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> hot<00:00:50.129> lard<00:00:50.399> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
what you're cooking into the hot lard to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.130 
what you're cooking into the hot lard to
see<00:00:50.879> what's<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:51.989> up<00:00:52.110> to

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
see what's to see if it's up to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.290 
see what's to see if it's up to
temperature<00:00:52.410> something<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> donuts<00:00:54.120> or

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
temperature something like the donuts or

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000 
temperature something like the donuts or
the<00:00:54.390> fritters<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.199> know<00:00:55.320> they<00:00:55.440> really<00:00:55.649> start

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the fritters you know they really start

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.619 
the fritters you know they really start
to<00:00:56.100> bubble<00:00:56.280> right<00:00:56.610> away<00:00:56.910> if<00:00:57.149> you're<00:00:57.390> at<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
to bubble right away if you're at the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.209 
to bubble right away if you're at the
right<00:00:57.809> temperature<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.800> too<00:00:59.010> hot

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
right temperature and if it's too hot

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.920 
right temperature and if it's too hot
you<00:00:59.250> can<00:00:59.550> tell<00:00:59.760> it's<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.359> cooking<00:01:00.600> way<00:01:00.870> too

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
you can tell it's just cooking way too

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.529 
you can tell it's just cooking way too
fast<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.710> really<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.879> little<00:01:03.149> bit<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.390> your

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
fast so really just a little bit of your

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.540 
fast so really just a little bit of your
dough<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.350> best<00:01:04.589> way<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.979> find<00:01:05.369> out

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
dough is the best way to find out

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.740 
dough is the best way to find out
whether<00:01:05.729> you're<00:01:05.970> at<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.149> right<00:01:06.270> temperature

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
whether you're at the right temperature

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.740 
whether you're at the right temperature
and<00:01:06.899> if<00:01:07.410> it's<00:01:07.560> too<00:01:07.860> hot<00:01:08.190> really<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:08.940> probably

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and if it's too hot really it's probably

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.080 
and if it's too hot really it's probably
easiest<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.380> move<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.680> fire<00:01:10.979> away<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.850> little

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
easiest to move the fire away a little

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.450 
easiest to move the fire away a little
bit<00:01:12.179> rather<00:01:12.509> than<00:01:12.840> move<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.259> hot<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:14.009> pot<00:01:14.250> of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
bit rather than move the hot the pot of

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.520 
bit rather than move the hot the pot of
hot<00:01:14.670> oil

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
hot oil

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.200

mentioned by the widow of Thomas
Dimmesdale<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:28.520> 1800<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.810> we<00:01:30.810> even<00:01:30.990> saw

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
Dimmesdale in 1800 and we even saw

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.660 
Dimmesdale in 1800 and we even saw
another<00:01:32.250> reference<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.840> 1790s<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.710> 1796

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
another reference in the 1790s like 1796

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.789 
another reference in the 1790s like 1796
for<00:01:36.270> donuts<00:01:36.780> both<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.170> these<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.560> non

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
for donuts both of these in a non

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.460 
for donuts both of these in a non
cookbook<00:01:38.700> setting<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:40.110> think<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.439> just

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
cookbook setting and I think that just

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.569 
cookbook setting and I think that just
goes<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.890> show<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:42.290> many<00:01:43.290> repeat<00:01:43.829> recipes<00:01:44.399> if

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
goes to show that many repeat recipes if

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.580 
goes to show that many repeat recipes if
not<00:01:44.759> all<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> recipes<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.200> 18th<00:01:46.560> century

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
not all of the recipes in 18th century

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.819 
not all of the recipes in 18th century
cookbooks<00:01:47.250> are<00:01:47.820> references<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.720> dishes<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
cookbooks are references to dishes that

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.789 
cookbooks are references to dishes that
were<00:01:49.950> already<00:01:50.189> being<00:01:50.880> made<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.590> know

when<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> recipe<00:01:54.720> showing<00:01:55.140> up

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
when we see you know a recipe showing up

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.249 
when we see you know a recipe showing up
in<00:01:55.500> 1800<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.670> that's<00:01:57.030> probably<00:01:57.600> been<00:01:57.869> made

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
in 1800 that that's probably been made

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.350 
in 1800 that that's probably been made
at<00:01:58.439> least<00:01:58.469> 10<00:01:58.979> years<00:01:59.310> prior<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.880> I've<00:02:00.299> got

should it be kept in the refrigerator at

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.250 
should it be kept in the refrigerator at
home<00:02:13.320> or<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.459> transported<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.329> cooler<00:02:15.660> what

home or and transported in a cooler what

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.630 
home or and transported in a cooler what
she's<00:02:16.410> really<00:02:16.560> wanting<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:16.980> know<00:02:17.070> is<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.519> they

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
she's really wanting to know is can they

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.030 
she's really wanting to know is can they
be<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.060> baby<00:02:18.660> stored<00:02:19.019> at<00:02:19.170> room<00:02:19.200> temperature

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
be the baby stored at room temperature

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.610 
be the baby stored at room temperature
and<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:21.030> answer<00:02:21.449> is<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.109> the<00:02:22.260> 18th

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
and the answer is that in the 18th

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.699 
and the answer is that in the 18th
century<00:02:22.820> these<00:02:23.820> boiled<00:02:24.180> puddings<00:02:24.510> were

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
century these boiled puddings were

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.540 
century these boiled puddings were
specifically

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
specifically

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.750 
specifically
many<00:02:27.030> times<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.720> be<00:02:28.100> cooked<00:02:29.100> ahead<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.550> time

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
many times to be cooked ahead of time

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.790 
many times to be cooked ahead of time
and<00:02:30.090> stored<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.780> at<00:02:30.900> room<00:02:31.260> temperature

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
and stored it at room temperature

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.270 
and stored it at room temperature
sometimes<00:02:32.130> for<00:02:32.460> quite<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.790> while<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:34.250> yeah<00:02:35.250> I

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
sometimes for quite a while so yeah I

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.470 
sometimes for quite a while so yeah I
wouldn't<00:02:35.670> worry<00:02:35.880> too<00:02:36.060> much<00:02:36.300> about

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
wouldn't worry too much about

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.480 
wouldn't worry too much about
refrigerating<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.500> then<00:02:37.590> unless<00:02:38.280> you're

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
refrigerating and then unless you're

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.730 
refrigerating and then unless you're
gonna<00:02:38.580> keep<00:02:38.820> them<00:02:39.060> for<00:02:39.240> quite<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.510> while<00:02:39.870> when

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
gonna keep them for quite a while when

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.890 
gonna keep them for quite a while when
they<00:02:40.920> stored<00:02:41.310> him<00:02:41.490> in<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.790> 18th<00:02:42.210> century<00:02:42.570> they

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
they stored him in the 18th century they

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.620 
they stored him in the 18th century they
left<00:02:43.290> them<00:02:43.530> in<00:02:43.740> their<00:02:44.130> pudding<00:02:44.400> bag<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.120> if

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
left them in their pudding bag and if

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.210 
left them in their pudding bag and if
you've<00:02:45.810> made<00:02:45.840> one<00:02:46.320> of<00:02:46.410> these<00:02:46.500> boiled<00:02:46.860> puddings

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
you've made one of these boiled puddings

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.010 
you've made one of these boiled puddings
you<00:02:47.310> know<00:02:47.490> one<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.240> things<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.600> happens

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
you know one of the things that happens

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.040 
you know one of the things that happens
when<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.260> cook<00:02:49.470> them<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.600> suet

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
when you cook them is that the the suet

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.800 
when you cook them is that the the suet
goes<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.920> outside<00:02:53.070> of<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> bag<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.720> it

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
goes to the outside of the bag and it

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.740 
goes to the outside of the bag and it
totally<00:02:55.200> coats<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:56.250> fabric<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.510> if<00:02:57.630> you

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
totally coats that that fabric so if you

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.860 
totally coats that that fabric so if you
don't<00:02:58.110> open<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.310> pudding<00:02:59.730> up<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.330> sort<00:03:00.810> of

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
don't open that pudding up it sort of

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.540 
don't open that pudding up it sort of
seals<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.500> from<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.800> air<00:03:01.980> it's<00:03:02.310> sort<00:03:02.490> of

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
seals it from the air it's sort of

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.280 
seals it from the air it's sort of
hermetically<00:03:03.420> sealed<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.810> they<00:03:03.930> would<00:03:04.080> take

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
hermetically sealed and they would take

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.810 
hermetically sealed and they would take
those<00:03:04.440> puddings<00:03:04.830> they<00:03:04.920> would<00:03:05.040> hang<00:03:05.250> them<00:03:05.460> hang

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
those puddings they would hang them hang

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.960 
those puddings they would hang them hang
them<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:06.240> and<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:08.250> would<00:03:08.400> keep<00:03:08.670> them<00:03:08.910> from

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
them up and that would keep them from

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.700 
them up and that would keep them from
from<00:03:09.800> you<00:03:10.800> know<00:03:10.830> setting<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.810> tight

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
something like that on them the next

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.510 
something like that on them the next
question<00:03:18.240> she<00:03:19.080> asks<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.890> parrot<00:03:20.220> art

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
question she asks is in the parrot art

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.720 
question she asks is in the parrot art
video<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.150> she<00:03:21.690> says<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.410> was<00:03:23.010> wondering<00:03:23.520> if

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
video and she says I was wondering if

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.180 
video and she says I was wondering if
mulberries<00:03:24.540> or<00:03:24.780> sour<00:03:25.050> cherries<00:03:25.710> would<00:03:25.890> work

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
mulberries or sour cherries would work

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.740 
mulberries or sour cherries would work
for<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.000> June<00:03:27.780> or<00:03:28.080> July<00:03:28.700> demonstration<00:03:29.750> you

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
for a June or July demonstration you

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.699 
for a June or July demonstration you
know<00:03:30.870> specifically<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:33.270> sour<00:03:33.510> cherries<00:03:34.020> mole

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
know specifically the sour cherries mole

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.240 
know specifically the sour cherries mole
berries<00:03:35.330> raspberries<00:03:36.330> those<00:03:37.290> fruits<00:03:37.830> do<00:03:38.070> not

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
berries raspberries those fruits do not

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.520 
berries raspberries those fruits do not
have<00:03:38.490> a<00:03:38.520> lot<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.790> pectin<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.420> so<00:03:39.720> they<00:03:39.930> do<00:03:39.990> not

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
have a lot of pectin and so they do not

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.650 
have a lot of pectin and so they do not
gel<00:03:41.250> up<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:42.180> same<00:03:42.480> way<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:43.560> many<00:03:44.280> other

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
gel up the same way that many other

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.870 
gel up the same way that many other
fruits<00:03:45.660> do<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.760> specifically<00:03:48.110> fruits<00:03:49.110> like

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
fruits do and specifically fruits like

fruits do and specifically fruits like
currants<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.600> in<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.350> kind<00:03:52.709> of<00:03:52.770> setting
