00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hi how is studied in poly 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.670
 I'm here in the gym 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.069
 julie space today I'm going to 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.800
 talking about walking is fundamental in the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.380
 feeding although all the meals 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.529
 that you have throughout the day that is 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.289
 breakfast until your last meal all 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.810
 undoubtedly have the most 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.689
 important for me to transform your 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.630
 body is what you carry out just 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.689
 after training the eyes whether 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.940
 you want to gain muscle or burn fat 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.870
 you must carry it out if you want to see 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.879
 results is fundamental how do you know 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.610
 your workouts are only the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.760
 encouragement is when you recover 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.910
 bone feeding by resting that the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.039
 results in the body are going to be given 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.340
 now it says it has a window 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.620
 of opportunity up to 45 minutes later 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.899
 to train to feed us 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.300
 that does not mean we should do 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.390
 wait for our body to receive 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.090
 the nutrients they need I tell you 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.659
 this because they are often seen 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.360
 waiting 30 minutes 45 minutes to 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.460
 just feed yourself so I'm going to 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.440
 recommend that you feed the most 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.619
 soon you can after training 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.119
 for example, bodybuilders 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.909
 Professional fitness models are 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.190
 feed as soon as possible that's 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.560
 what it takes our passing the 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.960
 time I eat immediately 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.600
 after training we do not want 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.330
 delay the recovery process 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.119
 we want to start it as soon as possible 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.800
 as you already know when recovering we are going to 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.210
 get the results that both 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.179
 we want to get in our bodies 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.069
 so from now on, feed yourself 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.470
 sooner than you can after 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.899
 train eating is aware of its 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.770
 huge importance let's move on to the next 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.070
 point 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.200
 what to eat first you must understand that 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.810
 when we finished training our 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.570
 body is ready to absorb the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.700
 nutrients that means that these 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.009
 nutrients will go directly to our 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.060
 muscles and they will not be deposited as 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.250
 grease 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.560
 then before giving us example of the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.519
 after eating I'll give you three rules 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.500
 phases must be liquid must contain 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.430
 proteins and fast carbohydrates 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.549
 absorption and not liquid thanks 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.680
 We need to be digested quickly as 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.019
 imagine a solid meal is delayed 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.610
 much more time to digest and how 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.650
 our body needs the nutrients 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.799
 the fastest is why it is 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.890
 It is recommended that a liquid be liquefied 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:43.890
 For example, it must contain proteins and 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.200
 fast-absorbing carbohydrates there 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.380
 sources of carbohydrates that are absorbed 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.060
 slow in this case we need 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.250
 carbohydrates to be absorbed quickly 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.190
 that's going to be the nutrients that 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.280
 let's consume the proteins enter 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.000
 quickly to our muscles and what 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.890
 another is not serious and because although the 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.709
 fats are fundamental in our 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.200
 feeding would cause a slow 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.540
 absorption of the other nutrients and that 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.050
 is not what we want because we want a 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.900
 fast function so no fats in this 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.530
 food now yes having everything in it 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.780
 I presented 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.660
 next I'm going to mention which ones 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.970
 are the foods that you can consume what 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.430
 first that proteins for example 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.290
 egg whites that yes I recommend you 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.480
 you will be pasteurized these are the 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.060
 sold in bottles also sell 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.519
 powdered egg whites or if you have a 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.800
 protein supplement that is the serum 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.500
 of milk or also known as eggs 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.710
 regarding carbohydrates are the 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.770
 fruit or a fruit juice milk 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.440
 chocolate that is excellent even 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.710
 for me it has proteins are also 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.170
 the rehydrating drinks can finally 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.930
 vary among all the ingredients to 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.400
 consume then train it well now 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.890
 that you already know what the ingredients are 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.020
 that you can use uses those that 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.740
 are your preference, you put them in the 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.840
 blender the vats and inside well that 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.330
 I try today's video I hope that 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.549
 have enjoyed it eat the most 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.549
 soon you can after training and 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.440
 you're going to get excellent results if 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.330
 you want me to personally advise you 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.310
 in your training routines or plans 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.470
 of food among other things to 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.940
 that you achieve the body that both 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.650
 then click on the link below 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.650
 see you there, chao
