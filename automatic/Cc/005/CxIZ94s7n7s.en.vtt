00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.050 
some of the police cars environment test
set<00:02:30.180> isn't<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.660> much<00:02:30.780> detailed<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
set isn't that much detailed so so the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.930 
set isn't that much detailed so so the
game<00:02:33.209> kind<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.570> runs<00:02:33.750> smoothly<00:02:34.050> even<00:02:34.770> on<00:02:35.430> other

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
game kind of runs smoothly even on other

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.250 
game kind of runs smoothly even on other
computers<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.940> yeah<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.480> said<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.900> graphics

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
computers so yeah I said the graphics

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.310 
computers so yeah I said the graphics
have<00:02:40.500> been<00:02:40.709> focused<00:02:41.220> on<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.610> cars<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.320> on

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
have been focused on the cars and on

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.880 
have been focused on the cars and on
everything<00:02:44.160> else<00:02:44.340> except<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.970> environment

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
everything else except the environment

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.449 
everything else except the environment
around<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.900> my<00:02:49.050> opinion<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:50.040> game<00:02:50.220> is

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
around you so in my opinion the game is

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.090 
around you so in my opinion the game is
really<00:02:50.670> great<00:02:50.970> it's<00:02:51.480> kind<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:52.140> difficult<00:02:52.500> at

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
really great it's kind of difficult at

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.699 
really great it's kind of difficult at
times<00:02:53.550> but<00:02:54.180> pretty<00:02:55.050> much<00:02:55.080> playable

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
times but pretty much playable

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.360 
times but pretty much playable
throughout<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.310> whole<00:02:56.459> game<00:02:57.920> with<00:02:58.920> without

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
throughout the whole game with without

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.789 
throughout the whole game with without
much<00:02:59.670> difficulty<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.230> cops<00:03:01.470> can<00:03:01.650> be<00:03:01.769> a

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
much difficulty and the cops can be a

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.660 
much difficulty and the cops can be a
bit<00:03:02.010> difficult<00:03:02.190> at

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
bit difficult at

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.670 
bit difficult at
levels<00:03:04.030> at<00:03:04.870> higher<00:03:05.050> levels<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:07.030> can<00:03:08.020> can

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
levels at higher levels but can can

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.330 
levels at higher levels but can can
easily<00:03:09.010> be<00:03:09.130> passed<00:03:09.430> through<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:12.069> earlier
