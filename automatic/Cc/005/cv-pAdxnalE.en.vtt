00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
action figure it's it's good I wish the

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.120 
action figure it's it's good I wish the

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
HCM probes were in 30 bucks but I got

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.580 
HCM probes were in 30 bucks but I got
some<00:05:59.520> that<00:05:59.970> i'll<00:06:00.120> be<00:06:00.300> reviewing<00:06:00.690> later<00:06:01.260> for

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
some that i'll be reviewing later for

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.750 
some that i'll be reviewing later for
about<00:06:01.830> 23<00:06:02.700> dollars<00:06:03.500> that's<00:06:04.500> a<00:06:04.860> good<00:06:05.100> price<00:06:05.400> but

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
about 23 dollars that's a good price but

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.030 
about 23 dollars that's a good price but
it's<00:06:05.940> still<00:06:06.210> a<00:06:06.270> little<00:06:06.480> expensive<00:06:07.040> these

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
it's still a little expensive these

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.020 
it's still a little expensive these
items<00:06:08.370> have<00:06:08.610> been<00:06:08.910> discontinued<00:06:09.870> I<00:06:10.050> guess

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
items have been discontinued I guess

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:18.140 
items have been discontinued I guess
probably<00:06:12.030> due<00:06:12.750> to<00:06:12.780> their<00:06:13.110> poor<00:06:13.410> sales<00:06:14.630> but<00:06:17.150> i'm

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
probably due to their poor sales but i'm

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.210 
probably due to their poor sales but i'm
sure<00:06:18.210> a<00:06:18.900> lot<00:06:19.170> of<00:06:19.230> people<00:06:19.410> didn't<00:06:19.980> buy<00:06:20.160> these

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
sure a lot of people didn't buy these

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.300 
sure a lot of people didn't buy these
because<00:06:20.760> of<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.210> price<00:06:21.450> I<00:06:21.840> mean<00:06:22.620> for<00:06:23.070> thirty
