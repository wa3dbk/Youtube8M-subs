00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.099
 good morning to everyone another Sunday more in 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.099
 black and decker meets 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.960
 NomÃ¡s us good morning Except that 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.070
 come to introduce us today good morning 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.930
 who wins good morning everyone 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.680
 we are going to present here s black and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.680
 decker the electro closes gk mil 740 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.510
 good to stand out from the tool 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.360
 we can start talking about the engine that 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.010
 it is an 1850 watt motor a very 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.040
 powerful to perform the activity not of 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.960
 the electro saw and about the sword 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.730
 of the lubrication system that you can 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.559
 tell us no more good that is a sword 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.149
 which is 40 centimeters long 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.219
 that allows a wide variety of 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.510
 cuts and how well you named the system 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.340
 lubrication is very important in these 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.230
 tools because it allows the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.480
 chain is lubricated and can perform the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.300
 work in a correct way and we have 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.370
 here a lubrication regulator for 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.510
 that we are going let's go see how 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.250
 is evolving the tool in the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.290
 work depending on the cut we go 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.900
 accelerating or not the system of 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.480
 lubrication 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.490
 and I suppose that this tool 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.340
 be an electro saw will have some 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.140
 security system if you have a system 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.660
 of security that once we 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.040
 we start to start the 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.690
 operation of the machine that we have 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.270
 up this lever e 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.010
 immediately that we cut if 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.350
 with the use of the tool 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.360
 the lever is operated downwards and cuts 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.370
 operating directly more than 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.750
 nothing to protect the user from 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.660
 any problem that may come to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.550
 happen to talk a little more about what 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.770
 which is the sword and the chain we can 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.470
 say it was a speed of 7 meters 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.350
 per second and that when changing 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.720
 what we highlight with black and decker 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.850
 We are looking for it to be manual either one of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.650
 adjusting this knob could go 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.620
 varying from the strength with which it is 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.330
 exposed the sword and we can get it out of 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.070
 a manual way and much more comfortable 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.140
 for the user when using it in 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.130
 your home or to cut some kind of 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.920
 branch and so on 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.420
 Clearly good and what do you think if 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.060
 now let's see how the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.740
 part perfect tool once 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.150
 we have placed the sword the 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.190
 tool we have to remember that 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.330
 we have the manual adjustment to paste it 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.970
 ok to bavaria copala in the tool 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.070
 and we also have on this side a 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.050
 screw that serves us to adjust and 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.820
 tighten the chain remember that the chain 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.250
 It must be designed no more than 5 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.720
 millimeters from the sword is worth 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.520
 emphasize that always inside the tank 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.200
 I think it's the oil we have to have 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.890
 Well lubricated tool for 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.590
 that can meet 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.720
 with the correct function and it does not break 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.430
 to make the cut once put 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.450
 the security elements we have to 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.160
 use teeth and teeth to 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.459
 to be able to work the tool and then 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.930
 this make more precise cut because 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.520
 the tool will be adjusted to 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.900
 trunk dance to the element that we are 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.900
 cutting in this way 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.640
 good as we just saw the 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.439
 tool has behaved 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.180
 correctly in your job and one of the 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.890
 things that numa has caught my attention 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.870
 is that since you can work from 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.180
 different postures and I would like to know 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.709
 why is it so light? 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.139
 lightness handling the 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.120
 tool as well you said the 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.310
 tool is easy to manipulate because 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.750
 has a secondary career and has a 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.489
 ergonomic way that allows us to 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.170
 we manipulate the tool 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.969
 depending on the cut that we're going to 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.870
 effect is very good to highlight that the 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:35.730
 tool because it is a tool 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.189
 comfortable when it comes to work too 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.439
 how to emphasize that we have seen that the 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.239
 time to cut if the chain is working 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.760
 it automatically stops and the machine 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.829
 stop and stop cutting another element of 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.950
 security itself has this tool 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.599
 and about the switches that it has 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.510
 that you can tell us good has a 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.519
 system that is also based for 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.560
 protect the user we activate the 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.599
 switch up and you know that 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.639
 is down turn the tool on once 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.750
 that we let go of the top machine 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.480
 cuts automatically in the 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.340
 clear performance terrific terrific 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.739
 and I do not know if any feature is missing 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.000
 more or you can tell us what in 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.190
 materials can be 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.600
 with the electro saw and the electro wax 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.910
 it performs very well in what it is 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.739
 trunks and wood depending on 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.040
 diameter that we have to take into account 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.660
 the diameter of the sword to cut 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.970
 different types of logs and so on but 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.040
 what is wood its functioning is 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.510
 very correct after everything that we 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.080
 have you told about the tool 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.300
 animal 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.080
 Now tell us where we can get it 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.210
 very well the tool we can 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.100
 get in all the concentres in 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.050
 hypermarkets in the hardware stores more 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.310
 close to your home to highlight that 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.170
 we have the most service network 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.650
 important country and the tool 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.150
 has one year of perfect warranty and another 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.850
 thing else if someone has any doubt 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.950
 wants to contact you where 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.110
 can do it well can you contact 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.300
 our website that is www.la 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.850
 khandaker dotcom score and also 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.400
 We are offering the public courses 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.540
 so they learn to operate the machines 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.990
 which is www of point courses of each point 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.270
 com.ar

 everyone thank you very much numa see you in 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.240
 the next block of black and decker 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.240
 but write to everyone
