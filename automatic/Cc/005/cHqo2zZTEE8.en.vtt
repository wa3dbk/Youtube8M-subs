well I next need to do the outer huge
bounded<00:01:22.890> by<00:01:23.009> these<00:01:23.070> two<00:01:23.369> separate<00:01:23.640> bolts<00:01:23.880> here

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
bounded by these two separate bolts here

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.389 
bounded by these two separate bolts here
is<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> real<00:01:24.539> super<00:01:24.869> tight<00:01:25.080> fit<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.560> these

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
is a real super tight fit and these

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.580 
is a real super tight fit and these
plates<00:01:26.700> are<00:01:26.850> kind<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.180> boat<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.140> little<00:01:28.410> bit

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
plates are kind of boat in a little bit

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.900 
plates are kind of boat in a little bit
let's<00:01:29.070> there<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.430> reasons<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:29.789> you
