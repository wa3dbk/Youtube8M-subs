was a bit easier to test all we did was

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.940 
was a bit easier to test all we did was
put<00:01:27.509> yellow<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.080> final<00:01:28.350> drag<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.710> put<00:01:28.860> my

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
put yellow and final drag and I put my

Lee<00:02:52.109> this<00:02:52.889> myth<00:02:53.099> was<00:02:53.280> actually<00:02:53.519> quite

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
Lee this myth was actually quite

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.430 
Lee this myth was actually quite
difficult<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.269> test<00:02:54.540> as<00:02:54.750> we're<00:02:54.930> not<00:02:55.079> a<00:02:55.139> hundred

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
difficult to test as we're not a hundred

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.589 
difficult to test as we're not a hundred
percent<00:02:55.560> sure<00:02:55.920> if<00:02:56.190> we<00:02:56.579> flashed<00:02:56.909> correctly<00:02:57.450> or

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
percent sure if we flashed correctly or

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.569 
percent sure if we flashed correctly or
not<00:02:57.629> but<00:02:58.109> taking<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.709> scenarios<00:02:59.159> that<00:02:59.190> we<00:02:59.310> did

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
not but taking the scenarios that we did

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.729 
not but taking the scenarios that we did
do<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.060> slowing<00:03:00.629> it<00:03:00.720> down<00:03:00.780> in<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.409> scenario

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
do and slowing it down in this scenario

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.319 
do and slowing it down in this scenario
you<00:03:01.889> can<00:03:02.010> see<00:03:02.159> a<00:03:02.190> guy<00:03:02.340> hit<00:03:02.549> by<00:03:02.639> the<00:03:02.700> wild<00:03:03.030> cards

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
you can see a guy hit by the wild cards

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.629 
you can see a guy hit by the wild cards
i<00:03:03.389> flash<00:03:03.750> backwards<00:03:04.409> just<00:03:04.950> before<00:03:05.340> they<00:03:05.459> hit

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
i flash backwards just before they hit

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.220 
i flash backwards just before they hit
me<00:03:05.790> again<00:03:06.090> but<00:03:06.329> this<00:03:06.540> time<00:03:06.780> they<00:03:06.900> just<00:03:07.079> simply

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
me again but this time they just simply

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.259 
me again but this time they just simply
go<00:03:07.440> through<00:03:07.680> me<00:03:07.859> however<00:03:08.340> we<00:03:08.519> also<00:03:08.700> tested<00:03:09.150> it

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
go through me however we also tested it

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.240 
go through me however we also tested it
with<00:03:09.359> other<00:03:09.569> projectiles<00:03:10.230> just<00:03:10.620> in<00:03:10.769> case<00:03:10.920> TF

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
with other projectiles just in case TF

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.979 
with other projectiles just in case TF
wild<00:03:11.519> cards<00:03:11.819> were<00:03:11.940> special<00:03:12.359> case<00:03:12.540> in<00:03:12.780> this

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
wild cards were special case in this

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.690 
wild cards were special case in this
example<00:03:13.379> we<00:03:13.620> used<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.829> piercing<00:03:14.220> arrow<00:03:14.430> of

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
example we used the piercing arrow of

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.610 
example we used the piercing arrow of
varus<00:03:15.090> as<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.480> can<00:03:15.599> see<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.930> Ezreal<00:03:16.260> gets<00:03:16.409> hit

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
varus as you can see the Ezreal gets hit

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.470 
varus as you can see the Ezreal gets hit
he<00:03:16.739> flashes<00:03:17.159> ahead<00:03:17.370> just<00:03:17.670> in<00:03:17.849> time<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.329> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
he flashes ahead just in time and the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.789 
he flashes ahead just in time and the
arrows<00:03:18.810> simply<00:03:19.109> goes<00:03:19.290> through<00:03:19.530> him<00:03:19.680> the

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
arrows simply goes through him the

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.439 
arrows simply goes through him the
second<00:03:20.099> time<00:03:20.129> he<00:03:20.699> does<00:03:20.849> not<00:03:21.030> get<00:03:21.239> hit<00:03:21.419> again

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
second time he does not get hit again

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.629 
second time he does not get hit again
but<00:03:22.260> since<00:03:22.379> we<00:03:22.590> want<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.889> ensure<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.190> we<00:03:23.310> try

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
but since we want to ensure that we try

but since we want to ensure that we try
and<00:03:23.819> test<00:03:23.970> as<00:03:24.120> many<00:03:24.329> cases<00:03:24.690> as<00:03:24.810> we<00:03:24.930> can<00:03:25.169> and<00:03:25.379> we

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
and test as many cases as we can and we

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.319 
and test as many cases as we can and we
weren't<00:03:25.739> sure<00:03:25.889> if<00:03:26.280> we<00:03:26.310> actually<00:03:26.879> flash<00:03:27.120> in

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
weren't sure if we actually flash in

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.210 
weren't sure if we actually flash in
time<00:03:27.510> for<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.750> other<00:03:27.930> ones<00:03:28.199> with<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.739> one<00:03:29.010> more
