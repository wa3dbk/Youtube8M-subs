session<00:00:45.870> itself<00:00:47.989> yes<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.469> was<00:00:49.829> kind<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.250> hoping

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
session itself yes I was kind of hoping

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.830 
session itself yes I was kind of hoping
that<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:50.879> would<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.149> able<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.329> post<00:00:51.600> for

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
that they would be able to post for

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.779 
that they would be able to post for
50-plus<00:00:52.469> because<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.250> gives<00:00:53.489> them<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
50-plus because that really gives them a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.250 
50-plus because that really gives them a
little<00:00:54.000> bit<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.239> leeway<00:00:54.510> as<00:00:54.809> well<00:00:55.020> because

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
little bit of leeway as well because

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.779 
little bit of leeway as well because
this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.469> still<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.829> good<00:00:56.039> pitch<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> baton

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
this is still a good pitch to baton

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.790 
this is still a good pitch to baton
there's<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.180> little<00:00:57.420> extra<00:00:57.690> bounce<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:58.710> you

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
there's a little extra bounce but if you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.380 
there's a little extra bounce but if you
play<00:00:58.980> through<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> line<00:00:59.520> if<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.910> are<00:01:00.090> able<00:01:00.239> to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
play through the line if you are able to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.939 
play through the line if you are able to
get<00:01:00.539> behind<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> line<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.350> ball<00:01:01.530> as<00:01:01.710> deep

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.469 
Smith has shown then you can get some
runs<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.070> if<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.030> cushion<00:01:06.270> of

those<00:01:06.630> extra<00:01:06.869> 50<00:01:07.260> 70<00:01:07.650> runs<00:01:07.920> then<00:01:08.580> even<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.330> you

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
those extra 50 70 runs then even if you

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.940

runs<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.590> that<00:04:22.070> can<00:04:22.280> be<00:04:22.310> a<00:04:22.430> bit<00:04:22.610> of<00:04:22.640> a<00:04:22.789> problem

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820

that is something

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.140 
that is something
you<00:04:24.530> need<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:24.830> tighten<00:04:25.070> up<00:04:25.250> in<00:04:25.460> fact<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:26.060> think

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
you need to tighten up in fact I think

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150 
you need to tighten up in fact I think
when<00:04:26.720> he's<00:04:26.960> bowling<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.470> way<00:04:27.560> he<00:04:27.770> is<00:04:27.830> he<00:04:28.040> needs

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
when he's bowling the way he is he needs

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.380 
when he's bowling the way he is he needs
to<00:04:28.370> be<00:04:28.490> given<00:04:28.670> a<00:04:28.850> little<00:04:29.000> more<00:04:29.240> protection

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
to be given a little more protection

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.480 
to be given a little more protection
towards<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:30.440> straight<00:04:30.710> aside<00:04:31.070> because<00:04:31.250> it

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
towards the straight aside because it

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.460 
towards the straight aside because it
tends<00:04:31.640> to<00:04:31.730> bowl<00:04:31.940> full<00:04:32.240> so<00:04:32.480> more<00:04:33.080> often<00:04:33.350> than

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
tends to bowl full so more often than

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.380 
tends to bowl full so more often than
not<00:04:33.530> batsman<00:04:34.100> hit<00:04:34.280> him<00:04:34.430> around<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.090> Madonna

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.880

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.480 
best field as in instead of the bowlers

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
little bit tired little bit slow if he

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.780 
little bit tired little bit slow if he

Brad Haddin now in that context would

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.610 
Brad Haddin now in that context would
you<00:05:07.970> say<00:05:08.150> that<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.390> Indian<00:05:08.750> bowlers<00:05:08.930> need<00:05:09.470> to

you say that the Indian bowlers need to

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.170

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
put up a performance on day three almost

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.060 
put up a performance on day three almost
like<00:05:11.510> the<00:05:11.630> one<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:12.140> Aussies<00:05:12.560> did<00:05:12.770> early<00:05:13.040> on

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
like the one the Aussies did early on

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.140 
like the one the Aussies did early on
day<00:05:13.280> two<00:05:15.220> yes<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.550> I<00:05:16.610> think<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:16.880> Aussies

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
day two yes and I think the Aussies

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.970 
day two yes and I think the Aussies
learned<00:05:17.390> from<00:05:17.570> what<00:05:17.780> they<00:05:18.350> had<00:05:18.470> done<00:05:18.650> the

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
learned from what they had done the

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.350 
learned from what they had done the
previous<00:05:19.190> day<00:05:19.490> when<00:05:19.670> they<00:05:19.790> bowled<00:05:19.970> far<00:05:20.210> too

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
previous day when they bowled far too

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.840 
previous day when they bowled far too
short<00:05:20.660> hazelwood<00:05:21.560> got<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.920> ball<00:05:22.430> around<00:05:22.700> the

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
short hazelwood got the ball around the

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.090 
short hazelwood got the ball around the
off-stump<00:05:23.270> got<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:23.930> ball<00:05:24.080> to<00:05:24.260> move<00:05:24.470> and<00:05:24.740> I

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
off-stump got the ball to move and I

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.470 
off-stump got the ball to move and I
think<00:05:25.310> that<00:05:25.400> is<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.550> area<00:05:25.730> that<00:05:25.880> India<00:05:26.240> really

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
think that is the area that India really

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.200 
think that is the area that India really
need<00:05:26.660> to<00:05:26.810> look<00:05:26.960> at<00:05:27.610> hazelwood<00:05:28.610> is<00:05:28.730> not<00:05:28.880> pulling

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
need to look at hazelwood is not pulling

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.880 
need to look at hazelwood is not pulling
any<00:05:29.360> quicker<00:05:29.630> than<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:29.960> Indians<00:05:30.560> are<00:05:30.680> bowling

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
any quicker than the Indians are bowling

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.520 
any quicker than the Indians are bowling
