00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
well you know LTE has got the fastest

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.149 
well you know LTE has got the fastest
speeds<00:00:57.330> around<00:00:57.720> but<00:00:58.290> I<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.650> to<00:00:58.799> tell<00:00:59.040> you

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159 
speeds around but I have to tell you

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.640 
speeds around but I have to tell you
that<00:00:59.400> the<00:00:59.580> first<00:01:00.000> handful<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.659> times<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.589> I

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
that the first handful of times that I

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.609 
that the first handful of times that I
tested<00:01:02.010> an<00:01:02.339> LTE<00:01:02.790> phone<00:01:03.180> versus<00:01:03.720> a<00:01:03.750> WiMAX<00:01:04.350> phone

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
tested an LTE phone versus a WiMAX phone

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.789 
tested an LTE phone versus a WiMAX phone
the<00:01:05.159> WiMAX<00:01:05.729> phone<00:01:06.000> actually<00:01:06.659> had<00:01:06.930> faster

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the WiMAX phone actually had faster

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.219 
the WiMAX phone actually had faster
download<00:01:08.189> speeds<00:01:08.220> from<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> internet<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.780> it

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
download speeds from the internet so it

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.679 
download speeds from the internet so it
can<00:01:10.530> go<00:01:10.770> either<00:01:11.039> way<00:01:11.219> I<00:01:11.429> know<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.450> some<00:01:12.659> of

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
can go either way I know that some of

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.389 
can go either way I know that some of
you<00:01:12.780> aren't<00:01:13.229> gonna<00:01:13.350> believe<00:01:13.439> me<00:01:13.859> but<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.070> tell

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
you aren't gonna believe me but I tell

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.760 
you aren't gonna believe me but I tell
you<00:01:14.549> I've<00:01:14.759> seen<00:01:14.789> it<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.390> my<00:01:15.450> own<00:01:15.600> eyes<00:01:15.990> both

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you I've seen it with my own eyes both

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.590 
you I've seen it with my own eyes both
of<00:01:16.979> these<00:01:17.130> networks<00:01:17.369> are<00:01:17.729> fast<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.359> can

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
of these networks are fast and you can

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.240 
of these networks are fast and you can
never<00:01:18.869> predict<00:01:19.350> which<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.039> to<00:01:20.100> be

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
never predict which one is going to be

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.179 
never predict which one is going to be
the<00:01:20.399> fastest<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.479> they<00:01:22.229> match<00:01:22.560> up<00:01:22.829> these<00:01:23.009> two

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the fastest so they match up these two

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.370 
the fastest so they match up these two
phones<00:01:23.429> match<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.960> many<00:01:25.109> ways

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
phones match up just in so many ways

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.960 
Touch if that's what you want to do so
the<00:04:16.169> I<00:04:16.200> think<00:04:16.530> that<00:04:16.799> that<00:04:17.070> is<00:04:17.220> an<00:04:17.370> advantage<00:04:17.820> in

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
the I think that that is an advantage in

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.599 
the I think that that is an advantage in
favor<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.959> Epic<00:04:19.289> 4G<00:04:19.320> Touch<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:20.160> it<00:04:20.310> gets<00:04:20.489> a

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
favor of the Epic 4G Touch so it gets a

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.060 
favor of the Epic 4G Touch so it gets a
three-pointer<00:04:21.209> with<00:04:21.359> that<00:04:21.599> one<00:04:21.810> so<00:04:22.590> there<00:04:22.919> you

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
three-pointer with that one so there you
