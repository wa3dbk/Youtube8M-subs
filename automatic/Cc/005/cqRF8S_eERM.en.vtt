00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.050
 mouth was champion of the metropolitan 76 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.580
 but I can never beat him river 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.040
 tied twice and we will lose this time 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.260
 on the cooper cold day 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.610
 with a fly a marked head side 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.990
 in the first instance for perfume 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.240
 the referee who clearly marks 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.410
 havelange with infraction the offside 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.000
 actually a position that 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.620
 supposedly obstructed there was issue that 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.990
 here comes out playing on the right after 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.270
 a little while later the revenge would come 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.980
 for the great roberto free kick 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.510
 matters has hands folded in the 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.640
 I try tarantines to take the ball out of the 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.520
 river fund was winning once again in the 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.080
 my champion in one year 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.080
 could not with river 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.019
 and I think it was not definitive 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.809
 procedural party 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.120
 it's true I think he played with 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.140
 too much brand too many too many 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.720
 infractions cut to the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.860
 the game in many opportunities 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.220
 any way I think the one who did 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.200
 a goal to the victory river won did the 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.729
 goal I can speculate through science 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.590
 while then well I think it went well 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:14.540
 mouth could not reach your head what was 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.479
 the clearest possibility and a town of 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.640
 more did not disturb anything except a play 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.520
 but 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.740
 of three quarters of court practically 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 I think I do not know if it 's deserved or not 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.320
 this case 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.700
 someone assured in the audience and in 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.940
 different sectors of the field that river 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:39.040
 came to find a point is true 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:42.310
 no no you do not know 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.990
 is a team with a score of 0 to 0 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.120
 surely it will lose 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.730
 because the temperament team 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.920
 offensive and it is clear by their 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.940
 players by their way of playing is the 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.920
 way it is planted is 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.380
 practically plays with two flyers and 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.200
 four attackers so he can not get out 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.600
 he can not go out and speculate because he's going 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.040
 clear disadvantage that for us was 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.040
 good business victory 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.000
 Juan Carlos Lorenzo continues the streak 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.739
 adverse to mouth not by the result in 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.150
 yes but because of the injuries because of 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.099
 soon a man has to change 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.970
 when he had not finished the 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.680
 first time I had good if today the 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.800
 true that we have not had luck for 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.730
 that 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:32.530
 it's not a matter of excuses the team played 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.500
 well the team attacked permanently not 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.870
 it happened 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.550
 How do you teach the election to Pernia 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.630
 I have to bring in a young boy 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.420
 also tip marker that does not walk 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.200
 wrong but logically it's not always the 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.860
 headline forward we had the speed 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.780
 of the two pointers 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.190
 the match was prepared in this way 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.820
 taking into account the difficulties that 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.510
 I had river 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.830
 the absence of comedy the absence of 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.410
 left tip marker was going to 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.870
 move to the right 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.090
 the absence also of pain gives me with the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.090
 feeling that we could win by taking 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.660
 to garcía cambón up accompanying 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.140
 tavern and 2.0 say attack to not give it 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.130
 the ball to river and not to suffer the 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.910
 strength of the one who leases offensively 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.630
 what is gonzález luque dimas and also 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.930
 alonso we have tried all this we have 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.100
 tried but sometimes not the center 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.930
 our game had two occasions 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.880
 very clear a front but safe 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.060
 opinion and the other that also this support 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.340
 it crossed the shoot but it did not have the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.080
 clarity to answer ngozi because 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.300
 I would have scored all the goals 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.330
 I say two but one possibly backwards 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:52.590
 I would have armed because it was loose 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:55.070
 everyone but he knew how to take advantage of 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.070
 free throw 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:08.990
 and like all of them many times I said no 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.990
 there is for the worst 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.340
 logically then I say 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.290
 mouth deserved a result you want 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.889
 point yes I now understand a part 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:26.479
 and by card is a card by the 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.400
 will that he put to mouth by the 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.380
 triumphant dresses by the way that 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.880
 he came to the one that deserved a draw 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:39.280
 possibly but the same is 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:42.050
 psychologically but I understand that this 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.889
 circumstance that could have given us a goal 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.070
 in your favor 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:50.020
 Anyway this campus is fine 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.810
 he realized he worked for the crime 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.650
 but he had no luck let's hope that we 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.650
 give the next game
