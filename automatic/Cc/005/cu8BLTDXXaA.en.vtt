00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.150
 kids two or three years can not long 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.880
 focus on one thing they 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.100
 get tired and distracted so games 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:28.810
 at that age should be short and 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:30.849

 even arrange competitions and after that 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.910
 the balls will recount 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.360

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.190
 individual groups and ask the child to find 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.050
 desired item 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.629
 if the baby was wrong we say thank you 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.270
 big for a yellow spoon but let's still 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.530

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.810
 learn to recognize colors and now 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.060

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.729
 listen to how ticking watch and 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.920
 repeat then knocking with spoons each from 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.619
 friend open and close the door 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.580

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.570
 can you hear now 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.970
 dealt with color sounds now 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.550
