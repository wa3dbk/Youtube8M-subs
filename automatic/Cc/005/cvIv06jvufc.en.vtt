00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 Hello everyone and you a sweetheart today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:11.460
 let's talk about why there is no water 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.679
 our aquariums are properly equipped 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.869
 and a well-kept aquarium will stand 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.930
 few years do not require a change of water 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.330
 must be observed in the aquarium 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:29.269
 biological balance of each individual 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.269
 fish need their own amount of water 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:38.219
 it is recommended to put lepic in the aquarium 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.059
 they eat well the leftovers without giving 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.059
 zagnit water 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.070
 it is necessary to make a diet 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.070
 power supply 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.489
 best of which is the joker 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:57.559
 the pipemaker carriages happily rate is 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.199
 5 worms a day for every adult would 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.870
 be eaten food must within 15 minutes 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.439
 she should not linger further in 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.820
 aquarium otherwise it closes because of 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.610
 it is necessary to use 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:17.070
 and begins to grow turbid if the aquarium 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.070
 tolerable or small 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.060
 plants in the aquarium will accumulate 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.990
 decay products which will serve 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.990
 excellent breeding food 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.979
 also water can lift due to the presence and 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:41.130
 distribution of days of large numbers 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:43.439
 bacteria which they are very 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:51.180
 ridley king of fish so for your 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:53.579
 plant bacteria will appear due 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.140
 improper feeding or overly 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.630
 tight fit or also help water 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.000
 maybe not because of the fact that beginners 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.590
 aquarists begin to change completely 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.370
 during the course of the substitution of a lot of blood on you 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.270
 this all with you was a jackal block
