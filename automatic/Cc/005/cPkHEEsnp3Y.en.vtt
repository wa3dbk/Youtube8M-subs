00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.370
 to me 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.000
 hello again here I bring you a new 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.000
 video is good and well, this one is going to 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.400
 be of the blushes that I have of more os 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.800
 I will teach the color as I do with the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.099
 shadows beat him on the finger in his hand 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.290
 and in the face so you can see it a 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.700
 little better because you already know the lights 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.439
 and others eat a little the colors 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.630
 I'm going to put it pretty strong cited as 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.110
 go and now I have one and it's pretty 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.750
 strong 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.250
 I personally would not take it if I'm from 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.490
 bring more colors a little more 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.350
 soft 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.260
 but so you can see a little bit 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.850
 better how it is I'm going to put a 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.580
 little bit strong little bit 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.920
 understand that for the video that is not 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.570
 so you can see it a little better 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.730
 because it's like they put it on me 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.410
 I put them almost barely perceive is the 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.150
 color that remains on the skin itself 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.180
 you want to keep it in mind my tone is more 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.940
 it's a nw 20, that's enough 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.410
 clarita all the soft ones are two or in the 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.690
 information box I leave a link 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.240
 The blog is valid for you to see the photos of 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.220
 those of the products that I teach you so much 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.440
 shadows as colors worth something and the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.030
 review defining those products too 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.740
 I found it on the blog so nothing 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.740
 I wind up May I leave you with the 8 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.940
 to 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.630

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.630

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.740
 to 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.090

 and good here you have the video discarding 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.239
 the colors of scenes I hope there's 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.250
 I have served you to see colors 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.250
 if you do not have a tent to swim nearby and 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.349

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.530
