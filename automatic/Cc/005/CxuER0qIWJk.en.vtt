hello<00:00:00.450> everyone<00:00:00.840> and<00:00:00.870> welcome<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.530> this

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
hello everyone and welcome to this

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.050 
hello everyone and welcome to this
week's<00:00:02.010> video<00:00:02.190> today<00:00:02.730> I'm<00:00:02.790> going<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.970> be

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
week's video today I'm going to be

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.510 
week's video today I'm going to be
talking<00:00:03.240> about<00:00:03.389> rotational<00:00:04.140> inertia<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.740> how

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
talking about rotational inertia and how

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.880 
talking about rotational inertia and how
rotational<00:00:06.210> inertia<00:00:06.299> affects<00:00:07.049> acceleration

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
rotational inertia affects acceleration

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.720 
rotational inertia affects acceleration
so<00:00:08.880> an<00:00:09.630> object's<00:00:10.260> moment<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.830> inertia<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.519> its

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
so an object's moment of inertia is its

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.209 
so an object's moment of inertia is its
resistance<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.480> changing<00:00:13.139> angular<00:00:13.469> velocity

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
resistance to changing angular velocity

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.890 
resistance to changing angular velocity
so<00:00:14.759> an<00:00:14.880> example<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.420> an<00:00:15.540> automotive

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
so an example in an automotive

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.680 
so an example in an automotive
application<00:00:16.650> for<00:00:17.160> example<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.640> flywheel<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.660> a

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
application for example a flywheel so a

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.170 
application for example a flywheel so a
flywheels<00:00:19.439> moment<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:19.980> inertia<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.640> its

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
flywheels moment of inertia is its

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.470 
flywheels moment of inertia is its
resistance<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:22.020> changing<00:00:22.529> RPM<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.789> if<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.210> have

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
resistance to changing RPM so if I have

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.820 
resistance to changing RPM so if I have
a<00:00:24.510> flywheel<00:00:24.930> has<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.140> high<00:00:25.380> moment<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.740> inertia

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
a flywheel has a high moment of inertia

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.279 
a flywheel has a high moment of inertia
when<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.640> press<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> gas<00:00:27.150> pedal<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.900> takes<00:00:28.140> it

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
when you press the gas pedal it takes it

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.529 
when you press the gas pedal it takes it
a<00:00:28.349> longer<00:00:28.680> time<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.460> RPM<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.000> build<00:00:30.240> of

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
a longer time for the RPM to build of

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.130 
a longer time for the RPM to build of
your<00:00:30.779> engine<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:32.099> have<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.550> lower<00:00:33.180> moment

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
your engine if you have a lower moment

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.590 
your engine if you have a lower moment
of<00:00:34.200> inertia<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.620> flywheel<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:36.120> floor<00:00:36.450> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
of inertia of flywheel and you floor it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.209 
of inertia of flywheel and you floor it
in<00:00:36.750> your<00:00:36.960> engine<00:00:37.380> then<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:37.860> going<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.040> take<00:00:38.160> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
in your engine then it's going to take a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.080 
in your engine then it's going to take a
shorter<00:00:38.550> amount<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.820> time

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
shorter amount of time

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.900 
shorter amount of time
in<00:00:39.270> order<00:00:39.809> for<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> RPM<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.590> build<00:00:40.800> its<00:00:41.760> it's

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
in order for the RPM to build its it's

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.110 
in order for the RPM to build its it's
resistance<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.660> changing<00:00:43.110> our<00:00:43.290> p.m.<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.760> once

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
resistance to changing our p.m. so once

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.389 
resistance to changing our p.m. so once
again<00:00:45.239> higher<00:00:45.600> means<00:00:45.989> more<00:00:46.320> resistance<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.280> if

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
again higher means more resistance so if

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.670 
again higher means more resistance so if
you<00:00:47.489> take<00:00:47.670> two<00:00:47.910> cylinders<00:00:48.629> here<00:00:49.020> and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
you take two cylinders here and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.350 
you take two cylinders here and
basically<00:00:50.250> automotive<00:00:50.850> applications

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
basically automotive applications

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.920 
basically automotive applications
everything<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:51.989> really<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.370> represented<00:00:53.370> by

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
everything can really be represented by

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.380 
everything can really be represented by
cylinders<00:00:54.930> almost<00:00:55.530> all<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.820> applications

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
cylinders almost all of the applications

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.700 
cylinders almost all of the applications
within<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> car<00:00:57.989> where<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> would<00:00:58.530> have

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
within a car where you would have

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.939 
within a car where you would have
rotational<00:00:59.399> inertia<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:01.590> moment<00:01:01.890> of

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
rotational inertia so the moment of

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.740 
rotational inertia so the moment of
inertia<00:01:02.219> for<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.609> cylinder<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.270> represented<00:01:03.719> by

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
inertia for a cylinder is represented by

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.730 
inertia for a cylinder is represented by
the<00:01:03.870> equation<00:01:03.989> y<00:01:04.979> equals<00:01:05.610> one-half<00:01:06.060> mass

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
the equation y equals one-half mass

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.679 
the equation y equals one-half mass
times<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.100> radius<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.299> outer<00:01:09.450> radius

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
times the radius the outer radius

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.620 
times the radius the outer radius
squared<00:01:10.110> plus<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> inner<00:01:11.040> radius<00:01:11.400> squared<00:01:11.630> so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
squared plus the inner radius squared so

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
squared plus the inner radius squared so
for<00:01:13.080> example<00:01:13.470> we've<00:01:13.560> got<00:01:13.590> these<00:01:13.890> two<00:01:14.159> here

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
for example we've got these two here

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.550 
for example we've got these two here
these<00:01:15.000> two<00:01:15.270> cylinders<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> solid

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
these two cylinders this is a solid

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.280 
these two cylinders this is a solid
cylinder<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.610> mass<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.299> whatever<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.170> can

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
cylinder of a mass and whatever we can

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.130 
cylinder of a mass and whatever we can
just<00:01:19.409> say<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.680> 200<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.479> one<00:01:21.689> here

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
just say it's 200 and then this one here

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.270 
just say it's 200 and then this one here
has<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:23.100> same<00:01:23.460> mass<00:01:23.700> 200<00:01:24.330> whatever<00:01:24.780> units

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
has that same mass 200 whatever units

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.090 
has that same mass 200 whatever units
and<00:01:26.990> because<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.229> hollowed<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
and because it's hollowed out in the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.740 
and because it's hollowed out in the
center<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.610> has<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> higher<00:01:30.299> moment<00:01:30.540> of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
center and has a higher moment of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.630 
center and has a higher moment of
inertia<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.470> these<00:01:31.590> objects<00:01:32.070> are<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> exact

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
inertia so these objects are the exact

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.499 
inertia so these objects are the exact
same<00:01:32.820> dimensions

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
same dimensions

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.330 
same dimensions
this<00:01:33.810> one's<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.110> hollowed<00:01:34.590> out<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.979> they're

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
this one's just hollowed out and they're

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.179 
this one's just hollowed out and they're
both<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.520> same<00:01:35.700> weight<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.960> what<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.950> means

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
both the same weight so what it means

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.499 
both the same weight so what it means
that<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:38.670> has<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> higher<00:01:39.060> moment<00:01:39.299> of

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
that this one has a higher moment of

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.719 
that this one has a higher moment of
inertia<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.799> more<00:01:41.100> difficult<00:01:41.549> for

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
inertia is and it's more difficult for

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.210 
inertia is and it's more difficult for
this<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:43.049> rotate<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.530> resists<00:01:43.860> change

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
this one to rotate it resists change

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.580 
this one to rotate it resists change
more<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.659> if<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.930> were<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.140> take<00:01:46.290> both<00:01:46.560> of

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
more so if you were to take both of

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.770 
more so if you were to take both of
these<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.189> put<00:01:47.460> them<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.790> top<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.240> hill<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
these and put them on top of a hill and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.929 
these and put them on top of a hill and
let<00:01:49.170> them<00:01:49.320> roll<00:01:49.470> down<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.610> would<00:01:50.759> reach

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
let them roll down this one would reach

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.940 
let them roll down this one would reach
the<00:01:51.180> bottom<00:01:51.329> first<00:01:51.780> because<00:01:52.409> it's<00:01:52.560> moment<00:01:52.920> of

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
the bottom first because it's moment of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.999 
the bottom first because it's moment of
inertia<00:01:53.360> is<00:01:54.360> less<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> wouldn't<00:01:55.710> resist

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
inertia is less so it wouldn't resist

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.819 
inertia is less so it wouldn't resist
gravity<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.909> would<00:01:57.030> rotate<00:01:57.329> quicker<00:01:57.829> now

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
gravity and it would rotate quicker now

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.399 
gravity and it would rotate quicker now
that's<00:01:59.490> kind<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.790> difficult<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.420> comprehend

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
that's kind of difficult to comprehend

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.950 
that's kind of difficult to comprehend
why<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.820> way<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.180> kind<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.450> sorted<00:02:03.810> out

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
why so the way that I kind of sorted out

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.479 
why so the way that I kind of sorted out
my<00:02:04.140> head<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.670> with<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.850> example<00:02:06.299> here<00:02:06.719> so

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
my head is with this example here so

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.249 
my head is with this example here so
here<00:02:08.489> we've<00:02:08.640> got<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.879> bicycle<00:02:09.629> tire

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
here we've got a bicycle tire

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.320 
here we've got a bicycle tire
basically<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.039> all<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.580> weight<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.239> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
basically so all of the weight is on the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.050 
basically so all of the weight is on the
very<00:02:12.480> outside<00:02:13.019> edge<00:02:13.409> of<00:02:13.799> this<00:02:14.310> bicycle<00:02:14.730> tire

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
very outside edge of this bicycle tire

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.270 
very outside edge of this bicycle tire
and<00:02:15.360> then<00:02:16.170> there's<00:02:16.349> pretty<00:02:16.530> much<00:02:16.590> nothing<00:02:16.950> in

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
and then there's pretty much nothing in

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.610 
and then there's pretty much nothing in
the<00:02:17.370> center<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.849> then<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.720> second<00:02:19.140> object<00:02:19.290> we

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
the center and then the second object we

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.559 
the center and then the second object we
have<00:02:19.799> is<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.640> bicycle<00:02:20.790> tire<00:02:21.269> it's<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
have is like the bicycle tire it's the

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.929 
have is like the bicycle tire it's the
exact<00:02:21.870> same<00:02:21.900> dimension<00:02:22.650> except<00:02:23.430> instead<00:02:23.790> of

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
exact same dimension except instead of

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.789 
exact same dimension except instead of
that<00:02:24.180> tire<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.810> outside<00:02:25.140> edge<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:25.560> just

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
that tire on the outside edge it's just

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.069 
that tire on the outside edge it's just
a<00:02:25.920> metal<00:02:26.189> ramp<00:02:26.400> basically<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.629> metal<00:02:27.900> ring

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
a metal ramp basically just a metal ring

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.920 
a metal ramp basically just a metal ring
going<00:02:28.349> around<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.829> tire<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.450> in<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.569> center

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
going around that tire and in the center

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.920 
going around that tire and in the center
of<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.319> you've<00:02:31.829> got<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:32.400> disc<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.510> that's

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
of that you've got a disc and that's

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.199 
of that you've got a disc and that's
where<00:02:34.170> all<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.349> mass<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.829> so<00:02:35.190> like<00:02:35.819> I've<00:02:36.000> drawn

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
where all the mass is so like I've drawn

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.789 
where all the mass is so like I've drawn
here<00:02:36.450> you've<00:02:36.569> got<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.870> disc<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.440> center

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
here you've got that disc in the center

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.649 
here you've got that disc in the center
and<00:02:38.010> that's<00:02:38.459> where<00:02:38.640> all<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.760> mass<00:02:38.879> is<00:02:39.120> now<00:02:39.569> the

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
and that's where all the mass is now the

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.149 
and that's where all the mass is now the
thing<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.140> note<00:02:40.349> about<00:02:40.379> both<00:02:40.829> of<00:02:40.859> these<00:02:41.099> is

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
thing to note about both of these is

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.039 
thing to note about both of these is
they're<00:02:41.849> both<00:02:42.060> going<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.690> exact

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
they're both going to have the exact

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.960 
they're both going to have the exact
same<00:02:43.079> mass<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.920> they're<00:02:44.310> both<00:02:44.430> going<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.790> have

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
same mass and they're both going to have

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.089 
same mass and they're both going to have
the<00:02:45.060> exact<00:02:45.359> same<00:02:45.390> diameter<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.920> only

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
the exact same diameter the only

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.619 
the exact same diameter the only
difference<00:02:47.459> between<00:02:47.579> them<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.060> going<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.480> be

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
difference between them is going to be

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.530 
difference between them is going to be
their<00:02:49.260> moment<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.280> inertia<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.849> these<00:02:51.389> two

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
their moment of inertia of these two

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.770 
their moment of inertia of these two
objects<00:02:51.959> so<00:02:52.889> the<00:02:53.010> way<00:02:53.129> I<00:02:53.159> kind<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.670> see<00:02:53.909> why

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
objects so the way I kind of see why

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.210 
objects so the way I kind of see why
would<00:02:55.019> this<00:02:55.170> one<00:02:55.230> reach<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.769> bottom<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.129> the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
would this one reach the bottom of the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.670 
would this one reach the bottom of the
hill<00:02:56.370> faster<00:02:56.639> than<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.180> why<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:57.930> its<00:02:58.260> moment

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
hill faster than this why is its moment

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.979 
hill faster than this why is its moment
of<00:02:58.709> inertia<00:02:58.799> lower<00:02:59.280> well<00:02:59.909> look<00:03:00.090> about<00:03:00.299> look<00:03:00.840> at

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
of inertia lower well look about look at

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.800 
of inertia lower well look about look at
where<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.379> mass<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.310> how<00:03:03.030> far<00:03:03.329> this<00:03:03.540> thing

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
where the mass is and how far this thing

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.430 
where the mass is and how far this thing
travels<00:03:04.319> so<00:03:05.280> here's<00:03:05.639> our<00:03:05.760> first<00:03:06.090> wheel<00:03:06.440> and

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
travels so here's our first wheel and

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.229 
travels so here's our first wheel and
what<00:03:07.920> happens<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.400> all<00:03:08.579> of<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.849> mass<00:03:09.030> is

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
what happens is all of the mass is

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.819 
what happens is all of the mass is
basically<00:03:09.569> on<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.139> very<00:03:10.319> outside

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
basically on the very outside

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.940 
basically on the very outside
so<00:03:11.670> as<00:03:12.000> this<00:03:12.480> tire<00:03:12.780> rotates<00:03:13.379> one<00:03:13.680> full

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
so as this tire rotates one full

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.670 
so as this tire rotates one full
revolution<00:03:14.609> that<00:03:15.090> mass<00:03:15.419> is<00:03:15.690> also<00:03:16.079> going<00:03:16.620> to

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
revolution that mass is also going to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.220 
revolution that mass is also going to
travel<00:03:17.069> that<00:03:17.190> distance<00:03:17.419> so<00:03:18.419> the<00:03:18.750> distance

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
travel that distance so the distance

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.979 
travel that distance so the distance
that<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.220> wheel<00:03:20.459> travels<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.510> distance

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
that the wheel travels is this distance

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.979 
that the wheel travels is this distance
one<00:03:22.769> revolution<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:23.790> this<00:03:23.970> point<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:24.449> now<00:03:24.660> that

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
one revolution so this point is now that

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.159 
one revolution so this point is now that
circumference<00:03:25.769> in<00:03:26.099> distance<00:03:26.760> away<00:03:26.989> with<00:03:27.989> one

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
circumference in distance away with one

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.860 
circumference in distance away with one
revolution<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.889> that<00:03:29.340> mass<00:03:29.609> also<00:03:30.419> travels

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
revolution and that mass also travels

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.449 
revolution and that mass also travels
that<00:03:30.989> same<00:03:31.260> distance<00:03:31.680> because<00:03:31.919> the<00:03:32.069> mass<00:03:32.250> is

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
that same distance because the mass is

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.119 
that same distance because the mass is
all<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:32.699> way<00:03:32.790> out<00:03:32.910> at<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.150> outside<00:03:33.449> edge<00:03:34.129> now

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
all the way out at the outside edge now

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.420 
all the way out at the outside edge now
if<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.519> take<00:03:35.699> the<00:03:35.879> second<00:03:36.389> tire<00:03:36.629> and<00:03:37.129> you<00:03:38.129> have

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
if you take the second tire and you have

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.330 
if you take the second tire and you have
the<00:03:38.760> same<00:03:39.060> outer<00:03:39.480> diameter<00:03:40.169> so<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.470> do<00:03:40.919> one

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
the same outer diameter so you do one

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.939 
the same outer diameter so you do one
rotation<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:42.750> outer<00:03:42.989> diameter<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.739> means

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
rotation that outer diameter that means

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:45.409 
rotation that outer diameter that means
the<00:03:44.129> wheel<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.489> going<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.669> move<00:03:44.849> that<00:03:45.150> same

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
the wheel is going to move that same

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.449 
the wheel is going to move that same
distance<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.260> one<00:03:46.440> moved<00:03:46.650> but<00:03:47.190> because

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
distance that this one moved but because

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.150 
distance that this one moved but because
your<00:03:47.609> mass<00:03:47.879> is<00:03:48.150> further<00:03:48.660> in<00:03:49.019> that<00:03:49.500> mass<00:03:49.859> is

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
your mass is further in that mass is

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.720 
your mass is further in that mass is
only<00:03:50.280> moving<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.760> distance<00:03:50.910> of<00:03:51.449> that<00:03:52.410> inner

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
only moving a distance of that inner

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.159 
only moving a distance of that inner
diameter<00:03:53.730> there<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.419> it's<00:03:54.569> not<00:03:54.720> going<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.019> move

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
diameter there so it's not going to move

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.619 
diameter there so it's not going to move
the<00:03:55.230> full<00:03:55.650> distance<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.459> will<00:03:56.699> move<00:03:56.940> so

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
the full distance that this will move so

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.170 
the full distance that this will move so
by<00:03:57.989> decreasing<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.859> distance<00:03:59.310> that<00:03:59.849> the<00:04:00.000> mass

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
by decreasing the distance that the mass

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.289 
by decreasing the distance that the mass
travels<00:04:00.810> in<00:04:01.079> a<00:04:01.199> sense<00:04:01.470> you're<00:04:02.430> decreasing<00:04:03.180> its

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
travels in a sense you're decreasing its

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.349 
travels in a sense you're decreasing its
moment<00:04:03.629> of<00:04:03.690> inertia<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.319> it's<00:04:04.440> easier<00:04:04.980> to

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
moment of inertia and it's easier to

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.839 
moment of inertia and it's easier to
obviously<00:04:06.359> do<00:04:06.540> less<00:04:06.750> work<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.260> move<00:04:07.470> this<00:04:07.849> less

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
obviously do less work to move this less

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.569 
obviously do less work to move this less
distance<00:04:09.419> and<00:04:09.659> to<00:04:10.319> move<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:10.799> a<00:04:11.069> greater

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
distance and to move this a greater

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.119 
distance and to move this a greater
distance<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.329> so<00:04:13.169> this<00:04:13.349> applies<00:04:13.709> to

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
distance and so this applies to

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.629 
distance and so this applies to
everything<00:04:14.879> that<00:04:14.909> rotates<00:04:15.419> in<00:04:16.049> a<00:04:16.289> car<00:04:16.639> I've

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
everything that rotates in a car I've

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.069 
everything that rotates in a car I've
written<00:04:17.909> down<00:04:18.000> some<00:04:18.299> examples<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:18.959> there's

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
written down some examples and there's

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.440 
written down some examples and there's
probably<00:04:19.260> plenty<00:04:19.709> more<00:04:20.090> driveshafts<00:04:21.090> crank

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
probably plenty more driveshafts crank

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.180 
probably plenty more driveshafts crank

you want to happen is you want your

you want to happen is you want your

power to go into pushing your vehicle

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.810 
power to go into pushing your vehicle
forward<00:04:39.260> rather<00:04:39.950> than<00:04:40.070> spooling<00:04:40.640> up

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
forward rather than spooling up

forward rather than spooling up
rotational<00:04:41.450> components<00:04:42.110> so<00:04:42.590> any<00:04:42.800> power<00:04:43.130> that

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
rotational components so any power that

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.980

you put into spooling up rotational

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.720 
you put into spooling up rotational
components<00:04:45.560> is<00:04:45.680> power<00:04:46.250> that<00:04:46.460> you're<00:04:46.580> not

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
components is power that you're not

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.810 
components is power that you're not
using<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.240> push<00:04:47.450> your<00:04:47.600> car<00:04:47.780> forward<00:04:48.140> and<00:04:48.500> so<00:04:49.100> by

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
using to push your car forward and so by

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.580 
using to push your car forward and so by
reducing<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.540> amount<00:04:50.810> of<00:04:50.930> power<00:04:51.200> you<00:04:51.290> put

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
reducing the amount of power you put

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.800 
reducing the amount of power you put
into<00:04:51.980> rotating<00:04:52.760> opponents<00:04:53.240> you<00:04:53.600> can

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
into rotating opponents you can

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.960 
into rotating opponents you can
therefore<00:04:54.020> increase<00:04:55.010> the<00:04:55.340> force<00:04:55.610> on<00:04:55.850> the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
therefore increase the force on the

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.520 
therefore increase the force on the
ground<00:04:56.180> and<00:04:56.450> your<00:04:56.660> car<00:04:56.840> will<00:04:56.960> accelerate

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
ground and your car will accelerate

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.990 
ground and your car will accelerate
faster<00:04:57.920> so<00:04:58.280> you're<00:04:58.400> increasing<00:04:58.550> your

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
faster so you're increasing your

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.740 
faster so you're increasing your
horsepower<00:04:59.420> by<00:05:00.130> decreasing<00:05:01.130> your<00:05:01.340> losses

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
horsepower by decreasing your losses

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.990 
horsepower by decreasing your losses
basically<00:05:03.130> and<00:05:04.130> I've<00:05:04.190> just<00:05:04.340> got<00:05:04.490> an<00:05:04.610> example

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
basically and I've just got an example

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.090 
basically and I've just got an example
drawn<00:05:05.180> here<00:05:05.480> you<00:05:05.870> may<00:05:06.050> see<00:05:06.110> for<00:05:06.590> example<00:05:06.980> like

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
drawn here you may see for example like

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.880 
drawn here you may see for example like
a<00:05:07.130> racing<00:05:07.790> flywheel<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.570> what<00:05:09.200> they<00:05:09.350> do<00:05:09.410> is

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
a racing flywheel and what they do is

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.830 
a racing flywheel and what they do is
they'll<00:05:10.280> take<00:05:10.490> out<00:05:10.700> you<00:05:10.970> may<00:05:11.060> see<00:05:11.120> like<00:05:11.480> holes

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
they'll take out you may see like holes

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.600 
they'll take out you may see like holes
punched<00:05:12.110> down<00:05:12.320> to<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.560> outer<00:05:12.680> edge<00:05:12.920> and<00:05:13.250> so

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
punched down to the outer edge and so

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.010 
punched down to the outer edge and so
that's<00:05:13.790> what<00:05:13.940> they're<00:05:14.090> doing<00:05:14.420> is<00:05:14.600> they're

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
that's what they're doing is they're

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.260 
that's what they're doing is they're
reducing<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:15.890> moment<00:05:16.190> of<00:05:16.250> inertia<00:05:16.460> by

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
reducing the moment of inertia by

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.330 
reducing the moment of inertia by
pulling<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:17.780> mass<00:05:17.960> away<00:05:18.500> from<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:18.920> outside

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
pulling the mass away from the outside

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.720 
pulling the mass away from the outside
and<00:05:19.640> getting<00:05:20.120> it<00:05:20.300> closer<00:05:20.540> to<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:20.930> center<00:05:21.730> so

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
and getting it closer to the center so

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.280 
and getting it closer to the center so
that's<00:05:22.940> the<00:05:23.060> basics<00:05:23.480> of<00:05:23.630> rotational<00:05:24.170> inertia

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
that's the basics of rotational inertia

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.409 
that's the basics of rotational inertia
I<00:05:24.770> can<00:05:25.130> have<00:05:25.220> a<00:05:25.280> follow-up<00:05:25.640> video<00:05:25.880> to<00:05:26.090> kind<00:05:26.390> of

I can have a follow-up video to kind of

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.150 
I can have a follow-up video to kind of
