hurt<00:01:26.440> their<00:01:26.590> turbo<00:01:26.860> graphics<00:01:27.100> was<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.610> fact

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
hurt their turbo graphics was the fact

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.210 
hurt their turbo graphics was the fact
that<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:28.090> only<00:01:28.210> had<00:01:28.420> one<00:01:28.720> controller<00:01:29.200> port<00:01:29.650> if

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
that it only had one controller port if

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.710 
that it only had one controller port if
you<00:01:30.340> wanted<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.729> be<00:01:30.820> social<00:01:31.330> and<00:01:31.390> actually
