 so I ask you to leave us 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.789
 comments you can also credit 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.880
 for me or on facebook page on 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.599
 productive painting and then letting the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.449
 your idea 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.730
 your trattorias suggestion okay good then 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.500
 Here we begin to tips will 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.730
 to pass I think a few cool tips 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.770
 for you 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.219
 the first one is how to switch from 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.500
 projects or I have more than one 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.230
 open project in 4d cinema like me 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.570
 I can change from one to the other so I 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.270
 here two projects is clear that I 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.489
 I only have one showing at the moment 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.649
 so how do I visualize the other 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.070
 you have two choices are her first 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.109
 it's in the window here the bottom goes 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.039
 have all your projects open in the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.909
 4d cinema 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.909
 then simply a click it changes 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.240
 to the other project or press the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.369
 to see on the keyboard appeared - suspense and 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.470
 Then you can then come here in project. 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.560
 will have all your projects open 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.590
 clicked it changes projects ok 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.270
 The second tip is in relation to render the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.880
 income comparison 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.170
 so I would like to compare a render 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.150
 with the other 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.020
 how can I do this using a 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.189
 4d cinema 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.770
 so I'm going to render this image 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.470
 I'll modify the lighting a bit 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.960
 I will do another render here in peter v 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.030
 you have to show the cinema 4d which 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.390
 which is the image you want to compare 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.740
 any image 1 and image 2 in case I 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.060
 I have here are the two images I 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.479
 I would like to occupy with each other 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.320
 I select the first image press letter 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.729
 to select the second image and 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.200
 letter d 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.570
 then there is no longer a line 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.429
 horizontal where I can click and 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.430
 drag up and down then 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.710
 he alternates remembering that the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.910
 image of top image and animal 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.430
 underneath the picture b right if I want 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.280
 that this line is vertical I came 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.620
 here in compare click here 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.120
 this is vertical horizontal then 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.280
 have horizontal and will change pro 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.510
 vertical and if it is vertical it will 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.490
 switch to horizontal 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.570
 Okay, enjoying what we have here. 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:40.320
 in one a painter saw few people know 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.730
 which few people use right here 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.710
 Do you have a filter? 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.860
 so you can work with this with 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.050
 this filter also on an image I will 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.730
 disable the compadre so well who 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:57.390
 compare or disable involve a 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.210
 filter I'm going to activate here it's a nego filter 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.210
 ok so here I have the brightness situation 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.370
 contrast the opening I can make 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.930
 small adjustments then suddenly stay 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.310
 a little more color a little less than 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:15.090
 before the bet is changing 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:19.920
 then this image both a refined one 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:24.120
 in this filter and saving it is seeing 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.150
 here in fahel if you had a choice here 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.450
 my format extension is that I 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.220
 I want to save doc chose the location where the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.780
 Wanna save, okay? 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.540
 ok let's talk a little bit later 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.090
 shadows 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.790
 if you want to soften the shadow 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.220
 let the shade a little clearer by 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.520
 The darker you can then working. 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.080
 here in options see 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.970
 you can for example I will leave a 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.990
 little stronger here in resolution 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.550
 increase of 3 thousand for example I go 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.730
 sell again 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.550
 You will realize that there will be a 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.790
 envy the hardware software then click 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.700
 a very firm trait even for example I will 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.760
 leave a little softer or leave 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:16.739
 250 how are you and I'm going to increase 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:19.890
 here our pushes, then I go 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:24.550
 leave the company gives another income 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:28.580
 realize that it will become more smoothed 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:31.730
 Okay, I can increase even more I 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.730
 I think most of it is 20 rain is 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.940
 even 20 percent can 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:42.040
 neighborhood or increase and increase 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:45.050
 leave a little clearer right 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.210
 then it will depend even on how the 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.350
 You want your shadow then I advise 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:54.680
 You mess that working on it using 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.030
 the resolution of x always hills and the neighborhood 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.060
 Say goodbye, okay? 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.380
 And then we'll close with 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.820
 textures 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.780
 many people ask me where the 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.890
 with textures using exists 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.710
 some websites, right? 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:13.040
 where you can download these textures 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.630
 however some better ones are paid 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.240
 but you also can not be using 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.380
 the google that is what else uses google 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.810
 images 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.950
 so I just want a texture of wood and 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.390
 scrolling and test-by-search and generally 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.110
 research in English because the 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:32.300
 better images and I always leave 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.590
 here in search tools I come 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.030
 world of any size for big 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:42.380
 So you'll always be giving me the 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.060
 best nÃ© featured quality 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.000
 so people here on google you 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.960
 gets a multitude of textures there 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.030
 which you can use for example if 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:58.250
 Do you want a wall of blocks in this 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:06:01.280
