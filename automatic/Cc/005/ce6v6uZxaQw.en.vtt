00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.270
 is to enter the link that I will leave in the 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:20.220

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.220
 and download the file 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.580
 I do not do it since I no longer have 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.619
 Discharged 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.050

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.540
 do is wait for the whole file 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.170
 they are downloaded and they will leave a file 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.170
 rar like this 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.629
 once you have downloaded what 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.560

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.800
 you will get this folder which will have 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:57.780
 two files one is the installer the 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.160
 what is this and the second is the crack 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.380
 first they have to 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.230
 click double click on it 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.950
 installer and wait for all the 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.939
 files that this has 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.939

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.670
 well then it is to start running the 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.070
 installer to all give you next me 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.230
 obviously I can not do it since I already 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.480
 I have installed the explained 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.740
 However, you will have several 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:37.340
 options they all get next next next 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.370
 and install and start loading them 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.050
 several files those files are for 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.230
 install in excel 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.760
 once the installation of the 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.040
 this 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.490
 in case any option comes up 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.740
 to start the explained once installed 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.160
 remove the option since not yet 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.160
 finished 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.310
 well after having installed the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.700
 I explain what we have to do is 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.330
 go to my pc we go after 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.870
 to local disk cm and program files 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.900
 I for personal reasons do not 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.000
 I did not address sometimes directly without 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.990
 But we go to files of 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.870
 program and we look for the folder that says 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.750
 and half labs we open this folder 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.350
 we open this other folder and just 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.510
 here we are going to paste the crack we copy the 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.159
 archive 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.159
 and we paste it here 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.080
 asks them if they want to replace this 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:52.410
 file you and well finally 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.960
 gentlemen here we have the explained 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.420
 so, well, I'm going to cut the video 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.050
 to check what 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.960
 dressed 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.390
 I will teach you two options the version 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.030
 free blocked cinema but that with this 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.950
 version believe they will not have them good 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.770
 Gentlemen here we are finally with him 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.440
 explains open to me it seems this 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.220
 option for this reason that says that this 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.690
 resolution does not allow the xp to you 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.470
 it will not come out in case they have 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:27.030
 windows 7 or windows 8 but good here 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.030
 finally we have gentlemen he 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.530
 in importance but 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.830
 for some reason 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.050
 good gentlemen here we finally have the 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.630
 blue end 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.970
 now I will show you one of the options 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.880
 that we are most interested in is that of 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.560
 sound which forces youtube 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:55.819
 especially the use asks them so that 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:00.550
 can this end 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:02.350
 platform and this is the codec 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.280
 to you in the free version them 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.069
 this will come out 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.440
 however with this version created 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.900
 you can change it to this which is the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.639
 that youtube and possibly twitch them 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:19.150
 ask for finally finally finally 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.510
 can use it 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:27.100
 and apply it in its extremes 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.060
 and in applying to this mother but for other 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.630
 things 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.020
 another option that they have left the option 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.020
 free 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.669
 a skype version however being 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.560
 I am very important however 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.030
 to check that it is blocked 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.550
 at the time it's free but the version 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.150
 created not 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.530
 so good gentlemen I would teach them 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.570
 about resolutions and all that without 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.060
 But I would leave them for another 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.250
 video for a moment this series all 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.350
 I hope you liked it if you want 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.630
 some other tutorial or if you have any 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.200
 doubt about this you can ask about it 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.740
 the comments and I will try to 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:13.170
 solve the but good I'm that one 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.170
