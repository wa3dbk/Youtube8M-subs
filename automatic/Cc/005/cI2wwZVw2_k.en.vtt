that's<00:00:56.700> because<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.180> been<00:00:57.300> around<00:00:57.329> since

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
that's because it's been around since

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.650 
that's because it's been around since
2005<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.489> although<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.790> brand<00:01:00.120> new<00:01:00.270> model<00:01:00.540> was
