00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
two tens man Lou getting extended I also

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.370 
two tens man Lou getting extended I also
need<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.579> couple<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.360> days<00:01:54.479> ago<00:01:54.540> didn't<00:01:55.229> get

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
need a couple of days ago didn't get

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.370 
need a couple of days ago didn't get
that<00:01:55.560> many<00:01:55.710> views<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.189> mean<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.610> many<00:01:57.380> that

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
that many views I mean that many that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.399 
that many views I mean that many that
many<00:01:58.409> good<00:01:58.740> cards<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.369> decent<00:02:00.030> pools<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:01.320> I

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
many good cards in it decent pools and I

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.630 
many good cards in it decent pools and I
guess<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.770> going<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.950> be<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.159> same<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.490> this
