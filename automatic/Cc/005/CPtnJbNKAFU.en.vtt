trying to edit this video because my

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.190 
trying to edit this video because my
editing<00:00:11.910> program<00:00:12.300> has<00:00:12.480> messed<00:00:12.719> me<00:00:12.870> up<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.019> bad

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
but anyways this is kyle setup and i'm

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.290 
but anyways this is kyle setup and i'm
using<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.039> silence<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.460> instead<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.820> Max<00:00:18.000> and

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
that's also one of the reasons because

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.679

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
safe Indiana's gamble because they are

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.720 
safe Indiana's gamble because they are
the<00:00:27.359> strongest<00:00:27.750> gun<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> game<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.369> were

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the strongest gun in the game and I were

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.910 
the strongest gun in the game and I were
told<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.210> too<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.840> yeah<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.470> use<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> same

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920

perks you really need to just go for the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.020 
perks you really need to just go for the
gun<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.710> went<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> start<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.820> not

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that's not a good ethical thing to do at

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.810 
that's not a good ethical thing to do at
all<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.350> second<00:01:19.710> perk<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> crater<00:01:20.700> all

all so the second perk is a crater all
pro<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.330> we're<00:01:21.750> not<00:01:21.840> using<00:01:22.049> hard<00:01:22.350> line<00:01:22.500> this

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
pro and we're not using hard line this

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.270 
pro and we're not using hard line this
time<00:01:22.740> because<00:01:24.320> we<00:01:25.320> will<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:26.070> need<00:01:26.220> that

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
time because we will really need that

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.520 
time because we will really need that
quick<00:01:26.670> game<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.119> not<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.689> ACR<00:01:28.290> this

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
quick game it's not like the ACR this

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.679 
quick game it's not like the ACR this
step<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:29.009> does<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> little<00:01:29.970> bit<00:01:30.090> more<00:01:30.299> damage

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
step this does a little bit more damage

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.899 
step this does a little bit more damage
and<00:01:30.869> when<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:31.560> use<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.799> crater<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.520> don't<00:01:32.640> need

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
and when we use the crater we don't need

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.780 
and when we use the crater we don't need
to<00:01:33.060> use<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.240> stalker<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.439> that's<00:01:34.650> why<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:35.130> use

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
to use the stalker so that's why we use

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.340 
to use the stalker so that's why we use
today<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.750> some<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> maps<00:01:37.200> you

problems you guys haven't dragged at the

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.490 
problems you guys haven't dragged at the
Moab<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.470> get<00:02:58.650> Randall<00:02:59.010> E<00:02:59.099> sniped<00:02:59.370> and<00:03:00.500> did

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
Moab you get Randall E sniped and did

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.099 
Moab you get Randall E sniped and did
basically<00:03:02.189> the<00:03:02.970> thinking<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.629> sniper<00:03:03.870> is

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
basically the thinking of a sniper is

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.940 
basically the thinking of a sniper is
they<00:03:04.859> go<00:03:05.280> in<00:03:05.669> side<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.389> map<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.079> maybe<00:03:07.799> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
they go in side the map and maybe the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.280 
they go in side the map and maybe the
hit<00:03:08.129> list<00:03:08.280> maybe<00:03:08.489> they<00:03:08.700> don't<00:03:08.879> but<00:03:09.480> most<00:03:10.109> of

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
hit list maybe they don't but most of

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.440 
hit list maybe they don't but most of
them<00:03:10.409> they<00:03:10.650> try<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:10.919> get<00:03:11.189> quad<00:03:11.639> feeds<00:03:11.939> and<00:03:12.329> it

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
them they try to get quad feeds and it

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.899 
them they try to get quad feeds and it
was<00:03:12.629> be<00:03:12.870> like<00:03:12.900> grits<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.040> they<00:03:14.099> try<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.370> still

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
was be like grits and they try to still

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.879 
was be like grits and they try to still
do<00:03:15.329> that<00:03:15.480> kind<00:03:15.659> of<00:03:15.720> stuff<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.139> he's<00:03:16.650> one<00:03:16.769> of
