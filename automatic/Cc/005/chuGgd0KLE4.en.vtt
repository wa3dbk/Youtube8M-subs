here<00:00:06.899> on<00:00:07.049> siren<00:00:07.799> nets<00:00:07.980> definitely<00:00:08.400> worth

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
here on siren nets definitely worth

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.430 
here on siren nets definitely worth
checking<00:00:08.550> out<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.080> unit<00:00:10.320> in

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
checking out and this is the unit in

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.209 
checking out and this is the unit in
question<00:00:10.889> it's<00:00:11.610> basically<00:00:12.090> their<00:00:12.769> 97<00:00:13.769> decibel

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
question it's basically their 97 decibel

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.799 
question it's basically their 97 decibel
backup<00:00:14.639> alarm<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.360> an<00:00:15.480> omnidirectional

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
backup alarm this is an omnidirectional

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.349 
backup alarm this is an omnidirectional
unit<00:00:16.650> meaning<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.400> frequency<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.240> this

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
unit meaning the frequency that this

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.970 
unit meaning the frequency that this
backup<00:00:18.960> alarm<00:00:19.170> will<00:00:19.380> work<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.740> is

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
backup alarm will work on is

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.730 
backup alarm will work on is
omnidirectional<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.630> ability

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
omnidirectional so you have the ability

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.560 
omnidirectional so you have the ability
when<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:22.890> hear<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.250> go<00:00:23.279> off<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:24.180> identify

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
when you hear it go off to identify

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.300

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
pollution and that's very important in

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.069 
pollution and that's very important in
environments<00:00:35.760> where<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.390> might<00:00:36.570> be<00:00:36.750> offering

and the voltage range is between 12 and
24<00:01:33.780> volts<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.799> unit<00:01:35.100> itself<00:01:35.340> actually<00:01:35.880> draws

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
24 volts the unit itself actually draws

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.179 
24 volts the unit itself actually draws
0.5<00:01:36.750> amps<00:01:37.110> that's<00:01:37.259> not<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> very<00:01:37.530> heavy<00:01:37.680> draw<00:01:37.979> as

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
0.5 amps that's not a very heavy draw as

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:38.899 
0.5 amps that's not a very heavy draw as
far<00:01:38.400> as<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.610> goes

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
far as that goes

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.670 
far as that goes
and<00:01:39.119> again<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.200> waterproof<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:41.850> ipx8<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:43.619> of

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
and again it's waterproof to ipx8 and of

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.350 
and again it's waterproof to ipx8 and of
course<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.040> also<00:01:44.189> epoxy<00:01:44.820> sealed<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.240> can

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
course it's also epoxy sealed we can

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.760 
course it's also epoxy sealed we can
take<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> look<00:01:45.600> at<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.780> back<00:01:45.990> here<00:01:46.229> it's

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
take a look at the back here it's

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.280 
take a look at the back here it's
actually<00:01:47.070> epoxy<00:01:47.549> sealed<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.689> respect<00:01:49.110> to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
actually epoxy sealed with respect to

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.380 
actually epoxy sealed with respect to
the<00:01:49.409> sort<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.680> dirt<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.189> dust<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.759> water
