00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
the padding on the ears is pretty nice

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.190 
the padding on the ears is pretty nice
there<00:01:53.460> was<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> lot<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.820> space<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.570> as<00:01:54.960> far<00:01:55.170> as

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
there was a lot of space but as far as

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.719 
there was a lot of space but as far as
the<00:01:55.439> weight<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> where<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.100> sat<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.340> my<00:01:56.549> head

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the weight and where it sat on my head

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.030 
the weight and where it sat on my head
it<00:01:56.909> really<00:01:57.509> did<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.659> agree<00:01:57.960> with<00:01:58.170> me<00:01:58.320> another

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040

it really did not agree with me another
thing<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.430> didn't<00:01:59.790> really<00:01:59.939> like<00:02:00.090> about<00:02:00.119> it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
thing that I didn't really like about it

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.660 
thing that I didn't really like about it
was<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.689> sound<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:02.040> guess<00:02:02.189> with<00:02:02.490> my

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
was the sound that I guess with my

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.149 
was the sound that I guess with my
teammates<00:02:03.060> heard<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.630> my

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
teammates heard and my

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.130

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
to channel her I didn't like either the

looking at audio quality it is pretty

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.050 
looking at audio quality it is pretty
flat<00:03:12.139> sounding<00:03:12.709> because<00:03:12.829> it's<00:03:13.099> just<00:03:13.340> it's<00:03:13.639> two

of natural sounds I think we had some

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.390 
of natural sounds I think we had some
complaints<00:03:38.870> there<00:03:39.230> so<00:03:39.500> I<00:03:39.769> will<00:03:39.919> let<00:03:40.040> you<00:03:40.190> take

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.400 
complaints there so I will let you take
that<00:03:40.430> away<00:03:40.579> yeah<00:03:41.150> we<00:03:41.810> were<00:03:41.900> looking<00:03:42.019> up<00:03:42.260> some

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
that away yeah we were looking up some

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.809 
that away yeah we were looking up some
other<00:03:42.560> stuff<00:03:42.739> about<00:03:42.859> Plantronics<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.579> lot<00:03:43.730> of

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
other stuff about Plantronics a lot of

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.970 
other stuff about Plantronics a lot of
other<00:03:43.940> people<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:45.019> guess<00:03:45.230> mentioned<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:45.769> it

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
other people I guess mentioned that it

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.559 
other people I guess mentioned that it
didn't<00:03:46.250> sound<00:03:46.400> very<00:03:46.639> realistic<00:03:47.000> which<00:03:47.419> was

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
didn't sound very realistic which was

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:48.640 
didn't sound very realistic which was
something<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.959> I<00:03:47.989> could<00:03:48.169> definitely<00:03:48.290> get

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
something that I could definitely get

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.069 
something that I could definitely get
behind<00:03:49.010> as<00:03:49.430> far<00:03:49.669> as<00:03:49.760> sound<00:03:49.940> of<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.389> I'm<00:03:50.780> used

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
behind as far as sound of it it I'm used

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.690 
behind as far as sound of it it I'm used
to<00:03:51.139> having<00:03:51.319> directional<00:03:51.889> audio<00:03:52.099> not<00:03:52.400> having

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
to having directional audio not having

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.250 
to having directional audio not having
that<00:03:52.819> was<00:03:52.940> really<00:03:53.209> difficult<00:03:53.389> having<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:54.049> rely

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
that was really difficult having to rely

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.539 
that was really difficult having to rely
on<00:03:54.290> other<00:03:54.470> things<00:03:54.590> in<00:03:54.980> order<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.280> figure<00:03:55.430> out

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
on other things in order to figure out

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.339 
on other things in order to figure out
where<00:03:55.790> enemies<00:03:56.030> were<00:03:56.359> and<00:03:56.630> how<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.780> play<00:03:57.049> and

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
where enemies were and how to play and

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.289 
where enemies were and how to play and
doing<00:03:57.650> all<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:57.829> stuff<00:03:58.150> definitely<00:03:59.150> was<00:03:59.269> a

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
doing all that stuff definitely was a

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.710 
doing all that stuff definitely was a
detriment<00:03:59.810> also<00:04:00.769> with<00:04:01.069> the<00:04:01.370> game<00:04:02.150> sound<00:04:02.389> the

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
detriment also with the game sound the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.509 
detriment also with the game sound the
voice<00:04:03.410> make<00:04:03.680> there<00:04:03.829> are<00:04:03.889> the<00:04:03.980> channels<00:04:04.370> that

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
voice make there are the channels that

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.009 
voice make there are the channels that
you<00:04:04.609> had<00:04:04.790> as<00:04:04.970> far<00:04:05.120> as<00:04:05.329> being<00:04:05.540> able<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.840> adjust

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
you had as far as being able to adjust

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.569 
you had as far as being able to adjust
the<00:04:06.169> volumes<00:04:06.530> you<00:04:06.650> had<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:06.799> master<00:04:07.160> volume<00:04:07.310> so

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
the volumes you had a master volume so

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.589 
the volumes you had a master volume so
you<00:04:07.669> could<00:04:07.790> make<00:04:07.910> things<00:04:08.030> super<00:04:08.209> loud<00:04:08.450> or

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
you could make things super loud or

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.229 
you could make things super loud or
super<00:04:08.780> soft<00:04:08.989> but<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.739> individual<00:04:10.280> volume

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
super soft but the individual volume

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.180 
super soft but the individual volume
levels<00:04:11.510> between<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:12.139> game<00:04:12.530> sound<00:04:12.859> and<00:04:13.100> the

levels between the game sound and the
chat<00:04:13.370> sound<00:04:13.609> didn't<00:04:14.120> have<00:04:14.239> a<00:04:14.269> whole<00:04:14.419> lot<00:04:14.539> of

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570

variation

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:15.259

you<00:04:15.560> went<00:04:15.739> from<00:04:15.859> loud

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
you went from loud

entirely without turning down the entire
master<00:04:22.880> volume<00:04:23.270> I<00:04:23.539> struggled<00:04:24.080> with<00:04:24.229> it<00:04:24.380> in<00:04:24.530> a

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
master volume I struggled with it in a

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.640 
master volume I struggled with it in a
way<00:04:25.099> that<00:04:25.280> I<00:04:25.310> wish<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.759> didn't<00:04:26.389> but<00:04:26.449> I<00:04:26.960> wish

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
way that I wish I didn't but I wish

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.809 
way that I wish I didn't but I wish
there<00:04:27.770> was<00:04:27.860> a<00:04:27.949> little<00:04:28.039> bit<00:04:28.190> more<00:04:28.340> variety<00:04:28.490> as

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:28.819 
there was a little bit more variety as

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.390 
there was a little bit more variety as
far<00:04:29.060> as<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.389> volume<00:04:29.960> level<00:04:30.229> settings<00:04:30.620> in<00:04:30.830> the

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
far as the volume level settings in the

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.430 
far as the volume level settings in the
mixer<00:04:31.759> the<00:04:32.389> way<00:04:32.509> I<00:04:32.539> feel<00:04:32.870> about<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.110> if<00:04:33.289> you're

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
mixer the way I feel about it if you're

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.870 
mixer the way I feel about it if you're
a<00:04:33.470> PC<00:04:33.650> gamer<00:04:34.009> then<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:34.430> should<00:04:34.610> really<00:04:34.789> be

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
a PC gamer then you should really be

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.120 
a PC gamer then you should really be
buying<00:04:35.449> a<00:04:35.599> PC<00:04:35.900> headset<00:04:36.319> because<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:36.710> probably

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
buying a PC headset because you probably

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.270 
buying a PC headset because you probably
don't<00:04:37.490> need<00:04:37.789> a<00:04:38.150> mixer<00:04:38.960> you<00:04:38.990> can<00:04:39.139> you<00:04:39.530> can<00:04:39.680> pause

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
don't need a mixer you can you can pause
