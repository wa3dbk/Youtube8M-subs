00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
where it's braden can easily become a 90

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.850 
where it's braden can easily become a 90
90<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.430> only<00:02:26.670> four<00:02:27.000> players<00:02:27.150> days<00:02:27.660> in<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.260> MVP

Kemba<00:02:31.500> Walker<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.980> not<00:02:32.130> one<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.520> players

Kemba Walker is not one of the players

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.550 
Kemba Walker is not one of the players
so<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.480> potential<00:02:34.020> should<00:02:34.170> not<00:02:34.290> be<00:02:34.410> that

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410

00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:56.499 
don't even think that would have been an

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.799 
don't even think that would have been an
option<00:06:56.979> because<00:06:57.159> I'm<00:06:58.089> pretty<00:06:58.269> sure<00:06:58.539> a<00:06:58.569> lot<00:06:58.749> of

00:06:58.799 --> 00:06:58.809 
option because I'm pretty sure a lot of

00:06:58.809 --> 00:07:01.169 
option because I'm pretty sure a lot of
people<00:06:58.929> at<00:06:59.319> a<00:06:59.349> prosthetic<00:06:59.859> sorry<00:07:00.249> I<00:07:00.669> don't

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:01.179 
people at a prosthetic sorry I don't

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:03.119 
people at a prosthetic sorry I don't
know<00:07:01.539> why<00:07:01.749> they'll<00:07:01.929> be<00:07:02.139> a<00:07:02.439> thing<00:07:02.860> they<00:07:03.009> would

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:03.129 
know why they'll be a thing they would

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:04.529 
know why they'll be a thing they would
take<00:07:03.249> out<00:07:03.459> but<00:07:03.669> says<00:07:03.819> nobody's<00:07:04.149> talking<00:07:04.479> about

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:04.539 
take out but says nobody's talking about

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:07.139 
take out but says nobody's talking about
it<00:07:04.719> I<00:07:04.869> guess<00:07:05.079> it<00:07:05.259> isn't<00:07:05.439> a<00:07:05.649> big<00:07:05.860> deal<00:07:05.889> I<00:07:06.489> guess<00:07:07.059> I

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:07.149 
it I guess it isn't a big deal I guess I

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:08.819 
it I guess it isn't a big deal I guess I
might<00:07:07.329> be<00:07:07.509> like<00:07:07.719> one<00:07:07.959> of<00:07:07.989> the<00:07:08.139> few<00:07:08.439> that<00:07:08.619> you

might be like one of the few that you

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:11.189 
might be like one of the few that you
care<00:07:09.039> about<00:07:09.069> a<00:07:09.249> roster<00:07:09.809> how<00:07:10.809> many<00:07:10.989> of<00:07:11.049> you

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 
care about a roster how many of you
