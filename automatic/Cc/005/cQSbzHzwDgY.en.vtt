00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.009
 Hello friends 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.310
 here I am again on the street with mine 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.349
 faithful made today a day like this was 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.579
 really a crime to remain closed 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.590
 at home 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.140
 I do not know that I'll still ride the rest 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.660
 around the house also because I have only today 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.449
 as a free day, follow the instinct 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.239
 and I hope to find snow so much snow 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.519
 to improve my driving skills e 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.960
 see how far the panda in this type 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.960
 of land will stop 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.770
 I'm already driving for a while I feel 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.260
 really well and doing it in the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.510
 deviation to every usual route ho 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.239
 discovered this monument that recalls i 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.039
 fallen of the First World War 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.859
 a hundred years have passed since those tragic 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.739
 events my curiosity leads you to 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.380
 discover the porcino is open to give the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.990
 possibility to visit it and leave the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.820
 own signature of his passage 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.479
 I see that all the names and writings are in 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.640
 Italian 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.300
 I would also like to mention that this 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.130
 territory was once Italy anyway 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.190
 a strange feeling is taking me 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.810
 staying in here , luck is me 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.429
 I didn't live in war but in mine 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.250
 thousands of images flow 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.080
 seen in the many books in the past for 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.750
 stronzaggine December because of the mind 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.489
 human can create and continue even i 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.530
 our days with terrorism and others 

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:38.880
 crap like that in various parts 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.979
 of Europe and the world 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.909
 okay it's better that i close this one 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.130
 speech I could be polenta 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.990
 and rude and better than I pick up the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.469
 my ride because that's what I know 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.659
 do 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:54.359
 travel has arrived here 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.899
 and now the scrum must cover the road 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:02:01.079
 the panda has already made two skids towards 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.079
 the ravine 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:10.690
 let's see if we can go slowly 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:16.049
 ahead also because I don't think it's missing 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:20.640
 much in the end is already here little safer 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.640
 let's say I'm paying a little bit below 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.550
 the boys shit me under but ce 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.550
 I did it 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.150
 other road blocked by the woods ok 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.150
 let's try to move let's see if I can 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.780
 this too is done we will go ahead 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.370
 the band with the 4x4 grafted in the snow 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.290
 behaves as if I can on tracks 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.750
 fantastic even if sometimes the ass 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.599
 it breaks up a little but then always comes back there 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:43.480
 is a big car and its 27 years 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:47.629
 seems not to feel really nice soon 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.790
 but I can free the way 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.909
 fuck the guys to move these 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.409
 pieces of me really destroyed me 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.480
 begins to have a certain age but 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.879
 the goal is to move forward 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.670
 so after you have caught your breath you come back 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:04.099
 to work even these situations do 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.700
 part of a journey and it excites me 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.700
 a mess 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:29.260
 just guys i'm really excited 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.520
 for having overcome the difficulties 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.500
 of the day 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.110
 now it lacks little to return to the 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.790
 normal road and then at home but in the 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.280
 trips can happen 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.050
 even at the last minute so never 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.660
 lower your guard 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.760
 in fact I miss about 300 meters for 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.530
 live on the main road and the 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.470
 panda for its low ground clearance 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.850
 runs aground in the snow 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.610
 I want to try to get out of this 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.570
 situation and move on but after one 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.880
 twenty minutes 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.980
 I raise the white flag because the panda will 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.580
 she was leaning against a network of 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.920
 fence sinking in the media then 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.990
 with no small effort escori put it in 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.330
 way to be able to maneuver and resume 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.730
 the road from where I came 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.010
 and true I gave up maybe someone will do 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.060
 also the comments or we will laugh but 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.550
 you know what I tell you 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.930
 I'm happy anyway because of it 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.510
 the less I tried to go on 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.180
 even with a small old panda e 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.730
 so I'm happy anyway as if 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.440
 I had overcome the obstacle by pardoning 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.480
 you for seeing all the video too 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.919
 this time I greet you all 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.669
 see you next time 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.669
 bye Bye
