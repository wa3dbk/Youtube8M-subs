what<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.480> looks<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.970> I<00:00:26.970> used<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.779> for

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
what it looks like and I used it for

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.390 
what it looks like and I used it for
four<00:00:28.320> days<00:00:28.439> even<00:00:28.800> though<00:00:28.890> you're<00:00:29.070> supposed<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
four days even though you're supposed to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.730

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
use it twice a day and it would probably

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.290 
use it twice a day and it would probably
last<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.099> two<00:00:32.279> times<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.910> lasts<00:00:33.090> me<00:00:33.270> four

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.729

another video about the same exact thing

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.750 
another video about the same exact thing
and<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.480> realized<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.830> soap<00:02:14.099> was<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.489> bar

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
and I realized that the soap was a bar

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.160 
and I realized that the soap was a bar
and<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.090> didn't<00:02:15.390> know<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.720> was<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.900> bar

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and I didn't know that it was a bar

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.530 
and I didn't know that it was a bar
until<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.190> was<00:02:17.790> actually<00:02:17.940> doing<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.330> video

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
until I was actually doing the video

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.630 
until I was actually doing the video
because<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.780> never<00:02:18.840> unwrapped<00:02:19.349> it<00:02:19.500> yet<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.489> the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
because I never unwrapped it yet and the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.400 
because I never unwrapped it yet and the
soap<00:02:20.849> that<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:21.060> was<00:02:21.239> using<00:02:21.390> was<00:02:21.630> liquid<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:22.380> I

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
soap that I was using was liquid so I

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.620 
soap that I was using was liquid so I
just<00:02:22.769> thought<00:02:23.010> I'm<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:23.400> gonna<00:02:23.790> try<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.239> a

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
some things about it that people said

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.890 
some things about it that people said
their<00:05:27.310> face<00:05:27.460> got<00:05:27.669> dry<00:05:27.880> and<00:05:28.150> it<00:05:28.210> broke<00:05:28.360> out<00:05:28.600> so

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
their face got dry and it broke out so

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.000 
their face got dry and it broke out so
if<00:05:28.990> that<00:05:29.020> happens<00:05:29.470> I<00:05:29.560> guess<00:05:29.620> we'll<00:05:29.830> just<00:05:29.860> have

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
if that happens I guess we'll just have

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.850 
if that happens I guess we'll just have
to<00:05:30.130> stop<00:05:30.430> using<00:05:30.729> it<00:05:30.940> but<00:05:31.870> anyways<00:05:32.440> it's<00:05:32.770> a

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
to stop using it but anyways it's a

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.159 
to stop using it but anyways it's a
really<00:05:33.070> really<00:05:33.280> great<00:05:33.490> system<00:05:34.419> I<00:05:34.660> recommend

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
really really great system I recommend

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.140 
really really great system I recommend

it to anyone who has acne or anything

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.940 
it to anyone who has acne or anything
like<00:05:37.180> that<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:37.690> you<00:05:38.050> can<00:05:38.169> take<00:05:38.289> a<00:05:38.320> test<00:05:38.650> online

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
like that and you can take a test online

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.879 
like that and you can take a test online
