00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
to see some heavy heavy zergling use and

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.590 
to see some heavy heavy zergling use and
metabolic<00:00:56.399> boost<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.910> finished<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.570> course

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
air trying to find these overlords and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.979 
air trying to find these overlords and
they<00:01:02.699> pick<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.149> zergling<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.690> kill<00:01:03.840> it

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.560 
they pick up a zergling and kill it
that's<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.650> awesome<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.390> really<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.540> that

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that's just awesome I really like that

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.200 
that's just awesome I really like that
ability<00:01:07.020> ability<00:01:07.170> graviton<00:01:07.979> beam<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.520> it's

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
ability ability graviton beam is it's

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.789 
ability ability graviton beam is it's
really<00:01:09.630> interesting<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.229> think<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.619> whole

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
really interesting I think it's a whole

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.920 
really interesting I think it's a whole
new<00:01:10.950> different<00:01:11.159> type<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> mechanic<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
new different type of mechanic and it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.490 
new different type of mechanic and it
just<00:01:13.110> seems<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.380> fit<00:01:13.680> very<00:01:13.920> well

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.500 

so<00:01:17.070> yeah<00:01:17.310> picking<00:01:17.730> up<00:01:17.850> more<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.420> more

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
so yeah picking up more and more

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.180 
so yeah picking up more and more
zerglings<00:01:19.140> not<00:01:19.410> sure<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.710> that's<00:01:19.830> really<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
zerglings not sure if that's really the

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.870 
zerglings not sure if that's really the
best<00:01:20.550> use<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.510> energy<00:01:21.690> as<00:01:22.110> these

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
best use for the energy as these

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.340 
best use for the energy as these
stalkers<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.090> century<00:01:24.720> are<00:01:24.840> able<00:01:25.050> to<00:01:25.170> just

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
stalkers and century are able to just

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.840 
stalkers and century are able to just
take<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.680> as<00:01:25.800> much<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.130> these<00:01:26.220> Earthlings<00:01:26.640> as

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
take out as much of these Earthlings as

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.420 
take out as much of these Earthlings as
they<00:01:27.240> want<00:01:28.010> so<00:01:29.010> we're<00:01:29.100> going<00:01:29.190> to<00:01:29.340> take

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
absolutely forever to kill the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.560 
absolutely forever to kill the
destructible<00:01:32.100> rocks<00:01:32.220> or<00:01:32.970> cake<00:01:33.210> Tech<00:01:33.420> is

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
destructible rocks or cake Tech is

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.330 
destructible rocks or cake Tech is
finished<00:01:33.990> he's<00:01:34.170> got<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.619> work<00:01:34.830> gates<00:01:35.100> still

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
finished he's got to work gates still

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.180 
finished he's got to work gates still
only<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:37.050> one<00:01:37.320> Stargate<00:01:37.920> not

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
only and just the one Stargate not

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.700 
only and just the one Stargate not
taking<00:01:38.550> an<00:01:38.640> expansion<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.500> say<00:01:40.680> I

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
taking an expansion I have to say I

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.850 
taking an expansion I have to say I
don't<00:01:41.190> like<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.640> play<00:01:41.940> by<00:01:42.180> nanny<00:01:42.860> he's

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
going to be able to rush deep into this

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.729 
going to be able to rush deep into this
base<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.030> take<00:03:53.419> out<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:53.599> natural<00:03:54.079> expansion

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
base and take out the natural expansion

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.729 
base and take out the natural expansion
and<00:03:55.540> this<00:03:56.540> this<00:03:56.840> could<00:03:57.019> be<00:03:57.139> it<00:03:57.230> for<00:03:57.260> nany<00:03:57.620> I

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
and this this could be it for nany I

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.140 
and this this could be it for nany I
don't<00:03:58.010> think<00:03:58.190> he<00:03:58.250> can<00:03:58.400> really<00:03:58.430> recover<00:03:58.940> from

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
don't think he can really recover from

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.270 
don't think he can really recover from
this<00:03:59.329> with<00:03:59.930> only<00:04:00.079> two<00:04:00.230> production<00:04:00.919> buildings

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280

this with only two production buildings
and<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:02.500> Stargate<00:04:03.500> it's<00:04:03.709> it's<00:04:04.430> just<00:04:04.609> not<00:04:04.819> going

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
and a Stargate it's it's just not going

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.940 
and a Stargate it's it's just not going
to<00:04:05.030> be<00:04:05.150> enough<00:04:05.359> immortals<00:04:05.989> obviously<00:04:06.500> not<00:04:06.739> the

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
to be enough immortals obviously not the

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.430 
to be enough immortals obviously not the
correct<00:04:07.340> unit<00:04:07.700> against<00:04:07.940> erdlings<00:04:08.480> he<00:04:09.079> needed

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
correct unit against erdlings he needed

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.069 
correct unit against erdlings he needed
to<00:04:09.530> have<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:09.889> for<00:04:10.160> gateways<00:04:10.579> and<00:04:10.849> he's<00:04:11.840> just

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
to have that for gateways and he's just

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.170

tournament play for this game and I
guess<00:04:21.660> he<00:04:21.780> thought<00:04:21.930> he<00:04:22.050> had<00:04:22.140> his<00:04:22.230> ramp<00:04:22.470> blocked

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
guess he thought he had his ramp blocked

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.080 
guess he thought he had his ramp blocked
with<00:04:23.100> two<00:04:23.490> stalkers<00:04:23.880> but<00:04:24.390> it<00:04:24.660> did<00:04:24.900> not<00:04:24.930> work<00:04:26.090> so

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
with two stalkers but it did not work so

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.760 
with two stalkers but it did not work so
