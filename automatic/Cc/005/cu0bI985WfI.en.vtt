veins arteries transport oxygen-rich

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.320 
veins arteries transport oxygen-rich
blood<00:00:12.330> from<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.830> heart<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.219> other<00:00:14.910> parts<00:00:15.269> of

blood from the heart to other parts of
the<00:00:15.480> body<00:00:16.609> the<00:00:17.609> blood<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.210> arteries<00:00:18.840> is

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
the body the blood in the arteries is

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.250 
the body the blood in the arteries is
bright<00:00:19.500> red<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.100> color<00:00:20.430> as<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.810> rich<00:00:22.050> in

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
bright red in color as it is rich in

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.939 
bright red in color as it is rich in
oxygen<00:00:23.240> blood<00:00:24.240> flows<00:00:24.720> through<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.439> arteries

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
oxygen blood flows through the arteries

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.750 
oxygen blood flows through the arteries
in<00:00:26.279> spurts<00:00:26.820> at<00:00:27.240> high<00:00:27.810> pressure<00:00:28.429> hence<00:00:29.429> they

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
in spurts at high pressure hence they

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.709 
in spurts at high pressure hence they
have<00:00:29.789> thick<00:00:30.269> elastic<00:00:30.750> walls

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
have thick elastic walls

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.139

therefore<00:00:33.719> when<00:00:34.290> an<00:00:34.440> artery<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.219> cut<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
therefore when an artery is cut the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.340 
therefore when an artery is cut the
blood<00:00:36.540> spurts<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.320> quickly<00:00:38.809> on<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.170> other

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
blood spurts out quickly on the other

the heart the blood in the veins is dark

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.590 
the heart the blood in the veins is dark
red<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.610> color<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.960> poor<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.710> oxygen<00:00:53.600> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
red in color as it is poor in oxygen the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.380 
red in color as it is poor in oxygen the
veins<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.320> valves<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:56.250> their<00:00:56.579> inner<00:00:56.910> lining

veins have valves on their inner lining

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.650 
veins have valves on their inner lining
that<00:00:57.870> allow<00:00:58.350> blood<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> flow<00:00:59.370> only<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.300> one

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
that allow blood to flow only in one

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.109 
that allow blood to flow only in one
direction<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:02.370> towards<00:01:03.149> thought<00:01:05.119> the

direction that is towards thought the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.690 
direction that is towards thought the
blood<00:01:06.420> flows<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> veins<00:01:07.439> slowly<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
blood flows in the veins slowly and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.440 
blood flows in the veins slowly and
continuously<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:10.260> very<00:01:10.619> low<00:01:10.979> pressure<00:01:11.450> hence

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
continuously at very low pressure hence

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.550 
continuously at very low pressure hence
they<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:12.840> thin<00:01:13.380> walls<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:15.150> when<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> vein<00:01:16.290> is

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
they have thin walls so when a vein is

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.670 
they have thin walls so when a vein is
cut<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.490> blood<00:01:17.790> flows<00:01:18.150> out<00:01:18.420> slowly<00:01:18.900> but

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
cut the blood flows out slowly but
