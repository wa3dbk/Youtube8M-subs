00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.519
 he talks guys I have a mustache 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.880
 bringing another video for you and today 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.670
 trago prova or I just want to show you dribbles. 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.580
 efficient solutions that I was able to test 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.220
 playing online is so I thought 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.289
 It worked well and I want to pass it on to you. 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.500
 there are several drinks as well as 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.210
 fifa and the concept is also very similar 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.590
 When I do not know which of the games 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.750
 He invented the first this concept of 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.040
 two analog for you to dribble 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.180
 right is to make the right combos then you will look 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.059
 show you 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.690
 there are two ways you can understand 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.750
 There dribble automatic and manual 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.520
 Look, I'm just on the side. 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.710
 where it is in the pause menu select 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.750
 side of my control settings 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.550
 Automatic dribbling I'm going for a sim 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.549
 first I'll show you how it does 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.159
 the automatic dribble I found that from a 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.780
 difference fuck much in the dribble that I 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.350
 I'll show you. 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.259
 so that first dribble has not changed yet 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.689
 the last one you will see how different it is 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.150
 then I do it first must be 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.130
 secure back on the right analog and 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.310
 then choose a side to where I go 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.740
 with the left analog for example the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.140
 from Japan and jumped up right 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.390
 on the left side ronaldo and here at 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.360
 right side and you can give a 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.400
 cleaner played here you hide the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.810
 ball as you pull on the opposite side of the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.110
 player leg 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.540
 You hide the ball, I found it a lot. 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.369
 efficient the guys coming dry take 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.229
 ball and you give it a go 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.530
 works a little diagonally too 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.000
 and if you do it forward it does 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.729
 this message here 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.820
 if he has a specialty one can 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.219
 give that two tokyo and go out with 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.500
 more speed next other dribble 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.989
 would be a dribble that has I use a lot of 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.300
 fifa who is more at speed you go 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.180
 invest forward you put the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.950
 sorry 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.269
 I asked you behind the analogue right you 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.329
 will put forward not much to the 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:22.900
 front and went to the side 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:25.120
 looks're only seeing is that it has ronaldo 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.379
 this cut here but it is right he gives 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.060
 this turn is that he uses this cut but the 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:34.090
 majority of players let 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.230
 marcelo who even with the goalkeeper he does 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:43.780
 So he does this dribble here, okay? 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:46.599
 Let's see what's here modric and 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.950
 I thought it was also not so 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:54.370
 efficient, but you can clean the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.889
 move and left facing the goal 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:02.950
 these two dribles I think very efficient 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:05.409
 is the other dribble at very high speed 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.829
 good is the pull aside and leave 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.930
 his populated father running the player in the 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.819
 right analog and then forward 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.819
 to continue running, I'm fine I'm going to 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.979
 Up and ahead, look, he's going to give 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.590
 also a cleaner on the face you have 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:23.049
 no brand you are 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.900
 and here's the dribble I told you 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.430
 you what has gone ahead and put you to the 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.370
 player side 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.729
 this I use a lot in fifa I think 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.269
 very efficient 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:39.250
 now the guys are going to disable the dribble 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:45.189
 automatic black or the only one of these 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:47.319
 changes is the and been working so ok come 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:50.379
 it got much harder 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.680
 come on, I can still do that 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:56.650
 of pulling normally those of walking 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.819
 on the one hand the punk closed here 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.549
 quiet 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.459
 Only the dear turn I have to give 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:06.909
 a 360 starting in front of the player 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.569
 it's in the right analog so i do 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.939
 360 starting from the front and then 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:18.720
 I put it on the side, so let's go. 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:18.720
 try to make your normal turn 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:30.380
 It's pretty cool to do it, too. 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:35.810
 do this you need to rotate 360 â€‹â€‹and 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:37.760
 still put jumping guy is good and good 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.979
 more difficult, man 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.580
 Look, this is putting it in front of the 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:46.940
 The same thing there on the automatic is 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.250
 only you direct the offeror in the two 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.030
 analogue first right after the 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.840
 left 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:59.150
 so let's try to do it again 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:02.120
 that did not work in the sense 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.760
 anti-clock tv can do for any 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.960
 side the crew can turn anti-clockwise and 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.000
 clockwise and also doing spinning and 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:16.580
 getting clockwise 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.470
 Let's go ronaldo, this is it guys the dribbles 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.130
 really are the ones here 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.800
 I think it's really good because you 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.750
 can clear a move the guy comes 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.860
 very anxious to take the ball from you 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:33.800
 you give a little run and you start 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.599
 Boot in beauty goal and I just hope that 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.250
 have liked whether or not you liked it 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.620
 give your side share a video 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.930
 Beauty, I'll hang around a hug. 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.930
 mustache 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.930
 bye
