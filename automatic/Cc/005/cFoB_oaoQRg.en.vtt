feature commentary with director John
Singleton<00:01:43.399> and<00:01:44.119> I<00:01:44.779> think<00:01:45.619> John<00:01:45.859> Singleton<00:01:46.459> was

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:46.639 
Singleton and I think John Singleton was

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.789 
Singleton and I think John Singleton was
the<00:01:46.759> wrong<00:01:46.969> choice<00:01:47.359> for<00:01:47.389> this<00:01:47.840> film<00:01:48.109> obviously

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799
