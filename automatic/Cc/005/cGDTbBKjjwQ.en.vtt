00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.110
 dodo 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.250
 and, people, all right genre around here 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.170
 today a different video talking about 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.860
 neder portals 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.860
 Yeah 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.090
 since I play minecraft I always 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.279
 I know I will not say that since I 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.949
 play minecraft because I did not know 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.399
 portals at the beginning but when I 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.380
 just learned about nerd portals 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.559
 I always knew that we needed 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.340
 at least one thousand and 24 blocks away 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.930
 for kind of having two different portals 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.280
 and make a shortcut through medley 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.840
 last week I was playing there 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.180
 our adventure map of a couple in the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.559
 maine craft and had an inscription that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.210
 asked me why I was not 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.780
 shortcut by the neder instead of making the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.550
 manicardi line I think it's the 700 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.989
 lots of distance between personal life 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.539
 and our house 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.810
 I told you because I did not have 1,024 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.970
 office can not do so it is possible 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.939
 that I say no he will not send you one 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.970
 video that he taught and he sent the link to 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.470
 me in a Portuguese youtuber colleague 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.920
 explaining how to do this and really 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.680
 It works very cool, even talking in 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.780
 portugal a hug to friends 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.689
 portuguese who are here on the channel 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.790
 watching our videos every time 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.049
 More people from portugal around here 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.240
 I think I'll have more soon 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.020
 portuguese and brazilian watching our 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.970
 channel 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.470
 I'm recording this video today in 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.860
 Sunday morning 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.649
 I know tonight at 7:00 a.m. 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.210
 night will have the second game portugal 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.430
 versus united states 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.770
 I hope this time you win because 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.420
 lose 4 germany in the first game not 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.829
 It was not pretty at all. 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.509
 but at least I think states 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.380
 united and win I think you can 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.810
 gain will be rooting for you will 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.850
 have in the video description the link of the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.670
 his channel is because nothing beats the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.879
 people give credit to who they really deserve 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.250
 It's very cool that he shared this. 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.410
 I wanted to bring 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.040
 This is my channel and show it to 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.660
 You because in the video of tomorrow I go 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.420
 is showing this 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.510
 this shortcut made by the neder with less 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.640
 one thousand in 24 blocks away 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.860
 I made a small representation here 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.900
 to show you how we're going 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.970
 do this so I voted here to 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.400
 flag of rio grande do sul 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.570
 signaling my first portal or 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.360
 open mouth 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.870
 this creative thing does not 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.300
 I messed up and did it there. 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.600
 the flag of Portugal in honor 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.800
 to the Portuguese signaling the second 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.170
 for as you can see in less than 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.690
 24 blocks away ne 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.350
 I think there should be 30 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.780
 blocks between one portal and another 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.220
 What do we have to do? 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.940
 we have to get a point here between 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.280
 this portal and note the coordinates for 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.370
 be able to create it by never 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:24.380
 because if I make another portal if I 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.239
 link this portal and enter it here I 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.980
 I'm going to leave here on my river portal. 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.519
 great southern 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.709
 But I do not want I want out there in 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:38.930
 portugal portal 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:41.570
 I already checked there I'll leave it 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.780
 show you guys this way 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:48.640
 Quiet to do first thing is 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.040
 We'll disconnect this portal and write it down. 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:04:00.230
 here is the coordinate that we are 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:04.459
 I'm here in the menu 195 x and 157 in the 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:08.150
 What we have to do is split this 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:11.230
 here for eight because it is 8 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.690
 every block we walk in the neder 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.459
 equals eight blocks here in our 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.200
 normal world 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.580
 I already lived it here it's here it 's notice 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:26.840
 Dinho's side will give less 24 point 37 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.270
 by 19 points and 62 is showing up in the 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.770
 screen 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.530
 for you to see right how it works 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.520
 let's go our main portal down there 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.129
 south and we will enter the medley 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.909
 I'm here on the portal of the rio grande do 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.870
 south 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:49.139
 I'll call the f3 here, I'll get here. 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:54.360
 I have already made it clear that 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:56.250
 would be at least 24 by 19 or ignoring 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.349
 these numbers on the side because it will not 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.720
 make no difference touch one more 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:08.310
 block - aquino neder and I'll make one 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:11.099
 another portal here that will be the portal 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.750
 from Portugal 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:20.430
 When I call here I go into it and 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:24.240
 To take out we are in the portal of portugal 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:28.139
 so it's possible, yes, we can do two 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.389
 independent portals within a thousand 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.490
 24 blocks away 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.530
 now I want to go to the Rio Grande do Sul there 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.979
 only this path is too long 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.289
 I 'm going to fight for the neder I go 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.810
 neverton on my portugal portal come 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.190
 walking to the side entered the portal of the 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.680
 Rio Grande do Sul 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.729
 I'm here on the portal of the rio grande do 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.139
 south 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:57.750
 they saw that quiet very simple even 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:01.500
 thanks to your help both the 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.440
 who wrote the tip about the 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.180
 channel and if from portugal you did tutorial 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.020

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.050
 you 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.270
 Let's recap then, take the 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:17.099
 coordinator of the portal where you want 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:22.440
 in the world the coordinated nokia of x and z 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:23.520
 of life eight will neder make a portal 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.740
 over there 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.500
 call inside because you 're not 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.990
 with the synchronized portal 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.460
 It's not so hard, I'll be. 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.529

 of good minecraft today's video was 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:43.200
 short but I think it was very valid

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.440
