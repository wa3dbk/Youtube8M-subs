talked<00:00:20.460> about<00:00:20.640> whether<00:00:20.970> or<00:00:21.240> not<00:00:21.390> we<00:00:21.930> might<00:00:22.140> put

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
talked about whether or not we might put

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.890 
talked about whether or not we might put
some<00:00:22.859> Easter<00:00:23.130> eggs<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.490> there<00:00:23.730> for<00:00:24.119> for<00:00:24.689> some

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
some Easter eggs in there for for some

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.630 
some Easter eggs in there for for some
things<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:25.769> wanted<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.460> make<00:00:26.609> sure

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
things and we just wanted to make sure

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.519 
things and we just wanted to make sure
that<00:00:27.060> we<00:00:27.210> didn't<00:00:27.480> preclude<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:28.439> when

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
that we didn't preclude it I think when

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.140 
that we didn't preclude it I think when
we're<00:00:28.650> making<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> film<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.490> really<00:00:29.939> have<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
we're making the film I really have the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.030 
we're making the film I really have the
philosophy<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:30.840> if<00:00:30.960> we<00:00:31.080> get<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.859> need<00:00:31.949> get

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
philosophy of like if we get we need get

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.590 
philosophy of like if we get we need get
Superman<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.700> order<00:00:32.969> right

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
Superman in order right

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.950 
Superman in order right
you<00:00:33.960> seem<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.230> get<00:00:34.320> his<00:00:34.469> house<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.890> order<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
you seem to get his house in order and

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.799 
you seem to get his house in order and
we<00:00:36.960> need<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.140> put<00:00:37.260> blinders<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.129> not<00:00:38.809> look

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
we need to put blinders on and not look

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.540 
we need to put blinders on and not look
there's<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.170> lot<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.590> distractions<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.460> you

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
there's a lot of distractions that you

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.010 
there's a lot of distractions that you
could<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> really<00:00:42.600> felt<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:42.899> we

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
could have but I really felt like we

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.779 
could have but I really felt like we
need<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.290> focus<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.739> him<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.010> knew<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
need to focus on him I knew that the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.750 
need to focus on him I knew that the
world<00:00:44.910> would<00:00:45.090> fall<00:00:45.300> off<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.750> him<00:00:45.930> if<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:47.460> was

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
world would fall off of him if that was

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.160 
world would fall off of him if that was
a<00:00:47.789> thing<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.059> needed<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.420> happen<00:00:48.570> after<00:00:49.050> this

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
a thing that needed to happen after this

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.189 
a thing that needed to happen after this
movie<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> really<00:00:50.850> though<00:00:51.629> might<00:00:52.110> have

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
movie and so I really though might have

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.450 
movie and so I really though might have
been<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> back<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.620> my<00:00:52.710> mind<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.039> little<00:00:53.100> bit<00:00:53.250> I

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
been the back of my mind a little bit I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.029 
been the back of my mind a little bit I
really<00:00:53.789> tried<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.000> focus<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.420> Superman<00:00:55.039> what's

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
really tried to focus on Superman what's

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.830

job<00:01:43.509> with<00:01:43.659> Batman<00:01:44.170> I<00:01:44.319> think<00:01:44.590> there's<00:01:45.130> a

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
job with Batman I think there's a

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.800 
job with Batman I think there's a
challenge<00:01:45.759> here<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.299> keep<00:01:46.479> it<00:01:46.630> modern<00:01:47.560> yet

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
iconic the same way it used to be I

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.399 
iconic the same way it used to be I
think<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:51.939> everybody<00:01:52.359> wants<00:01:52.539> something

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409

felt that actually the fans also wanted

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.550 
felt that actually the fans also wanted
us<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.879> bring<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.239> character<00:02:10.690> into<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:10.989> 21st
