showed how you wash them out how I made
covers<00:00:26.960> for<00:00:27.199> the<00:00:27.789> jars<00:00:28.789> and<00:00:28.910> stuff<00:00:29.140> and<00:00:30.140> here's

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
covers for the jars and stuff and here's

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.060 
covers for the jars and stuff and here's
uh<00:00:31.840> if<00:00:32.840> this<00:00:33.019> is<00:00:33.079> what<00:00:33.350> happens<00:00:33.769> in<00:00:33.949> the

overnight and here it is morning and

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.689 
overnight and here it is morning and
they<00:00:41.480> ballooned<00:00:42.470> out<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.070> much<00:00:43.780> that<00:00:44.780> they

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
they ballooned out so much that they

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.189 
they ballooned out so much that they
actually<00:00:46.699> threatened<00:00:47.150> to<00:00:47.300> fill<00:00:47.930> up<00:00:48.050> the

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
actually threatened to fill up the

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:54.889 
actually threatened to fill up the
entire<00:00:48.500> jar<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.730> start<00:00:50.089> coming<00:00:50.480> out<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:50.780> top

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:09.750 

they've<00:00:59.750> all<00:00:59.960> sprouted<00:01:00.530> very<00:01:00.770> nicely

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.870

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
taste you know at the texture and

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.880 
taste you know at the texture and
everything<00:01:20.980> tastes<00:01:21.610> acceptable<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.890> some

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
people who are not used to sprouting

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.420 
people who are not used to sprouting
they<00:01:27.970> will<00:01:28.180> say<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.660> it's<00:01:28.900> uh<00:01:29.200> you<00:01:30.160> know<00:01:30.280> it's

you<00:02:00.790> can<00:02:00.970> also<00:02:02.250> continue<00:02:03.250> on<00:02:03.580> with<00:02:03.820> these<00:02:04.030> for

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
you can also continue on with these for

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.520 
you can also continue on with these for
a<00:02:04.360> time<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:05.290> if<00:02:06.250> you<00:02:06.430> notice<00:02:08.520> sprout<00:02:10.530> is

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
a time and if you notice sprout is

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.780 
a time and if you notice sprout is
actually<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.400> little<00:02:12.730> bit<00:02:12.850> green<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:14.700> don't<00:02:15.700> know

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
actually a little bit green I don't know

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.270 
actually a little bit green I don't know
if<00:02:15.880> this<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.060> coming<00:02:16.540> through<00:02:16.750> on<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.980> video

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
if this is coming through on the video

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.740 
if this is coming through on the video
well<00:02:18.970> but<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:20.290> green<00:02:20.560> part<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.370> sprout

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
well but the green part is the sprout

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.770 
well but the green part is the sprout
the<00:02:22.750> white<00:02:23.790> part<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:26.260> root<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.780> you

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
the white part is the the root and you

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.440 
the white part is the the root and you
can<00:02:29.140> leave<00:02:29.350> these<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.950> Sun<00:02:30.190> for<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.000> bit<00:02:31.270> and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
can leave these in the Sun for a bit and

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.280 
can leave these in the Sun for a bit and
they<00:02:32.410> will<00:02:32.590> turn<00:02:32.830> green<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.900> can<00:02:34.930> have

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
they will turn green and you can have

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.220 
they will turn green and you can have
them<00:02:35.530> for<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.800> vegetable

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.869 

like<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.530> green<00:02:40.830> vegetable<00:02:41.129> instead<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.790> a

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
like a green vegetable instead of a

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.720 
like a green vegetable instead of a
sprout<00:02:42.180> you'll<00:02:42.870> have<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.080> green<00:02:43.319> vegetable<00:02:43.730> and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
sprout you'll have a green vegetable and

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.650 
sprout you'll have a green vegetable and
I<00:02:45.660> suppose<00:02:46.260> there's<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.650> little<00:02:46.980> bit<00:02:47.129> different

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
I suppose there's a little bit different

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.309 
I suppose there's a little bit different
nutrient<00:02:48.660> content<00:02:49.140> when<00:02:49.830> they<00:02:49.860> go<00:02:50.220> green<00:02:51.319> but

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
nutrient content when they go green but

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.690 
nutrient content when they go green but
at<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.560> point<00:02:52.800> you're<00:02:52.980> probably<00:02:53.160> gonna<00:02:53.459> have

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
at that point you're probably gonna have

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.030 
at that point you're probably gonna have
to<00:02:53.760> cook<00:02:54.030> them<00:02:54.290> because<00:02:55.290> they're<00:02:55.709> it's<00:02:55.890> gonna

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
to cook them because they're it's gonna

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.720 
to cook them because they're it's gonna
start<00:02:56.640> tasting<00:02:56.849> like<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.239> branch<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.930> tree

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
start tasting like a branch of a tree

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.309 
start tasting like a branch of a tree
they<00:02:59.730> get<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.090> tough<00:03:02.030> so

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:13.180 

those<00:03:06.920> are<00:03:07.069> my<00:03:07.219> wheat<00:03:07.400> sprouts

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.280 

okay

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
okay

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.219 
okay
