bringing in the sriracha hot sauce so

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.750 
bringing in the sriracha hot sauce so
I'm<00:02:41.859> going<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.069> be<00:02:42.159> using<00:02:42.250> about<00:02:42.549> two

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
I'm going to be using about two

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.429 
I'm going to be using about two
tablespoons<00:02:42.939> of<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:43.659> you<00:02:43.900> guys<00:02:44.019> can<00:02:44.290> add

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
tablespoons of this you guys can add

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.099 
tablespoons of this you guys can add
more<00:02:44.709> if<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.189> want<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.700> but<00:02:46.060> I<00:02:46.329> really<00:02:47.079> think

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
more if you want to but I really think

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.009 
more if you want to but I really think
two<00:02:47.739> tablespoons<00:02:48.519> is<00:02:48.819> good<00:02:49.239> enough<00:02:49.450> otherwise

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
two tablespoons is good enough otherwise

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.710 
two tablespoons is good enough otherwise
it<00:02:50.379> can<00:02:50.500> become<00:02:50.650> too<00:02:51.280> spicy<00:02:51.909> so<00:02:52.209> once<00:02:52.450> that<00:02:52.540> is

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
it can become too spicy so once that is

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.500 
it can become too spicy so once that is
done<00:02:52.750> what<00:02:53.079> I<00:02:53.109> do<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.590> just<00:02:53.980> kind<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.510> mix

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
done what I do is just kind of mix

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.690 
done what I do is just kind of mix
everything<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.680> give<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.400> good<00:02:57.579> flip<00:02:59.700> so

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
everything and give it a good flip so

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.420 
everything and give it a good flip so
that<00:03:00.909> everything<00:03:01.329> just<00:03:01.569> kinda<00:03:02.139> is<00:03:02.430> well

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
that everything just kinda is well

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.670 
that everything just kinda is well
combined<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.689> once<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:04.989> is<00:03:05.200> all<00:03:05.349> done<00:03:05.500> I'm

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680
