00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
because it's big it's wide open it

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.810

recommend<00:00:43.260> pushing<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.980> map<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.340> all

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
recommend pushing on this map at all

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.160 
recommend pushing on this map at all
court<00:00:44.760> points<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.300> means<00:00:45.450> taking<00:00:45.600> all<00:00:45.930> three

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
court points that means taking all three

court points that means taking all three
objectives<00:00:46.800> when<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.730> push<00:00:47.969> people<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.809> map

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
objectives when you push people this map

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.200 
objectives when you push people this map
becomes<00:00:49.440> very<00:00:49.770> very<00:00:50.340> simple<00:00:50.730> you'll<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.180> a

any<00:03:39.720> given<00:03:39.989> game<00:03:40.020> right<00:03:40.380> there's<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.680> point

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
any given game right there's the point

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.850 
any given game right there's the point
where<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.580> guy<00:03:41.730> actually<00:03:42.470> outsmarted<00:03:43.470> me<00:03:43.560> and

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
where the guy actually outsmarted me and

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.600 
where the guy actually outsmarted me and
lo<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.310> behold<00:03:44.400> as<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.760> level<00:03:45.060> 18<00:03:45.450> dude<00:03:45.739> but<00:03:46.739> you

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
lo and behold as a level 18 dude but you

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.680 
lo and behold as a level 18 dude but you
got<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:47.790> just<00:03:47.970> get<00:03:48.120> back<00:03:48.269> on<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.510> grind

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
got to just get back on the grind

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.120 
got to just get back on the grind
there's<00:03:49.019> no<00:03:49.140> black<00:03:49.380> bird<00:03:49.590> up<00:03:49.709> at<00:03:49.800> this<00:03:49.890> point

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
there's no black bird up at this point

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.310 
there's no black bird up at this point
so<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.120> try<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.720> do<00:03:51.900> something<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.290> little

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
so I try to do something a little

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.750 
so I try to do something a little
differently<00:03:52.800> because<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:53.070> know<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.250> can't<00:03:53.519> hold

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
differently because I know I can't hold

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.220 
differently because I know I can't hold
that<00:03:53.790> area<00:03:54.150> without<00:03:54.269> black<00:03:54.660> bird<00:03:54.870> because<00:03:55.110> you

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
that area without black bird because you

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.990 
that area without black bird because you
got<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.680> know<00:03:55.800> when<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.070> spawn<00:03:56.310> flips<00:03:56.670> you<00:03:56.820> got

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
got to know when the spawn flips you got

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.090 
got to know when the spawn flips you got
to<00:03:57.120> do<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.390> so<00:03:58.050> I'm<00:03:58.260> just<00:03:58.410> basically<00:03:58.709> going<00:03:58.950> out

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100

in about 20 seconds here bouncing back
and<00:04:34.650> forth<00:04:34.740> just<00:04:35.250> trying<00:04:35.790> to<00:04:35.910> do<00:04:36.389> it<00:04:36.540> I<00:04:36.660> think<00:04:36.720> I

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
and forth just trying to do it I think I

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.030 
and forth just trying to do it I think I
think<00:04:37.169> there's<00:04:37.290> only<00:04:37.320> two<00:04:37.650> people<00:04:37.919> in<00:04:37.979> the

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
think there's only two people in the

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.219 
think there's only two people in the
game<00:04:38.220> at<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.490> point<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:39.540> that's<00:04:39.930> why<00:04:40.080> I'm

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
game at this point so that's why I'm

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.840 
game at this point so that's why I'm
leaning<00:04:40.770> back<00:04:40.949> and<00:04:40.979> forth<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.639> I'm<00:04:41.729> just

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
leaning back and forth and I'm just

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.030 
leaning back and forth and I'm just
hoping<00:04:42.150> he<00:04:42.210> spawns<00:04:42.600> on<00:04:42.780> load<00:04:42.960> store<00:04:43.229> so<00:04:43.830> I<00:04:43.889> see

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
hoping he spawns on load store so I see

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.469 
hoping he spawns on load store so I see
there's<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.280> guy<00:04:44.430> behind<00:04:44.580> me<00:04:44.850> on<00:04:44.940> a<00:04:45.060> so<00:04:45.120> he's<00:04:45.330> not

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
there's a guy behind me on a so he's not

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.150 
there's a guy behind me on a so he's not
going<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.690> spawn<00:04:45.930> delay<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.740> can<00:04:46.860> use<00:04:47.040> your

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
going to spawn delay you can use your

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.900 
going to spawn delay you can use your
team<00:04:47.370> as<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.580> really<00:04:48.090> really<00:04:48.300> good<00:04:49.910> indication

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910

bored of using the load starts it seems

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.700 
bored of using the load starts it seems
like<00:06:00.419> i<00:06:00.479> can<00:06:00.599> get<00:06:00.690> more<00:06:00.840> kills<00:06:01.110> outside<00:06:01.590> the
