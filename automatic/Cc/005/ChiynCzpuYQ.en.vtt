00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
into the vast Pacific Ocean you think

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.720 
into the vast Pacific Ocean you think
you<00:02:39.690> think<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.959> know<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.410> out<00:02:40.620> there<00:02:40.860> but

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
you think you know it's out there but

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.220 
you think you know it's out there but
you<00:02:41.880> keep<00:02:42.030> bumping<00:02:42.269> into<00:02:42.480> continents

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
you keep bumping into continents

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.840 
you keep bumping into continents
and<00:02:43.560> even<00:02:44.489> though<00:02:44.580> I'm<00:02:44.730> conducting<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:46.850> even

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
and even though I'm conducting and even

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.740 
and even though I'm conducting and even
though<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.000> wrote<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.540> piece<00:02:48.750> it's<00:02:49.440> still<00:02:49.860> a

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
though I wrote the piece it's still a

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.259 
though I wrote the piece it's still a
voyage<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.930> discovery<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.769> think<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:54.000> such<00:02:54.150> an

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
voyage of discovery I think it's such an

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.330 
voyage of discovery I think it's such an
event<00:02:54.540> for<00:02:54.750> Sydney<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.260> be<00:02:55.410> performing<00:02:56.130> now
