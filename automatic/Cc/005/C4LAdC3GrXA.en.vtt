00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
rigging and now we can see how is and

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.589 
rigging and now we can see how is and
sorry<00:00:13.549> medium<00:00:14.549> point<00:00:14.820> for<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.120> people<00:00:15.360> point

sorry medium point for the people point

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.130 
sorry medium point for the people point
ok<00:00:15.900> it's<00:00:16.470> much<00:00:16.949> better<00:00:17.400> ok<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.720> can<00:00:18.900> move

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
ok it's much better ok you can move

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.740 
ok it's much better ok you can move
forward<00:00:19.500> card<00:00:19.920> character<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.939> not<00:00:21.150> perfect

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
forward card character is not perfect

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.880 
forward card character is not perfect
but<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.670> much<00:00:23.670> better<00:00:24.529> one<00:00:25.529> more<00:00:25.680> thing<00:00:25.710> that

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
but it's much better one more thing that

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.730 
but it's much better one more thing that
we<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.390> see<00:00:27.599> here<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.439> a

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
we can do you can see here we have a

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.189 
we can do you can see here we have a
problem<00:00:29.130> right<00:00:29.609> here<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:30.090> deformation<00:00:30.539> problem

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
problem right here a deformation problem

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.080 
problem right here a deformation problem
we<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:31.949> correct<00:00:32.099> him<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:34.020> edit<00:00:34.380> mode<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.100> if

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
we can correct him in in edit mode so if

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.240 
we can correct him in in edit mode so if
I<00:00:36.360> select<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.649> mesh<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.640> go<00:00:38.820> into<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
I select the mesh and I go into the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.389 
I select the mesh and I go into the
modifier<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.170> modify<00:00:43.440> here's<00:00:43.920> my

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
modifier of I have to modify here's my

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.850 
modifier of I have to modify here's my
mistake<00:00:44.820> sorry<00:00:47.090> well<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.020> read<00:00:49.260> this

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
mistake sorry well I have to read this

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.330 
mistake sorry well I have to read this
one<00:00:50.129> sorry<00:00:50.309> ok<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:52.199> will<00:00:52.410> find<00:00:52.770> if<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.129> go

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
one sorry ok we we will find if you go

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.630 
one sorry ok we we will find if you go
here<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.820> will<00:00:53.940> find<00:00:54.239> our<00:00:55.129> armature<00:00:56.129> modifier

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
here we will find our armature modifier

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.400 
here we will find our armature modifier
ok<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.399> we<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> few<00:01:01.350> things

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
ok so we have we can do a few things

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.109 
ok so we have we can do a few things
first<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.500> check<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.710> preset<00:01:05.670> volume

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
first is and check this preset volume

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.090 
first is and check this preset volume
and<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:07.610> make<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> deformation<00:01:09.360> up<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.740> little

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and it make a deformation up a little

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.109 
and it make a deformation up a little
bit<00:01:11.280> better<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.990> solution

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
bit better but it's not the solution

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.910 
bit better but it's not the solution
usually<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.150> haven't<00:01:15.450> used<00:01:15.630> bone<00:01:15.960> envelope<00:01:16.590> no

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
usually I haven't used bone envelope no

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.679 
usually I haven't used bone envelope no
usually<00:01:17.100> because<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.759> game<00:01:18.060> engine<00:01:18.479> don't

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
usually because the game engine don't

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.590 
usually because the game engine don't
work<00:01:18.900> swung<00:01:19.290> envelopes<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
work swung envelopes so we have to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.840 
work swung envelopes so we have to
uncheck<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.950> want<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.430> use<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
uncheck it if we want to use the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.170 
uncheck it if we want to use the
animation<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.450> game<00:01:25.110> named<00:01:25.290> Jim<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.180> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
animation in the game named Jim and to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.240 
animation in the game named Jim and to
correct<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.200> want<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:30.829> remove<00:01:31.829> some

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
correct this I want to a remove some

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.679 
correct this I want to a remove some
bets<00:01:32.490> from<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.990> bone<00:01:34.619> T<00:01:35.220> hi<00:01:35.400> dot<00:01:35.850> l<00:01:36.119> for

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
bets from this bone T hi dot l for

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.130 
bets from this bone T hi dot l for
example<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.369> go<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.640> edit<00:01:39.420> mode<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.810> lose

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
example and if I go to edit mode I lose

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.620 
example and if I go to edit mode I lose
the<00:01:40.530> deformation<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:42.270> see<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the deformation so to see the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.719 
the deformation so to see the
information<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.470> edit<00:01:43.860> mode<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.520> push

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
information in edit mode I have to push

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.719 
information in edit mode I have to push
here<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.649> here<00:01:46.649> that's<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.729> can

i'm going to a spine bone spyware are

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.780 
i'm going to a spine bone spyware are
you<00:02:38.350> here<00:02:39.280> I'm<00:02:39.970> going<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.270> assign<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:42.220> the

you here I'm going to assign so the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.810 
you here I'm going to assign so the
information<00:02:43.360> now<00:02:43.540> it's<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:44.380> little<00:02:45.370> bit<00:02:45.520> better

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
information now it's a little bit better

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.390 
information now it's a little bit better
my<00:02:46.480> opinion<00:02:46.990> much<00:02:47.440> better<00:02:48.720> okay<00:02:49.720> i<00:02:50.100> can<00:02:51.100> i<00:02:51.280> can

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
now we have rigging skinit model that we

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.020 
now we have rigging skinit model that we
can<00:04:30.760> use<00:04:30.790> to<00:04:31.060> make<00:04:32.039> animation<00:04:33.039> in<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.639> next

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
can use to make animation in the next

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.610 
can use to make animation in the next
tutorial<00:04:34.260> we<00:04:35.260> will<00:04:35.289> learn<00:04:35.530> how<00:04:36.130> to<00:04:36.160> make<00:04:37.620> pose
