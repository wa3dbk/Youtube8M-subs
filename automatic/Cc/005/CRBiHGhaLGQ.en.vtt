00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
pattern right now like it's kind of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.670 
pattern right now like it's kind of
chained<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.619> brushed<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> with

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
chained like I brushed do it with

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.990 
chained like I brushed do it with
conditioner<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.920> my<00:01:59.159> paddle<00:01:59.520> brush<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.969> then

brush<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.540> brush<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.140> should

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
brush you like brush to it I should

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.609 
brush you like brush to it I should
record<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.040> vo<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.520> while<00:02:06.320> washing<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.439> because

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
record a vo and while washing it because

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.609 
record a vo and while washing it because
it<00:02:07.770> was<00:02:07.799> beautiful<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:10.259> here<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.500> a

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
it was beautiful but so here is a

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.520 
it was beautiful but so here is a
pattern<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.780> right<00:02:12.780> now

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
pattern like right now

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.280 
pattern like right now
but<00:02:13.830> it's<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.610> process<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.120> drawing<00:02:15.450> it's

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
but it's in the process of drawing it's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.010 
but it's in the process of drawing it's
not<00:02:16.500> pulled<00:02:16.740> apart<00:02:16.890> yet<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.450> uniform

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
not pulled apart yet so it is uniform

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.770 
not pulled apart yet so it is uniform
curl<00:02:19.319> pattern<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:20.520> will<00:02:21.000> pull<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.720> apart

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
curl pattern but I will pull it apart

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.230 
curl pattern but I will pull it apart
when<00:02:22.230> i<00:02:22.260> install<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.130> which<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:23.910> far<00:02:24.209> from
