00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.440
 to sit on a chair 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.880

 Helmut Kohl 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.800
 because the workload and Dr

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.110
 govern yourself badly 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.180
 Helmut Kohl the conserved he is totally unable in the activity report in 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.609
 He asserted that the political crisis was going to be a scourge 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.100
 Dr

 Aston Martin 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.290
 First of all, the house is the line on the wrong 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.680
 in his eyes Gerold 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.540
 That's good this year 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.880
 but I say 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.680
 Barig by chance at the head of a government in the fortunately the SBB the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.180
 most decisions 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.990
 and I had time 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.450
 for the really important things 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.140
 so I have already piece by piece 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.340
 aim for a definitive solution to and 14 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 and I'm ready for the big career now

 kamp-lintfort music 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:17.200
 the crisis has shot here 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.309
 the mood in the field Lian see Bank Handlowy scored 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:26.269
 Experts hope that the next with a bit of luck comes from the money too 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.889
 something co 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:31.239
 that the economy itself 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.029
 the plan on 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:34.069
 more money is still being distributed 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.329
 sometimes I dream of the education plan 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.529
 and an attitude so often track is insanity 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.729
 in the first phase 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.799
 Lehmann

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.929
 The water is actually growing the economy 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:14.249

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.029
 negligently 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:50.499

 the Swiss women who wins 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:05.859
 This trend sees all senders suffering our damage 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.519
 because it is a pity 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.759
 people use their biggest benefit 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:12.759
