00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.733
Hello everyone, it's Aunt Frenita.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.666
Today's story is called: A New World

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:25.566
The memory verse is from Genesis, Chapter 1 verse 1.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.633
It says:

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.700
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.900
Today's message is

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.033
"We worship God when we thank Him for creating our world."

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:42.133
Have you ever noticed how beautiful nature is?

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.633
The colors of a butterfly,

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:46.630
the beauty of a sunset,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.630
or the amazing stars.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.900
All these,didn't just happen.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.066
God planned each one, as part of the perfect world He created.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.566
God had a plan to create a world.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.500
He wanted this world to be beautiful and full of creature that would walk

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.500
fly, crawl,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.500
swim, and talk.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:15.600
God found a dark, empty, watery spot in the universe.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.500
He said: "Let there be light." And light appeared.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.466
God called the light, day, and the darkness, night. 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.200
The light was morning, and the dark was night.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.300
Together, these were the first day.

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:33.966
But everything was still watery.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.433
Not good for walking, flying, or crawling.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.800
So God spoke again.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:43.333
"Let there be something to divide the water in two."

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.733
The water divided into two parts

00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:48.730
with a space in between.

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:52.333
The space was dry, and light, and blue.

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:55.833
God called the upper part, sky,

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:57.830
it was the second day.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.166
Next, God decided to make a place where creatures could walk and crawl.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.300
He said,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.300
"Water, come together, make room for dry ground."

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.266
God called the ground, land.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.500
He called the water that was left, seas.

00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:19.066
He looked at the land and said.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.433
"Produce plants and trees for food and shelter."

00:02:23.233 --> 00:02:27.833
This happened on the third day, and God saw that it was good.

00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:31.300
Then God was ready to make lights.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.133
He said, "Lights, hang yourselves in the sky."

00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:37.300
And lights appeared.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.800
A big one, the Sun, marked the day.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.233
A smaller one, the moon, marked the night.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.533
Together, with smaller lights, the stars,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.600
they would mark the seasons and years.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.500
With these day markers in place,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.766
God ended the fourth day.

00:02:57.166 --> 00:03:00.433
And God saw, that it was good.

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:05.133
Now the earth was ready for some of the creatures God had planned.

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:08.700
"Sea creatures, the water is ready for you.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.966
Birds, the air is ready for you,"

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.200
said God.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.966
And fish and birds appeared.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.966
God blessed them saying, "Fill the seas, fill the air.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.466
Multiply and fill the earth."

00:03:23.966 --> 00:03:26.200
That ended the fifth day.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.733
And God saw that it was good.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.166
The next day God said,

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:34.160
"I am ready to make animals."

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:36.160
And He did.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.866
Large ones and small ones.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.300
He told the animals to multiply and fill the earth. 

00:03:42.733 --> 00:03:44.833
But He wasn't finished yet.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.300
"Let us make man in our image." He said.

00:03:49.766 --> 00:03:52.066
Then God did something different.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.800
He gathered up some clay, and began to shape it.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.200
He formed it into a creature with two legs,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.100
two arms, a body and a head.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.033
Then God breathed into the face of the creature.

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:10.466
And the creature opened its eyes and sat up.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:12.460
It was a man!

00:04:13.066 --> 00:04:15.666
God called the man, Adam

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.900
He showed everything He had just made.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.366
"This is for you Adam, take care of it."

00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:26.366
Then God put Adam to sleep.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.266
While Adam was sleeping, God took Adam's rib\

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.466
and made a wife for him.

00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:37.266
When Adam saw his wife, he exclaimed,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.166
"You are my perfect partner!"

00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:42.160
He called her Eve.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.700
And that was the end of the sixth day. 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.833
And God saw all that He had made, and it was very good.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:55.466
The next day God looked at all the good things He had made.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.400
And He, and Adam and Eve,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.166
and all the other creatures rested

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.733
and enjoyed their new home.

00:05:03.733 --> 00:05:05.730
It was the seventh day.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.933
The wonderful day we call: Sabbath.

00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:13.466
God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy. 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.666
because on it he rested from all the work of creating that He had done.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.300
God's new world, was complete.
