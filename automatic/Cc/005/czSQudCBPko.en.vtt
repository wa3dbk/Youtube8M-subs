similar to Jala's it works long distance

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.150 
similar to Jala's it works long distance
very<00:00:42.080> well<00:00:43.630> good<00:00:44.630> for<00:00:44.900> taking<00:00:45.320> enemies<00:00:45.800> slowly

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
normally quickly Cong whose weapon is

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.020 
normally quickly Cong whose weapon is
like<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:52.820> laser<00:00:53.090> shotgun<00:00:54.250> is<00:00:55.250> very<00:00:55.610> good<00:00:55.790> close

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
like a laser shotgun is very good close

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.850 
like a laser shotgun is very good close
range<00:00:56.330> but<00:00:56.540> if<00:00:56.660> his<00:00:56.780> long<00:00:56.960> distance<00:00:57.410> it<00:00:57.590> isn't

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
range but if his long distance it isn't

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.680 
range but if his long distance it isn't
so<00:00:57.980> good<00:00:58.160> because<00:00:58.520> if<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:59.059> look<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.330> lasers

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
so good because if you look the lasers

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.140 
so good because if you look the lasers
spread<00:01:00.020> out<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.379> obviously<00:01:01.100> one<00:01:01.520> will<00:01:02.000> do<00:01:02.120> a

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
spread out and obviously one will do a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.540 
spread out and obviously one will do a
lot<00:01:02.360> less<00:01:02.540> damage<00:01:02.720> to<00:01:02.900> several<00:01:03.470> there's<00:01:04.460> also

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
lot less damage to several there's also

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.730 
lot less damage to several there's also
glitch<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:05.000> can<00:01:05.119> do<00:01:05.210> with<00:01:05.330> Congo<00:01:05.720> be<00:01:06.170> sure<00:01:06.440> and

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
glitch you can do with Congo be sure and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.160 
glitch you can do with Congo be sure and
then<00:01:07.310> switch<00:01:07.610> quickly<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:08.390> get<00:01:08.509> the<00:01:08.690> floating

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
then switch quickly you get the floating

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.570 
then switch quickly you get the floating
fire<00:01:09.440> in<00:01:09.649> midair<00:01:09.950> from<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.280> end<00:01:10.399> of<00:01:10.490> his

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
fire in midair from the end of his

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.969 
fire in midair from the end of his
weapon<00:01:10.930> it's<00:01:11.930> pretty<00:01:12.110> cool<00:01:12.320> and<00:01:12.560> then<00:01:12.890> you

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
weapon it's pretty cool and then you

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.830 
weapon it's pretty cool and then you
turn<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:13.160> back<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:13.369> goes<00:01:13.640> out<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.450> next<00:01:14.630> up<00:01:14.780> is

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
he has a beam attack which is very

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.360 
he has a beam attack which is very
similar<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.690> Polly's<00:02:53.140> but<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.500> it's<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.190> bit

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
similar to Polly's but it it's a bit

similar to Polly's but it it's a bit
quite<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.610> bit<00:02:54.790> weaker<00:02:55.500> usually<00:02:56.500> for<00:02:56.680> similar

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
quite a bit weaker usually for similar

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.650 
quite a bit weaker usually for similar
sort<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.280> things<00:02:57.520> but<00:02:57.640> really<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.300> just<00:02:58.450> want

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
sort of things but really you just want

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.530 
sort of things but really you just want
to<00:02:58.720> use<00:02:58.840> Kali

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.960 

see<00:03:03.540> works<00:03:03.750> pretty<00:03:04.049> well<00:03:04.140> long-distance<00:03:05.040> yeah

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
see works pretty well long-distance yeah

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.289 
see works pretty well long-distance yeah
it<00:03:06.060> same<00:03:06.239> sort<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.510> things<00:03:06.689> Holly<00:03:06.900> really<00:03:07.170> but

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
resort really this is same pretty much

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.470 
resort really this is same pretty much
all<00:03:15.180> for<00:03:15.209> ARCA

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
all for ARCA

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.410 
all for ARCA
next<00:03:18.480> we<00:03:18.659> have<00:03:18.900> doc<00:03:19.440> who<00:03:20.370> has<00:03:20.849> again<00:03:21.209> has<00:03:21.390> a

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
next we have doc who has again has a

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.449 
next we have doc who has again has a
beam<00:03:21.659> attack<00:03:22.220> very<00:03:23.220> similar<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:25.040> these<00:03:26.040> off<00:03:26.280> at

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
beam attack very similar to these off at

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.130 
beam attack very similar to these off at
Holly's<00:03:26.819> so<00:03:27.420> you'd<00:03:27.569> use<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.840> for<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:27.989> same

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
Holly's so you'd use it for the same

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.509 
Holly's so you'd use it for the same
sort<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.560> thing<00:03:30.799> only<00:03:31.799> this<00:03:32.010> one<00:03:32.189> has<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> more

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
sort of thing only this one has a more

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.690 
sort of thing only this one has a more
icy<00:03:32.909> feel<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.420> it

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.949 

and<00:03:36.700> that<00:03:36.819> stuck<00:03:38.280> next<00:03:39.280> is<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.580> buck<00:03:39.880> who<00:03:40.780> has<00:03:40.930> a

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
and that stuck next is a buck who has a

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.550 
and that stuck next is a buck who has a
very<00:03:41.470> rapid-fire<00:03:42.160> weapon

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
very rapid-fire weapon

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.170 
very rapid-fire weapon
but<00:03:45.130> it's<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.430> very<00:03:45.610> weak<00:03:45.940> rapid-fire<00:03:46.630> weapon

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:04:04.150 

so<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:49.750> may<00:03:50.019> as<00:03:50.049> well<00:03:50.200> just<00:03:50.379> be<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.709> beam<00:03:51.040> really

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.210 

yeah<00:04:04.730> it<00:04:05.720> works<00:04:05.930> reasonably<00:04:06.470> well<00:04:06.530> long-range

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
yeah it works reasonably well long-range

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.310 
yeah it works reasonably well long-range
but<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.460> fact<00:04:07.700> that<00:04:07.820> it's<00:04:08.030> so<00:04:08.300> weak<00:04:08.630> really

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
but the fact that it's so weak really

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.590 
but the fact that it's so weak really
works<00:04:09.530> against<00:04:10.070> it

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
works against it

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.090 
works against it
that's<00:04:11.600> a<00:04:11.840> vac<00:04:13.000> next<00:04:14.000> is<00:04:14.180> rider<00:04:15.040> who<00:04:16.040> has

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
that's a vac next is rider who has

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.650 
that's a vac next is rider who has
another<00:04:16.400> rapid<00:04:16.820> fire<00:04:17.000> sort<00:04:17.330> of<00:04:17.390> thing<00:04:17.540> but

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
another rapid fire sort of thing but

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:25.879 
another rapid fire sort of thing but
this<00:04:17.780> one's<00:04:17.930> kind<00:04:18.140> of<00:04:18.170> world's<00:04:18.980> ooh<00:04:22.840> nothing

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.309 

yeah<00:04:26.490> see<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:26.849> take<00:04:27.060> out<00:04:27.270> this<00:04:27.569> guy<00:04:27.780> takes<00:04:28.080> out

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:28.319 
yeah see the take out this guy takes out

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.770 
yeah see the take out this guy takes out
the<00:04:28.500> enemies<00:04:28.830> quite<00:04:29.189> well<00:04:29.490> but<00:04:30.150> again<00:04:30.270> it's<00:04:30.689> a

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
the enemies quite well but again it's a

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.020 
the enemies quite well but again it's a
slow<00:04:31.050> drain<00:04:31.379> which<00:04:32.189> is<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.430> same<00:04:32.610> problem

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
slow drain which is the same problem

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.420 
slow drain which is the same problem
with<00:04:33.120> most<00:04:33.389> rapid-fire<00:04:34.080> weapons<00:04:34.590> on<00:04:34.770> this

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.520
