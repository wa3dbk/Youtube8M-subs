00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.339 

so<00:00:05.890> recently<00:00:06.399> I<00:00:06.430> was<00:00:06.670> just<00:00:07.569> got<00:00:07.750> a<00:00:07.779> swing<00:00:08.139> that

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:08.349 
so recently I was just got a swing that

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:09.930 
so recently I was just got a swing that
I<00:00:08.380> had<00:00:08.590> to<00:00:08.679> hang<00:00:08.830> for<00:00:09.160> my<00:00:09.340> kids<00:00:09.610> in<00:00:09.849> the

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
I had to hang for my kids in the

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.530 
I had to hang for my kids in the
backyard<00:00:10.150> and<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:11.769> was<00:00:12.430> actually<00:00:12.880> think<00:00:13.450> it

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
backyard and I was actually think it

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.330 
backyard and I was actually think it
would<00:00:13.690> be<00:00:13.809> a<00:00:13.840> simple<00:00:14.349> problem<00:00:14.710> to<00:00:14.920> do<00:00:15.099> but

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
would be a simple problem to do but

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.160 
would be a simple problem to do but
actually<00:00:15.880> for<00:00:16.480> me<00:00:16.570> it<00:00:16.689> actually<00:00:16.720> took<00:00:17.109> a

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
actually for me it actually took a

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.419 
actually for me it actually took a
little<00:00:17.320> thinking<00:00:17.710> so<00:00:17.859> I<00:00:17.920> thought<00:00:18.099> I'd<00:00:18.220> share

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:18.429 
little thinking so I thought I'd share

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:19.979 
little thinking so I thought I'd share
with<00:00:18.490> everybody<00:00:18.849> I'll<00:00:19.510> go<00:00:19.660> through<00:00:19.869> the

00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:19.989 
with everybody I'll go through the

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:21.509 
with everybody I'll go through the
simple<00:00:20.199> steps<00:00:20.529> quick<00:00:20.829> so<00:00:20.980> you<00:00:21.039> don't<00:00:21.220> need<00:00:21.369> to

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:21.519 
simple steps quick so you don't need to

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.259 
simple steps quick so you don't need to
hear<00:00:21.849> me<00:00:21.999> dream<00:00:22.269> drool<00:00:22.749> on<00:00:23.039> but<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:25.119> can

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.429 
listen afterwards and I'll explain all
my<00:00:27.339> thought<00:00:27.579> process<00:00:28.089> behind<00:00:28.239> it<00:00:28.569> so<00:00:28.810> what<00:00:29.409> I

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
my thought process behind it so what I

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.100 
my thought process behind it so what I
did<00:00:29.560> was<00:00:29.890> we<00:00:30.099> started<00:00:30.579> with<00:00:30.849> some<00:00:31.779> one-inch

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
did was we started with some one-inch

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.440 
did was we started with some one-inch
tubular<00:00:32.619> webbing<00:00:32.770> or<00:00:33.340> we<00:00:33.460> have<00:00:33.670> here<00:00:34.000> it's

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
tubular webbing or we have here it's

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.690 
tubular webbing or we have here it's
actually<00:00:34.899> got<00:00:35.050> a<00:00:35.079> hole<00:00:35.440> in<00:00:35.770> down<00:00:36.130> the<00:00:36.340> center

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
actually got a hole in down the center

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.370 
actually got a hole in down the center
which<00:00:36.880> makes<00:00:37.180> this<00:00:37.360> really<00:00:37.690> strong<00:00:37.930> I<00:00:38.110> forget

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
which makes this really strong I forget

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.200 
which makes this really strong I forget
how<00:00:38.470> many<00:00:38.530> thousands<00:00:39.400> of<00:00:39.520> pounds<00:00:39.760> this<00:00:40.060> thing

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
how many thousands of pounds this thing

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.870 
how many thousands of pounds this thing
is<00:00:40.330> rated<00:00:40.720> for<00:00:40.930> but<00:00:41.560> it's<00:00:41.710> incredibly<00:00:42.490> strong

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
is rated for but it's incredibly strong

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.340 
is rated for but it's incredibly strong
and<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.150> added<00:00:43.420> advantage<00:00:43.870> of<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.050> doesn't

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
and the added advantage of the doesn't

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.300 
and the added advantage of the doesn't
stretch<00:00:44.970> then<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.210> other<00:00:46.330> thing<00:00:46.540> we<00:00:46.660> have<00:00:46.690> is

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
stretch then the other thing we have is

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.430 
stretch then the other thing we have is
some<00:00:48.310> rust-oleum<00:00:48.850> leak<00:00:49.270> seal<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.810> only<00:00:50.020> key

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
some rust-oleum leak seal the only key

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.320 
some rust-oleum leak seal the only key
part<00:00:50.800> here<00:00:51.010> is<00:00:51.070> a<00:00:51.100> rubberized<00:00:51.640> coating<00:00:51.880> comes

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
part here is a rubberized coating comes

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.890 
part here is a rubberized coating comes
out<00:00:52.480> of<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:52.660> can<00:00:52.840> just<00:00:53.170> and<00:00:54.040> it's<00:00:54.190> done<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.570> then

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
out of a can just and it's done and then

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.780 
out of a can just and it's done and then
of<00:00:56.020> course<00:00:56.050> we<00:00:56.440> have<00:00:56.620> our<00:00:56.650> tree<00:00:57.190> limb

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
of course we have our tree limb

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.819 
of course we have our tree limb
I<00:00:57.850> just<00:00:58.510> cut<00:00:58.690> this<00:00:58.840> out<00:00:58.990> of<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.170> backyard<00:00:59.680> and

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
I just cut this out of the backyard and

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.850 
I just cut this out of the backyard and
one<00:01:00.340> to<00:01:00.579> show<00:01:00.760> everybody<00:01:01.150> so<00:01:01.390> so<00:01:02.350> what<00:01:02.500> I<00:01:02.530> did

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
one to show everybody so so what I did

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.130 
one to show everybody so so what I did
is<00:01:03.070> started<00:01:03.760> with<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.180> one<00:01:04.629> inch<00:01:04.780> tubular

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
is started with the one inch tubular

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.609 
is started with the one inch tubular
webbing

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
webbing

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.980 
webbing
I<00:01:05.710> took<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.310> rust-oleum<00:01:06.820> product<00:01:07.540> here<00:01:07.840> and

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
I took the rust-oleum product here and

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.309 
I took the rust-oleum product here and
actually<00:01:08.829> sprayed<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.490> on<00:01:09.810> about<00:01:10.810> that's

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:11.319 
actually sprayed it on about that's

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:14.160 
actually sprayed it on about that's
about<00:01:11.499> the<00:01:11.619> first<00:01:11.829> I<00:01:12.219> guess<00:01:12.369> 16<00:01:13.299> inches<00:01:13.719> or<00:01:13.780> so

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
about the first I guess 16 inches or so

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.730 
about the first I guess 16 inches or so
of<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:16.060> webbing<00:01:16.420> only<00:01:17.079> on<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.289> one<00:01:17.439> side

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
of the webbing only on the one side

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.469 
of the webbing only on the one side
though<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.609> could<00:01:18.729> probably<00:01:18.939> narrow<00:01:19.299> that

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
though you could probably narrow that

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.779 
though you could probably narrow that
down<00:01:19.539> to<00:01:19.749> a<00:01:19.929> foot<00:01:20.229> to<00:01:20.380> make<00:01:20.469> it<00:01:20.619> real<00:01:20.979> still

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
down to a foot to make it real still

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.340 
down to a foot to make it real still
make<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.179> usable<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.749> I'll<00:01:22.840> show<00:01:23.020> you<00:01:23.049> why

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
make it usable and I'll show you why

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.739 
make it usable and I'll show you why
later<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:24.490> then<00:01:25.590> instead<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:27.630> wrapping<00:01:28.630> it

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
later and then instead of wrapping it

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:31.289 
later and then instead of wrapping it
around<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.920> tying<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:30.490> around<00:01:30.549> the<00:01:30.880> tree<00:01:31.119> limb

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
around or tying it around the tree limb

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.929 
around or tying it around the tree limb
what<00:01:31.869> I<00:01:31.899> did<00:01:32.259> was<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.560> wrap<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.159> I<00:01:33.189> started<00:01:33.670> I'll

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
what I did was a wrap so I started I'll

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.539 
what I did was a wrap so I started I'll
start<00:01:34.329> here<00:01:34.689> with<00:01:35.229> it<00:01:35.409> on<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.619> diagonal<00:01:36.189> angle

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
start here with it on a diagonal angle

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.699 
start here with it on a diagonal angle
there<00:01:36.939> you<00:01:37.060> can<00:01:37.240> kind<00:01:37.450> of<00:01:37.509> see<00:01:37.749> how<00:01:38.499> we're

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
there you can kind of see how we're

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:42.300 
there you can kind of see how we're
going<00:01:38.920> out<00:01:39.189> doing<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.789> then<00:01:40.569> coming<00:01:41.259> up<00:01:41.409> over

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
going out doing and then coming up over

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:49.090 
going out doing and then coming up over
and<00:01:42.990> back<00:01:43.990> around<00:01:45.090> this

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.360 

and<00:01:50.600> over<00:01:51.600> again<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.230> more<00:01:52.410> time<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:53.100> then

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
and over again one more time and then

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.830 
and over again one more time and then
you<00:01:56.370> can<00:01:56.520> see<00:01:56.700> how<00:01:56.880> its<00:01:57.060> wrapped<00:01:57.390> there<00:01:57.810> a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
you can see how its wrapped there a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.530 
you can see how its wrapped there a
couple<00:01:58.200> times<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.920> then<00:01:58.980> down<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.390> now

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
couple times and then down and so now

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.720 
couple times and then down and so now
you<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.870> this<00:02:01.080> one<00:02:01.860> hanging<00:02:02.130> down<00:02:02.370> that<00:02:02.550> side

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
you have this one hanging down that side

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.550 
you have this one hanging down that side
and<00:02:02.910> really<00:02:03.150> that's<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> end<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.110> here

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
and really that's the end of it and here

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.970 
and really that's the end of it and here
and<00:02:04.680> I'll<00:02:04.770> explain<00:02:05.190> why<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.550> did<00:02:05.970> everything<00:02:06.980> so

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
and I'll explain why I did everything so

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.010 
and I'll explain why I did everything so
for<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.880> swing<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.300> we<00:02:09.420> purchased<00:02:09.899> we

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
for the swing that we purchased we

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.110 
for the swing that we purchased we
actually<00:02:10.410> got<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.830> swing<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.550> spin<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:12.090> can

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
actually got a swing and spin you can

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.990 
actually got a swing and spin you can
look<00:02:12.450> at<00:02:12.600> them<00:02:12.720> online<00:02:12.930> there<00:02:13.440> it's<00:02:14.340> kind<00:02:14.940> of

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
look at them online there it's kind of

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.270 
look at them online there it's kind of
an<00:02:15.120> updated<00:02:15.450> version<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:16.080> tire<00:02:16.320> swing<00:02:16.590> and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
an updated version of a tire swing and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.090 
an updated version of a tire swing and
the<00:02:18.150> limb<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.690> was<00:02:18.960> hanging<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.500> off<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:20.010> was

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
the limb I was hanging it off it was

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.250 
the limb I was hanging it off it was
probably<00:02:20.430> about<00:02:20.580> 20<00:02:21.000> 25<00:02:21.480> feet<00:02:21.780> up<00:02:21.990> in<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.230> tree

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
probably about 20 25 feet up in a tree

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.100 
probably about 20 25 feet up in a tree
and<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:23.430> originally<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.330> tied<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.570> rope<00:02:24.900> up

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
and so originally I just tied a rope up

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.350 
and so originally I just tied a rope up
there<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.710> then<00:02:26.160> hung<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.460> swing<00:02:26.700> off<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.090> but

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
there and then hung the swing off it but

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.650 
there and then hung the swing off it but
with<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.380> much<00:02:28.440> length<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.280> rope<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.850> three

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
with that much length of rope and three

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.930 
with that much length of rope and three
or<00:02:30.780> four<00:02:30.810> kids<00:02:31.350> hanging<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.070> swing<00:02:32.370> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
or four kids hanging on the swing the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.400 
or four kids hanging on the swing the
swing<00:02:33.210> would<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.660> know<00:02:33.750> start<00:02:34.050> off<00:02:34.200> the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
swing would you know start off the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.250 
swing would you know start off the
ground<00:02:34.700> maybe<00:02:35.700> 18<00:02:36.390> inches<00:02:36.420> off<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.870> ground

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
ground maybe 18 inches off the ground

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.810 
ground maybe 18 inches off the ground
and<00:02:37.350> by<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.560> time<00:02:37.770> all<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.070> kids<00:02:38.250> loaded<00:02:38.670> on

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
and by the time all the kids loaded on

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.760 
and by the time all the kids loaded on
to<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.540> Rope<00:02:39.750> would<00:02:39.930> stretch<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.560> would

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
to it the Rope would stretch it would

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.860 
to it the Rope would stretch it would
come<00:02:41.070> down<00:02:41.100> near<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.670> ground<00:02:41.940> which<00:02:42.330> really

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
come down near the ground which really

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.790 
come down near the ground which really
wasn't<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.260> great<00:02:43.470> idea

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
wasn't a great idea

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.920 
wasn't a great idea
so<00:02:44.460> I<00:02:44.490> went<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.270> one<00:02:45.420> inch<00:02:45.600> tubular

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
so I went to the one inch tubular

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.930 
so I went to the one inch tubular
webbing<00:02:46.170> which<00:02:46.530> hardly<00:02:46.800> has<00:02:47.040> any<00:02:47.220> stretch<00:02:47.790> at

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
webbing which hardly has any stretch at

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.240 
webbing which hardly has any stretch at
all<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.240> stuff<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.660> just<00:02:49.050> super<00:02:49.650> super

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
all this stuff is just super super

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.670 
all this stuff is just super super
strong<00:02:50.760> but<00:02:51.540> more<00:02:51.810> importantly<00:02:52.260> there's<00:02:52.500> not

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
strong but more importantly there's not

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.729 
strong but more importantly there's not
a<00:02:52.709> lot<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:52.950> stretch<00:02:53.400> into<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.660> then<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
a lot of stretch into it and then the

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.890 
a lot of stretch into it and then the
other<00:02:55.860> thing<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.400> did<00:02:56.520> is<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.030> originally

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
other thing that I did is I originally

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.620 
other thing that I did is I originally
just<00:02:58.230> tied<00:02:58.560> the<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:01.310> webbing<00:03:02.360> around<00:03:03.360> the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
just tied the the webbing around the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.320 
just tied the the webbing around the
limb<00:03:03.840> but<00:03:04.350> now<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.220> proposed<00:03:05.670> or<00:03:05.940> proposed

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
limb but now that proposed or proposed

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.820 
limb but now that proposed or proposed
another<00:03:06.600> problem<00:03:07.020> let's<00:03:07.170> just<00:03:07.230> assume<00:03:07.650> this

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
another problem let's just assume this

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.979 
another problem let's just assume this
is<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.040> knot<00:03:08.340> down<00:03:08.610> here<00:03:08.940> as<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.600> kids<00:03:09.810> would

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
is a knot down here as the kids would

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.449 
is a knot down here as the kids would
swing<00:03:10.230> back<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.440> forth<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:11.130> got<00:03:11.280> this

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
swing back and forth you got this

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.850 
swing back and forth you got this
rubbing<00:03:11.850> action<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.510> in<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.440> case<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.770> the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
rubbing action and in the case of the

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.229 
rubbing action and in the case of the
webbing<00:03:14.220> it's<00:03:14.370> just<00:03:14.520> gonna<00:03:14.670> wear<00:03:14.970> right

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
webbing it's just gonna wear right

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.330 
webbing it's just gonna wear right
through<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:16.170> our<00:03:16.290> case<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.920> think<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.310> was

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
through and in our case I think it was

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.070 
through and in our case I think it was
like<00:03:17.519> one<00:03:17.790> week<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.330> it's<00:03:18.450> just<00:03:18.510> wore<00:03:18.810> through

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
like one week and it's just wore through

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.199 
like one week and it's just wore through
and<00:03:19.230> broke<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.370> kids<00:03:20.790> were<00:03:20.910> sitting<00:03:21.090> on

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
and broke and that kids were sitting on

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.830 
and broke and that kids were sitting on
the<00:03:21.330> ground<00:03:21.510> yeah<00:03:22.290> not<00:03:23.190> really<00:03:23.430> happy<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.180> if

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
the ground yeah not really happy and if

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.360 
the ground yeah not really happy and if
you're<00:03:25.019> getting<00:03:25.290> something<00:03:25.650> heavier<00:03:26.190> like

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
you're getting something heavier like

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.770 
you're getting something heavier like
even<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.700> chain<00:03:26.970> you're<00:03:27.239> even<00:03:27.450> just<00:03:27.570> gonna

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
even a chain you're even just gonna

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.570 
even a chain you're even just gonna
damage<00:03:28.050> your<00:03:28.350> tree<00:03:28.620> limb<00:03:28.800> which<00:03:29.040> was<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.550> know

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
damage your tree limb which was you know

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.180 
damage your tree limb which was you know
get<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:29.940> long<00:03:30.239> term<00:03:30.480> not<00:03:30.630> gonna<00:03:30.810> be<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.110> best<00:03:31.350> so

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
get a long term not gonna be the best so

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.270 
get a long term not gonna be the best so
what<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.150> did<00:03:33.269> was<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:34.170> friend<00:03:34.860> of<00:03:34.950> mine<00:03:35.070> actually

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
what I did was a friend of mine actually

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.280 
what I did was a friend of mine actually
came<00:03:35.670> up<00:03:35.700> with<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.090> idea<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.780> would<00:03:36.870> saw<00:03:37.110> him

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
came up with the idea I would saw him

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.770 
came up with the idea I would saw him
doing<00:03:37.590> something<00:03:37.860> else<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.489> when<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:39.450> wrap

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
doing something else and when you wrap

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.600 
doing something else and when you wrap
it<00:03:39.840> around<00:03:40.170> I'm<00:03:40.860> not<00:03:40.920> even<00:03:41.280> using<00:03:41.489> the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
it around I'm not even using the

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.220 
it around I'm not even using the
rubberized<00:03:42.000> side<00:03:42.390> right<00:03:42.630> now<00:03:42.780> but<00:03:43.019> when<00:03:43.140> you

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
rubberized side right now but when you

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.290 
rubberized side right now but when you
wrap<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.530> around<00:03:43.800> it's<00:03:44.220> self<00:03:44.519> tensioning<00:03:44.850> so

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
wrap it around it's self tensioning so

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.590 
wrap it around it's self tensioning so
it<00:03:45.420> tightens<00:03:45.930> on<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.410> itself<00:03:46.800> and<00:03:47.100> then<00:03:47.940> your

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
it tightens on to itself and then your

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.840 
it tightens on to itself and then your
motion<00:03:49.110> when<00:03:49.380> your<00:03:49.500> swing<00:03:49.830> is<00:03:50.040> just<00:03:50.160> like<00:03:50.610> this

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
motion when your swing is just like this

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.370 
motion when your swing is just like this
so<00:03:51.030> there's<00:03:51.209> very<00:03:51.630> little<00:03:51.900> rubbing<00:03:52.260> you're

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
so there's very little rubbing you're

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.320 
so there's very little rubbing you're
gonna<00:03:52.470> get<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.739> little<00:03:53.010> bit<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.459> here<00:03:53.730> but<00:03:54.180> we're

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
gonna get a little bit in here but we're

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.509 
gonna get a little bit in here but we're
not<00:03:54.510> talking<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.170> huge<00:03:55.560> amount<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:56.160> you<00:03:56.310> had

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
not talking the huge amount that you had

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.650 
not talking the huge amount that you had
before<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:58.010> so<00:03:59.010> the<00:04:00.000> other<00:04:00.090> thing<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.480> I

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
before and so the other thing that I

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.620 
before and so the other thing that I
didn't<00:04:00.960> even<00:04:01.020> do<00:04:01.319> for

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
didn't even do for

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.630 
didn't even do for
my<00:04:01.690> own<00:04:01.840> swing<00:04:02.230> because<00:04:02.920> that<00:04:03.250> works<00:04:03.490> just

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
my own swing because that works just

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.850 
my own swing because that works just
great<00:04:04.210> but<00:04:04.540> I<00:04:04.840> just<00:04:04.870> like<00:04:05.080> know<00:04:05.230> what's<00:04:05.680> the

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
great but I just like know what's the

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.530 
great but I just like know what's the
best<00:04:06.190> way<00:04:06.370> to<00:04:06.400> improve<00:04:06.610> upon<00:04:07.120> this<00:04:07.330> and<00:04:07.480> I

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
best way to improve upon this and I

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.720 
best way to improve upon this and I
thought<00:04:07.720> you<00:04:07.930> know<00:04:08.020> spraying<00:04:08.740> a<00:04:08.890> little<00:04:09.220> bit

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
thought you know spraying a little bit

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.760 
thought you know spraying a little bit
of<00:04:09.880> this<00:04:09.970> rubberized<00:04:10.420> compound<00:04:11.140> on<00:04:11.350> here<00:04:11.650> is

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
of this rubberized compound on here is

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.910 
of this rubberized compound on here is
going<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.580> give<00:04:13.330> it<00:04:13.360> that<00:04:13.780> initial<00:04:14.470> part<00:04:14.650> some

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
going to give it that initial part some

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.560 
going to give it that initial part some
tackiness<00:04:15.370> now<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:15.760> only<00:04:16.060> want<00:04:16.420> the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
tackiness now you only want the

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.820 
tackiness now you only want the
tackiness<00:04:16.989> going<00:04:17.470> for<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:19.320> for<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.380> webbing

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
tackiness going for the for the webbing

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.590 
tackiness going for the for the webbing
as<00:04:21.040> it<00:04:21.400> touches<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.820> tree<00:04:22.120> limb<00:04:22.300> you<00:04:22.420> don't

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
as it touches the tree limb you don't

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.060 
as it touches the tree limb you don't
want<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:22.900> at<00:04:23.020> any<00:04:23.170> other<00:04:23.320> point<00:04:23.650> that's<00:04:23.770> why<00:04:23.950> we

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
want it at any other point that's why we

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.070 
want it at any other point that's why we
only<00:04:24.190> do<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.550> one<00:04:24.730> side<00:04:25.000> see<00:04:25.540> if<00:04:25.570> I<00:04:25.720> put<00:04:25.960> that

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
only do the one side see if I put that

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.350 
only do the one side see if I put that
there<00:04:26.380> I<00:04:26.410> just<00:04:26.710> put<00:04:26.890> a<00:04:26.920> single<00:04:27.310> finger<00:04:27.700> if<00:04:28.150> I

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
there I just put a single finger if I

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.420 
there I just put a single finger if I
pull<00:04:28.720> on<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:29.050> it<00:04:29.260> just<00:04:29.470> wants<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:29.800> grip<00:04:30.250> that

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
pull on that it just wants to grip that

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.790 
pull on that it just wants to grip that
lock<00:04:30.760> versus<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.570> other<00:04:31.720> side<00:04:31.990> single<00:04:32.440> finger

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
lock versus the other side single finger

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.760 
lock versus the other side single finger
and<00:04:33.010> it<00:04:33.160> just<00:04:33.340> wants<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.700> pull<00:04:33.910> through<00:04:34.180> there

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
and it just wants to pull through there

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.980 
and it just wants to pull through there
but<00:04:35.770> as<00:04:36.070> you<00:04:36.250> wrap<00:04:36.580> it<00:04:36.610> around<00:04:36.910> so<00:04:37.540> if<00:04:37.630> we<00:04:37.780> take

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
but as you wrap it around so if we take

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.380 
but as you wrap it around so if we take
this<00:04:38.260> stick<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:38.800> little<00:04:39.010> dwell<00:04:39.430> I<00:04:39.700> say<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.090> stick

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
this stick a little dwell I say to stick

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.170 
this stick a little dwell I say to stick
this<00:04:40.690> stick<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:41.470> little<00:04:41.770> tail<00:04:42.010> out<00:04:42.280> there<00:04:42.610> come

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
this stick a little tail out there come

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.150 
this stick a little tail out there come
up<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:43.540> around<00:04:45.150> now<00:04:46.150> it's<00:04:46.780> free<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.560> slip<00:04:47.950> on

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
up and around now it's free to slip on

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.340 
up and around now it's free to slip on
itself<00:04:48.880> so<00:04:49.330> you<00:04:49.390> see<00:04:49.690> you<00:04:49.840> can<00:04:49.990> have<00:04:50.020> this

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
itself so you see you can have this

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.990 
itself so you see you can have this
slipping<00:04:50.830> here<00:04:51.040> because<00:04:51.310> we<00:04:51.430> only<00:04:51.550> sprayed<00:04:51.880> it

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
slipping here because we only sprayed it

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000 
slipping here because we only sprayed it
on<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.180> one<00:04:52.360> side<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:53.170> you<00:04:53.560> want<00:04:53.830> that

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
on the one side and you want that

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.770 
on the one side and you want that
because<00:04:54.070> you<00:04:54.430> want<00:04:54.700> this<00:04:54.880> thing<00:04:55.090> to<00:04:55.240> tighten

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
because you want this thing to tighten

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.240 
because you want this thing to tighten
down<00:04:55.810> on<00:04:56.200> itself<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:56.770> when<00:04:56.860> you<00:04:56.950> do<00:04:57.100> that

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
down on itself and when you do that

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.190 
down on itself and when you do that
second<00:04:57.760> wrap<00:04:57.970> you're<00:04:58.540> even<00:04:58.810> going<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.050> have

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
second wrap you're even going to have

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.440 
second wrap you're even going to have
more<00:04:59.560> of<00:04:59.590> that<00:04:59.770> so<00:05:00.070> it's<00:05:00.220> all<00:05:00.520> cinching<00:05:01.240> down

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
more of that so it's all cinching down

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.420 
more of that so it's all cinching down
super<00:05:01.900> tight<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.260> then<00:05:02.830> pulling<00:05:03.160> that

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
super tight and then pulling that

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.080 
super tight and then pulling that
rubberized<00:05:04.030> coating<00:05:04.300> right<00:05:05.140> into<00:05:05.950> the<00:05:06.850> tree

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
rubberized coating right into the tree

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.850 
rubberized coating right into the tree
limb<00:05:07.920> now<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:10.660> rubber<00:05:11.080> is<00:05:11.260> coating<00:05:11.620> you<00:05:11.740> can

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
limb now the rubber is coating you can

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.500 
limb now the rubber is coating you can
just<00:05:12.010> go<00:05:12.100> down<00:05:12.220> to<00:05:12.280> Home<00:05:12.550> Depot<00:05:12.580> or<00:05:13.180> somewhere

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
probably over go actually I know it's

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.260 
probably over go actually I know it's
overkill<00:05:32.650> this<00:05:32.860> is<00:05:33.010> meant<00:05:33.220> for<00:05:33.310> rock<00:05:33.940> climbing

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
overkill this is meant for rock climbing

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.420 
overkill this is meant for rock climbing
take<00:05:34.600> somebody<00:05:34.990> taking<00:05:35.380> like<00:05:35.500> a<00:05:35.530> 20<00:05:35.890> foot<00:05:36.100> fall

take somebody taking like a 20 foot fall

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.020 
take somebody taking like a 20 foot fall
and<00:05:36.790> it'll<00:05:37.360> actually<00:05:37.630> absorb<00:05:38.170> that<00:05:38.350> impact

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
and it'll actually absorb that impact

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.820 
and it'll actually absorb that impact
and<00:05:40.030> you<00:05:40.390> could<00:05:40.570> probably<00:05:40.840> go<00:05:41.200> to<00:05:41.230> even<00:05:41.590> like<00:05:41.800> a

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
and you could probably go to even like a

I've got this all bound up so it's not

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.420 
I've got this all bound up so it's not
just<00:05:55.060> a<00:05:55.600> mess<00:05:55.810> but<00:05:56.290> then<00:05:56.470> you<00:05:56.620> can<00:05:56.830> pull<00:05:57.250> it

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
just a mess but then you can pull it

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.430 
just a mess but then you can pull it
tight<00:05:57.910> as<00:05:58.150> far<00:05:58.600> as<00:05:58.780> you<00:05:59.020> know<00:05:59.110> how<00:05:59.140> much

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
holding thousands of pounds so you could

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.330 
holding thousands of pounds so you could
take<00:06:11.680> this<00:06:11.919> off

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
take this off

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.320

cut the hook off this other end and then

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.870 
cut the hook off this other end and then
hang<00:06:18.330> you<00:06:18.780> know<00:06:18.810> you<00:06:19.410> do<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:19.800> same<00:06:20.100> concept

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
hang you know you do the same concept

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.280 
hang you know you do the same concept
that<00:06:21.030> we<00:06:21.150> got<00:06:21.300> on<00:06:21.419> the<00:06:21.540> other<00:06:21.570> end<00:06:21.840> that<00:06:21.960> we<00:06:22.110> did

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
that we got on the other end that we did

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.020 
that we got on the other end that we did
back<00:06:22.440> here<00:06:22.710> with<00:06:22.800> the<00:06:22.889> tubular<00:06:23.220> webbing<00:06:23.370> spray

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
back here with the tubular webbing spray

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.640 
back here with the tubular webbing spray
it<00:06:24.120> on<00:06:24.240> the<00:06:24.330> side<00:06:24.540> we<00:06:24.840> wrap<00:06:24.960> it<00:06:24.990> around<00:06:25.200> three

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
it on the side we wrap it around three

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.990 
it on the side we wrap it around three
or<00:06:25.680> four<00:06:25.950> times<00:06:26.160> you<00:06:26.400> probably<00:06:26.669> don't<00:06:26.820> even

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
or four times you probably don't even

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.670 
or four times you probably don't even
need<00:06:27.090> that<00:06:27.300> much<00:06:27.540> and<00:06:27.780> then<00:06:28.139> you<00:06:28.260> have<00:06:28.380> a<00:06:28.410> hook

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
need that much and then you have a hook

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.110 
need that much and then you have a hook
to<00:06:28.919> actually<00:06:29.250> hang<00:06:29.460> through<00:06:29.700> your<00:06:29.820> swings

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
to actually hang through your swings

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.540 
to actually hang through your swings
pull<00:06:30.750> it<00:06:30.900> up<00:06:31.020> to<00:06:31.260> whatever<00:06:31.620> type<00:06:32.130> that<00:06:32.430> you

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
pull it up to whatever type that you

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.310 
pull it up to whatever type that you
want<00:06:32.730> it<00:06:32.910> and<00:06:32.970> you're<00:06:33.540> all<00:06:33.690> set<00:06:33.990> and<00:06:34.080> ready<00:06:34.260> to

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
want it and you're all set and ready to

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.430 
want it and you're all set and ready to
go<00:06:35.120> and<00:06:36.120> you<00:06:36.360> can<00:06:36.510> have<00:06:36.720> the<00:06:36.900> set<00:06:37.110> of<00:06:37.260> these<00:06:37.380> I

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
go and you can have the set of these I

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.500 
go and you can have the set of these I
think<00:06:37.680> for<00:06:38.130> like<00:06:38.160> five<00:06:38.669> you<00:06:39.090> know<00:06:39.180> twelve

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
think for like five you know twelve

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.930 
think for like five you know twelve
dollars<00:06:39.960> maybe<00:06:40.230> at<00:06:40.470> Walmart<00:06:40.919> or<00:06:41.220> you<00:06:41.820> know

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
dollars maybe at Walmart or you know

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.040 
dollars maybe at Walmart or you know
wherever<00:06:42.120> you<00:06:42.300> want<00:06:42.419> so<00:06:42.450> they're<00:06:42.660> you<00:06:43.020> know

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
wherever you want so they're you know

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.500 
wherever you want so they're you know
there's<00:06:43.230> some<00:06:43.380> options<00:06:43.590> there<00:06:44.060> but<00:06:45.060> anyways

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
there's some options there but anyways

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.580 
there's some options there but anyways
just<00:06:45.540> thought<00:06:45.960> I'd<00:06:46.110> share<00:06:46.350> that<00:06:46.380> with

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
just thought I'd share that with

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.030 
just thought I'd share that with
everybody<00:06:46.800> it<00:06:47.010> was<00:06:47.130> really<00:06:47.510> kind<00:06:48.510> of<00:06:49.040> tweaking

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
everybody it was really kind of tweaking

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.560 
everybody it was really kind of tweaking
my<00:06:50.070> little<00:06:50.460> tiny<00:06:50.640> brain<00:06:50.940> for<00:06:51.210> a<00:06:51.240> little<00:06:51.419> bit

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
my little tiny brain for a little bit

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.940 
my little tiny brain for a little bit
trying<00:06:51.840> to<00:06:51.900> figure<00:06:52.140> out<00:06:52.169> how<00:06:52.560> I<00:06:52.590> was<00:06:52.740> gonna

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950 
trying to figure out how I was gonna

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.370 
trying to figure out how I was gonna
hang<00:06:53.250> this<00:06:53.460> swing<00:06:53.730> properly<00:06:54.060> and<00:06:54.510> I'm<00:06:54.900> really

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
hang this swing properly and I'm really

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:05.050 
hang this swing properly and I'm really
happy<00:06:55.680> with<00:06:55.830> the<00:06:56.040> solution<00:06:56.430> we<00:06:56.520> have<00:06:56.700> now

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.060 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.120
