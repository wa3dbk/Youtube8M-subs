00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.840 

so<00:00:16.049> let's<00:00:16.320> talk<00:00:16.500> about<00:00:16.560> server<00:00:17.310> matching

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
so let's talk about server matching

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.810 
so let's talk about server matching
briefly<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.650> we've<00:00:19.650> done<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.010> alpha<00:00:20.430> mapping

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
briefly so we've done the alpha mapping

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.530 
briefly so we've done the alpha mapping
from<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.690> upper<00:00:21.960> mapping<00:00:22.350> then<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.940> do

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
from the upper mapping then we can do

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.410 
from the upper mapping then we can do
the<00:00:25.110> Jo<00:00:25.380> after<00:00:25.800> Magi<00:00:26.400> row<00:00:26.460> let's<00:00:27.120> do<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the Jo after Magi row let's do the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.640 
the Jo after Magi row let's do the
survey<00:00:27.690> imagine<00:00:28.080> we're<00:00:28.260> going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.440> do<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
survey imagine we're going to do the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.290 
survey imagine we're going to do the
server<00:00:28.860> matching<00:00:29.220> after<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> gyro<00:00:29.940> is

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
server matching after the gyro is

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.510 
server matching after the gyro is
because<00:00:30.690> you<00:00:30.870> want<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.350> in<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.250> output

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
because you want to in the output

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.700 
because you want to in the output
mapping<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:33.120> gyrus<00:00:33.900> or<00:00:34.140> something<00:00:34.470> you<00:00:34.650> can

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
mapping of gyrus or something you can

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.520 
mapping of gyrus or something you can
you<00:00:34.890> want<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.129> put<00:00:35.660> for<00:00:36.660> example<00:00:36.750> where<00:00:37.410> you

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
you want to put for example where you

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.830 
you want to put for example where you
had<00:00:37.739> direct<00:00:38.640> 4<00:00:38.879> which<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.300> London<00:00:39.629> you

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
had direct 4 which is the London you

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.490 
had direct 4 which is the London you
want<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.170> put<00:00:40.879> gyro<00:00:41.879> rudder<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:43.320> once

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
want to put gyro rudder a and then once

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.890 
want to put gyro rudder a and then once
that's<00:00:43.680> done<00:00:43.949> you<00:00:44.670> can<00:00:44.879> leave<00:00:44.909> on<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
that's done you can leave on to the

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.460 
that's done you can leave on to the
servo<00:00:46.730> matching<00:00:47.730> or<00:00:48.300> adjusting<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> end

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
servo matching or adjusting the end

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.540 
servo matching or adjusting the end
point<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.800> don't<00:00:49.949> necessarily<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.400> to<00:00:50.430> use

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
point you don't necessarily have to use

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.180 
point you don't necessarily have to use
this<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.540> servo<00:00:51.960> matching<00:00:52.470> function<00:00:53.010> you

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
this for a servo matching function you

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.160 
this for a servo matching function you
can<00:00:53.400> use<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.760> as<00:00:53.909> an<00:00:54.300> endpoint<00:00:54.659> function<00:00:55.080> as

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
can use it as an endpoint function as

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.390 
can use it as an endpoint function as
well<00:00:55.379> which<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.650> have<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.890> show<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.129> how<00:00:56.339> to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
well which you have to show you how to

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.240 
well which you have to show you how to
do<00:00:56.670> now<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.170> want<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.680> press<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.040> hold

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
do now so we want to you press and hold

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.450 
do now so we want to you press and hold
the<00:00:59.489> set<00:00:59.699> key<00:00:59.909> and<00:01:00.440> we<00:01:01.440> want<00:01:01.650> to<00:01:01.739> go<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> survey

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the set key and we want to go to survey

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.270 
the set key and we want to go to survey
matching<00:01:02.900> so<00:01:03.900> you'll<00:01:04.260> get<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:06.710> menu<00:01:07.710> much<00:01:08.040> like

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
matching so you'll get a menu much like

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.490 
matching so you'll get a menu much like
that<00:01:08.490> output<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.909> mapping<00:01:09.240> I've<00:01:09.570> got<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.350> know

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
that output of mapping I've got you know

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.430 
that output of mapping I've got you know
a<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.400> servo<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.510> which<00:01:12.690> just<00:01:12.960> happens<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.320> be

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
a a servo here which just happens to be

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.569 
a a servo here which just happens to be
set<00:01:14.430> up<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.439> we<00:01:16.799> go<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
set up a will on so we go to that and

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.389 
set up a will on so we go to that and
now<00:01:18.420> what<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.719> need<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.899> do<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.439> before<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.250> do

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
now what we need to do is before we do

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.359 
now what we need to do is before we do
anything<00:01:20.610> initialize<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.630> output<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.039> just

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
anything initialize that output so just

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.099 
anything initialize that output so just
click<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.909> then<00:01:24.509> move<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.920> stick<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.990> end

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
click and then move the stick to the end

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:32.499 
click and then move the stick to the end
points<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.359> you'll<00:01:30.359> see<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.659> sharp<00:01:31.079> there<00:01:31.369> and

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
points and you'll see it sharp there and

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.810 
points and you'll see it sharp there and
then<00:01:34.969> that<00:01:35.969> output<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.869> initialized<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:38.640> you

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
then that output is initialized if you

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.969 
then that output is initialized if you
go<00:01:38.969> back<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> menu<00:01:39.659> you'll<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.259> now<00:01:40.710> that

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
go back to the menu you'll see now that

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.859 
go back to the menu you'll see now that
that<00:01:41.609> has<00:01:42.590> there<00:01:43.590> has<00:01:43.859> a<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:44.670> saying<00:01:45.570> that

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
that has there has a I'm saying that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.649 
that has there has a I'm saying that
that<00:01:46.109> number<00:01:46.350> has<00:01:46.799> been<00:01:46.950> initialized<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:48.420> you

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that number has been initialized and you

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.319 
that number has been initialized and you
can<00:01:48.810> see<00:01:49.070> when<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.219> matched<00:01:50.549> or<00:01:50.939> you've<00:01:51.119> done

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
can see when it's matched or you've done

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.870 
can see when it's matched or you've done
the<00:01:51.450> endpoints<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.310> an<00:01:53.399> end<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the endpoints you can see an end and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.370 
the endpoints you can see an end and
that<00:01:53.999> it<00:01:54.090> says<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.329> output<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.170> being

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
that it says that output that is being

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.069 
that it says that output that is being
matched<00:01:55.759> or<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.479> fiddled<00:01:57.749> around<00:01:57.810> with

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
matched or you just fiddled around with

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.690 
matched or you just fiddled around with
the<00:01:58.229> endpoint<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.679> let's<00:01:58.859> go<00:01:58.950> back<00:01:59.130> into<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.579> so

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the endpoint so let's go back into it so

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.219 
the endpoint so let's go back into it so
it's<00:01:59.850> matched<00:02:00.060> what<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.539> do<00:02:00.659> now<00:02:00.869> once

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
it's matched what can you do now once

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.709 
it's matched what can you do now once
you've<00:02:01.469> initialize<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.280> output<00:02:02.820> well<00:02:02.999> you

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
you've initialize the output well you

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.919 
you've initialize the output well you
can<00:02:03.929> reverse<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.439> servo<00:02:04.710> sewing<00:02:05.689> that's<00:02:06.689> it

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
can reverse the servo sewing that's it

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:07.940 
can reverse the servo sewing that's it
if<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.229> want<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.619> have<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.740> way<00:02:07.859> around

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
if you want if you have a way around

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.550 
if you want if you have a way around
mirror<00:02:08.670> image<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.090> elevators<00:02:09.660> or<00:02:09.840> stabilizers

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
mirror image on elevators or stabilizers

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.940 
mirror image on elevators or stabilizers
from<00:02:10.770> example<00:02:12.020> you<00:02:13.020> can<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.200> click<00:02:13.530> server

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
from example you can just click server

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.330 
from example you can just click server
reverse<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.640> now<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:15.210> can<00:02:15.390> see<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.890> server

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
reverse and now you can see the server

towards the center it means you're

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.569

reducing the movement if you've got a

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.220 
reducing the movement if you've got a

surface straining you shouldn't have

because<00:03:13.410> she's<00:03:13.560> really<00:03:13.739> disconnect<00:03:14.340> the

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.759 
because she's really disconnect the
surface<00:03:14.790> Lee<00:03:14.879> but<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.480> know<00:03:16.079> some<00:03:16.290> people<00:03:16.440> don't

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
surface Lee but I know some people don't

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.400 
surface Lee but I know some people don't
and<00:03:17.099> then<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.340> can<00:03:17.519> easily<00:03:17.790> see<00:03:18.079> which<00:03:19.079> way

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
and then you can easily see which way

and then you can easily see which way
the<00:03:20.099> server<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.640> moving<00:03:23.060> out<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.360> center

the server is moving out to the center

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.880 
the server is moving out to the center
that's<00:03:24.870> obviously<00:03:25.140> more<00:03:25.349> movement<00:03:25.650> into<00:03:25.860> the

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
that's obviously more movement into the

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.220 
that's obviously more movement into the
center<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.340> less<00:03:26.579> meeting<00:03:26.910> them<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.360> that's

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
center and less meeting them so that's

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.620 
center and less meeting them so that's
done<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:29.010> then<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.250> other<00:03:29.400> way<00:03:29.609> again<00:03:30.180> just

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
done and then the other way again just

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.140 
done and then the other way again just
move<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.930> stick<00:03:31.230> press<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.799> set<00:03:32.040> key<00:03:32.069> let<00:03:32.970> go

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
move the stick press the set key let go

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.330 
move the stick press the set key let go
the<00:03:33.359> stick<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:34.609> can<00:03:35.609> mute<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.420> endpoint<00:03:37.340> say

the stick you can mute the endpoint say
I<00:03:38.370> want<00:03:38.609> it<00:03:38.760> there<00:03:39.200> so<00:03:40.200> that's<00:03:41.130> that's<00:03:41.430> just<00:03:42.090> it

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
I want it there so that's that's just it

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.930 
I want it there so that's that's just it
whatever<00:03:42.930> say<00:03:43.319> you've<00:03:43.470> got<00:03:43.650> one<00:03:43.920> rudder

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
whatever say you've got one rudder

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.849 
whatever say you've got one rudder
this<00:03:45.359> was<00:03:45.569> another<00:03:45.870> surface<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.769> was
