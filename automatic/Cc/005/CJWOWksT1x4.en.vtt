00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.729 
these centers of intensive and frequent
activity<00:00:44.920> if<00:00:45.250> you<00:00:45.370> look<00:00:45.730> at<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.239> data<00:00:47.110> points

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
activity if you look at the data points

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.280 
activity if you look at the data points

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
for a lot of other things if there's

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:06.539 
for a lot of other things if there's
going<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.590> be<00:01:05.650> a<00:01:05.710> clock<00:01:05.950> in<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.190> house<00:01:06.340> the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
how much stuff is in the broader home so

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.000 
how much stuff is in the broader home so

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
look at the this is going to because

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.059 
look at the this is going to because
this<00:03:22.299> shows<00:03:22.569> stuff<00:03:23.200> gets<00:03:23.409> up<00:03:23.560> here<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:23.980> it

never ever leaves

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.449 
never ever leaves
I<00:03:25.629> think<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.079> expiration<00:03:26.470> date<00:03:26.680> on<00:03:27.010> these<00:03:27.159> is

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
I think the expiration date on these is

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.940 
I think the expiration date on these is
like<00:03:28.120> two<00:03:28.389> years<00:03:28.629> ago

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
like two years ago

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.170 
like two years ago
we<00:03:29.950> also<00:03:30.129> found<00:03:30.489> some<00:03:30.609> interesting<00:03:31.060> patterns

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
we also found some interesting patterns

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.599 
we also found some interesting patterns
that<00:03:31.420> emerged<00:03:31.720> in<00:03:31.840> bathrooms<00:03:32.409> bathrooms<00:03:33.310> are

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
that emerged in bathrooms bathrooms are

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.189 
that emerged in bathrooms bathrooms are
where<00:03:33.700> we<00:03:33.790> start<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.120> day<00:03:34.299> right<00:03:34.329> and<00:03:34.780> so<00:03:34.930> we

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
where we start the day right and so we

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.319 
where we start the day right and so we
put<00:03:35.349> on<00:03:35.440> our<00:03:35.590> face<00:03:35.799> we<00:03:36.340> put<00:03:36.639> on<00:03:36.760> our<00:03:36.879> clothes<00:03:37.150> we

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
put on our face we put on our clothes we

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.909 
put on our face we put on our clothes we
look<00:03:37.540> at<00:03:37.629> ourselves<00:03:37.720> we<00:03:38.079> check<00:03:38.349> in<00:03:38.560> we<00:03:38.709> make

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:38.919 
look at ourselves we check in we make

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.220 
look at ourselves we check in we make
sure<00:03:39.129> that<00:03:39.519> everything<00:03:40.209> is<00:03:40.329> there<00:03:40.540> we<00:03:40.900> psych

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
sure that everything is there we psych

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.339 
sure that everything is there we psych
up<00:03:41.470> for<00:03:41.889> the<00:03:42.489> workplace<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.389> for<00:03:43.540> school<00:03:44.049> and

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
up for the workplace and for school and

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.619 
up for the workplace and for school and
so<00:03:44.500> they<00:03:44.980> end<00:03:45.129> up<00:03:45.190> being<00:03:45.400> these<00:03:45.639> anticipatory

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
so they end up being these anticipatory

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.599 
so they end up being these anticipatory
spaces<00:03:47.049> where<00:03:47.199> we're<00:03:47.319> anticipating<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:48.400> day

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
spaces where we're anticipating the day

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.509 
spaces where we're anticipating the day
to<00:03:48.669> come<00:03:49.440> not<00:03:50.440> only<00:03:50.680> is<00:03:50.739> my<00:03:50.799> fridge<00:03:51.099> the<00:03:51.310> site

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
to come not only is my fridge the site

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.129 
to come not only is my fridge the site
of<00:03:51.669> but<00:03:51.879> our<00:03:51.970> bathroom<00:03:52.359> mirror<00:03:52.599> has<00:03:52.810> become

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
of but our bathroom mirror has become

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.080 
of but our bathroom mirror has become
the<00:03:53.260> schedule<00:03:53.650> central<00:03:54.099> because<00:03:54.730> we<00:03:54.910> have<00:03:55.060> a

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
the schedule central because we have a

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.240 
the schedule central because we have a
really<00:03:55.449> big<00:03:55.840> bathroom<00:03:56.199> mirror<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:56.829> anything

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
that the kids are doing

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.059 
that the kids are doing
that's<00:03:58.660> importantly<00:03:59.169> it's<00:03:59.349> taped<00:03:59.620> up<00:03:59.799> there

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
that's importantly it's taped up there

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.699 
that's importantly it's taped up there
because<00:04:00.519> I<00:04:00.879> won't<00:04:01.660> always<00:04:01.900> open<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.500> fridge

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:03.990 
because I won't always open the fridge
first<00:04:02.919> thing<00:04:03.160> in<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.340> morning<00:04:03.609> but<00:04:03.790> I<00:04:03.819> will

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
the mirror bathrooms are also perhaps

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.309 
the mirror bathrooms are also perhaps
one<00:04:09.760> of<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:09.910> most<00:04:09.970> contested<00:04:10.510> resources<00:04:11.079> and

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
one of the most contested resources and

to wake up in that space and these are
