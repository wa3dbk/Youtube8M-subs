00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.199 
far is decent HTC's claiming somewhere
in<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:11.739> region<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.130> 2<00:03:12.280> hours<00:03:12.459> of<00:03:12.760> total<00:03:13.060> use

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
in a region of 2 hours of total use

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.370 
in a region of 2 hours of total use
which<00:03:13.480> means<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:13.930> should<00:03:14.080> be<00:03:14.170> able<00:03:14.260> to

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
which means you should be able to

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.890 
which means you should be able to
squeeze<00:03:14.560> about<00:03:14.769> 1200<00:03:15.700> photos<00:03:15.850> or<00:03:16.300> an<00:03:16.569> hour<00:03:16.690> of

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
squeeze about 1200 photos or an hour of

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.930 
squeeze about 1200 photos or an hour of
40<00:03:17.170> minutes<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.530> continuous<00:03:18.010> video<00:03:18.310> recording

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
40 minutes of continuous video recording

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.729 
40 minutes of continuous video recording
so<00:03:19.450> far<00:03:19.630> it's<00:03:19.750> held<00:03:19.930> up<00:03:20.019> pretty<00:03:20.140> well<00:03:20.470> though

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
so far it's held up pretty well though

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.680 
so far it's held up pretty well though
we'd<00:03:20.950> have<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.250> test<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.549> really<00:03:22.329> vital

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
we'd have to test a really vital

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.840 
we'd have to test a really vital
impressions<00:03:23.200> of<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.440> battery<00:03:23.739> life<00:03:23.950> but<00:03:24.579> so

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
impressions of the battery life but so

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.759 
impressions of the battery life but so
far<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.209> not<00:03:25.239> too<00:03:25.480> shabby<00:03:25.690> last<00:03:26.560> but<00:03:26.680> not

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
far it's not too shabby last but not

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.140 
far it's not too shabby last but not
least<00:03:26.980> let's<00:03:27.160> talk<00:03:27.250> a<00:03:27.280> bit<00:03:27.430> about<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.730> re<00:03:27.940> app

pretty quick and something we thought
was<00:03:43.209> really<00:03:43.390> cool<00:03:43.660> is<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:44.049> can<00:03:44.200> use<00:03:44.320> the

but so far its functionality isn't up to

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.449 
but so far its functionality isn't up to
