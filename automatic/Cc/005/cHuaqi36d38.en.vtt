and torque spec is 58 foot-pounds

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.039 
and torque spec is 58 foot-pounds
alright<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.310> 22<00:01:50.670> millimeter<00:01:51.180> nut<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.689> got

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
alright that's a 22 millimeter nut I got

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.590 
alright that's a 22 millimeter nut I got
a<00:01:52.079> little<00:01:52.290> jinx<00:01:53.189> set<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.570> that

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
a little jinx set up here so that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.990 
a little jinx set up here so that
release<00:01:55.110> lever<00:01:55.409> doesn't<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:55.860> hit<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.820> I'm

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
release lever doesn't get hit but I'm

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.859 
release lever doesn't get hit but I'm
going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.180> torque<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.329> down<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.600> 58

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
going to torque it down to 58

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.889 
going to torque it down to 58
foot-pounds<00:01:59.180> now<00:02:00.180> I'm<00:02:00.270> going<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> bend<00:02:00.750> over

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
foot-pounds now I'm going to bend over

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.480 
foot-pounds now I'm going to bend over
that<00:02:01.229> part<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.619> washer<00:02:02.009> right<00:02:02.189> there<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
that part of the washer right there the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.039 
that part of the washer right there the
part<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.880> didn't<00:02:03.180> use<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.689> isn't<00:02:03.810> all

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
part that I didn't use and it isn't all

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.899 
part that I didn't use and it isn't all
chewed<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.469> but<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.979> got<00:02:05.219> lucky<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.729> lined

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
chewed up but I got lucky and it lined

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.990 
chewed up but I got lucky and it lined
up<00:02:06.030> perfect<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:08.220> looks<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.729> first

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
up perfect it looks like this first

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.729 
up perfect it looks like this first
friction<00:02:09.690> plate<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.020> goes<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> little

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
friction plate that goes on is a little

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.020 
friction plate that goes on is a little
bit<00:02:10.890> thicker<00:02:11.160> than<00:02:11.280> those<00:02:11.610> other<00:02:11.790> ones

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
bit thicker than those other ones

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.550 
bit thicker than those other ones
because<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.510> first<00:02:12.720> friction<00:02:13.110> pad

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
because the first friction pad

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.620 
because the first friction pad
actually<00:02:14.069> rubs<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:15.000> clutch<00:02:15.180> basket

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
actually rubs on the clutch basket

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:24.350 
actually rubs on the clutch basket
itself<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:21.330> install<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.880> then<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
itself to install that and then on the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.270 
itself to install that and then on the
steel<00:02:25.110> plates<00:02:25.440> there's<00:02:25.709> this<00:02:25.800> little<00:02:25.980> part

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
steel plates there's this little part

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.580 
steel plates there's this little part
that<00:02:26.430> sticks<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.959> you're<00:02:27.959> going<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.200> make<00:02:28.380> sure

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
that sticks up you're going to make sure

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.550 
that sticks up you're going to make sure
that<00:02:28.770> those<00:02:29.010> go<00:02:29.430> into<00:02:29.580> alternating<00:02:30.120> order<00:02:30.690> so

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
that those go into alternating order so

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.050 
that those go into alternating order so
you're<00:02:31.680> going<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.860> put<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:32.190> there<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.459> then

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
you're going to put one there and then

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.250 
you're going to put one there and then
the<00:02:33.180> next<00:02:33.420> one<00:02:33.569> you're<00:02:33.630> going<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.810> put<00:02:34.050> over

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
the next one you're going to put over

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.990 
the next one you're going to put over
here<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.069> next<00:02:35.250> one<00:02:35.430> over<00:02:35.550> there<00:02:35.819> and

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
here and the next one over there and

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.160 
here and the next one over there and
next<00:02:36.180> one<00:02:36.300> over<00:02:36.390> there<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.599> think<00:02:36.630> there's<00:02:36.930> six

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
next one over there I think there's six

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.750 
next one over there I think there's six
plates<00:02:37.470> total<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.069> should<00:02:38.280> have<00:02:38.370> three<00:02:38.640> on

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
plates total so you should have three on

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.050 
plates total so you should have three on
top<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.239> three<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.599> bottom<00:02:40.640> now<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.670> steel

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
top and three on bottom now the steel

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.000 
top and three on bottom now the steel
ring<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.450> going<00:02:42.599> to<00:02:42.660> go<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:42.989> underneath<00:02:43.530> the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
ring is going to go on underneath the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.770 
ring is going to go on underneath the
second<00:02:44.459> friction<00:02:44.910> plate<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.390> install

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
second friction plate that you install

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.600 
second friction plate that you install
should<00:02:46.290> slide<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.769> underneath<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.250> perfect

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
should slide in underneath it perfect

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.050 
should slide in underneath it perfect
just<00:02:47.790> like<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:49.340> now<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.400> install<00:02:50.790> your

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
just like that now to install your

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.880 
just like that now to install your
pressure<00:02:51.330> plate<00:02:51.630> line<00:02:52.019> up<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.470> hole<00:02:52.860> right

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890
