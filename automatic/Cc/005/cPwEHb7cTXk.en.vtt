how<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.470> gonna<00:00:31.619> work

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
how this is gonna work

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.660 
how this is gonna work
you<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.540> either<00:00:33.690> mount<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.590> there<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.100> your

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
you can either mount it there on your

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.660 
you can either mount it there on your
stem<00:00:35.969> or<00:00:36.210> at<00:00:37.140> your<00:00:37.380> handlebar<00:00:37.800> that's<00:00:38.399> your

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
stem or at your handlebar that's your

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
stem or at your handlebar that's your
decision<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.719> gonna<00:00:39.870> take<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> little

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
decision and I'm gonna take a little

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.299 
decision and I'm gonna take a little
folks<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> little<00:00:42.629> thoughts<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:43.280> what<00:00:44.280> I

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
folks have a little thoughts of what I

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.200 
folks have a little thoughts of what I
think<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> smallest<00:00:45.510> things<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:47.210> this

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
think is the smallest things to do this

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.470 
think is the smallest things to do this
is<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.600> mount<00:00:49.320> itself<00:00:49.969> this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> front

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
is the mount itself this is the front

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.889 
is the mount itself this is the front
maybe<00:00:52.199> not<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.590> easy<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.129> see<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.579> front

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
maybe not so easy to see this is a front

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.729 
maybe not so easy to see this is a front
and<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> back<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:57.120> comes<00:00:57.300> with

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
and this is the back and it comes with

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.260 
and this is the back and it comes with
four<00:00:58.739> strips<00:00:59.370> or<00:00:59.789> sips<00:01:00.539> or<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.289> call<00:01:01.440> it

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
four strips or sips or what you call it

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.890 
four strips or sips or what you call it
so<00:01:04.159> if<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.280> got<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.119> got<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> mount<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.689> on

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
so if you got a if you got a mount it on

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.109 
so if you got a if you got a mount it on
another<00:01:07.590> bike<00:01:07.740> later<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.549> will<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.850> two

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
bag which is not really environmental

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.929 
bag which is not really environmental
friendly<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.150> not<00:01:18.810> very<00:01:18.840> good<00:01:19.200> Garmin<00:01:19.939> anyways

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.390 
friendly so not very good Garmin anyways
not<00:01:21.420> enough<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> floral<00:01:22.350> hook<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.070> Garmin

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
not enough of the floral hook the Garmin

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.149 
not enough of the floral hook the Garmin
let's<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.299> how<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:25.110> could<00:01:25.439> really<00:01:25.590> work<00:01:25.740> on

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
let's see how this could really work on

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.740 
let's see how this could really work on
this<00:01:26.759> mountain<00:01:27.600> bicycle<00:01:28.880> as<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.150> mentioned

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
this mountain bicycle as I mentioned

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.710 
this mountain bicycle as I mentioned
earlier<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.320> could<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.460> here<00:01:34.700> and

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
earlier you could have it like here and

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.080 
earlier you could have it like here and
it<00:01:36.720> fits<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.170> nice<00:01:37.439> actually

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
it fits really nice actually

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.620 
it fits really nice actually
it<00:01:39.090> says<00:01:39.390> widths<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.170> 2.5<00:01:40.799> centimeters<00:01:41.630> so

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
it says widths up to 2.5 centimeters so

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.830 
it says widths up to 2.5 centimeters so
so<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.909> handlebar<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.090> goes<00:01:45.299> very<00:01:45.540> well<00:01:45.689> with

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
so this handlebar it goes very well with

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.270 
so this handlebar it goes very well with
this<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> richest<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.970> more<00:01:49.280> standard

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
this is a richest have more standard

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.609 
this is a richest have more standard
diamond<00:01:51.000> diameter<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.780> think<00:01:52.049> but<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.470> should

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
diamond diameter I think but you should

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.950 
diamond diameter I think but you should
check<00:01:52.829> with<00:01:53.040> your<00:01:53.189> your<00:01:53.670> step

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
check with your your step

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.560 
check with your your step
and<00:01:55.259> Hempel<00:01:55.979> anyways<00:01:57.409> what<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.439> did<00:01:59.119> instead<00:02:00.119> of

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
and Hempel anyways what I did instead of

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.810 
and Hempel anyways what I did instead of
mounting<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.049> there<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.530> wanted<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.250> mount<00:02:02.610> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
mounting it there I wanted to mount it

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.069 
mounting it there I wanted to mount it
on<00:02:03.060> my<00:02:03.270> stomach

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
on my stomach

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.839 
on my stomach
why<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.759> well<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:07.039> suspect<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.640> could

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
why is that well I suspect that it could

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.119 
why is that well I suspect that it could
be<00:02:09.030> some<00:02:09.270> slipping<00:02:09.780> here<00:02:10.020> if<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.619> hit<00:02:10.770> rocks

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
be some slipping here if you hit rocks

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.780 
be some slipping here if you hit rocks
or<00:02:11.489> rock<00:02:11.730> corns

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
or rock corns

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.309 
or rock corns
when<00:02:13.420> you're<00:02:13.540> single<00:02:13.810> tracking<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.450> you

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
when you're single tracking so so you

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.110 
when you're single tracking so so you
have<00:02:18.060> much<00:02:19.060> more<00:02:19.360> stability<00:02:19.569> here<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.200> think

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
have much more stability here I think

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.780 
have much more stability here I think
time<00:02:22.120> will<00:02:22.150> tell<00:02:22.510> though<00:02:22.720> but<00:02:23.470> that's<00:02:23.650> my<00:02:24.040> my

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
time will tell though but that's my my

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.050 
time will tell though but that's my my
first<00:02:25.030> thought<00:02:25.269> of<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.629> and<00:02:26.849> it's<00:02:27.849> really

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
first thought of this and it's really

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.710 
first thought of this and it's really
easy<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.450> see<00:02:28.840> it's<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.290> little<00:02:29.410> bit<00:02:29.560> bigger

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
easy you see it's a little bit bigger

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.380 
easy you see it's a little bit bigger
diameter<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.080> stem<00:02:32.319> but<00:02:33.069> still<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:33.580> it's

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
diameter of the stem but still it's it's

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.380 
diameter of the stem but still it's it's
not<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.599> problem<00:02:34.900> really<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.709> mount<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.069> here

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
not a problem really to to mount it here

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.970 
not a problem really to to mount it here
so<00:02:37.390> we<00:02:37.510> just<00:02:37.540> place<00:02:38.379> it<00:02:38.410> wherever<00:02:38.769> you<00:02:38.950> want

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
so we just place it wherever you want

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.000 
so we just place it wherever you want
out<00:02:39.310> suggest<00:02:40.120> placing<00:02:40.599> it<00:02:40.720> as<00:02:41.440> far<00:02:41.709> up<00:02:41.860> as

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
out suggest placing it as far up as

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.910 
out suggest placing it as far up as
possible<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.510> don't<00:02:43.930> need<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.230> bend<00:02:44.769> your

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
possible so you don't need to bend your

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.339 
possible so you don't need to bend your
neck<00:02:45.099> so<00:02:45.340> much<00:02:45.549> when<00:02:45.819> you're<00:02:45.910> gonna<00:02:46.200> see<00:02:47.200> the

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
neck so much when you're gonna see the

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.900 
neck so much when you're gonna see the
screen<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:50.129> you<00:02:51.129> might<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.430> really<00:02:51.730> by

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
screen and you might it really by

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.710 
screen and you might it really by
putting<00:02:52.629> the<00:02:52.750> two<00:02:52.930> strips<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:55.239> showed<00:02:55.510> you

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
putting the two strips that I showed you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.250 
putting the two strips that I showed you
earlier<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.370> end<00:02:57.519> finish<00:02:58.049> could<00:02:59.049> be

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
earlier and the end finish could be

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.090 
earlier and the end finish could be
something<00:02:59.769> like<00:02:59.799> this<00:03:00.190> on<00:03:00.459> my<00:03:00.760> robot
