00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
behind why I haven't been uploading and

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.960 
behind why I haven't been uploading and
it<00:00:28.380> was<00:00:28.560> simply<00:00:28.830> because<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.160> had<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.849> new

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
it was simply because I had a the new

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.580 
it was simply because I had a the new
job<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> had<00:00:30.480> with<00:00:30.960> quite<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> lot<00:00:31.500> of

job that I had with quite a lot of

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.319 
job that I had with quite a lot of
man-hours<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.309> didn't<00:00:32.550> even<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.790> time<00:00:33.059> for<00:00:33.120> my

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
man-hours I didn't even have time for my

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.360 
man-hours I didn't even have time for my
own<00:00:33.360> family<00:00:33.750> being<00:00:34.710> real<00:00:34.920> see<00:00:35.130> me<00:00:35.219> own

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
this one that I haven't unlocked at the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.160 
this one that I haven't unlocked at the
moment<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:02.039> well<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.780> yet<00:01:03.780> we're<00:01:03.870> gonna<00:01:04.019> jump

moment as well and yet we're gonna jump

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.539 
moment as well and yet we're gonna jump
straight<00:01:04.379> into<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.650> one<00:01:04.979> with<00:01:05.010> red

different ways but I've gone for a red
background<00:01:13.010> number<00:01:14.010> seven<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.340> Y<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.850> then

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
background number seven in Y and then

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:15.679 
background number seven in Y and then
what<00:01:15.060> I'm<00:01:15.119> gonna<00:01:15.240> do<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.420> get<00:01:15.570> these

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
what I'm gonna do is get these

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.899 
what I'm gonna do is get these
semicircles<00:01:16.409> here<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.009> stretch<00:01:17.340> them<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.729> a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
semicircles here and stretch them in a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.240 
semicircles here and stretch them in a
way<00:01:18.380> there's<00:01:19.380> gonna<00:01:19.470> start<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.890> shape<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
way there's gonna start to shape the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.620 
way there's gonna start to shape the
neck<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.820> see<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.210> reason<00:01:21.450> why<00:01:21.570> I'm

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
neck as you can see the reason why I'm

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.570 
neck as you can see the reason why I'm
this<00:01:22.140> one's<00:01:22.380> ready<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> see<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.369> soon<00:01:23.520> as

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
this one's ready like to see if soon as

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.800 
this one's ready like to see if soon as
you<00:01:23.640> put<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:23.939> red<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.420> matches<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you put them red it matches the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.130 
you put them red it matches the
background<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.470> makes<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.100> shared<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:27.600> shapes

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
background it makes the shared it shapes

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.569 
background it makes the shared it shapes
it<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> lot<00:01:28.439> better<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.070> patching<00:01:29.490> it

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
it a lot better it's like patching it

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.100 
it a lot better it's like patching it
open<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.270> background<00:01:30.540> hands<00:01:30.930> that

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
open it the background hands that

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.590 
open it the background hands that
patching<00:01:31.470> off<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.610> put<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.299> its<00:01:33.420> neck

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
patching off so I put one on its neck

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.120 
patching off so I put one on its neck
one<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.990> its<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.470> underneath<00:01:34.710> where<00:01:35.009> its

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
one of its just underneath where its

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.740 
one of its just underneath where its
head<00:01:35.220> will<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.790> also<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> back<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.630> its

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
head will be and also on the back of its

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.859 
head will be and also on the back of its
neck<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> looked<00:01:37.409> more<00:01:37.470> other<00:01:37.829> neck<00:01:38.869> gives

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
neck so it looked more other neck gives

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.840 
the bottom now on this video I usually
play<00:02:03.899> with<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.170> I'm<00:02:04.259> quite<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> bit<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.460> I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
play with it I'm quite a bit of the I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.139 
play with it I'm quite a bit of the I
play<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> video<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.700> fact<00:02:08.700> I've<00:02:08.849> played<00:02:09.060> with

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
play the video a fact I've played with

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.620 
play the video a fact I've played with
it<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.330> bit<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.660> quicker<00:02:10.349> sped<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.920> up<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.069> bit<00:02:11.099> and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
it a bit so quicker sped it up a bit and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.630 
it a bit so quicker sped it up a bit and
so<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.200> looks<00:02:13.410> better<00:02:13.500> because<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.310> I'll

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
so it looks better because of that I'll

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.040 
so it looks better because of that I'll
spend<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.150> video<00:02:15.390> will<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.600> lot<00:02:15.720> longer<00:02:15.840> if

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
spend this video will be a lot longer if

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.660 
spend this video will be a lot longer if
I<00:02:16.110> didn't<00:02:16.290> speed<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.590> all<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.460> want<00:02:17.640> a

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.630 
I didn't speed it all and you want a
city<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.030> 20<00:02:18.300> minutes<00:02:18.540> dance<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.350> it's<00:02:20.190> easy

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
city of 20 minutes dance and it's easy

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
scratch start from scratch this one

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.570 
scratch start from scratch this one
actually<00:03:42.750> does<00:03:42.990> look<00:03:43.140> a<00:03:43.200> little<00:03:43.440> bit<00:03:43.650> bow<00:03:43.860> so

once I've placed it how I once look on

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.050 
once I've placed it how I once look on
the<00:03:46.680> copy<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.040> paste<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.460> make<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:47.940> bit

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
the copy and paste it make it a bit

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.730 
the copy and paste it make it a bit
smaller<00:03:48.180> while<00:03:48.600> we're<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.780> down<00:03:48.960> put<00:03:49.650> in

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
smaller while we're it down put in

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.870 
smaller while we're it down put in
position<00:03:50.070> and<00:03:50.190> we<00:03:50.280> keep<00:03:50.490> doing<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:50.820> until

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
and then the last bit is completely
