over before but that video got lost

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.940 
over before but that video got lost
somewhere<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.930> this<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:46.860> will

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
somewhere and this this is what will

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.549 
somewhere and this this is what will
come<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.340> lot<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.520> lockout<00:00:47.940> kits<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:49.410> only
