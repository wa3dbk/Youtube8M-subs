00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.559
 hello everyone my name is Valencian 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.050
 of students of the degree cycle 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:11.310
 top cooking direction I can 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.090
 state that despite my cut 22 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.410
 years 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.120
 I am clear that I want this to be my 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.890
 professional future I love the kitchen 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.630
 I feel fulfilled in it and something 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.890
 like in particular is the fact that 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.079
 can constantly be learning 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.849
 if you want you can withdraw from what 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.919
 is taken to the kitchen and continue 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.659
 learning in a limited way and 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.419
 I think here in this school and with this 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:32.099
 great opportunity that they are giving I can 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.530
 greatly increase and giving a great 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.899
 step that knowledge without anything else 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.719
 what to add we will start with the recipe that 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.699
 I have chosen for a course what I titled 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.710
 the essence of the three continents already 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.629
 I wanted to explain a bit 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.280
 Canary Islands has been a free port for 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.559
 so to speak of different ingredients 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.300
 of vegetable vegetables spices we have 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.000
 started with the can that should be a 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.769
 Iberian pig and we have chosen the dam 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.440
 Iberian since having so much fat 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.629
 between truth with a good song makes 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.030
 that the palate is very soft honey 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.949
 first garrison was established 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.960
 I wanted to have some kind of thirst 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.270
 chosen the ticket is also usually 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.090
 call yes or by itself and we will go down 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.070
 with them with grated cheese for the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.840
 food garnish with slow cv 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.380
 we have chosen since we are in the Canary Islands 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.329
 and the potato is a very important element 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.130
 the black potato plate but that is a 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.439
 imitation of the way it has been done 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.360
 when the bread basket has not had production 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.360
 to replace them, it is worth mentioning that 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.740
 it is very accomplished the taste the white coat and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.509
 Sweet potato yolk third 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.350
 garrison which was free as well 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.329
 say it 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.759
 we have chosen some cheese appetizers 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.340
 with fried plantains the goat cheese 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.170
 animal that knew to adapt to the paisana 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.450
 group and rest of the island to a milk 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.399
 exceptional for his cheese the banana that 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.799
 the Canarian banana and finally the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.649

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.909
 cactus fruit from here of the islands 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.709
 also palm honey is 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.599
 origin see to eat is obtained from the 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.429
 salvia of the Canarian palm tree which 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:03.689
 call guara to get honey from 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.880
 palm is simply a cooking 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.099
 flattered of said said guarapo and 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.229
 we have a port wine last 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.260
 as decorative elements we have chosen 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.240
 the mir powder which is mine crushed 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.580
 and dried in the oven 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.870
 about six seven hours depending on the 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.060
 oven and the powder of flowers in mole and 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.710

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.050
 last verbena 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.700
 in this case we have chosen the pressure 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.120
 america that as I said earlier 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.580
 the tongue for its softness and we have 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.010
 enriched with apart a cooking to 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.390
 slow fire a dark background which 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.850
 It should be noted that we have put 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.880
