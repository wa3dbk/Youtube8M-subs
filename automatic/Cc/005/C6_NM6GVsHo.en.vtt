something England forget over

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.510 
something England forget over
I<00:00:14.910> said<00:00:15.780> awful<00:00:16.139> awful<00:00:16.710> happening<00:00:17.190> really<00:00:17.369> I

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
I said awful awful happening really I

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.250 
I said awful awful happening really I
mean<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.730> captain<00:00:18.119> as<00:00:18.210> well<00:00:18.390> our<00:00:18.690> best<00:00:18.930> center

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
mean the captain as well our best center

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.340 
mean the captain as well our best center
but<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.529> think<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:20.689> it's<00:00:21.689> all<00:00:21.840> going<00:00:22.050> wrong<00:00:22.199> at

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
but I think it's it's all going wrong at

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.980 
but I think it's it's all going wrong at
the<00:00:22.439> last<00:00:22.980> minute<00:00:23.279> really<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:24.210> hopefully

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the last minute really is that hopefully

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.710 
the last minute really is that hopefully
not<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> disaster<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:26.060> it's<00:00:27.060> an<00:00:27.240> order<00:00:27.630> of

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
not a disaster but it's an order of

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.269 
not a disaster but it's an order of
magnitude<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.590> yeah<00:00:28.769> because<00:00:29.099> I

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
magnitude for you is it yeah because I

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.999 
magnitude for you is it yeah because I
think<00:00:29.849> he<00:00:29.939> really<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.720> real<00:00:31.470> heartbeat<00:00:31.890> of

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
think he really is the real heartbeat of

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.250 
think he really is the real heartbeat of
that<00:00:32.130> defense<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.790> he's<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.329> captain<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:34.140> I

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
that defense and he's the captain as I

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.360 
that defense and he's the captain as I
said<00:00:34.440> we've<00:00:34.590> already<00:00:34.710> lost<00:00:34.950> one<00:00:35.040> captain

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
said we've already lost one captain

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.280 
said we've already lost one captain
earlier<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.120> season<00:00:36.300> when<00:00:37.170> his

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
earlier on in the season when his

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.590 
earlier on in the season when his
captaincy<00:00:37.649> was<00:00:37.890> changed<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.579> yeah<00:00:39.270> it's

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
captaincy was changed and yeah it's

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.250 
captaincy was changed and yeah it's
gonna<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:39.930> many<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.829> other<00:00:40.950> captains

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
gonna have to be many of other captains

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.510 
gonna have to be many of other captains
what<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.379> reckon<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.280> really

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
what do you reckon is it is it really

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.970 
what do you reckon is it is it really
that<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.180> mountable<00:00:45.620> it's<00:00:46.620> something<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
that it's a mountable it's something a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.560 
that it's a mountable it's something a
great<00:00:47.160> group<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.670> certainly<00:00:48.059> employ<00:00:48.329> means

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
great group can certainly employ means

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.540 
great group can certainly employ means
he's<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.079> captain<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.649> squad<00:00:49.800> he's<00:00:50.370> one

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
he's the captain of the squad he's one

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.770 
he's the captain of the squad he's one
of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> most<00:00:50.760> experienced<00:00:51.360> players<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.560 
of the most experienced players in the
team<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.489> he's<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:53.730> had<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> great<00:00:54.300> season

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570

problem<00:00:56.309> recurring<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.329> growing<00:00:57.570> problem

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
problem recurring is a growing problem

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.959 
problem recurring is a growing problem
as<00:00:58.230> well<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.250> obviously<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.579> new<00:00:59.760> problem

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
as well this is obviously a new problem

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.459 
as well this is obviously a new problem
is<00:01:00.149> knee<00:01:00.329> ligament<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.960> looks<00:01:01.109> lot<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
is knee ligament so it looks lot to be a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.170 
is knee ligament so it looks lot to be a
separate<00:01:01.800> issue<00:01:01.890> right<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.609> think<00:01:02.910> which<00:01:03.059> is

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
separate issue right I think which is

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.189 
separate issue right I think which is
that<00:01:03.270> I've<00:01:03.359> read<00:01:03.510> online<00:01:03.660> comes<00:01:04.019> there

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that I've read online comes there

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.719 
that I've read online comes there
although<00:01:04.379> we're<00:01:04.769> already<00:01:05.040> questions<00:01:05.549> about

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
although we're already questions about

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.310 
although we're already questions about
how<00:01:05.850> long<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.090> might<00:01:06.210> survive<00:01:06.540> if<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.110> turns

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
how long you might survive if it turns

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.320 
how long you might survive if it turns
into<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.560> long<00:01:07.770> tournament<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.939> know<00:01:09.030> some<00:01:09.270> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
into a long tournament you know some of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.490 
into a long tournament you know some of
those<00:01:09.390> things<00:01:09.570> might<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:09.990> come<00:01:10.200> back<00:01:10.229> any

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
those things might have come back any

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.440 
those things might have come back any
more<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.520> way<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:11.970> great<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.330> it's

being<00:02:51.950> fairly<00:02:52.189> abusive<00:02:52.489> but<00:02:52.909> does<00:02:53.180> he<00:02:53.269> deserve

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
being fairly abusive but does he deserve

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.929 
being fairly abusive but does he deserve
all<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:54.379> stick<00:02:54.590> he<00:02:54.680> gets<00:02:54.889> I<00:02:55.129> don't<00:02:55.519> think<00:02:55.760> so<00:02:55.909> I

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:55.939

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.339 
all the stick he gets I don't think so I
think<00:02:56.000> I<00:02:56.299> think<00:02:56.359> that's<00:02:56.540> harsh<00:02:56.840> really<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.230> mean

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
think I think that's harsh really I mean

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.449 
think I think that's harsh really I mean
he's<00:02:57.530> been<00:02:57.709> he<00:02:57.889> was<00:02:58.010> brilliant<00:02:58.189> in<00:02:58.400> the

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
he's been he was brilliant in the

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.250 
he's been he was brilliant in the
qualifiers<00:02:58.909> you<00:02:59.150> know<00:02:59.239> him<00:02:59.389> and<00:02:59.510> Rooney<00:03:00.109> look

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260

very<00:03:00.439> well<00:03:00.590> upfront<00:03:00.889> together<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.549> think<00:03:02.000> he's

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
very well upfront together I think he's

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.369 
very well upfront together I think he's
got<00:03:02.269> a<00:03:02.299> lot<00:03:02.389> of<00:03:02.450> cobble<00:03:02.720> guy<00:03:02.810> personally<00:03:03.290> he

got a lot of cobble guy personally he

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.569 
got a lot of cobble guy personally he

doesn't score goals and I think people

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.020 
doesn't score goals and I think people
get<00:03:04.790> annoyed<00:03:04.939> well<00:03:06.370> there's<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.459> striker<00:03:07.790> he

doesn't score when he go but I don't
