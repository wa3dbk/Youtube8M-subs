so<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> motherboard<00:01:57.270> here<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.869> actually<00:01:58.500> an

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
so the motherboard here is actually an

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.410 
so the motherboard here is actually an
upgraded<00:01:59.100> motherboard<00:01:59.579> over<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.939> 499

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
upgraded motherboard over the 499

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.840 
upgraded motherboard over the 499
version<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> 499<00:02:01.710> 1<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.490> main<00:02:02.820> difference

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
version so the 499 1 the main difference

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.840 
version so the 499 1 the main difference
in<00:02:03.509> terms<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.930> i/o<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.100> only<00:02:05.250> has<00:02:05.549> two

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
in terms of i/o is that it only has two

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.910 
in terms of i/o is that it only has two
USB<00:02:06.060> 3<00:02:06.719> ports<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> back<00:02:07.290> whereas<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.860> one

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
USB 3 ports on the back whereas this one

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.400 
USB 3 ports on the back whereas this one
has<00:02:08.160> four<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.479> upgraded<00:02:10.020> one<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.349> is

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
has four so on this upgraded one this is

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.470 
has four so on this upgraded one this is
the<00:02:10.500> pro<00:02:10.800> level<00:02:10.950> board<00:02:11.220> we've<00:02:11.459> got<00:02:11.670> two<00:02:11.879> usb2

an<00:04:53.200> entry-level<00:04:53.530> gamer<00:04:53.950> so<00:04:54.190> i<00:04:54.220> might<00:04:54.550> want<00:04:54.760> to

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
an entry-level gamer so i might want to

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.580 
an entry-level gamer so i might want to
add<00:04:54.940> a<00:04:54.970> dedicated<00:04:55.450> graphics<00:04:55.930> card<00:04:56.140> even<00:04:56.350> if

about gaming then the only thing that

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.130 
about gaming then the only thing that
I'd<00:05:03.190> really<00:05:03.460> change<00:05:03.730> is<00:05:04.000> I'd<00:05:04.210> throw<00:05:04.450> an<00:05:04.600> SSD<00:05:05.050> in

solution<00:06:06.850> especially<00:06:07.570> for<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.350> price<00:06:08.530> so<00:06:09.250> I
