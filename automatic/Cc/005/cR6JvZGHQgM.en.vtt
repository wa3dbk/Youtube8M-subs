00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.060
 make sure to reveal when to jump 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.120
 jump and so here I feel 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.180
 inverted which in a 10 in all 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.079

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.459

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:51.730
 when we publish 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.060
 adif forest fountains after vacation 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.060
 Show 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.640
 In an hour 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.430
 from the first day you want to improve 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.960
 every day and maybe that's why the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.050
 second year is better because 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.390
 we know better what we know and we have in 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.030
 ambition plan to improve all 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.150
 the days we learn a little community 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.450
 we try to improve and that's why 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.030
 I think the second year was for soda 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.160
 but for everything and also the second 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.060
 year was better than the first if it is 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.080
 truth is always with us is 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.270
 important because 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.570
 it is always a reference that we 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.430
 we have and we respect a lot and we know that 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.900

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.900
