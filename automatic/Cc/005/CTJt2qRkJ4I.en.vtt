00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hi we are all here with a new one 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.899
 video of gta 5 in this video vi 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.000
 I'll explain how to get the car happy 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.290
 su gta online 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.650
 then there are few passages but one is 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.880
 fundamental 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.400
 you will need a friend who already has the 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.859
 the alien machine because it will be enough for you 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.970
 simply duplicate it and then I could 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.570
 you can also drink it in your garage 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.910
 ok so you have to have one 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.730
 free space in the garage you see I have 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.730
 prepared one that is the one there 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.400
 now I will go out and that is my friend that me 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.010
 wait outside with the alien machine 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.470
 ready to duplicate if you want I can 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.239
 do it myself, a few of you maybe 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.220
 five people maximum so you can 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.100
 you have it too without having to look for a 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.989
 friend who has the alien car 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.710
 however the alien machine is that of 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.720
 gta offline and the one you take with i 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.690
 pieces and was minted copied 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.300
 etc. from a hacker probably or from 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.700
 one that changed play and then 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.570
 copied to everyone the machine is 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.610
 only modifiable you can put it 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.619
 insurance what $ 130,000 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.229
 so it's not a trick 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:27.220
 and here it is, ok, he got on the car 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.729
 well now i told my friend about 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.789
 get on the machine that is ready 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.340
 to duplicate then you will have to go up 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.810
 car with your friends out of the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:44.439
 your garage call martin 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.299
 that's the way it used to be once 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:51.900
 what you called martin request 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.900
 activity and wait for it to give her 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.540
 here is done once he has given you the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.790
 mission death from the art from above is 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.520
 same as a mission as long as you can 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.340
 make in a player why you will have to 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.350
 be alone, accept it 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.350
 it won't let you out of the lobby because if 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.030
 you accept you can still talk with 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.230
 Your friend and the years maybe 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.390
 stand still and so on 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:24.150
 and what you have to do is start it from 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:26.700
 only once you have started the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.800
 mission alone 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.959
 here the alien machine will come 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.630
 duplicate and you will be free to 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.810
 put it in your garage right now 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.810
 here 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.360
 well then now in the garage will have 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.610
 only the indicator does not 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.560
 the insurance I've already told you 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.819
 it will cost a lot you will have to do it from 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.250
 alone and now you can abandon the 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.620
 garage obviously and or finish the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.940
 mission or call martin e 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.480
 cancel it then exit the mission 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.160
 without completing it I will now do it 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.840
 see how I did it already 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:19.620
 last time i don't want to and 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:19.620
 so the gate is ok, I'm out 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.360
 pull on the phone go on, indeed no 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.380
 sorry sorry we don't go on martin ma 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:36.390
 let's go to the current activity list 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.670
 square and hicks that is to abandon now 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.350
 will let you out, you will enter another 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.650
 lobby then you can come back with yours 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.650
 friends 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:52.470
 here we are in another lobby e 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:55.110
 now I'll show you that it works 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:01.500
 because now we are not in the mission 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:04.020
 back to the garage and I should still have it 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.900
 the liena machine ready to use for 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.900
 always practically here is the giu 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.459
 now I'll let you take a ride 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.290
 maybe to let you see as if you are there 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.910
 interested you can now 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.000
 almost everyone has it 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.890
 so I don't think it's hard to find 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.450
 someone around who has it and 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:32.450
 ask if you can copy it too 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.090
 ok 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:52.290
 unfortunately we tried and get in 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.000
 top of the mountain does not work not 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.620
 so the aliens won't come anyway 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.490
 see you all from an upcoming video 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.490
 take care of me
