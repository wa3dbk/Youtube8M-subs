me just show you the parts that you
could<00:00:28.349> use<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:30.320> this<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:32.059> went<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.239> craft

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
could use on this I went to a craft

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.049 
could use on this I went to a craft
store<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.790> it's<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:36.000> giant<00:00:36.480> ball<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.760> cut

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
store and it's a giant ball and I cut

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.959 
store and it's a giant ball and I cut
some<00:00:39.239> off<00:00:40.489> and<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:43.620> balls<00:00:43.829> really<00:00:44.340> cost<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.820> lot

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
some off and the balls really cost a lot

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.869 
some off and the balls really cost a lot
so<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:46.320> one<00:00:46.500> cost<00:00:46.680> like<00:00:46.860> 13<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.460> wasn't<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
so this one cost like 13 this wasn't the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.720 
so this one cost like 13 this wasn't the
biggest<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:49.430> this<00:00:50.430> right<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.989> nucleus

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
biggest and this right here the nucleus

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.139 
biggest and this right here the nucleus
