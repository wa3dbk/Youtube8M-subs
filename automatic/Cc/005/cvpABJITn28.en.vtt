access<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.560> labor<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:27.040> achieve<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.910> same

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
access and labor to achieve the same

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.809 
access and labor to achieve the same
result<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.530> expectations<00:02:30.220> on<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.400> job<00:02:30.640> like

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
result so the expectations on a job like

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.870 
result so the expectations on a job like
this<00:02:30.849> is<00:02:31.239> that<00:02:31.599> we<00:02:32.500> will<00:02:33.099> have<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.400> work<00:02:33.549> longer

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
this is that we will have to work longer

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.520 
this is that we will have to work longer
hours<00:02:34.000> if<00:02:34.360> we<00:02:34.480> don't<00:02:34.660> meet<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.140> deadlines

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
hours if we don't meet the deadlines

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.039 
hours if we don't meet the deadlines
which<00:02:35.980> puts<00:02:36.459> pressure<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.299> guys<00:02:37.450> on<00:02:37.750> site

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
which puts pressure on the guys on site

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.039 
which puts pressure on the guys on site
and<00:02:38.610> being<00:02:39.610> able<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.970> install<00:02:40.329> pipe<00:02:40.660> quicker

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
and being able to install pipe quicker

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.630 
and being able to install pipe quicker
means<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.590> guys<00:02:41.739> can<00:02:41.980> go<00:02:42.099> home<00:02:42.310> at<00:02:42.519> the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
means that the guys can go home at the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.069 
means that the guys can go home at the
end<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.819> a<00:02:42.940> eight-hour<00:02:43.480> day<00:02:43.690> instead<00:02:43.959> of

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
end of a eight-hour day instead of

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.990 
end of a eight-hour day instead of
having<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.349> work<00:02:44.500> with<00:02:44.620> 12<00:02:44.890> hour<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.069> day<00:02:45.130> okay

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
having to work with 12 hour a day okay

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.970 
having to work with 12 hour a day okay
so<00:02:46.060> we've<00:02:46.239> got<00:02:46.269> six<00:02:46.660> installers<00:02:47.290> working

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
so we've got six installers working

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.759 
so we've got six installers working
on-site<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.730> do<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:49.000> roof<00:02:49.269> sections<00:02:49.720> in<00:02:50.470> the

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
on-site to do the roof sections in the

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.370 
on-site to do the roof sections in the
valve<00:02:51.040> room<00:02:51.310> itself<00:02:51.700> we're<00:02:52.030> down<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.569> four<00:02:52.780> for

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
valve room itself we're down to four for

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.440 
valve room itself we're down to four for
the<00:02:53.500> heavier<00:02:53.829> equipment<00:02:54.069> we<00:02:54.970> can<00:02:55.090> actually

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
the heavier equipment we can actually

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.759 
the heavier equipment we can actually
install<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.810> valve<00:02:55.930> sets<00:02:56.260> with<00:02:56.410> only<00:02:56.560> two

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
install the valve sets with only two

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.789 
install the valve sets with only two
guys<00:02:57.420> I'd<00:02:58.420> estimate<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:59.109> we<00:02:59.200> saved<00:02:59.470> around

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
guys I'd estimate that we saved around

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.949 
guys I'd estimate that we saved around
five<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:00.730> eight<00:03:00.790> percent<00:03:01.269> on<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.480> total<00:03:01.780> bail

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
five to eight percent on the total bail

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.780 
five to eight percent on the total bail
costs<00:03:02.230> by<00:03:02.680> using<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.160> installation<00:03:03.609> ready

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
costs by using the installation ready

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:26.670 
costs by using the installation ready
technology

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.860 

well<00:03:27.680> we've<00:03:27.830> done<00:03:28.040> two<00:03:28.790> successful<00:03:29.300> projects

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
well we've done two successful projects

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.170 
well we've done two successful projects
with<00:03:29.990> victaulic<00:03:30.380> as<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.710> supplier<00:03:31.100> now<00:03:31.310> first

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
with victaulic as a supplier now first

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.840 
with victaulic as a supplier now first
been<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.720> freezer<00:03:33.440> install<00:03:34.130> where<00:03:34.400> we<00:03:34.550> had<00:03:34.730> to

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
been a freezer install where we had to

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.000 
been a freezer install where we had to
work<00:03:35.000> in<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.300> live<00:03:35.660> freezer<00:03:36.020> at<00:03:36.230> minus<00:03:36.500> 20

work in a live freezer at minus 20
the<00:03:37.280> insulation<00:03:37.730> really<00:03:38.150> couplings<00:03:38.570> provided

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
the insulation really couplings provided

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.810 
the insulation really couplings provided
us<00:03:39.260> with<00:03:39.350> a<00:03:39.470> flush<00:03:39.710> seal<00:03:39.950> on<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.190> gasket<00:03:40.640> as

us with a flush seal on the gasket as

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.420 
us with a flush seal on the gasket as
well<00:03:41.000> as<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.360> quick<00:03:41.600> install<00:03:42.050> in<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:43.160> freezer

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
well as a quick install in the freezer

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.580 
well as a quick install in the freezer
itself<00:03:43.880> so<00:03:44.360> we're<00:03:44.510> doing<00:03:44.600> a<00:03:44.750> warehouse<00:03:45.140> now

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
itself so we're doing a warehouse now

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.550 
itself so we're doing a warehouse now
that<00:03:45.860> is<00:03:46.010> similar<00:03:46.730> type<00:03:47.240> but<00:03:47.840> much<00:03:48.170> larger

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
that is similar type but much larger

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.140 
that is similar type but much larger
scale<00:03:48.830> and<00:03:49.010> we've<00:03:49.550> used<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.970> same

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
scale and we've used the same

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.480 
scale and we've used the same
methodology<00:03:50.810> on<00:03:51.020> this<00:03:51.440> new<00:03:51.710> warehouse<00:03:52.190> as

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
methodology on this new warehouse as

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.520 
methodology on this new warehouse as
well<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:53.090> it's<00:03:53.270> definitely<00:03:53.810> beneficial

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
well so it's definitely beneficial

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.180 
well so it's definitely beneficial

what we meet to be doing so the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.810 
what we meet to be doing so the
reliability<00:04:06.320> of<00:04:06.740> the<00:04:06.860> victaulic<00:04:07.160> product<00:04:07.640> is

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
reliability of the victaulic product is

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.030 
reliability of the victaulic product is
