here look towards the finish line what

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.990 
here look towards the finish line what
this<00:03:20.750> can't<00:03:20.989> be<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.919> tortoise<00:03:22.340> was<00:03:22.459> almost<00:03:22.819> to

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
this can't be the tortoise was almost to

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.809 
this can't be the tortoise was almost to
the<00:03:23.090> finish<00:03:23.359> line<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:25.130> hare<00:03:25.340> jumped<00:03:25.669> up<00:03:25.790> from

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
the finish line the hare jumped up from

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.550 
the finish line the hare jumped up from
his<00:03:26.090> resting<00:03:26.480> place<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.959> sprinted<00:03:27.349> toward

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
his resting place and sprinted toward

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.339 
his resting place and sprinted toward
the<00:03:27.680> finish<00:03:28.130> line<00:03:28.459> but<00:03:29.000> it<00:03:29.060> was<00:03:29.090> too<00:03:29.450> late<00:03:29.660> the

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
the finish line but it was too late the

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.289 
the finish line but it was too late the
tortoise<00:03:30.739> crossed<00:03:30.950> one<00:03:31.400> where<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.880> hare<00:03:32.090> can

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
tortoise crossed one where the hare can

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.449 
tortoise crossed one where the hare can
even<00:03:32.630> come<00:03:32.930> close

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
even come close

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.309 
even come close
but<00:03:34.459> perhaps<00:03:34.700> what<00:03:35.359> was<00:03:35.480> most<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.870> freshing

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
but perhaps what was most of freshing

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.020 
but perhaps what was most of freshing
was<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:36.889> tourists<00:03:37.280> did<00:03:37.370> not<00:03:37.579> brag<00:03:37.880> about

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
was that the tourists did not brag about

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.300 
was that the tourists did not brag about
