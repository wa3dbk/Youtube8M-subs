hey<00:00:08.380> this<00:00:08.559> is<00:00:08.650> Daniel<00:00:08.830> from<00:00:09.010> Adorama<00:00:09.160> today

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
hey this is Daniel from Adorama today

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.029 
hey this is Daniel from Adorama today
we're<00:00:10.180> gonna<00:00:10.269> talk<00:00:10.540> about<00:00:10.830> low<00:00:11.830> key<00:00:12.010> lighting

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:12.039 
we're gonna talk about low key lighting

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:13.799 
we're gonna talk about low key lighting
and<00:00:12.610> high<00:00:12.760> key<00:00:12.969> lighting<00:00:13.000> these<00:00:13.420> terms<00:00:13.660> are

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
and high key lighting these terms are

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:14.940 
and high key lighting these terms are
thrown<00:00:13.990> around<00:00:14.110> a<00:00:14.260> lot<00:00:14.289> so<00:00:14.559> I<00:00:14.619> figured<00:00:14.860> I'd

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
thrown around a lot so I figured I'd

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.470 
thrown around a lot so I figured I'd
talk<00:00:15.099> about<00:00:15.160> a<00:00:15.369> little<00:00:15.549> bit<00:00:15.700> and<00:00:15.760> and<00:00:16.090> let

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
talk about a little bit and and let

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.609 
talk about a little bit and and let
people<00:00:16.570> understand<00:00:16.990> what<00:00:17.109> they<00:00:17.199> really<00:00:17.470> mean

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
people understand what they really mean

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.730 
people understand what they really mean
so<00:00:18.310> high<00:00:18.699> key<00:00:18.939> lighting<00:00:18.970> a<00:00:19.660> lot<00:00:20.470> of<00:00:20.529> people

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
so high key lighting a lot of people

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.080 
so high key lighting a lot of people
immediately<00:00:20.890> think<00:00:21.130> of<00:00:21.369> shoot<00:00:21.760> against<00:00:22.029> a

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
immediately think of shoot against a

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.130 
immediately think of shoot against a
white<00:00:22.210> background<00:00:22.240> that's<00:00:22.810> high<00:00:22.960> key

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
white background that's high key

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.239 
white background that's high key
lighting<00:00:23.170> that<00:00:23.590> does<00:00:23.710> not<00:00:23.829> make<00:00:24.099> your

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:24.249 
lighting that does not make your

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.040 
lighting that does not make your
lighting<00:00:24.669> high<00:00:24.789> key<00:00:24.999> what<00:00:25.210> makes<00:00:25.390> it<00:00:25.570> high<00:00:25.839> key

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
lighting high key what makes it high key

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.800 
lighting high key what makes it high key
is<00:00:26.199> low<00:00:26.470> contrast<00:00:27.039> so<00:00:27.789> sure<00:00:28.269> a<00:00:28.300> lot<00:00:28.539> of<00:00:28.630> stuff

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
is low contrast so sure a lot of stuff

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.300 
is low contrast so sure a lot of stuff
the<00:00:28.960> Thai<00:00:29.109> key<00:00:29.289> is<00:00:29.409> shot<00:00:29.650> in<00:00:29.890> very<00:00:30.130> bright

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
the Thai key is shot in very bright

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.190 
the Thai key is shot in very bright
environments<00:00:30.939> and<00:00:31.119> we're<00:00:31.659> actually<00:00:31.810> against

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
environments and we're actually against

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.090 
environments and we're actually against
a<00:00:32.259> white<00:00:32.410> background<00:00:32.590> cuz<00:00:32.829> we're<00:00:32.950> in<00:00:33.040> the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
a white background cuz we're in the

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.770 
a white background cuz we're in the
studio<00:00:33.250> but<00:00:33.940> what<00:00:34.120> you<00:00:34.210> want<00:00:34.390> to<00:00:34.420> do<00:00:34.540> is<00:00:34.660> when

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
studio but what you want to do is when

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.940 
studio but what you want to do is when
you're<00:00:34.900> setting<00:00:35.110> up<00:00:35.170> your<00:00:35.200> lighting<00:00:35.500> ratios

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
you're setting up your lighting ratios

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.310 
you're setting up your lighting ratios
your<00:00:36.700> shadows<00:00:37.090> should<00:00:37.540> be<00:00:37.720> nearly<00:00:38.079> invisible

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
your shadows should be nearly invisible

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.020 
your shadows should be nearly invisible
basically<00:00:39.070> you<00:00:39.370> should<00:00:39.460> have<00:00:39.550> just<00:00:39.730> enough<00:00:39.940> to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
basically you should have just enough to

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.020 
basically you should have just enough to
shape<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.360> face<00:00:40.510> maybe<00:00:41.290> a<00:00:41.620> stop<00:00:42.190> or<00:00:42.400> half<00:00:42.910> a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
shape the face maybe a stop or half a

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.520 
shape the face maybe a stop or half a
stop<00:00:43.210> difference<00:00:43.600> between<00:00:43.810> your<00:00:43.930> shadow<00:00:44.140> and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
stop difference between your shadow and

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.970 
stop difference between your shadow and
your<00:00:44.770> neutral<00:00:45.250> so<00:00:45.850> very<00:00:46.210> very<00:00:46.480> low<00:00:46.980> contrast

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
your neutral so very very low contrast

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.980 
your neutral so very very low contrast
lighting<00:00:48.310> is<00:00:48.820> high<00:00:49.060> key<00:00:49.300> that's<00:00:49.660> often<00:00:49.960> used

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
lighting is high key that's often used

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.930 
lighting is high key that's often used
in<00:00:50.260> things<00:00:50.410> like<00:00:50.500> sitcoms<00:00:51.070> or<00:00:51.340> in<00:00:51.460> situations

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
in things like sitcoms or in situations

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.100 
in things like sitcoms or in situations
of<00:00:51.970> people<00:00:52.180> have<00:00:52.270> to<00:00:52.330> walk<00:00:52.510> around<00:00:52.660> and<00:00:52.990> move

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
of people have to walk around and move

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.690 
of people have to walk around and move
around<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.470> lot<00:00:53.590> because<00:00:54.040> it's<00:00:54.250> it's<00:00:54.460> very

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
around a lot because it's it's very

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.430 
around a lot because it's it's very
forgiving<00:00:55.210> people<00:00:55.480> can<00:00:55.630> all<00:00:56.020> the<00:00:56.230> different

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
forgiving people can all the different

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.630 
forgiving people can all the different
camera<00:00:56.710> angles<00:00:56.980> look<00:00:57.100> good<00:00:57.220> no<00:00:57.340> matter<00:00:57.460> where

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
camera angles look good no matter where

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.160 
camera angles look good no matter where
they<00:00:57.760> turn<00:00:57.910> their<00:00:58.060> face<00:00:58.270> and<00:00:58.570> then<00:00:59.020> if<00:00:59.110> they

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
they turn their face and then if they

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.150 
they turn their face and then if they
have<00:00:59.200> to<00:00:59.320> move<00:00:59.440> a<00:00:59.500> little<00:00:59.650> bit<00:00:59.770> in<00:00:59.860> the<00:00:59.950> scene

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
have to move a little bit in the scene

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.860 
have to move a little bit in the scene
it'll<00:01:00.490> it'll<00:01:00.760> cover<00:01:01.000> them<00:01:01.180> but<00:01:01.510> low-key

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
it'll it'll cover them but low-key

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.200 
it'll it'll cover them but low-key
lighting<00:01:02.140> is<00:01:02.410> light<00:01:02.680> with<00:01:03.100> very<00:01:03.820> high

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
lighting is light with very high

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.810 
lighting is light with very high
contrast<00:01:05.040> generally<00:01:06.040> speaking<00:01:06.369> if<00:01:06.520> people

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
contrast generally speaking if people

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.700 
contrast generally speaking if people
use<00:01:06.970> it<00:01:07.119> a<00:01:07.180> lot<00:01:07.270> in<00:01:07.450> dark<00:01:07.659> scenes<00:01:07.960> so<00:01:08.170> you<00:01:08.470> see

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
use it a lot in dark scenes so you see

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.920 
use it a lot in dark scenes so you see
that<00:01:08.890> but<00:01:09.549> essentially<00:01:10.090> from<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.600> the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
that but essentially from the the

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.200 
that but essentially from the the
neutral<00:01:11.680> on<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.070> subjects<00:01:12.460> face<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.940> proper

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
neutral on the subjects face the proper

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.690 
neutral on the subjects face the proper
exposure<00:01:13.480> to<00:01:14.290> let's<00:01:14.560> say<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:14.740> shadow<00:01:14.950> can

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
exposure to let's say the shadow can

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.000 
exposure to let's say the shadow can
Gugu<00:01:16.180> completely<00:01:16.690> black<00:01:16.870> or<00:01:17.110> completely

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
Gugu completely black or completely

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.200 
Gugu completely black or completely
white<00:01:18.220> if<00:01:18.430> you<00:01:18.550> went<00:01:18.730> the<00:01:18.790> other<00:01:18.820> way

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
white if you went the other way

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.270 
white if you went the other way
so<00:01:19.420> basically<00:01:19.750> incredibly<00:01:20.650> high<00:01:20.770> contrast

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
so basically incredibly high contrast

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.860 
so basically incredibly high contrast
here<00:01:21.760> we<00:01:21.850> have<00:01:21.940> shereena<00:01:22.270> on<00:01:22.330> set<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:22.659> she<00:01:22.780> has

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
here we have shereena on set and she has

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.540 
here we have shereena on set and she has
very<00:01:22.990> high<00:01:23.200> key<00:01:23.380> lighting<00:01:23.409> on<00:01:23.800> her<00:01:23.830> it's<00:01:24.430> very

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
very high key lighting on her it's very

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.460 
very high key lighting on her it's very
very<00:01:24.940> even<00:01:25.300> this<00:01:25.780> would<00:01:25.930> be<00:01:26.020> great

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
very even this would be great

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.620 
very even this would be great
again<00:01:26.710> if<00:01:26.800> she<00:01:26.920> was<00:01:27.070> like<00:01:27.250> on<00:01:27.729> TV<00:01:28.120> presenting

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
again if she was like on TV presenting

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.540 
again if she was like on TV presenting
something<00:01:28.870> if<00:01:29.140> it<00:01:29.260> was<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.409> sitcom<00:01:29.680> it's<00:01:30.040> comedy

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
something if it was a sitcom it's comedy

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.250 
something if it was a sitcom it's comedy
it's<00:01:30.670> light-hearted<00:01:31.060> it's<00:01:31.270> easy<00:01:31.540> this<00:01:32.080> is

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
it's light-hearted it's easy this is

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.450 
it's light-hearted it's easy this is
this<00:01:32.409> is<00:01:32.560> good<00:01:32.710> lighting<00:01:32.860> for<00:01:33.070> this<00:01:33.220> if<00:01:33.340> we

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
this is good lighting for this if we

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.040 
this is good lighting for this if we
want<00:01:33.670> to<00:01:33.790> convert<00:01:34.240> this<00:01:34.360> into<00:01:34.420> low-key

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
want to convert this into low-key

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.990 
want to convert this into low-key
lighting<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:36.340> can<00:01:36.460> just<00:01:36.580> turn<00:01:36.700> off<00:01:36.820> some<00:01:36.970> of

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
lighting we can just turn off some of

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.160 
lighting we can just turn off some of
the<00:01:37.120> lights<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:37.510> let's<00:01:37.659> go<00:01:37.810> ahead<00:01:37.870> and<00:01:37.960> do<00:01:38.080> that

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
the lights so let's go ahead and do that

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.219 
the lights so let's go ahead and do that
if<00:01:38.560> I<00:01:38.650> turn<00:01:38.830> off<00:01:38.860> this<00:01:39.100> her<00:01:39.400> key<00:01:39.940> here<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.540> also

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
if I turn off this her key here and also

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.460 
if I turn off this her key here and also
her<00:01:41.380> hair<00:01:41.560> light<00:01:41.799> and<00:01:42.010> our<00:01:42.820> background<00:01:43.000> light

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
her hair light and our background light

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.620 
her hair light and our background light
that's<00:01:44.470> gonna<00:01:44.650> get<00:01:44.830> us<00:01:45.210> that's<00:01:46.210> gonna<00:01:46.360> get<00:01:46.540> us

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
that's gonna get us that's gonna get us

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.120 
that's gonna get us that's gonna get us
most<00:01:46.810> of<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.049> way<00:01:47.140> there<00:01:47.170> what<00:01:47.770> we<00:01:47.890> need<00:01:48.010> to<00:01:48.070> do

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
most of the way there what we need to do

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.260 
most of the way there what we need to do
is<00:01:48.190> move<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.460> light<00:01:48.610> a<00:01:48.640> little<00:01:48.700> closer<00:01:48.940> to<00:01:49.180> her

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
is move the light a little closer to her

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.430 
is move the light a little closer to her
we're<00:01:49.540> in<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.659> white<00:01:49.870> space<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.290> lights

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
we're in a white space the lights

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.570 
we're in a white space the lights
bouncing<00:01:50.830> all<00:01:50.920> around<00:01:50.950> so<00:01:51.250> it's<00:01:51.369> actually

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
bouncing all around so it's actually

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.890 
bouncing all around so it's actually
acting<00:01:51.850> as<00:01:51.940> its<00:01:52.090> own<00:01:52.180> fill<00:01:52.479> so<00:01:52.659> by<00:01:52.780> bringing

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
acting as its own fill so by bringing

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.510 
acting as its own fill so by bringing
the<00:01:53.080> light<00:01:53.229> closer<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.710> her<00:01:53.830> we'll<00:01:54.250> be<00:01:54.280> able<00:01:54.400> to

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
the light closer to her we'll be able to

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.640 
the light closer to her we'll be able to
increase<00:01:54.700> our<00:01:55.000> contrast<00:01:55.540> so<00:01:56.290> David's<00:01:56.530> gonna

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
increase our contrast so David's gonna

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.090 
increase our contrast so David's gonna
bring<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:56.979> softbox<00:01:57.310> in<00:01:57.490> real<00:01:57.640> close<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:59.100> in

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
bring the softbox in real close and in

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.190 
bring the softbox in real close and in
this<00:02:00.880> type<00:02:01.000> of<00:02:01.060> situation<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.810> could<00:02:01.930> do<00:02:02.080> this

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
this type of situation you could do this

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.350 
this type of situation you could do this
kind<00:02:02.260> of<00:02:02.470> half<00:02:02.650> lit<00:02:03.220> face<00:02:03.640> thing<00:02:03.850> or<00:02:04.000> she<00:02:04.210> could

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
kind of half lit face thing or she could

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
kind of half lit face thing or she could
face<00:02:04.510> into<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.780> light<00:02:04.930> would<00:02:05.049> be<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.200> more

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
face into the light would be the more

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.810 
face into the light would be the more
common<00:02:05.409> way<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.830> do<00:02:06.010> it<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.220> that<00:02:06.610> way<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:06.760> can

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
common way to do it and that way you can

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
common way to do it and that way you can
get<00:02:06.939> a<00:02:06.970> nice<00:02:07.060> beautiful<00:02:07.299> light<00:02:07.540> over<00:02:07.570> her

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
get a nice beautiful light over her

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.539 
get a nice beautiful light over her
whole<00:02:08.019> face<00:02:08.170> so<00:02:08.439> face<00:02:08.799> into<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.129> light<00:02:09.280> I

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
whole face so face into the light I

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.339 
whole face so face into the light I
could<00:02:10.060> add<00:02:10.269> if<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.629> want<00:02:10.840> separation<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
could add if I want separation of the

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.479 
could add if I want separation of the
background<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.739> could<00:02:11.799> kick<00:02:12.099> blocks<00:02:12.310> at<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
background I could kick blocks at the

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.890 
background I could kick blocks at the
hair<00:02:12.610> light<00:02:12.790> back<00:02:12.970> on<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.450> would<00:02:13.599> still<00:02:13.840> be

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
hair light back on and it would still be

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.900 
hair light back on and it would still be
low-key<00:02:14.620> because<00:02:14.980> it's<00:02:15.129> still<00:02:15.340> very<00:02:15.760> high

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
low-key because it's still very high

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.660 
low-key because it's still very high
contrast<00:02:16.300> so<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.590> see<00:02:17.770> very<00:02:18.010> high<00:02:18.310> contrast

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
contrast so you see very high contrast

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.490 
contrast so you see very high contrast
between<00:02:18.910> my<00:02:19.120> normal<00:02:19.540> exposure<00:02:19.900> and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
between my normal exposure and

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.930 
between my normal exposure and
darhk's<00:02:20.920> or<00:02:21.100> my<00:02:21.280> normal<00:02:21.520> twitter<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:21.880> the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
lights that makes it low-key Heike is

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.190 
lights that makes it low-key Heike is
very<00:02:24.310> low<00:02:24.490> contrast<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.840> thanks<00:02:26.050> for<00:02:26.140> watching
