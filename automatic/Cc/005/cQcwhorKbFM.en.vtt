00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.220
 hello how in this video I'm going to show you how to be a fantastic woman 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.599
 with the tug of war 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.709
 is the design of the flower 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.729
 and the scarf basically those that are pure strips 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.550
 made with chain 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.929
 that in this case in this type of wine are two hundred chains 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.679
 for each strip because then you fold your hand and I'll show you how to do it 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.690
 we are going to use this language 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.240
 what is a thickness 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.060
 medium 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.840
 this is narrower than this thickness so this is real what is the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.950
 difference 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.080
 and how they have the flower using nuanced style and this they say are completely 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.090
 different 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.090
 in this case we are going to take out the tip 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 here we find latent 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.670
 well let's start 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.830
 weaving eight chains 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.650
 since we wove the eight chains in the first we want more weapons 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.719
 close 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:15.230
 there we are going to take 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.640
 for toilets 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.890
 a circle like this we start with two chains 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.490
 because we're going to start weaving half a point 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.440
 here we are going to increase each time it is half a point later 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.380
 a penalty 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.280
 after 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.549
 a normal high point 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.590
 after 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.980
 three points 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.980
 double highs 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.910
 what would they be 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.010
 not at all 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.869
 everyone 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.870
 and all other double high point 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.229
 not at all 2 milestones if they are fixed now let's 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.229
 down which is a normal high point 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.680
 a point at night 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.420
 and half a field 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.420
 mixtequilla we finish the first petals we go through 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.440
 we go for the second we continue with the point at night we will not repeat the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.779
 half points 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.709
 a penalty 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.799
 a high point 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.079
 and half a point and nothing else we are missing one apparently kiwis the karez but 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.999
 now let's not run 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.509
 and it's not about that 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.799
 hostility of the flowers is that they want a little raised 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.229
 that the petals are waving 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:38.659
 we go for the point by hand 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.659
 a high point 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.369
 a double high point 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:47.369
 muse tg3 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.569
 two 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.959
 3 the normal high point 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.319
 the point is nothing new 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.349
 and seen in half point we have here here 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.050
 we have the chains that are the ones that helped us raise the half point 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.839
 to insert 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:13.779
 in the first chain 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.049
 and we get the point of view 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.580
 as you know 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.769
 Here we have a little flower 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.899
 really good so let's do 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:26.399
 in third dimension to do that we give notice 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.549
 let's weave three chains 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.399
 so we can slide to the back 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.639
 I spoke goya and just 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:35.960
 on the point 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.620
 in the middle of the fabric that would be in the second high point 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:41.800
 what we did 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.800
 for about that montage 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:47.810
 the first point there I will leave 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.629
 tied to the three chains 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.249
 now and let's ride nato 3 4 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.229
 five chains and we're going 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.479
 to the next point that was 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.479
 and that we had a part of it on average 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.489
 there we are going to make a point of chrysanthemum that is to learn it 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:13.649
 let's try 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:14.680
 who loves us 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.680
 very solid 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:20.530
 Mixteca its serious 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.249
 this 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:25.249
 and it would be the two chains 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.460
 we go 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.800
 this is how it is going 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.240
 again let's learn jtg five other chains 3 4 5 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:42.560
 and we are going to turn on the 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.930
 in the next petar remember it month by the back 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.860
 and it has to be 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.610
 in the third if for some reason they are wrong 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.819
 and do not turn it on the third one does not matter 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.509
 if they did not take two chains and take more 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.050
 no matter 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.729
 two centuries rather I meant 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.729
 since he added five let's insert it now car 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.300
 Really 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.020
 Car 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.750
 is very kind and for some reason we are wrong in 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.460
 simple details nothing happens 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.460
 2. 3. 4. 5 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:30.430
 and I honestly lectivo rarely that it is cheap some project that I do 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.289
 if for some reason I'm doing 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.889
 in the bag for example a bag of madrid paagman batasuna is thus weaving 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:38.710
 the bag 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.820
 and tall 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.520
 take like half I did not like 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.520
 2 3 4 5 know what it says 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:49.099
 Sad the web is cheap but it will not be a saint 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.650
 and I turned it into an omelet maker, I stay fabulous 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.250
 well I took advantage of it I am very recycled and take advantage of it if you 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.129
 they fix now now here we have 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:03.439
 in the front part there are the petals true 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:08.589
 in the back we were afraid of the 5 waves that we made with five chains each 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:09.369
 a 

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.379
 good inside those probes 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:12.900
 let's put that 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.640
 the petals but now they are going to be bigger we will start with 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:20.830
 a point of view or to get into the wave 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.599
 matos 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.779
 that are the chains that join us as the half point truth 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.569
 make us heights half a point 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:30.800
 we go with 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.800
 next to hand 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.550
 a high point 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.139
 a high double point a good high point 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.150
 111 

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:52.559
 do you think now they are going to be 4 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:58.710
 we continue with a high point 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.710
 normal 

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:05.339
 then it is the hand point 

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:09.709
 And here we are going to be a half point because each petal is closing 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:15.550
 what we are going to do is the famous one to move the next one 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:20.070
 with happiness that we had bullfighting cultures and we are going to start over 

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:22.879
 half point 

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:25.879
 point in a note 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.800
 high point 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.800
 10 4 double points 

00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:36.619
 together double jumps 

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:39.619
 two 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:43.509
 you think 

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:46.909
 4 we already have 

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:50.849
 the four that now we're going down to knit a normal high point 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.289
 both on a note 

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:56.309
 and in half point 

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:59.309
 from to show how they are going 

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:05.059
 how is the next petals the idea and is that he wants 

00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:06.870
 in the middle d 

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.369
 that we already had 

00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:09.859
 so let's finish the round
