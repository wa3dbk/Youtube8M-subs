00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:05.729 
in this lecture snippet I want to use a

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:08.090 
in this lecture snippet I want to use a
command<00:00:06.269> line<00:00:06.569> tool<00:00:06.870> rather<00:00:07.259> than<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.529> GUI<00:00:07.799> tool

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.100 
command line tool rather than a GUI tool

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.400 
command line tool rather than a GUI tool
to<00:00:08.280> be<00:00:08.370> able<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.610> view<00:00:08.969> the<00:00:09.030> hard<00:00:09.420> drives<00:00:09.719> just

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
to be able to view the hard drives just

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.930 
to be able to view the hard drives just
as<00:00:10.530> another<00:00:10.740> option<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.429> be<00:00:11.519> able<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.700> view

discs themselves or the devices you will
need<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.949> run<00:00:35.159> sudo<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.879> I'm<00:00:35.970> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.120> type<00:00:36.269> in

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
need to run sudo so I'm going to type in

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.479 
need to run sudo so I'm going to type in
sudo<00:00:36.659> to<00:00:37.140> run<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.409> as<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.710> administrator<00:00:38.250> and

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
sudo to run it as the administrator and

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.070 
sudo to run it as the administrator and
then<00:00:39.000> I'm<00:00:39.089> going<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.299> need<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.629> go<00:00:39.780> ahead<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
then I'm going to need to go ahead and

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.280 
then I'm going to need to go ahead and
use<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.440> command<00:00:40.680> f<00:00:41.030> disk<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.449> then<00:00:43.049> we<00:00:43.170> can

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
use the command f disk and then we can

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.310 
use the command f disk and then we can
use<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.500> option<00:00:43.949> dash<00:00:44.339> l<00:00:44.729> for<00:00:45.269> listing<00:00:45.750> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
use the option dash l for listing and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.899 
use the option dash l for listing and
i'll<00:00:46.440> go<00:00:46.559> ahead<00:00:46.589> and<00:00:46.769> hit<00:00:46.920> enter<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.460> i<00:00:47.699> will

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
i'll go ahead and hit enter and i will

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:49.399 
i'll go ahead and hit enter and i will
need<00:00:48.089> to<00:00:48.210> put<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.510> my<00:00:48.690> administrative

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
need to put in my administrative

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.369 
need to put in my administrative
password<00:00:49.619> and<00:00:50.780> i'll<00:00:51.780> go<00:00:51.930> ahead<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.140> maximize

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
password and i'll go ahead and maximize

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.410 
password and i'll go ahead and maximize
this<00:00:53.040> so<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.909> what's<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.299> on<00:00:54.360> here

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
this so we can see what's going on here

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.500 
this so we can see what's going on here
this<00:00:55.350> lists<00:00:55.890> out<00:00:56.010> all<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.790> hard<00:00:56.820> drives<00:00:57.330> or

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
this lists out all the hard drives or

discs associated with my particular
operating<00:00:59.940> system<00:01:00.390> i'm<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:01.049> to<00:01:01.140> highlight

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
operating system i'm going to highlight

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.390 
operating system i'm going to highlight
all<00:01:01.799> of<00:01:01.890> disc<00:01:02.400> a<00:01:03.229> there<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.350> go<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.220> see

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
all of disc a there we go you can see

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.230 
all of disc a there we go you can see
that<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.090> device<00:01:06.720> SDA<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.670> 260

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that this is device SDA it is 260

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.840 
that this is device SDA it is 260
basically<00:01:10.050> 60<00:01:10.410> gigabyte<00:01:10.800> hard<00:01:11.010> drive<00:01:11.160> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
basically 60 gigabyte hard drive and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.040 
basically 60 gigabyte hard drive and
they<00:01:11.940> break<00:01:12.180> down<00:01:12.240> all<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.690> sector

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
they break down all the sector

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.780 
they break down all the sector
information<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.980> heads<00:01:14.190> that<00:01:14.370> are<00:01:14.430> part<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
information the heads that are part of

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.060 
information the heads that are part of
the<00:01:14.940> actual<00:01:15.510> disk<00:01:15.750> themselves<00:01:16.410> how<00:01:16.920> many

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the actual disk themselves how many

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.460 
the actual disk themselves how many
bytes<00:01:17.340> each<00:01:17.730> sector<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.750> which<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.110> typically

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
bytes each sector is which is typically

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.890 
bytes each sector is which is typically
512<00:01:20.160> bytes<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.550> we<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:20.760> see<00:01:20.910> that<00:01:21.060> there<00:01:21.330> we

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
512 bytes and we can see that there we

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.810 
512 bytes and we can see that there we
can<00:01:22.020> see<00:01:22.170> some<00:01:22.380> disc<00:01:22.800> identifiers<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.640> well

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
can see some disc identifiers as well

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.460 
can see some disc identifiers as well
but<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.300> also<00:01:24.450> see<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.840> something

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
but we can also see that something

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.410 
but we can also see that something
doesn't<00:01:25.650> look<00:01:25.800> right<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.370> fdisk<00:01:26.760> that's

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
doesn't look right with fdisk that's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
doesn't look right with fdisk that's
because<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.050> formatted<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.800> volume

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
because this is formatted as a volume

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.610 
because this is formatted as a volume
rather<00:01:29.520> than<00:01:29.730> partitions<00:01:30.390> however<00:01:30.870> you<00:01:31.470> can

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
rather than partitions however you can

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.110 
rather than partitions however you can
see<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.800> it<00:01:32.070> tried<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.370> make<00:01:32.610> sense<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
see that it tried to make sense of it

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.760 
see that it tried to make sense of it
here<00:01:33.420> I'm<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.990> scroll<00:01:34.200> down<00:01:34.260> and<00:01:34.710> look

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
here I'm going to scroll down and look

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.860 
here I'm going to scroll down and look
at<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.310> next<00:01:35.820> disc<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.540> I<00:01:39.540> can

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
at the next disc there it is and I can

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.050 
at the next disc there it is and I can
easily<00:01:40.140> identify<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.190> is<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> disc

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
easily identify that this is the disc

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.720 
easily identify that this is the disc
that<00:01:42.630> has<00:01:42.840> my<00:01:43.170> linux<00:01:43.710> operating<00:01:43.860> system<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.580> it

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
that has my linux operating system on it

shoot it with my operating system this

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.539 
shoot it with my operating system this
one<00:02:18.269> is<00:02:18.390> another<00:02:18.599> 60<00:02:19.110> gig<00:02:19.349> hard<00:02:19.620> drive<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.340> I

one is another 60 gig hard drive and I

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.100 
one is another 60 gig hard drive and I
can<00:02:20.730> see<00:02:20.849> some<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.150> information<00:02:21.330> about<00:02:21.870> it

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
can see some of the information about it

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.270 
can see some of the information about it
on<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.650> one<00:02:22.709> here<00:02:23.099> it<00:02:23.220> says<00:02:23.720> SDC<00:02:24.720> one<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.190> it

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
on this one here it says SDC one so it

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.460 
on this one here it says SDC one so it
has<00:02:26.340> one<00:02:26.790> partition<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:28.080> can<00:02:28.230> see<00:02:28.349> that

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
has one partition and I can see that

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.039 
has one partition and I can see that
this<00:02:28.590> partition<00:02:29.069> is<00:02:29.190> formatted<00:02:29.670> ntfs<00:02:29.909> so<00:02:30.870> this

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
this partition is formatted ntfs so this

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.750 
this partition is formatted ntfs so this
is<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> hard<00:02:31.620> drive<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.099> has<00:02:32.159> been<00:02:32.370> taken<00:02:32.670> from

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
is a hard drive that has been taken from

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.970 
is a hard drive that has been taken from
my<00:02:32.910> windows<00:02:33.239> computer<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.319> this<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.500> using

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
my windows computer so this is using

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.280 
my windows computer so this is using
fdisk<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.970> run<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.269> command<00:02:36.629> line<00:02:36.690> option<00:02:37.200> to
