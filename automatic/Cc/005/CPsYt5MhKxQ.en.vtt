00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.389 

a<00:00:00.089> neat<00:00:01.020> trick<00:00:01.350> that<00:00:01.380> I<00:00:01.620> was<00:00:01.949> always

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
a neat trick that I was always

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.059 
a neat trick that I was always
interested<00:00:02.879> in<00:00:03.419> when<00:00:03.810> I<00:00:03.840> first<00:00:03.959> started<00:00:04.620> rom

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
interested in when I first started rom

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.530 
interested in when I first started rom
hacking<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.670> scripting<00:00:06.210> was<00:00:06.870> whether<00:00:08.540> making

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
hacking and scripting was whether making

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.220 
hacking and scripting was whether making
it<00:00:09.900> rain<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.800> particular<00:00:11.190> route<00:00:11.670> or<00:00:12.090> do<00:00:13.019> any

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
it rain on a particular route or do any

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.860 
it rain on a particular route or do any
kind<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.650> weather<00:00:13.950> really<00:00:14.940> brightens<00:00:15.570> up<00:00:15.750> a

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
kind of weather really brightens up a

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.080 
kind of weather really brightens up a
game<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.320> makes<00:00:16.500> things<00:00:16.740> really<00:00:17.550> interesting

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
game and makes things really interesting

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.849 
game and makes things really interesting
to<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> player<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.900> when<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> first<00:00:19.529> starting

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
to the player and when I first starting

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.070 
to the player and when I first starting
when<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> first<00:00:20.850> started<00:00:21.600> getting<00:00:21.869> into

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
when I first started getting into

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.189 
when I first started getting into
hacking<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:23.210> really<00:00:24.210> went<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.660> little<00:00:24.779> overboard

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
hacking I really went a little overboard

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.650 
hacking I really went a little overboard
on<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.740> weather<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.310> made<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.939> rain<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.420> almost

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
on the weather I made it rain on almost

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.720 
on the weather I made it rain on almost
every<00:00:27.960> single<00:00:28.080> route<00:00:28.410> that's<00:00:29.369> because<00:00:29.640> I

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
every single route that's because I

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.179 
every single route that's because I
enjoyed<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.359> much<00:00:30.529> we<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.710> do<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.009> just

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
enjoyed it so much we can do this just

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.860 
enjoyed it so much we can do this just
by<00:00:32.369> going<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.790> head<00:00:33.000> or<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.180> advance<00:00:33.600> map

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
by going to the head or in advance map

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.010 
by going to the head or in advance map
and<00:00:34.170> where<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.160> says<00:00:35.309> weather<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:36.450> could<00:00:36.719> put

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
and where it says weather we could put

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.060 
and where it says weather we could put
rainy<00:00:37.559> weather<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.129> if<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.149> save<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.950> open<00:00:40.950> it

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
rainy weather and if we save it open it

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.930 
rainy weather and if we save it open it
up<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.309> our<00:00:41.399> emulator<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:43.610> then<00:00:44.610> go<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
up in our emulator and then go to the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.670 
up in our emulator and then go to the
route<00:00:45.120> as<00:00:45.829> you<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:46.980> see<00:00:47.129> it'll<00:00:47.399> be<00:00:47.550> raining

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
route as you can see it'll be raining

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.130 
route as you can see it'll be raining
now<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.980> useful<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.899> making<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> game

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
now this is useful for making the game

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.299 
now this is useful for making the game
interesting<00:00:52.820> but<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.149> course<00:00:54.539> if<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.620> always

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
interesting but of course if we always

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.119 
interesting but of course if we always
have<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.789> route<00:00:56.969> raining<00:00:57.649> it<00:00:58.649> sometimes

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
have the route raining it sometimes

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.570 
have the route raining it sometimes
looks<00:00:59.489> unprofessional<00:00:59.940> or<00:01:01.100> bad<00:01:02.100> will<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:04.580> so

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
looks unprofessional or bad will you so

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.789 
looks unprofessional or bad will you so
you<00:01:06.390> might<00:01:06.540> think<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.290> trigger<00:01:07.530> this

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you might think can we trigger this

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.950 
you might think can we trigger this
through<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> script<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.450> will<00:01:09.840> only

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
through a script so that it will only

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.609 
through a script so that it will only
happen<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.560> certain<00:01:10.979> times<00:01:11.460> things<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.360> that

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
happen at certain times things like that

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.380 
happen at certain times things like that
we<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.220> fact<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.880> took<00:01:14.970> me<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> while<00:01:15.330> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
we can in fact and it took me a while to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.570 
we can in fact and it took me a while to
learn<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.229> after<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.799> finally<00:01:17.070> did<00:01:17.310> I

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
learn this but after I finally did I

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.520 
learn this but after I finally did I
used<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:18.540> much<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.080> could

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
used it as much as I could

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.620 
used it as much as I could
first<00:01:20.430> I'm<00:01:20.700> going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.850> create<00:01:20.970> three<00:01:21.600> new

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
first I'm going to create three new

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.819 
first I'm going to create three new
scripts<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:23.119> I'll<00:01:24.119> put<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.600> here<00:01:25.520> here<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
scripts and I'll put one here here and

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:37.410 
scripts and I'll put one here here and
here<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:29.060> my<00:01:30.060> VAR<00:01:30.570> I'll<00:01:30.930> make<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:32.150> sixty<00:01:33.150> ten

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.730 

and<00:01:37.720> I'll<00:01:38.080> leave<00:01:38.260> everything<00:01:38.440> else<00:01:38.860> blank<00:01:43.740> now

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
and I'll leave everything else blank now

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.710 
and I'll leave everything else blank now
let's<00:01:44.980> open<00:01:45.100> up<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.430> script<00:01:45.760> it's<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.390> very

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
let's open up the script it's a very

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.210 
let's open up the script it's a very
very<00:01:47.050> simple<00:01:47.350> script<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.740> write<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.700> I'll<00:01:48.760> put

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
very simple script to write so I'll put

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.260 
very simple script to write so I'll put
weather<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:53.260> first<00:01:53.440> thing<00:01:53.830> would<00:01:54.100> be<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.550> set

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
weather the first thing would be to set

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.830 
weather the first thing would be to set
weather<00:01:56.970> now<00:01:59.640> there<00:02:00.640> are<00:02:00.970> several<00:02:01.690> different

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
weather now there are several different

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.710 
weather now there are several different
weather<00:02:02.710> values<00:02:03.250> as<00:02:03.850> we<00:02:04.090> can<00:02:04.210> see<00:02:04.360> an<00:02:04.420> advance

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
weather values as we can see an advance

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.560 
weather values as we can see an advance
map<00:02:04.900> we<00:02:05.020> have<00:02:05.140> rainy<00:02:05.440> snowflake

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
map we have rainy snowflake

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.050 
map we have rainy snowflake
thunderstorms<00:02:07.570> steady<00:02:07.930> snowing<00:02:08.619> snow<00:02:09.190> cloudy

thunderstorms steady snowing snow cloudy
all<00:02:10.690> kinds<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.170> things<00:02:11.380> just<00:02:11.470> like<00:02:11.740> that<00:02:12.930> now

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
all kinds of things just like that now

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.440 
all kinds of things just like that now
how<00:02:14.260> do<00:02:14.320> we<00:02:14.410> know<00:02:14.590> which<00:02:14.830> one<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.160> which<00:02:15.450> there

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
how do we know which one is which there

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.290 
how do we know which one is which there
is<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.660> text<00:02:17.350> document<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:18.610> tells<00:02:18.880> us<00:02:19.030> right

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
is a text document that tells us right

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.460 
is a text document that tells us right
here<00:02:20.400> none<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.760> zero<00:02:22.239> reflected<00:02:22.959> clouds<00:02:23.230> is

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
here none is zero reflected clouds is

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.660 
here none is zero reflected clouds is
one<00:02:23.709> normal<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.550> two<00:02:25.020> rain<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.320> three<00:02:26.680> normal

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
one normal is two rain is three normal

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.880 
one normal is two rain is three normal
and<00:02:27.940> none<00:02:28.330> are<00:02:28.690> basically<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.470> exact<00:02:29.860> same

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
and none are basically the exact same

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.180 
and none are basically the exact same
thing<00:02:30.510> as<00:02:31.510> far<00:02:31.870> as<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:32.050> can<00:02:32.110> remember<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.770> might

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
reason I use devar right here is just

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.560 
reason I use devar right here is just
because<00:05:40.040> if<00:05:40.460> you<00:05:40.580> leave<00:05:40.760> it<00:05:40.850> at<00:05:40.940> zero<00:05:41.150> zero<00:05:41.480> the

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
because if you leave it at zero zero the

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.050 
because if you leave it at zero zero the
game<00:05:41.870> will<00:05:42.080> freeze<00:05:42.380> I<00:05:42.650> didn't<00:05:43.400> use<00:05:43.550> any<00:05:43.700> VARs

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
game will freeze I didn't use any VARs

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.850 
game will freeze I didn't use any VARs
in<00:05:44.300> my<00:05:44.390> script<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:45.140> that's<00:05:45.320> because<00:05:45.560> I<00:05:45.680> just

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
in my script and that's because I just

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.230 
in my script and that's because I just
wanted<00:05:46.070> it<00:05:46.190> to<00:05:46.250> happen<00:05:46.430> every<00:05:46.820> single<00:05:47.000> time

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
wanted it to happen every single time

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.940 
wanted it to happen every single time
when<00:05:47.390> I<00:05:47.419> step<00:05:47.630> there<00:05:47.840> if<00:05:48.050> you<00:05:48.410> only<00:05:48.560> want<00:05:48.800> it<00:05:48.830> to

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
when I step there if you only want it to

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.640 
when I step there if you only want it to
happen<00:05:49.040> once<00:05:49.400> set<00:05:50.180> your<00:05:50.360> VAR<00:05:50.600> and<00:05:50.870> it<00:05:51.470> won't

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
happen once set your VAR and it won't

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.010 
happen once set your VAR and it won't
happen<00:05:51.800> again
