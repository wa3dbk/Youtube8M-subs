00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
back to that debate at the front I'm

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.430 
back to that debate at the front I'm
sure<00:03:15.300> they<00:03:15.420> can<00:03:15.480> put<00:03:15.690> their<00:03:15.810> differences<00:03:15.989> or

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
sure they can put their differences or

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.690 
sure they can put their differences or
whatever<00:03:16.650> differences<00:03:16.950> there<00:03:17.220> were<00:03:17.340> aside

whatever differences there were aside

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.160 
whatever differences there were aside
for<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.060> little<00:03:18.390> ride<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.750> finish<00:03:18.870> here<00:03:19.140> I

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
for a little ride to the finish here I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.320 
for a little ride to the finish here I
think<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.310> differences<00:03:20.760> were<00:03:20.910> made<00:03:21.150> in

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
think the the differences were made in

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.690 
think the the differences were made in
in<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.780> papers<00:03:22.230> last<00:03:22.470> year<00:03:22.739> where<00:03:23.010> whereas

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
in the papers last year where whereas

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.940 
in the papers last year where whereas
you<00:03:24.269> know<00:03:24.300> between<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.380> two<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.709> them<00:03:25.800> there

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
you know between the two of them there

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.470 
you know between the two of them there
was<00:03:26.070> never<00:03:26.220> really<00:03:26.340> any<00:03:26.610> problems<00:03:27.030> but<00:03:27.209> he<00:03:27.300> was

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
was never really any problems but he was

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
trying to make his way up to two second

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.699 
trying to make his way up to two second

and knee Bali and he

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.080 
and knee Bali and he
on<00:03:34.099> these<00:03:34.489> kind<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:34.879> climbs<00:03:35.120> he<00:03:35.480> is<00:03:35.689> incredible

capabilities<00:04:02.750> pattle<00:04:03.650> no<00:04:03.980> but<00:04:04.099> with<00:04:04.219> a

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250

calibre<00:04:04.609> of<00:04:04.639> GC<00:04:05.030> riders<00:04:05.180> he<00:04:05.480> I'm<00:04:05.599> sure<00:04:05.750> a

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
calibre of GC riders he I'm sure a

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.530 
calibre of GC riders he I'm sure a
podium<00:04:06.139> certainly<00:04:06.950> would<00:04:07.099> be<00:04:07.310> a<00:04:07.639> massively

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
podium certainly would be a massively

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.420 
podium certainly would be a massively
positive<00:04:09.260> result<00:04:09.590> for<00:04:09.769> him<00:04:09.889> of<00:04:10.069> course

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
positive result for him of course

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.099 
positive result for him of course
I<00:04:10.579> think<00:04:11.150> yet<00:04:11.389> he<00:04:11.510> would<00:04:11.599> have<00:04:11.720> been<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.900> stage

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
I think yet he would have been the stage

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:13.390 
I think yet he would have been the stage
that<00:04:12.290> he<00:04:12.379> targeted<00:04:12.799> all<00:04:12.919> week<00:04:13.129> that<00:04:13.310> would

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
that he targeted all week that would

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.830 
that he targeted all week that would
have<00:04:13.519> been<00:04:13.639> his<00:04:13.730> primary<00:04:14.030> objective<00:04:14.720> without

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
have been his primary objective without

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.620 
have been his primary objective without
doubt<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:15.439> think<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.709> surgery<00:04:16.039> looked<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:17.239> the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
doubt I think the surgery looked the the

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.319 
doubt I think the surgery looked the the
fact<00:04:18.109> that<00:04:18.199> Katie<00:04:18.560> was<00:04:18.680> included<00:04:19.130> is<00:04:19.220> it<00:04:19.310> Morse

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
fact that Katie was included is it Morse

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.749 
fact that Katie was included is it Morse
normally<00:04:20.870> is<00:04:21.019> on<00:04:21.259> this<00:04:21.410> race<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:22.280> first<00:04:22.460> name

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 
normally is on this race the first name

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.400 
normally is on this race the first name
that<00:04:22.789> springs<00:04:23.240> to<00:04:23.419> mind<00:04:23.449> he's<00:04:23.870> pretty<00:04:24.110> tough

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
that springs to mind he's pretty tough

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.680 
that springs to mind he's pretty tough
yeah
