you<00:00:16.170> might<00:00:16.410> imagine<00:00:17.690> we<00:00:18.690> like<00:00:18.930> maps<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.560> half

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
you might imagine we like maps the half

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.130 
you might imagine we like maps the half
a<00:00:19.740> lot<00:00:20.039> balls<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.520> them<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.420> map<00:00:21.660> has<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
a lot balls in them so this map has a

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.540 
a lot balls in them so this map has a
ton<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.590> golf<00:00:23.490> balls<00:00:23.760> okay<00:00:24.800> just<00:00:25.800> like<00:00:25.949> your

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
ton of golf balls okay just like your

old western shooter shooting galleries
there's<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> bunch<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.619> objects<00:00:29.010> out<00:00:29.130> there

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
there's a bunch of objects out there

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.679 
there's a bunch of objects out there
that<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.519> can<00:00:29.670> shoot<00:00:29.820> at<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.240> pick<00:00:30.510> up<00:00:30.630> your

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689

laser rifle and blast away this case

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.860 
laser rifle and blast away this case
here's<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.790> here's<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.540> game<00:00:36.690> works

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
here's the here's the way the game works

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.830 
here's the here's the way the game works
there's<00:00:37.200> two<00:00:37.350> rounds<00:00:37.739> each<00:00:38.309> team<00:00:38.700> has<00:00:39.660> an

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
there's two rounds each team has an

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.380 
there's two rounds each team has an
identical<00:00:40.290> structure<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.670> they<00:00:41.850> will<00:00:42.149> shoot

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
identical structure that they will shoot

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.299 
identical structure that they will shoot
the<00:00:42.719> golf<00:00:42.899> balls<00:00:43.140> at<00:00:43.350> or<00:00:43.530> shoot<00:00:43.860> at<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> golf

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the golf balls at or shoot at the golf

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.150 
the golf balls at or shoot at the golf
balls<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:46.070> in<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.309> structure<00:00:47.640> there<00:00:48.180> are

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
balls and in that structure there are

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.119 
balls and in that structure there are
four<00:00:50.160> point<00:00:51.090> system<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.750> guess<00:00:51.809> there's

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
four point system I guess there's

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.740 
four point system I guess there's
basically<00:00:53.210> different<00:00:54.210> ways<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.660> can

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
basically different ways that you can

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.389 
basically different ways that you can
score<00:00:54.930> points<00:00:55.350> cave<00:00:55.559> some<00:00:55.949> balls<00:00:56.129> are<00:00:56.280> worth

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
score points cave some balls are worth

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.549 
score points cave some balls are worth
one<00:00:56.610> point<00:00:56.640> some<00:00:57.210> are<00:00:57.300> worth<00:00:57.420> two<00:00:57.690> some<00:00:58.410> are

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
one point some are worth two some are

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.099 
one point some are worth two some are
three<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.309> finally<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.629> last<00:01:00.750> are<00:01:00.989> worth

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
three and finally the last are worth

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.990 
three and finally the last are worth
four<00:01:01.469> okay<00:01:02.129> we'll<00:01:02.280> start<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> ones<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
four okay we'll start with the ones the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.690 
four okay we'll start with the ones the
ones<00:01:04.070> roll<00:01:05.070> very<00:01:05.339> slowly<00:01:05.700> down<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.689> steep

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
ones roll very slowly down this steep

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.910 
ones roll very slowly down this steep
decline<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:11.280> gets<00:01:11.549> us<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.760> railing<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.920> you

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
decline and it gets us a railing and you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.109 
decline and it gets us a railing and you
and<00:01:14.010> your<00:01:14.100> teammates<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.460> shoot<00:01:14.729> those<00:01:14.939> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
and your teammates can shoot those and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.580 
and your teammates can shoot those and
each<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.390> popped<00:01:15.689> off<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.080> worth<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.560> point

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
each one popped off is worth one point

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.980 
each one popped off is worth one point
okay<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.150> go<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.479> bottom<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
okay then if you go to the bottom of the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.190 
okay then if you go to the bottom of the
bottom<00:01:19.590> rail<00:01:19.799> its<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.450> kind<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
bottom rail its it's a it's a kind of a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.020 
bottom rail its it's a it's a kind of a
zigzag<00:01:22.439> structure<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.130> now<00:01:23.250> we're<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.610> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
zigzag structure but now we're on to to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.840 
zigzag structure but now we're on to to
the<00:01:24.240> two<00:01:24.509> point<00:01:24.720> okay<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> bottom<00:01:25.740> meets<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the two point okay the bottom meets the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.460 
the two point okay the bottom meets the
two<00:01:26.970> point<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.900> ball<00:01:28.049> speed<00:01:28.320> up

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
two point you see that the ball speed up

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.649 
two point you see that the ball speed up
to<00:01:28.590> get<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> little<00:01:28.920> faster<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:30.240> move<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
to get a little faster you move to the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.410 
to get a little faster you move to the
middle<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.799> kind<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> little

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
middle and you kind of have a little

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.480 
middle and you kind of have a little
castle<00:01:33.420> bridge<00:01:33.630> there<00:01:33.960> with<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:35.009> know<00:01:35.100> some

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
castle bridge there with you know some

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.640 
castle bridge there with you know some
protection<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> ball<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.409> little

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
protection for the ball so it's a little

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.050 
protection for the ball so it's a little
more<00:01:37.799> difficult<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.579> balls<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
more difficult and the balls are going a

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.210 
more difficult and the balls are going a
little<00:01:39.210> bit<00:01:39.420> faster<00:01:39.990> than<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.470> two<00:01:40.890> level

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
little bit faster than on the two level

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.889 
little bit faster than on the two level
and<00:01:41.520> then<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> get<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> four<00:01:42.270> level<00:01:42.630> where

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
and then you get the four level where

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.270 
and then you get the four level where
the<00:01:43.020> balls<00:01:43.200> are<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.470> kind<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.040> shooting

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the balls are just kind of shooting

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.340 
the balls are just kind of shooting
across<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.720> little<00:01:45.810> more<00:01:45.960> difficult

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
across and it's a little more difficult

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
across and it's a little more difficult
to<00:01:46.439> hit<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.710> four<00:01:47.100> levels<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.909> game

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
to hit the four levels so this is a game

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.800 
to hit the four levels so this is a game
of<00:01:48.479> teamwork<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.680> your<00:01:49.770> team<00:01:49.979> again<00:01:50.939> like

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
of teamwork you and your team again like

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.630 
of teamwork you and your team again like
most<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.680> minigames<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.220> play<00:01:53.430> it's

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
most of the minigames we play it's

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.209 
most of the minigames we play it's
important<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.540> your<00:01:55.189> you<00:01:56.189> know

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
important that you have your you know

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.010 
important that you have your you know
microphones<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:57.840> coordinate

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
microphones on and you can coordinate

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.480 
microphones on and you can coordinate
with<00:01:58.229> each<00:01:58.409> other<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:58.770> what<00:01:59.340> you're

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
with each other because what you're

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.550 
with each other because what you're
doing<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.060> want<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> pick<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.390> guy<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.439> be

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
doing is you want to pick one guy to be

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.219 
doing is you want to pick one guy to be
your<00:02:01.770> sharpshooter<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.790> sort<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.119> try<00:02:04.020> for

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
your sharpshooter to sort of try for

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.039 
your sharpshooter to sort of try for
that<00:02:04.350> four<00:02:04.590> ball<00:02:04.799> when<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.280> comes<00:02:05.490> okay<00:02:05.969> at<00:02:06.360> one

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
that four ball when it comes okay at one

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.380 
that four ball when it comes okay at one
point<00:02:07.350> during<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.680> game<00:02:07.920> also<00:02:08.190> there<00:02:09.090> will<00:02:09.360> be

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
point during the game also there will be

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.830 
point during the game also there will be
a<00:02:09.720> sniper<00:02:10.319> rifle<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.739> spawns

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
a sniper rifle that spawns

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.560 
a sniper rifle that spawns
I've<00:02:12.080> seen<00:02:12.380> some<00:02:12.590> teams<00:02:13.000> use<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.030> sniper<00:02:14.390> rifle

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
I've seen some teams use a sniper rifle

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.620 
I've seen some teams use a sniper rifle
to<00:02:14.780> try<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:14.990> get<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.230> four<00:02:15.470> ball<00:02:15.650> but<00:02:16.630> darkling

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
to try to get the four ball but darkling

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.180 
to try to get the four ball but darkling
I've<00:02:17.720> decided<00:02:18.050> that<00:02:18.230> if<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.740> actually<00:02:18.890> get

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
I've decided that if you actually get

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.400 
I've decided that if you actually get
more<00:02:19.310> points<00:02:19.550> if<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:19.880> just<00:02:20.060> use<00:02:20.240> that<00:02:20.510> sniper

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
more points if you just use that sniper

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.490 
more points if you just use that sniper
rifle<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.940> hit<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.390> one<00:02:23.570> balls<00:02:23.780> as<00:02:24.020> they<00:02:24.230> come

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
rifle to hit the one balls as they come

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.400 
rifle to hit the one balls as they come
from<00:02:24.710> the<00:02:24.860> very<00:02:25.130> very<00:02:25.190> top<00:02:25.580> or<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.900> guess<00:02:27.140> pick<00:02:27.320> a

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
from the very very top or I guess pick a

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.790 
from the very very top or I guess pick a
spot<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:27.830> doesn't<00:02:27.860> really<00:02:28.130> matter<00:02:28.340> where

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
spot it doesn't really matter where

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.930 
spot it doesn't really matter where
because<00:02:30.800> if<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.430> kill

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
because if you kill

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.820 
because if you kill
now<00:02:32.180> obviously<00:02:32.300> you<00:02:32.690> know<00:02:32.810> if<00:02:32.990> you<00:02:33.080> can<00:02:33.290> knock

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
now obviously you know if you can knock

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.740 
now obviously you know if you can knock
off<00:02:34.040> repeatedly<00:02:34.430> one<00:02:35.090> ball<00:02:35.270> after<00:02:35.450> one<00:02:35.600> ball

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
off repeatedly one ball after one ball

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.660 
off repeatedly one ball after one ball
after<00:02:35.840> one<00:02:36.110> ball<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.770> one<00:02:36.890> balls<00:02:37.100> come<00:02:37.370> more

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
after one ball the one balls come more

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.930 
after one ball the one balls come more
in<00:02:37.880> greater<00:02:38.810> numbers<00:02:39.230> than<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.560> four<00:02:39.980> ball<00:02:40.190> so

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
in greater numbers than the four ball so

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.850 
in greater numbers than the four ball so
our<00:02:41.450> theory<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.140> can<00:02:42.320> actually<00:02:42.440> get<00:02:42.709> more

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
our theory is you can actually get more

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.280 
our theory is you can actually get more
points<00:02:43.270> focusing<00:02:44.270> on<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.660> one<00:02:44.870> ball<00:02:45.080> with

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
points focusing on the one ball with

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.199 
points focusing on the one ball with
that<00:02:45.440> sniper<00:02:45.830> rifle<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.430> do<00:02:46.640> want<00:02:46.880> somebody

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
that sniper rifle you do want somebody

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.390 
that sniper rifle you do want somebody
on<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.480> four<00:02:47.660> ball<00:02:47.840> because<00:02:48.110> obviously<00:02:48.650> just

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
on the four ball because obviously just

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.910 
on the four ball because obviously just
like<00:02:49.520> in<00:02:49.640> basketball<00:02:49.790> your<00:02:50.239> three-point<00:02:50.600> shot

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
like in basketball your three-point shot

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.260 
like in basketball your three-point shot
it's<00:02:51.920> hard<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.310> recover<00:02:52.700> when<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.060> get<00:02:53.239> a

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
it's hard to recover when you get a

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.810 
it's hard to recover when you get a
three<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.870> four<00:02:54.170> in<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:55.310> other<00:02:55.340> team's<00:02:55.610> only

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
three and four in the other team's only

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.170 
three and four in the other team's only
hit<00:02:55.910> him<00:02:55.940> once<00:02:56.090> you're<00:02:56.840> gonna<00:02:56.959> win<00:02:57.110> okay<00:02:58.180> we

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
hit him once you're gonna win okay we

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.180 
hit him once you're gonna win okay we
think<00:02:59.330> it's<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.630> actually<00:03:00.170> pretty<00:03:00.380> fun<00:03:00.739> mini

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
think it's a actually pretty fun mini

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.340 
think it's a actually pretty fun mini
game<00:03:01.459> that's<00:03:02.120> why<00:03:02.270> we're<00:03:02.480> reviewing<00:03:02.870> this<00:03:03.110> map

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
game that's why we're reviewing this map

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.080 
game that's why we're reviewing this map
you<00:03:03.770> should<00:03:03.800> really<00:03:04.100> should<00:03:04.280> try<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.520> out<00:03:04.670> if

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
you should really should try it out if

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.020 
you should really should try it out if
you<00:03:05.209> haven't<00:03:05.330> played<00:03:05.570> it<00:03:05.800> yeah<00:03:06.800> it<00:03:07.250> this<00:03:07.820> map

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
you haven't played it yeah it this map

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.390 
you haven't played it yeah it this map
it<00:03:08.360> kind<00:03:08.570> of<00:03:08.600> reminds<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.080> of<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.440> old<00:03:09.470> you
