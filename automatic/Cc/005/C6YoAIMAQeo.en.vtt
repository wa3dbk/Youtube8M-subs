00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
immediately people began to suspect

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.080 
immediately people began to suspect
blackout<00:00:22.619> was<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> name<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.430> zombies<00:00:23.880> map

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
blackout was the name of a zombies map

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.450 
blackout was the name of a zombies map
and<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.539> very<00:00:24.840> well<00:00:25.050> may<00:00:25.439> be<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.830> case<00:00:26.099> and

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
and that very well may be the case and

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.700 
and that very well may be the case and
yes<00:00:26.970> there's<00:00:27.269> always<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.720> possibility<00:00:27.900> that

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
yes there's always the possibility that

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.050 
yes there's always the possibility that
maybe<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.189> has<00:00:29.310> something<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.820> do<00:00:29.939> with

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
maybe it has something to do with

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.089 
maybe it has something to do with
multiplayer<00:00:30.480> instead<00:00:31.140> or<00:00:31.380> maybe<00:00:31.679> it's<00:00:31.949> an

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
multiplayer instead or maybe it's an

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.310 
multiplayer instead or maybe it's an
audio<00:00:32.520> file<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.329> secret<00:00:33.719> song<00:00:34.079> or

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
audio file for a secret song or

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.229 
audio file for a secret song or
something<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:35.160> for<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> sake<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.940> this

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
something but for the sake of this

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.119 
something but for the sake of this
argument<00:00:36.450> let's<00:00:37.170> pretend<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.920> is

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
argument let's pretend that this is

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.100 
argument let's pretend that this is
actually<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.820> name<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.450> map<00:00:39.690> we're<00:00:39.899> going

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
actually the name of the map we're going

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.380 
actually the name of the map we're going
to<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.590> call<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.860> duty<00:00:40.950> black<00:00:41.190> ops<00:00:41.550> 3<00:00:42.030> now

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
to get in call of duty black ops 3 now

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.389 
to get in call of duty black ops 3 now
as<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.840> saw<00:00:43.050> before<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.800> promotional

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
as we saw before with the promotional

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.940 
as we saw before with the promotional
poster<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.360> most<00:00:45.629> likely<00:00:46.200> area<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.800> this

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
poster the most likely area that this

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.940 
poster the most likely area that this
map<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.700> take<00:00:47.910> place<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.950> Chicago

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
map is going to take place in is Chicago

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.279 
map is going to take place in is Chicago
and<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.820> due<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.210> fact<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.140> this

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
and this is due to the fact that in this

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.369 
and this is due to the fact that in this
poster<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:53.010> see<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.399> Chicago<00:00:54.000> skyline<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.170> if

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
poster we see the Chicago skyline so if

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.979 
poster we see the Chicago skyline so if
blackout<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> name<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.059> Chicago<00:00:57.719> map

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
blackout is the name of this Chicago map

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.319 
blackout is the name of this Chicago map
immediately<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:59.100> can<00:00:59.280> start<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.789> assume<00:01:00.120> that

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
immediately we can start to assume that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.299 
immediately we can start to assume that
we're<00:01:00.690> playing<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.170> Chicago<00:01:01.800> after<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
we're playing in Chicago after the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.490 
we're playing in Chicago after the
zombies<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:03.090> started<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.600> take<00:01:03.840> over<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
zombies have started to take over and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.950 
zombies have started to take over and
the<00:01:04.860> city<00:01:05.100> has<00:01:05.250> lost<00:01:05.549> power<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.570> sounds

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the city has lost power and that sounds

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.840 
the city has lost power and that sounds
very<00:01:07.170> reasonable<00:01:07.470> for<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> zombies<00:01:08.610> map

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
very reasonable for a zombies map

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.390 
very reasonable for a zombies map
however<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.840> could<00:01:10.229> actually<00:01:10.439> take<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.189> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
however this could actually take on a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.730 
however this could actually take on a
different<00:01:11.640> meaning<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.450> well<00:01:12.750> besides<00:01:13.439> power

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
different meaning as well besides power

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.679 
different meaning as well besides power
blackouts<00:01:14.369> large<00:01:14.850> cities<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.450> also

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
blackouts large cities can also

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.859 
blackouts large cities can also
experience<00:01:16.530> media<00:01:17.369> blackouts<00:01:17.970> now<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.810> is

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
experience media blackouts now this is

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.109 
experience media blackouts now this is
the<00:01:19.200> idea<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.070> government<00:01:20.580> or<00:01:20.729> some

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the idea that the government or some

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.020 
the idea that the government or some
larger<00:01:21.990> force<00:01:22.409> actually<00:01:23.159> manipulates<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
larger force actually manipulates the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.960 
larger force actually manipulates the
media<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.810> completely<00:01:25.470> isolate<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:26.310> city<00:01:26.700> or

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
media to completely isolate a city or

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.870 
media to completely isolate a city or
area<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> time<00:01:28.259> being<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.070> basically<00:01:29.700> in

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
area for the time being so basically in

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.899 
area for the time being so basically in
this<00:01:30.150> sense<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.720> black<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.740> Chicago<00:01:32.340> would

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
this sense a black out of Chicago would

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.240 
this sense a black out of Chicago would
be<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> whole<00:01:33.600> country<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.530> ignore<00:01:34.979> its

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
be for the whole country to ignore its

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.090 
be for the whole country to ignore its
existence<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> few<00:01:36.900> days<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.710> why<00:01:37.920> would

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
existence for a few days so why would

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.039 
existence for a few days so why would
this<00:01:38.250> occur<00:01:38.640> well<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.240> starters<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
this occur well for starters in the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.050 
this occur well for starters in the
zombie<00:01:40.409> apocalypse<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:41.220> don't<00:01:41.549> want<00:01:41.880> your

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
zombie apocalypse you don't want your

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.240 
zombie apocalypse you don't want your
entire<00:01:42.390> country<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> panic<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.100> would<00:01:44.220> make

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
entire country to panic so it would make

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.520 
entire country to panic so it would make
sense<00:01:44.520> if<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.180> government<00:01:45.360> issued<00:01:45.750> some<00:01:46.229> sort

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
sense if a government issued some sort

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.530 
sense if a government issued some sort
of<00:01:46.619> blackout<00:01:47.100> around<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.729> city<00:01:47.970> where<00:01:48.360> the
