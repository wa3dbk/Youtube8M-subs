here<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.030> go

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
here we go

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.230 
here we go
how<00:01:24.840> much<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.229> enjoy<00:01:25.259> cooking<00:01:26.240> ready-made

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
how much do you enjoy cooking ready-made

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.270 
how much do you enjoy cooking ready-made
meals<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> best<00:01:28.080> are<00:01:28.500> always<00:01:28.530> cooking

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
meals are the best are always cooking

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.219 
meals are the best are always cooking
from<00:01:29.460> scratch<00:01:29.880> now<00:01:30.540> obviously<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.020> get<00:01:31.110> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
from scratch now obviously you get to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.380 
from scratch now obviously you get to
answer<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.650> properly<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.250> air<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
answer it properly on the air on the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.539 
answer it properly on the air on the
gamepad<00:01:33.720> there's<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> scale<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:35.040> like

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
gamepad there's like a scale of on like

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.890 
gamepad there's like a scale of on like
front<00:01:35.729> side<00:01:35.880> side<00:01:36.060> there's<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.479> scale<00:01:36.689> from

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
front side side there's the scale from

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.370 
front side side there's the scale from
like<00:01:37.079> 1<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.710> think<00:01:38.220> 20<00:01:38.720> so<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.259> have

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
like 1 to I think 20 so you can you have

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.319 
like 1 to I think 20 so you can you have
to<00:01:40.409> move<00:01:40.680> out<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> lot<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.130> scale<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.700> obviously

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
to move out a lot of scale and obviously

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.380 
to move out a lot of scale and obviously
there<00:01:42.869> could<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.110> more<00:01:43.290> accurate<00:01:43.500> answer

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
there could be a more accurate answer

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.740 
there could be a more accurate answer
so<00:01:46.140> then<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.100> answer<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.580> here<00:01:48.480> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
so then we have to answer it here and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.830 
so then we have to answer it here and
after<00:01:49.410> this<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> cut<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:51.450> section

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
after this one I cut out this section

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.990 
after this one I cut out this section
because<00:01:52.110> my<00:01:52.560> god<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.190> it<00:01:53.310> dull<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> TV

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
because my god is it dull on the TV

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.210 
because my god is it dull on the TV
screen<00:01:55.790> it's<00:01:56.790> it's<00:01:57.240> not<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.600> exciting<00:01:58.220> to

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
screen it's it's not that exciting to

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.360 
screen it's it's not that exciting to
watch<00:01:59.400> but<00:02:00.260> yeah<00:02:01.260> it's<00:02:01.620> an<00:02:01.710> interesting<00:02:02.160> game

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370
