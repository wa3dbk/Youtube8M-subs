00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.180
 hello good everyone I'm liquid and good 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.570
 here I bring you the third part of this 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.390
 good tutorial in this case is the easter 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.840
 I found a lot of information in 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.669
 English-speaking channels and some in 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.340
 Spanish and well let's proceed to 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:33.550
 show 6-3 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.059
 it has to be on original difficulty or 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.390
 with friends 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.760
 they are not worth they mean they are easy 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.900
 a cross or an X appears together 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.630
 to the word difficulty let's go back to it 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.070
 ok I will not explain anything I'm not going to 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.100
 do any kind of tutorial and I'm going to 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.320
 explain anything about the steps 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.390
 I will simply show you where to go 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.970
 and how do you do it with the 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.840
 tutorial I mean I 'm not going to 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:05.330
 explain how to get the pieces of the 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.640
 electricity and generator because if 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.320
 it is already explained in the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.280
 chapters in the previous parts as well 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.280
 that if you have any doubt 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.050
 you are going to see the previous parts 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:23.390
 well let's go the generator 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.390
 If I wanted to build a land 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.770
 and the last piece 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.770
 this just in case 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.189
 but the appetite 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.210
 good 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.210
 we put it to the last piece 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.700
 as we left we rotate the left hand 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.120
 we go here and we go here and not what 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:26.090
 you are going to see what I tried to look for but not 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:31.040
 You are going to see it but look at us 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:34.490
 next to the money that you have and now we 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.880
 let's go to the fourth station third 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.880
 stop 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.700
 well we are here 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.020
 we are going to open and we are going to collect all 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.850
 the pieces for 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.860
 activate electricity we have here the 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.620
 hand I swear it is for this is the last 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.880
 piece we are going to activate the electricity 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.100
 try that the com and is here 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:01.580
 inside so you do not bet the rays 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.660
 we activate it is now supposed to be straight 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:11.060
 end says something that we released the bug is 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:14.610
 the electric bug that tells us something and 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.380
 that we did not hear him because he 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.240
 the interference electricity is something 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.950
 like that then when we finish 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.190
 stress and we go back and turn it off more 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.190
 good 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.480
 idiot for her is open we 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:40.230
 let's get out here, well, I took the bus 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.230
 and now I'm on my way to the prepared ones 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.190
 I'm going to the fifth station the force 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.640
 for so much 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.640
 clean and its remedies we have 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.740
 good 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.740
 Now we have to 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.700
 we work here to fix spaces in that light 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.700
 we down 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.909
 now it will be mounted 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.640
 is worth a bug of those there that colo there 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:17.250
 to bring an ugly goal of these to 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.920
 each site of these 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.320
 it's not 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.250
 we have to let him give us a couple of 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:30.740
 blows know what I do 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.740
 we give him a couple of hits 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.440
 and we put it in here 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.830
 and this activates a teleporter 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.860
 that will take us we jump fun and 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.880
 we are on another side under another lamppost 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.610
 you see has given me the achievement 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.360
 and we do exactly the same in all 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.320
 in which we are carrying more 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.580
 advantage 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.529
 a couple of hits 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.969
 and we bring it to the fore in context 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:03.509
 the websites 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:03.509
 in 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:14.200
 so I 'm afraid that yes, this would have 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.180
 to do it whenever we want 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.150
 teleport you would have to put a 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.140
 it does not have much difficulty the truth but 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.490
 It should be done every time 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.360
 we would like 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.819
 teleporting we would get a lot 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.680
 of these in the head and we put it in 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.110
 argentary 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.510
 we put it in the bulb and we 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:38.770
 will transport to a site and good everything 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:42.970
 but in part 4 and you already know like 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.970
