quite a lot I really actually even know
about<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.640> off<00:01:29.789> the<00:01:29.969> game<00:01:30.149> of<00:01:30.299> course<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.780> mom

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
about it's off the game of course a mom

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.660 
about it's off the game of course a mom
kind<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.649> gave<00:01:31.799> him<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.950> information<00:01:32.159> about

it but I feel like a lot of that has to

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.929 
it but I feel like a lot of that has to
go<00:01:34.649> off<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.859> the<00:01:34.950> offense<00:01:35.340> they've<00:01:35.609> had<00:01:35.789> the
