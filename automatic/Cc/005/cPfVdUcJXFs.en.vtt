00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.380
Imagination…

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.360
but...

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.280
the reality is?!

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.360
Let's go for lunch, it's my treat.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.840
miz fresher~

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.240
What do you want to eat~?

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.380
At one time, I was freshman too...

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.880
OK,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.080
I'll show you 'freshman makeup' that look so young more than freshman!

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.180
Makeup that changes stained face freshly~

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.940
Hello everyone, I’m KIMDAX.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.540
Today, I’m going to teach you a makeup 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.700
that is good for all sad enrolled students and for those who just entered university.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.320
Blossom and bright eyes and lip, and rosy cheek.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.180
I have made it easily, so try to follow it~

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.880
So, shall we start~?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.320
First, it is to make moist skin just like freshman~

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.640
Before applying C.C cream, I’m going to apply water oil to make moist skin condition.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.380
I strongly recommend this product. This is really good.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.840
We made some moist now, so we need to make glow now.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.720
You can skip this, but I’m going to apply starter for glowing skin even I’m far on the campus of spring.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.820
Don’t apply glowing starter on the whole face but apply only on nose, forehead, cheekbone, and jaw to make it look more three dimensionally

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.400
And I’m going to brighten the complexion with C.C cream.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.360
To follow young freshman, it is better to apply cream that makes the tone up.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.220
Before applying it, it has greenish color, but if you put it on the skin, it turns to flesh color that matches with the skin.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.420
But, I think it is little oily. So, buy it after testing in a shop.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.680
The point of this makeup is finishing skin makeup without darkness.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.640
So, do cover your dark circle using concealer.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.460
To apply concealer finely is to use this ring finger.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.820
Tap it with ring finger fast to make concealer sticks on skin.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.080
And draw the brow.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.840
To make thick brow, make a line with pen type brow product and fill it finely with brow mascara.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.480
For the parts where there are less hair, touch it adversely then you could make it as if there are many.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.940
Now, it is coral coral eye makeup in earnest.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.020
Apply pinkish base shadow on the whole eyes

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.940
And apply coral color eye shadow on the outer part of eyes until 1/3.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.000
And with dark coral shadow, I’m going to shade the eyes.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.580
Because this makeup is to remove darkness, I’m going to make eye hole naturally with this coral shadow.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.700
Brush it from outer part to the inner part and draw on the eye hole to make the depth of the eyes.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.920
If you find it difficult to use shadow, touch it alternately, then you could control the quantity and avoid making one eye bigger than the other.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.840
And this is to make eyes look opened and glitter softly.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.360
Using pinkish shadow with coarse-grained pearl, apply on the middle of the eyes and on the inner part then blend it.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.960
It is not show the detail, so it is easier to use finger!

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.860
And draw eye line closely on the waterline.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.160
Rather than drawing thick one, make the tail drooped to make you look profound and young.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.380
And with reddish eyeliner, I’m going to fill the tail and underline.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.600
Apply it few times on the tail where it meets with eye line and as you draw it to the middle part, do it less as if you are tapping.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.820
Tapping it but not applying it at once is because it might look the stage makeup if it is too dark.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.700
Arrange the line finely by blending it with flat brush.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.180
You could make pure, profound, and bigger eyes than when you filled the underline with dark eyeliner.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.420
Now it is the life of vitality! Blusher.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.740
Brush upward diagonally to make lifting effect and to make healthy and lively cheek.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.580
Because this makeup is to brighten up the face, I didn’t shade darkly.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.040
But it looks so plain, so it is better to shade lightly on the nose.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.640
Touch on the side and tip of the nose and blend it naturally

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.360
Now, make moist and dark pinkish lip.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.200
Tadah~

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.180
I’m done if I arrange the hair finely!

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.180
It surely makes me look younger and livelier than when I applied red lipstick and strong makeup, right?

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.380
I hope you could be the one who don’t feel inferior to anyone with respect to appearance~ 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.882
 Bye!

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.520
A year later...

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.520
(she was the freshman a year ago)

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.040
miz freshman~ How about going for a meal?

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.020
Let's go to drink, it's my treat~!

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.260
-a living lesson-

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.620
Time files,it's heartless thing.
