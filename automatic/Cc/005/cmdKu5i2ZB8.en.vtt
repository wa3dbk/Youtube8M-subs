fans<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.590> helpful<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.400> have

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
fans this is helpful if you have

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.399 
fans this is helpful if you have
multiple<00:01:12.000> GPUs<00:01:12.210> because<00:01:13.020> it'll<00:01:13.200> give<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
multiple GPUs because it'll give you

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.679 
multiple GPUs because it'll give you
direct<00:01:13.770> cooling<00:01:14.220> right<00:01:14.400> over<00:01:14.670> your<00:01:14.820> GPUs

direct cooling right over your GPUs

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.590 
direct cooling right over your GPUs
we've<00:01:16.439> got<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.860> single<00:01:17.280> GPU<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.119> our<00:01:18.330> build

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
we've got a single GPU in our build

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.420 
we've got a single GPU in our build
today<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.560> we're<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.830> stick<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
today so we're going to stick with the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.020 
today so we're going to stick with the
clear<00:01:20.790> side<00:01:21.030> panel<00:01:22.430> first<00:01:23.430> we're<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
clear side panel first we're going to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.460 
clear side panel first we're going to
remove<00:01:24.270> some<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> fans<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.259> we're<00:01:25.380> going

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
remove some of the fans that we're going

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.560 
remove some of the fans that we're going
to<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.680> replacing<00:01:26.070> before<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.700> get<00:01:26.820> all

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
to be replacing before we get all

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.899 
to be replacing before we get all

cluttered up with Hardware in there and

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.190 
cluttered up with Hardware in there and
make<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.150> lot<00:01:30.299> easier<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.780> remove<00:01:31.020> them

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
make it a lot easier to remove them

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.819 
make it a lot easier to remove them
