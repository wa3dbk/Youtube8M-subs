00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.249 

this<00:05:23.669> bow<00:05:23.909> is<00:05:24.059> zero<00:05:24.299> to<00:05:24.449> 20<00:05:24.779> yards<00:05:25.079> and<00:05:25.199> the

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
this bow is zero to 20 yards and the

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.019 
this bow is zero to 20 yards and the
point<00:05:25.499> of<00:05:25.559> impact<00:05:25.709> is<00:05:26.099> almost<00:05:26.429> the<00:05:26.549> exact<00:05:26.909> same

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.029 
point of impact is almost the exact same

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:30.049 
point of impact is almost the exact same
as<00:05:27.419> at<00:05:27.539> 10<00:05:27.749> yards<00:05:27.929> this<00:05:28.649> is<00:05:28.889> a<00:05:28.919> fast<00:05:29.249> bow<00:05:29.519> I'm

00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:30.059 
as at 10 yards this is a fast bow I'm

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:32.299 
as at 10 yards this is a fast bow I'm
now<00:05:30.419> at<00:05:30.569> 30<00:05:30.809> yards<00:05:31.019> and<00:05:31.319> I'm<00:05:31.379> using<00:05:31.589> the<00:05:31.860> exact

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:32.309 
now at 30 yards and I'm using the exact

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:34.189 
now at 30 yards and I'm using the exact
same<00:05:32.489> point<00:05:33.059> of<00:05:33.179> aim<00:05:33.360> as<00:05:33.569> the<00:05:33.749> previous<00:05:34.169> two

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
same point of aim as the previous two

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:42.409 
same point of aim as the previous two
groups<00:05:39.979> so<00:05:40.979> I<00:05:41.009> got<00:05:41.309> some<00:05:41.489> expected<00:05:41.999> drop<00:05:42.119> to

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
groups so I got some expected drop to

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.269 
groups so I got some expected drop to
the<00:05:42.539> arrow<00:05:42.719> finally<00:05:43.289> but<00:05:43.829> notice<00:05:44.099> how<00:05:44.219> the

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
the arrow finally but notice how the

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.489 
the arrow finally but notice how the
group<00:05:44.549> is<00:05:44.669> directly<00:05:45.239> below<00:05:45.479> the<00:05:45.869> previous<00:05:46.229> two

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:46.499 
group is directly below the previous two

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:48.529 
group is directly below the previous two
groups<00:05:46.769> all<00:05:47.129> of<00:05:47.549> which<00:05:47.699> are<00:05:47.819> offset<00:05:48.360> to<00:05:48.509> the

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
groups all of which are offset to the

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.209 
groups all of which are offset to the
left<00:05:48.659> by<00:05:49.049> a<00:05:49.079> little<00:05:49.499> bit<00:05:49.619> over<00:05:49.889> an<00:05:50.039> inch

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:50.219 
left by a little bit over an inch

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:51.709 
left by a little bit over an inch
there's<00:05:50.639> a<00:05:50.729> reason<00:05:51.179> for<00:05:51.209> that

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
there's a reason for that

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.929 
there's a reason for that
now<00:05:52.319> I'm<00:05:52.499> going<00:05:52.649> to<00:05:52.739> use<00:05:52.769> the<00:05:53.129> crosshairs<00:05:53.729> to

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:53.939 
now I'm going to use the crosshairs to

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:55.879 
now I'm going to use the crosshairs to
adjust<00:05:54.360> for<00:05:54.599> my<00:05:54.719> yardage<00:05:55.169> and<00:05:55.349> I'm<00:05:55.649> going<00:05:55.799> to

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
adjust for my yardage and I'm going to

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.819 
adjust for my yardage and I'm going to
see<00:05:56.099> how<00:05:56.339> well<00:05:56.579> I<00:05:56.610> group<00:05:57.059> three<00:05:57.809> shots<00:05:58.110> each<00:05:58.409> at

00:05:58.819 --> 00:05:58.829 
see how well I group three shots each at

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:06.079 
see how well I group three shots each at
a<00:05:58.860> different<00:05:59.249> yardage<00:06:02.689> and<00:06:04.819> it<00:06:05.819> worked<00:06:05.969> out

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:06.089 
a different yardage and it worked out

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:09.379 
a different yardage and it worked out
exactly<00:06:06.749> like<00:06:06.839> I<00:06:07.139> thought<00:06:07.349> it<00:06:07.409> would<00:06:08.299> so<00:06:09.299> those

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
exactly like I thought it would so those

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.229 
exactly like I thought it would so those
three<00:06:09.869> shots<00:06:09.899> in<00:06:10.439> in<00:06:10.649> succession<00:06:11.279> one<00:06:11.879> at<00:06:12.029> ten

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:12.239 
three shots in in succession one at ten

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:13.879 
three shots in in succession one at ten
yards<00:06:12.569> one<00:06:12.749> at<00:06:12.869> 20<00:06:13.049> yards<00:06:13.259> and<00:06:13.499> one<00:06:13.619> at<00:06:13.709> 30

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
yards one at 20 yards and one at 30

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.249 
yards one at 20 yards and one at 30
yards<00:06:14.279> you<00:06:14.939> saw<00:06:15.149> the<00:06:15.209> way<00:06:15.539> the<00:06:15.719> groups<00:06:15.959> lined

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
yards you saw the way the groups lined

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:20.299 
yards you saw the way the groups lined
up<00:06:16.669> with<00:06:17.669> an<00:06:17.819> offset<00:06:17.999> scope<00:06:18.769> all<00:06:19.769> you<00:06:20.009> have<00:06:20.159> to

00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:20.309 
up with an offset scope all you have to

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:24.919 
up with an offset scope all you have to
do<00:06:20.489> is<00:06:20.819> set<00:06:21.719> your<00:06:22.139> point<00:06:23.129> of<00:06:23.219> aim<00:06:23.429> for<00:06:24.329> exactly

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:24.929 
do is set your point of aim for exactly

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:27.949 
do is set your point of aim for exactly
the<00:06:25.139> offset<00:06:25.709> that<00:06:26.309> it<00:06:26.519> has<00:06:26.759> on<00:06:27.149> the<00:06:27.509> bow<00:06:27.689> on

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:27.959 
the offset that it has on the bow on

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:31.189 
the offset that it has on the bow on
this<00:06:28.169> from<00:06:28.949> the<00:06:28.979> string<00:06:29.429> or<00:06:29.729> on<00:06:30.509> a<00:06:30.539> rifle<00:06:31.050> from

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
this from the string or on a rifle from

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.879 
this from the string or on a rifle from
the<00:06:31.409> barrel<00:06:31.769> and<00:06:31.919> then<00:06:32.729> at<00:06:33.029> every<00:06:33.360> yardage<00:06:34.019> you

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889 
the barrel and then at every yardage you

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.519 
the barrel and then at every yardage you
should<00:06:35.099> be<00:06:35.300> exactly<00:06:36.300> that<00:06:36.569> far<00:06:36.989> off<00:06:37.139> because

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:37.529 
should be exactly that far off because

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:39.409 
should be exactly that far off because
the<00:06:38.069> point<00:06:38.339> of<00:06:38.459> aim<00:06:38.550> and<00:06:38.759> the<00:06:38.819> point<00:06:39.029> of<00:06:39.149> impact

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 
the point of aim and the point of impact

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:42.049 
the point of aim and the point of impact
should<00:06:39.719> be<00:06:39.839> parallel<00:06:40.289> and<00:06:40.679> so<00:06:41.610> when<00:06:41.939> you're

00:06:42.049 --> 00:06:42.059 
should be parallel and so when you're

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:45.469 
should be parallel and so when you're
talking<00:06:42.179> about<00:06:42.389> 1<00:06:42.929> and<00:06:43.289> 3/4<00:06:44.039> or<00:06:44.069> one<00:06:44.519> and<00:06:44.729> 3/16

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
talking about 1 and 3/4 or one and 3/16

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.679 
talking about 1 and 3/4 or one and 3/16
of<00:06:45.569> an<00:06:45.689> inch<00:06:45.899> and<00:06:46.229> offset<00:06:47.189> that's<00:06:47.819> meaningless

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:48.689 
of an inch and offset that's meaningless

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:51.379 
of an inch and offset that's meaningless
when<00:06:49.050> it<00:06:49.169> comes<00:06:49.379> to<00:06:49.559> hunting<00:06:49.759> so<00:06:50.759> you<00:06:50.849> can<00:06:51.179> just

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:51.389 
when it comes to hunting so you can just

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.649 
when it comes to hunting so you can just
aim<00:06:51.829> right<00:06:52.829> on<00:06:53.069> the<00:06:53.579> crosshair<00:06:54.089> that<00:06:54.299> you<00:06:54.449> pick

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:54.659 
aim right on the crosshair that you pick

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:57.409 
aim right on the crosshair that you pick
for<00:06:54.809> your<00:06:54.869> yardage<00:06:55.319> or<00:06:56.129> if<00:06:56.610> you<00:06:57.029> want<00:06:57.239> you

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 
for your yardage or if you want you

00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:59.209 
for your yardage or if you want you
could<00:06:57.569> just<00:06:57.629> do<00:06:58.049> the<00:06:58.079> Kentucky<00:06:58.679> windage<00:06:59.009> and

00:06:59.209 --> 00:06:59.219 
could just do the Kentucky windage and

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:02.239 
could just do the Kentucky windage and
aim<00:06:59.939> to<00:07:00.179> the<00:07:00.209> right<00:07:00.329> by<00:07:00.779> about<00:07:01.079> an<00:07:01.289> inch<00:07:01.439> if<00:07:01.739> you

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:02.249 
aim to the right by about an inch if you

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:04.219 
aim to the right by about an inch if you
want<00:07:02.489> to<00:07:02.610> get<00:07:02.789> really<00:07:03.329> precise<00:07:03.809> with<00:07:04.049> your

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229 
want to get really precise with your

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.489 
want to get really precise with your
shot<00:07:04.439> that's<00:07:05.159> not<00:07:05.399> that<00:07:05.610> hard<00:07:05.819> to<00:07:05.969> do<00:07:06.499> with

00:07:07.489 --> 00:07:07.499 
shot that's not that hard to do with

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:10.789 
shot that's not that hard to do with
with<00:07:08.069> the<00:07:08.189> scope<00:07:08.519> at<00:07:09.139> hunting<00:07:10.139> distances<00:07:10.619> with

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:10.799 
with the scope at hunting distances with

00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:13.249 
with the scope at hunting distances with
a<00:07:10.829> crossbow<00:07:11.449> of<00:07:12.449> course<00:07:12.719> there's<00:07:12.899> no<00:07:13.019> such

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259 
a crossbow of course there's no such

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.439 
a crossbow of course there's no such
offset<00:07:13.709> issue<00:07:13.919> with<00:07:14.429> the<00:07:14.639> pin<00:07:14.849> sights<00:07:15.209> and

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:15.449 
offset issue with the pin sights and

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:17.539 
offset issue with the pin sights and
what's<00:07:16.019> really<00:07:16.319> unique<00:07:16.469> is<00:07:16.769> they<00:07:16.979> can<00:07:17.189> be<00:07:17.219> used

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:17.549 
what's really unique is they can be used

00:07:17.549 --> 00:07:19.549 
what's really unique is they can be used
as<00:07:17.759> backup<00:07:18.059> sights<00:07:18.509> to<00:07:18.659> the<00:07:18.779> scope<00:07:19.049> and<00:07:19.259> that's

00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:19.559 
as backup sights to the scope and that's

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:21.319 
as backup sights to the scope and that's
just<00:07:19.769> one<00:07:20.009> more<00:07:20.039> advantage<00:07:20.429> to<00:07:20.789> its<00:07:20.939> vertical

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:21.329 
just one more advantage to its vertical

00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:25.939
