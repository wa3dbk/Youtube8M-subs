00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.660
 work on the creation of bmp 3m began back in 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.450
 early eighties 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.290
 before the developers was put 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.650
 on the most difficult tasks to design 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.239
 single combat vehicle for marines 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:14.200
 land 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.200
 airborne 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.330
 should have possessed all the best 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.330
 qualities of their 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.260
 in 1986 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.730
 and nothing progressive 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.330
 non soviet army 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.670
 after the first maneuver 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.730
 it became obvious that the designers 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.620
 managed to create something really 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.620
 unique 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.750
 unlike their steel 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.750
 predecessor 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.740
 white alloys 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.230
 engine transmission 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.430
 branch is located 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.010
 in the bow as before 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.560
 and in the stern for tank 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.290
 on the layout in mp3 years like combat 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.290
 assault vehicles bmp 1 and ibm db2 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.700
 driver mechanics located in 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.360
 branch center 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.420
 next to him barely design 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.540
 well who would have his grave 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.580
 is the operator gunner and commander 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.670
 landing on folding seats 5 shooters 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.840
 their disembarkation is made through 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.290
 door in the stern what is most secure 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.280
 fights 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.630
 power weapons bmp 3 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.410
 has competitors among his cars 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.250
 two guns are mounted on triples 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.900
 ammunition 100 millimeter 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.230
 launcher guns consists of 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.550
 and to shells and eight 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.860
 rate of fire 30 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.970
 out of five shots 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.710
 besides the usual coaxial machine gun 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.070
 installed in the tower along with the main 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.690
 weapons there are two more located in 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.690
 housing 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.470
 optical sights 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.880
 bmw 5 3 engine multi-fuel 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.560
 can also be used 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.969
 tall as a tank 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.279
 m and aviation 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:13.059
 feed tanks characteristic of 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.059
 previous car disappeared and 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.189
 building can equally well 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.029
 valid in almost all 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:21.439
 climatic zones 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.439
 including in the mountains 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.069
 mechanically done and developed by 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.909
 certain doctrine 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.730
 offensive she is fit to lead 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.219
 their 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.819
 hurt the contaminated area and for 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.289
 two days without leaving the crew 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.329
 and provide all assessment capabilities 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.519
 this existence of them parkour even if 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.519
 And toilet program bus for but 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.559
 strategic maneuvers 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:55.829
 I try this car maybe two days 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.009
 for example, it is made on 2 Suvorov 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.449
 transfers payment Ural Dalaman width 3 stock 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.929
 move they have enough resources to force such 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:07.709
 throw 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.369
 in full combat weight machine 18 tons 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:12.319
 she is capable of carrying ten people 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.969
 assault and that but ammunition 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:16.339
 while moving by land 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:18.849
 at speeds of up to 70 kilometers and palladium 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.849
 and up to ten kilometers per hour 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.939
 bmp 3m began to actively modernize 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.839
 it was his turn to raise 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:30.109
 security and maneuverability 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.579
 several options have been developed 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.499
 modifications for all occasions 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.689
 most modern version of bmp 3m 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:39.729
 enhanced armor is now capable 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:41.799
 to withstand the hit of small-caliber 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:42.749
 projectile 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.299
 without a car increased but mobility 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.619
 worsened by more powerful 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:50.619
 engine 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.899
 raised can live here by 30 percent 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.779
 changed security 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:01.409
 cars especially from missiles of all classes 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.259
 span of course racket controlled 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:06.699
 it means we have developed several systems 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.659
 of protection 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.959
 in an arena type complex which can 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.599
 provide protection from controlled and 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.120
 unguided rocket of all classes 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.120
 curtain complex which provides 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.389
 protection ator managed and 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.780
 unguided rockets by staging or 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.680
 optical interference of electronic interference 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.729
 as well as the complex will say so 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.840
 passive dynamic protection and 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.430
 active armor 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.100
 which are meant for 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.360
 protection against hand grenade launchers 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.250
 it was then that such developments took place and 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.930
 such machines is one 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.770
 tests on Russian landfills 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.830
 armies 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.580
 since 1992 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.949
 in mp3 started actively promoting on 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.219
 international arms market 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.409
 in keen competition this car 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:57.769
 proved that the main 

00:04:57.769 --> 00:04:59.150
 characteristics 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.150
 equal to her world today is not 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.960
 there are similar machines 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.819
 Bradley's Answer American Brand 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.159
 and therefore 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.590
 then Syria 96 km is a car of the same class 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:18.460
 premiere but they are heavier and not 24 tons 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.530
 they need to say communication here this version 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.410
 year on the armor urban 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.779
 protection but they don't swim 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:29.259
 they will bring having ammunition in the composition 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:31.830
 so they imk 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.249
 troops 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:34.829
 kuwait she participated in 

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:36.979
 maneuvers with the Americans bradley 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.110
 by itself it was not stops in mp3 on 

00:05:40.109 --> 00:05:42.399
 marches of people and other american tanks 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:43.349
 were 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.050
 she always came back her 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.050
 course and not at full strength 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:52.400
 today large batches in mp3 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.340
 purchased cyprus in kuwait south korea and 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.770
 United Arab Emirates 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.740
 The design of bmp is 3 years so successful that 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.639
 the possibility of modifying it is simple 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:03.629
 are huge 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:05.389
 in class this car is really 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:06.889
 it is better 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:08.469
 according to experts 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.330
 safety margin design bmp 3 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.370
 enough for at least another decade
