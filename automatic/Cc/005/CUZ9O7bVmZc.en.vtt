aerodynamic specialist said they've

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.690 
aerodynamic specialist said they've
never<00:02:17.870> seen<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.260> vehicle<00:02:18.709> like<00:02:18.739> continuum<00:02:19.550> in

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
never seen a vehicle like continuum in

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.880 
never seen a vehicle like continuum in
the<00:02:19.819> wind<00:02:20.000> tunnel<00:02:20.120> this<00:02:21.020> was<00:02:21.260> quite<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.650> unique

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
the wind tunnel this was quite a unique

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.059 
the wind tunnel this was quite a unique
vehicle<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.700> challenge<00:02:23.150> for<00:02:23.360> us<00:02:23.860> we've<00:02:24.860> never

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
vehicle and challenge for us we've never

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.220 
vehicle and challenge for us we've never
tested<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:26.150> my<00:02:26.270> knowledge<00:02:26.480> a<00:02:26.780> three-wheeled

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
tested to my knowledge a three-wheeled

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.070 
tested to my knowledge a three-wheeled
vehicle<00:02:27.680> so<00:02:28.069> that's<00:02:28.430> been<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:29.120> little<00:02:29.780> bit<00:02:29.959> of

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
vehicle so that's been a little bit of

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.290 
vehicle so that's been a little bit of
engineering<00:02:30.680> technical<00:02:34.000> development<00:02:35.000> needed

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
engineering technical development needed

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.140 
engineering technical development needed
and<00:02:35.840> then<00:02:36.530> also<00:02:36.800> this<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.340> very<00:02:37.580> extremely

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
and then also this is a very extremely

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.930 
and then also this is a very extremely
low<00:02:38.450> drag<00:02:38.780> vehicle<00:02:39.319> so<00:02:39.680> it's<00:02:39.980> beyond<00:02:40.370> anything

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
low drag vehicle so it's beyond anything

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.330 
low drag vehicle so it's beyond anything
that<00:02:41.180> we<00:02:41.330> would<00:02:41.569> ever<00:02:41.720> do<00:02:41.930> for<00:02:42.709> production

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
that we would ever do for production

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.030 
that we would ever do for production
cars<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:44.720> it's<00:02:45.170> it's<00:02:45.560> going<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.830> be<00:02:45.950> an

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
cars so it's it's going to be an

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.390 
cars so it's it's going to be an
