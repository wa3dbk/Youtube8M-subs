setup

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259

so<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.320> can<00:02:10.560> see<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:11.100> have<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.460> launch<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.850> out

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
so you can see you have to launch it out

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.990 
so you can see you have to launch it out
of<00:02:12.090> second<00:02:12.420> gear<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:14.310> when<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.580> launch<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.910> out

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
of second gear so when you launch it out

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.540 
of second gear so when you launch it out
of<00:02:15.090> second<00:02:15.450> gear<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:17.220> know<00:02:17.310> you're<00:02:17.430> gonna

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
of second gear you know you're gonna

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.700 
of second gear you know you're gonna
might<00:02:17.730> have<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.060> fiddle<00:02:18.270> with<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.710> shift

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
might have to fiddle with the shift

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.420 
might have to fiddle with the shift
points<00:02:21.200> but<00:02:22.200> if<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.470> try<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.710> get<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.070> close<00:02:23.280> to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
points but if you try to get it close to

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.180 
points but if you try to get it close to
perfect<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.030> usually<00:02:24.540> you'll<00:02:24.990> get<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.530> good

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
perfect and usually you'll get a good

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.610 
perfect and usually you'll get a good
number
