00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
support how has skateboarding changed

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.510 
support how has skateboarding changed
over<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:02.959> years<00:02:03.409> I<00:02:03.709> think<00:02:04.099> that<00:02:04.159> over<00:02:04.429> the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
over the years I think that over the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.570 
over the years I think that over the
years<00:02:05.709> skateboarding's<00:02:06.709> become<00:02:07.159> more

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
years skateboarding's become more

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.150 
years skateboarding's become more
accepted<00:02:08.030> in<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.209> mainstream<00:02:08.500> do<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.679> do<00:02:10.130> to

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
accepted in the mainstream do to do to

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.600 
accepted in the mainstream do to do to
just<00:02:10.610> exposure<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:11.239> think<00:02:11.480> X<00:02:11.720> Games<00:02:12.430> those<00:02:13.430> type

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
just exposure I think X Games those type

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.259 
just exposure I think X Games those type
of<00:02:13.640> contest<00:02:14.239> do<00:02:14.690> tour<00:02:15.940> those<00:02:16.940> kind<00:02:17.120> of<00:02:17.180> things

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
of contest do tour those kind of things

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.610 
of contest do tour those kind of things
you're<00:02:17.450> seeing<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.079> see<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:18.319> on<00:02:18.410> TV

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
you're seeing and you see it on TV

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.039 
you're seeing and you see it on TV
commercially<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:20.390> think<00:02:20.599> it's<00:02:20.750> becoming

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
commercially and I think it's becoming

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.449 
commercially and I think it's becoming
more<00:02:21.260> accepted<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.700> think<00:02:23.569> that<00:02:23.780> uh<00:02:24.459> it's

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
more accepted I think that uh it's

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.580 
more accepted I think that uh it's
interesting<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:26.060> me<00:02:26.180> I'm<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:26.510> my<00:02:26.630> 40s<00:02:27.079> and<00:02:27.290> it's

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
interesting to me I'm in my 40s and it's

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.550 
interesting to me I'm in my 40s and it's
it's<00:02:27.890> no<00:02:28.450> it's<00:02:29.450> no<00:02:29.569> big<00:02:29.870> deal<00:02:29.900> for<00:02:30.079> me<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.440> go<00:02:30.530> to

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
it's no it's no big deal for me to go to

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.930 
it's no it's no big deal for me to go to
the<00:02:30.709> skateboard<00:02:31.130> park<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.579> other<00:02:31.730> guys

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
the skateboard park it's the other guys

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.840 
the skateboard park it's the other guys
in<00:02:32.150> their<00:02:32.269> 40s<00:02:32.299> skateboarding<00:02:33.489> so<00:02:34.489> its<00:02:34.640> peak

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
in their 40s skateboarding so its peak

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.270 
in their 40s skateboarding so its peak
it's<00:02:35.060> finally<00:02:35.390> reached<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.870> era<00:02:36.250> or<00:02:37.250> i

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
it's finally reached that era or i

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.030 
it's finally reached that era or i
should<00:02:37.400> say<00:02:37.579> it's<00:02:38.180> finally<00:02:38.569> reached<00:02:39.040> similar

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
should say it's finally reached similar

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.650 
should say it's finally reached similar
to<00:02:40.310> surfing<00:02:40.790> where<00:02:40.970> there<00:02:41.090> isn't<00:02:41.239> an<00:02:41.450> age

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
to surfing where there isn't an age

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.199 
to surfing where there isn't an age
limit<00:02:41.989> so<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:43.280> older<00:02:43.579> guys<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:44.090> were

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
limit so the older guys that were

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.840 
limit so the older guys that were
skateboarders<00:02:44.750> now<00:02:44.900> have<00:02:45.109> kids<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.819> yeah<00:02:46.819> I

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
skateboarders now have kids and yeah I

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.039 
skateboarders now have kids and yeah I
think<00:02:47.000> you're<00:02:47.239> right<00:02:47.299> i<00:02:47.450> think<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:47.780> becoming

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
think you're right i think it's becoming

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.110 
think you're right i think it's becoming
more<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.500> mainstream<00:02:48.709> kind<00:02:49.489> of<00:02:49.579> thing<00:02:49.730> there

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
more of a mainstream kind of thing there

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.629 
more of a mainstream kind of thing there
certainly<00:02:50.359> is<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.959> other<00:02:51.319> element<00:02:51.980> it'll

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
certainly is that other element it'll

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.770 
certainly is that other element it'll
always<00:02:52.850> be<00:02:53.030> there<00:02:53.299> that's<00:02:53.510> part<00:02:53.720> of

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
always be there that's part of

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.330 
always be there that's part of
skateboarding<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.620> it's<00:02:54.799> certainly<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.130> part

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
skateboarding and it's certainly a part

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.160 
skateboarding and it's certainly a part
of<00:02:55.400> what<00:02:55.549> i'm<00:02:55.700> showing<00:02:55.940> with<00:02:56.209> backyard<00:02:56.660> empty

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
of what i'm showing with backyard empty

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.970 
of what i'm showing with backyard empty
pools<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:59.209> i<00:02:59.299> hope<00:02:59.389> that<00:02:59.480> never<00:02:59.780> goes<00:03:00.019> away

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.289 

uh<00:03:03.069> my<00:03:04.030> work<00:03:04.239> is<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.510> series<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.940> paintings<00:03:06.940> that

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.960 
those structures out of the wooden panel
that<00:03:21.310> I'm<00:03:21.549> painting<00:03:22.000> on<00:03:22.360> so<00:03:23.049> there's<00:03:23.290> a

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
that I'm painting on so there's a

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.199 
that I'm painting on so there's a

building a landscape on a panel nick is

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.550 
building a landscape on a panel nick is
this<00:03:28.420> because<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.780> can't<00:03:28.989> make<00:03:29.140> up<00:03:29.260> your<00:03:29.290> mind

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
making a painting is is building a

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.349 
making a painting is is building a
structure<00:03:44.440> that<00:03:44.680> people<00:03:45.640> inhabit<00:03:46.000> I

traveling through images and objects and

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.039 
traveling through images and objects and
things<00:04:12.130> that<00:04:13.120> are<00:04:13.209> meaningful<00:04:13.299> are<00:04:13.720> stories

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
basically I try out different ways of

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.229 
basically I try out different ways of
explaining<00:04:17.680> those<00:04:17.919> are<00:04:18.099> exploring<00:04:18.430> those<00:04:18.639> so

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
ladder I give a lot of thought to how

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.550 
ladder I give a lot of thought to how
things<00:04:46.150> come<00:04:46.420> about<00:04:46.540> so<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:46.990> materials<00:04:47.410> that

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
things come about so the materials that

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.440 
things come about so the materials that
i<00:04:47.590> use<00:04:47.860> but<00:04:48.520> more<00:04:48.670> often<00:04:48.790> than<00:04:48.910> not<00:04:49.030> i<00:04:49.150> just

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
i use but more often than not i just

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.730 
i use but more often than not i just
kind<00:04:49.600> of<00:04:49.630> start<00:04:49.870> with<00:04:49.960> an<00:04:50.080> object<00:04:50.470> this<00:04:50.590> is

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
kind of start with an object this is

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.170

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
about ways to illustrate that and both

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.600 
about ways to illustrate that and both
like<00:05:02.140> metaphorically<00:05:02.710> as<00:05:02.920> in<00:05:03.070> glory<00:05:03.310> train
