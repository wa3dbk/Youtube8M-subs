00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.510
 hello to all I galley to write 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.950
 this video I galley serious 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.070
 so that's what we're going to do look 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.330
 this table this is my thesis what I 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.040
 support is that the Lord of 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.390
 star wars and camelot rings are grosso 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.710
 merdo the same story not in the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.939
 detail certainly but in the functions 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.230
 that each character 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.340
 indeed these three stories respond 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.779
 to the same simple patterns that we 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.039
 found in any archetypal intrigue 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.580
 so here's rejected a look at 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.930
 chart so first of all I want to 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.250
 specify that the entirety of what I 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.720
 will tell you is much more lies 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.340
 in this dramatic app has more 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.570
 precisely in the help to chelsea that 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.860
 you're interested so we have three heroes 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.479
 hockey these three heroes have a priori 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.830
 not a fantastic life and go for that I 

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.699
 I'm farmers and vasic his gland to my 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.930
 right and go on that it's a small 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.790
 guy on the left but a nice day 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.379
 landed a very important character the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.909
 guardian is the character who starts 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.140
 the story without him the hero continues to 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.400
 but that's not all because the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.229
 goalkeeper arrives with a quest in his 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.760
 pocket but also with a code 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.229
 moral begins to a moral code and ben 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.460
 yes, you will not do it if you do not do that 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.869
 do not play with the ring 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.890
 defend the dignity of the tables and 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:02.239
 dark side anyway it's dark 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.189
 more blue like the most and this pub 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.720
 it's gandalf that brings the No. 7 obi-wan 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.189
 that initia lucas force is merlin 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.900
 who does remove the sword from arthur rock 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.490
 hockey then of course we have our 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.690
 Monday antagonistic lives that seeks to 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.770
 avoid what the hero is trying to 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.360
 accomplish will know who wants to recover 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.890
 all his jewels the emperor who wants anti 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.090
 young batch and later but the eag years 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.380
 well all these good people who are not 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.790
 definitely not very nice but this is 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.230
 not everything in a good story there is 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.730
 also need a figure that shows to 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.350
 hero what can happen if he does not follow 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.670
 not the code of his guardian this character 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.290
 it's the agonist tale that's the 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.820
 mirror character of the hero the double 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.930
 evil one who is like the hero 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.400
 but who do not things like he 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.930
 must and of course it's gollum 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.640
 Escape horse and lancelot voili voilou 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.290
 yes gollum these facts pervert by the 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.790
 gold nova gets perverted by the side 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.080
 obscur and lancelot works for 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.159
 the other one and it's done by 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.330
 the eag between our three intrigues 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.290
 meet plus it's great by this 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.430
 is really going on the same thing in 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.200
 the three stories the guardians are 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.700
 incarnations of the supernatural to send 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.960
 places and therefore this in 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.520
 premium to the hero's quest a taste of 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.810
 destiny as if it were the world 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.310
 even that they would ask to be saved 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.750
 then if our guards are the guarantors 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.039
 of the moral code a bit like parents 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.909
 what better way to reprove our heroes 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.439
 than to make them fall 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.759
 here is a beautiful difficulty in our 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.259
 protagonists will they arrive at 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.909
 stay the course despite the lack of 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.079
 their guardian and that's the death of big one 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.460
 and that's the banishment of the lady of the 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.079
 lake couple is departing from merlin and 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.429
 that's the fall of gandalf once 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.690
 the more difficult it seems to me not to 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.099
 notice the parallel between two three 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.440
 intrigues and if it stopped there but 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.879
 no sam gabegie r2d2 and pierval cracked 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.110
 in the box of thresholds that categories 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.519
 of characters who represent faith 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.840
 in our hero and year worries and I 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.910
 even go a little further with boromir 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.019
 solo and leodagan crack category of 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.099
 skeptical the characters who 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.260
 represent the doubt within our 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.340
 history what but if your Roman does not 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.720
 do not believe in the destruction of the ring 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.220
 leodagan does not believe in the lady of the lake 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.079
 and yan solo does not believe in strength 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.849
 crack so 10 g to finish both 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.410
 last categories emotionally because the 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.090
 hot and cold to spock and mccoy 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.950
 let's see gimli the nar elsewhere and 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.239
 legolas the laconic elf chewbacca the 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.280
 rookie and the ja the imperial princess 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.930
 gueniÃ¨vre the eccentric and manages the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.160
 old frosty slut to make it simple 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.269
 yes because there I make it simple 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.590
 to lay the groundwork is analysis 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.849
 rudimentary which can well be 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.870
 do too much by the first fan boy 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.489
 become the first thing to specify 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.810
 would be that several characters to 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.129
 condition of being well defined can 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.269
 occupy the same category finally brief 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.930
 it does not matter I do not think I have the 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.680
 rocket science 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.239
 what do I want to do with this 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.230
 video is rather to create the debate than to 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.579
 avoid it but admit that 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.750
 these similarities are troubling as 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.799
 if there was a winning recipe in this 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.220
 concerning the composition of a 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.780
 plot 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.709
 Well, if it's all right, you said that I 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.060
 I will be happy to make a 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.109
 other video I will go into detail 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.519
 as daddy in mom for the 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.660
 English speakers so go take a shot 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.280
 dramatic to and for 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.930
 Anglophobes like and share this 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.400
 video on facebook or even better come 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.870
 subscribe to my youtube channel in the east 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.280
 and at + 84 and I tell you next time 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.280
 for a new episode of the ciao bioscope
