hey guys let me show you a little way to
add<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.370> bit<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:02.550> texture<00:00:02.790> into<00:00:03.090> your<00:00:03.179> hair<00:00:03.389> it's

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.630 
add a bit of texture into your hair it's
not<00:00:04.080> very<00:00:04.380> hard<00:00:04.560> it's<00:00:04.770> really<00:00:04.920> simple<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:05.549> I

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
not very hard it's really simple and I

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.380 
not very hard it's really simple and I
do<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:05.850> quite<00:00:05.940> often

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
do it quite often

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.780 
do it quite often
it<00:00:07.080> just<00:00:07.290> takes<00:00:07.680> about<00:00:07.799> five<00:00:08.040> minutes<00:00:08.340> anyway

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
it just takes about five minutes anyway

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.770 
it just takes about five minutes anyway
so<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.240> use<00:00:09.480> these<00:00:09.690> which<00:00:09.840> are<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.190> cloud9

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
so I use these which are the cloud9

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.030 
so I use these which are the cloud9
straighteners<00:00:12.780> with<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> wide<00:00:13.380> plates<00:00:13.740> I

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
straighteners with the wide plates I

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.499 
straighteners with the wide plates I
like<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.460> wide<00:00:14.610> plate<00:00:14.880> well<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.210> peculiar

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
like the wide plate well it's peculiar

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.970 
like the wide plate well it's peculiar
because<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.900> takes<00:00:16.049> less<00:00:16.260> time<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.500> do<00:00:16.680> my<00:00:16.830> hair

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
because it takes less time to do my hair

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.250 
because it takes less time to do my hair
because<00:00:17.550> I'm<00:00:17.699> lazy<00:00:17.970> but<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.900> can<00:00:19.020> use<00:00:19.140> like

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
because I'm lazy but you can use like

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.990 
because I'm lazy but you can use like
ghd's<00:00:19.710> all<00:00:19.949> those<00:00:20.100> normal<00:00:20.279> straightness<00:00:20.789> and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
ghd's all those normal straightness and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.090 
ghd's all those normal straightness and
I<00:00:21.539> turn<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.080> on<00:00:22.140> already<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.650> I'm<00:00:22.769> gonna<00:00:22.980> get

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
I turn it on already so I'm gonna get

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.040 
I turn it on already so I'm gonna get
straight<00:00:23.279> into<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.670> what<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.390> tend<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
straight into it what I tend to do and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.630 
straight into it what I tend to do and
I'm<00:00:25.170> doing<00:00:25.350> my<00:00:25.500> hair<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.160> saw<00:00:26.310> grab

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
I'm doing my hair I just saw grab

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.990 
I'm doing my hair I just saw grab
sections<00:00:28.039> you<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.070> check<00:00:29.369> your<00:00:29.550> section<00:00:29.910> your

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
sections you can check your section your

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.380 
sections you can check your section your
hair<00:00:30.060> off<00:00:30.269> properly<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.619> am<00:00:32.180> don't<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
hair off properly but I am don't and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.139 
hair off properly but I am don't and
then<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:34.040> do<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.460> rotate<00:00:35.940> it

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
then you just do this like rotate it

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.650 
then you just do this like rotate it
backwards<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.840> forwards<00:00:37.399> to<00:00:38.399> add<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:39.450> this

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
backwards and forwards to add like this

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.170 
backwards and forwards to add like this
kind<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.960> shaping<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.950> don't<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.030> do

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
kind of shaping to it I don't like to do

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.680 
kind of shaping to it I don't like to do
it<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.450> too<00:00:42.750> much<00:00:43.219> precision<00:00:44.219> because<00:00:44.789> you

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
it with too much precision because you

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.910 
it with too much precision because you
know<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:46.079> meant<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.320> be<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.500> sort<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.860> like

California mary-kate Olsen is a very

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.770 
California mary-kate Olsen is a very
obvious<00:01:01.770> sort<00:01:02.039> didn't<00:01:02.340> think<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:03.629> do

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
obvious sort didn't think of we do

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.600 
obvious sort didn't think of we do
doesn't<00:01:04.049> rotate<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:05.070> could<00:01:06.320> like<00:01:07.320> say<00:01:07.650> it's

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
doesn't rotate that could like say it's

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.490 
doesn't rotate that could like say it's
so<00:01:08.850> simple<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.420> especially<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:10.049> these<00:01:10.170> wide

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
so simple and especially with these wide

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.520 
so simple and especially with these wide
plates<00:01:10.890> purely<00:01:11.430> because<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.670> takes<00:01:12.140> no<00:01:13.140> time

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
plates purely because it takes no time

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.800 
plates purely because it takes no time
at<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.220> said<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.390> section<00:01:15.689> your<00:01:15.780> hair

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
at all I said you can section your hair

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.999 
at all I said you can section your hair
off<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.200> want<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:17.090> don't<00:01:18.090> tend<00:01:18.659> to

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
off if you want to I don't tend to

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.210 
off if you want to I don't tend to
because<00:01:20.009> I'm<00:01:20.250> lazy

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
because I'm lazy

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.190 
because I'm lazy
yeah<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.939> sort<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.180> left<00:01:24.450> with<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.930> which

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
yeah so you sort of left with this which

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.890 
yeah so you sort of left with this which
is<00:01:25.490> like<00:01:26.490> compared<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.119> side<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.630> looks<00:01:27.659> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
is like compared to this side it looks a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.120 
is like compared to this side it looks a
lot<00:01:28.080> more<00:01:28.790> texturized<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> lot<00:01:30.360> more

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
lot more texturized and a lot more

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.190 
lot more texturized and a lot more
weight<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> same<00:01:33.390> thing<00:01:33.630> it's

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
weight just do the same thing it's

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.660 
weight just do the same thing it's
really<00:01:34.380> hard<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.860> explain<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.460> just

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
really hard to explain because we just

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.760 
really hard to explain because we just
pull<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.939> out<00:01:36.170> push<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.320> down<00:01:37.939> pull<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:38.970> out

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
pull it out push it down pull it out

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.120 
pull it out push it down pull it out
push<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.799> down<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:42.229> learnt<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.350> technique<00:01:43.860> off

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
push it down I learnt this technique off

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.980 
push it down I learnt this technique off
when<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.850> first<00:01:45.060> got<00:01:45.210> my<00:01:45.329> first<00:01:45.509> other<00:01:45.750> pair<00:01:45.960> of

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
when I first got my first other pair of

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.010 
when I first got my first other pair of
ghd's<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.310> styling<00:01:47.820> video<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.509> there's

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
ghd's in the styling video and there's

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.499 
ghd's in the styling video and there's
like<00:01:49.170> wave<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.520> use<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> same

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
like wave one I just use the same

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.789 
like wave one I just use the same

OSIS dust it hot remember I mentioned
this<00:03:42.510> before<00:03:42.660> but<00:03:43.080> it's<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:43.290> sort<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.739> like<00:03:43.799> a

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
this before but it's just sort of like a

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.320 
this before but it's just sort of like a
powder<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.610> kind<00:03:44.820> of<00:03:44.850> put<00:03:45.090> in<00:03:45.209> your

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
powder that you kind of put in your

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.830 
powder that you kind of put in your
roots<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.780> then<00:03:45.959> rub<00:03:46.200> your<00:03:46.380> hair<00:03:47.480> so<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.660> just

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
roots and then rub your hair so you just

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.780 
roots and then rub your hair so you just
apply<00:03:48.989> like<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:51.000> feels<00:03:51.269> absolute<00:03:52.080> horrible

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
apply like so it feels absolute horrible

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.970 
apply like so it feels absolute horrible
but<00:03:53.790> it's<00:03:54.360> amazing<00:03:55.170> at<00:03:55.440> getting<00:03:56.690> volume<00:03:57.980> that

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
but it's amazing at getting volume that

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.949 
but it's amazing at getting volume that
lasts

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.449 

it<00:04:02.959> does<00:04:03.110> it<00:04:03.379> does<00:04:03.409> give<00:04:03.769> a<00:04:03.799> lot<00:04:03.980> of<00:04:04.010> build-up

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
it does it does give a lot of build-up

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.559 
it does it does give a lot of build-up
so<00:04:04.489> you<00:04:04.700> really<00:04:05.030> have<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.299> use<00:04:05.420> like<00:04:05.510> a

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
so you really have to use like a

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.600 
so you really have to use like a
clarifying<00:04:06.760> shampoo<00:04:07.760> when<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:09.310> wash<00:04:10.310> it<00:04:10.340> out

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
clarifying shampoo when you wash it out

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.759 
clarifying shampoo when you wash it out
so<00:04:11.239> that<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:12.049> then<00:04:12.140> you<00:04:12.260> can<00:04:12.379> just<00:04:12.500> sort<00:04:12.739> of

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
so that and then you can just sort of

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.189 
so that and then you can just sort of
very<00:04:13.730> little<00:04:14.209> bit<00:04:14.329> more<00:04:14.510> add<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.780> bit<00:04:15.049> more

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199
