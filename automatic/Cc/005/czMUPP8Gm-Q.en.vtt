football game they get 45 minutes in the
classroom<00:03:50.879> learning<00:03:51.329> French<00:03:51.810> but<00:03:52.140> with

classroom learning French but with

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.650 
classroom learning French but with
football<00:03:52.680> resources<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.579> then<00:03:54.030> they<00:03:54.120> have<00:03:54.269> 45

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
football resources and then they have 45

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.470 
football resources and then they have 45
minutes<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:55.140> football<00:03:55.650> coaching<00:03:56.329> but<00:03:57.329> with

minutes of football coaching but with

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.030 
minutes of football coaching but with
the<00:03:57.599> instructions<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.319> coach<00:03:58.560> all<00:03:58.829> done

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
the instructions of the coach all done

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.940 
the instructions of the coach all done
in<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.670> language<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.269> French<00:04:00.840> Spanish<00:04:01.530> German

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
in the language so French Spanish German

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.089 
in the language so French Spanish German
and<00:04:02.640> you<00:04:03.569> think<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:03.870> combination<00:04:04.200> of<00:04:04.620> French

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
and you think that combination of French

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.270 
and you think that combination of French
and<00:04:05.370> football<00:04:06.000> helps<00:04:06.329> them<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.569> excel<00:04:06.930> in<00:04:06.959> both

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
and football helps them to excel in both

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.979 
and football helps them to excel in both
yeah<00:04:08.280> definitely<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.849> think<00:04:08.989> learning

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
yeah definitely I think learning

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.800 
yeah definitely I think learning
languages<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:11.069> well<00:04:11.549> it's<00:04:11.790> quite<00:04:12.329> hard<00:04:12.659> to

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
languages and well it's quite hard to

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.170 
languages and well it's quite hard to
motivate<00:04:13.079> and<00:04:13.709> especially<00:04:14.250> secondary<00:04:14.819> school

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
motivate and especially secondary school

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.810 
motivate and especially secondary school
children<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.199> to<00:04:16.859> learn<00:04:17.130> languages<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:17.760> I

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
children and to learn languages and I

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.909 
children and to learn languages and I
think<00:04:18.030> having<00:04:18.180> football<00:04:18.690> as<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.870> motivation<00:04:19.709> is

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
think having football as a motivation is

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.390 
think having football as a motivation is
is<00:04:20.700> key<00:04:21.380> Marilyn<00:04:22.380> how<00:04:22.590> important<00:04:23.099> you<00:04:23.160> think

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
is key Marilyn how important you think

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.339 
is key Marilyn how important you think
it<00:04:23.520> is<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.789> get<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:23.940> foundation<00:04:24.660> in<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.900> second

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
it is to get a foundation in a second

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.710 
it is to get a foundation in a second
language<00:04:25.440> at<00:04:26.039> an<00:04:26.220> early<00:04:26.460> age<00:04:26.490> well<00:04:27.300> at<00:04:27.389> an

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
language at an early age well at an

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.440
