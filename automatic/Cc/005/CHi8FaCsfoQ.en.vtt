00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
app and open it up and then select

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.770 
app and open it up and then select
camera<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.219> then<00:01:59.430> snap<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.880> picture<00:02:00.360> from

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
camera and then snap a picture from

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.810 
camera and then snap a picture from
above<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.469> can<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> nice<00:02:02.040> angle<00:02:02.399> and

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.589 

so<00:02:10.009> it's<00:02:10.160> an<00:02:10.250> easy<00:02:10.399> three-step<00:02:11.000> process<00:02:11.180> that

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
so it's an easy three-step process that

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.120 
so it's an easy three-step process that
begins<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:11.989> it's<00:02:12.110> lifting<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.770> shade<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.010> the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
begins so it's lifting the shade of the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.220 
begins so it's lifting the shade of the
lips<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.910> can<00:02:14.030> also<00:02:14.209> just<00:02:14.510> zoom<00:02:14.750> them<00:02:14.930> in<00:02:15.050> so

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
lips you can also just zoom them in so

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.110 
lips you can also just zoom them in so
you<00:02:15.319> can<00:02:15.410> have<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.620> better<00:02:15.890> visual<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.000> can

select the color a lot better and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.979 
select the color a lot better and

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
by the app because that's the whole

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.760 
by the app because that's the whole
purpose<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.870> steel<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.260> lookup<00:04:23.590> it

wanted to feature the products to see if

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.670 
wanted to feature the products to see if
I<00:04:28.030> can<00:04:28.210> really<00:04:28.570> steal<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.050> looks<00:04:29.290> with<00:04:29.590> the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
I can really steal the looks with the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.100 
I can really steal the looks with the
products<00:04:30.070> that<00:04:30.250> were<00:04:30.340> recommended<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:31.840> next

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
products that were recommended the next

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.380 
products that were recommended the next
step<00:04:32.350> is<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.860> black<00:04:33.100> eyeliner<00:04:33.730> and<00:04:34.150> this<00:04:34.270> is

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
step is the black eyeliner and this is

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.450 
step is the black eyeliner and this is
going<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:34.630> go<00:04:34.750> on<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.020> outer<00:04:35.320> edge<00:04:35.710> of<00:04:35.950> my<00:04:36.160> top

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
going to go on the outer edge of my top

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.930 
going to go on the outer edge of my top
lash<00:04:36.970> line<00:04:37.080> now<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.560> did<00:04:39.040> end<00:04:39.250> up<00:04:39.370> changing<00:04:39.640> that

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
lash line now I did end up changing that

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.790 
lash line now I did end up changing that
just<00:04:40.240> because<00:04:40.630> it<00:04:40.900> looks<00:04:41.110> a<00:04:41.200> lot<00:04:41.350> better<00:04:41.560> when

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
just because it looks a lot better when

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.650 
just because it looks a lot better when
you<00:04:41.920> follow<00:04:42.160> it<00:04:42.340> all<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.610> way<00:04:42.970> through<00:04:43.390> and

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
you follow it all the way through and

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.200 
you follow it all the way through and
now<00:04:44.110> for<00:04:44.170> my<00:04:44.440> lips<00:04:44.710> I'm<00:04:44.860> applying<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.700> lipstick
