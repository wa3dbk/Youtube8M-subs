besides<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.149> fact<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.420> they<00:02:00.630> are<00:02:00.689> very

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
besides the fact that they are very

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.359 
besides the fact that they are very
posable<00:02:01.680> very<00:02:02.250> posable<00:02:02.689> let's<00:02:03.689> see<00:02:03.810> they<00:02:03.960> have

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
posable very posable let's see they have

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.690 
posable very posable let's see they have
ball<00:02:05.369> joint<00:02:05.670> head<00:02:06.979> ball<00:02:07.979> joint<00:02:08.220> shoulders

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
ball joint head ball joint shoulders

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.790 
ball joint head ball joint shoulders
which<00:02:08.819> depending<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.450> shoulder<00:02:09.840> pads<00:02:10.050> it

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
which depending on the shoulder pads it

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.180 
which depending on the shoulder pads it
might<00:02:11.220> make<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.550> little<00:02:11.670> more<00:02:11.849> difficult<00:02:12.360> to

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
might make it a little more difficult to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.710 
might make it a little more difficult to
move<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.520> arms<00:02:13.730> kind<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:13.970> started<00:02:14.300> in<00:02:14.390> Johnson

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
move the arms kind of started in Johnson

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.180 
move the arms kind of started in Johnson
to<00:02:14.810> them<00:02:14.960> you<00:02:15.080> got<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.260> blue<00:02:15.410> CQB<00:02:15.830> here<00:02:16.040> who

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
to them you got the blue CQB here who

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.090 
to them you got the blue CQB here who
does<00:02:16.430> get<00:02:16.580> more<00:02:16.730> motion<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.800> they<00:02:18.950> also

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
does get more motion and they also

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.690 
does get more motion and they also
whoops<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.610> what<00:02:20.450> cattle<00:02:20.870> off<00:02:21.340> they<00:02:22.340> also<00:02:22.520> have

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
whoops is what cattle off they also have

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.810 
whoops is what cattle off they also have
articulation<00:02:23.240> at<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.560> elbow<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:25.550> then<00:02:25.670> I

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
articulation at the elbow and then I

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.280 
articulation at the elbow and then I
guess<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.090> could<00:02:26.240> say<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.660> hand<00:02:26.930> has

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
guess you could say that the hand has

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.630 
guess you could say that the hand has
articulation<00:02:27.920> but<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.070> hands<00:02:28.250> are<00:02:28.370> usually

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
articulation but the hands are usually

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.460 
articulation but the hands are usually
detachable<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:29.630> yes<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.590> no<00:02:32.470> weights

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
detachable so yes and no weights

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.750 
detachable so yes and no weights
articulation<00:02:34.160> on<00:02:34.280> some<00:02:34.460> other<00:02:34.610> figures

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
articulation on some other figures

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.200 
articulation on some other figures
depending<00:02:35.210> on<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.360> armor<00:02:35.720> they<00:02:36.260> have<00:02:37.210> hip

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
depending on the armor they have hip

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.260 
depending on the armor they have hip
articulation<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:39.200> then<00:02:39.920> knee<00:02:40.100> articulation

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
articulation and then knee articulation

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.730 
articulation and then knee articulation
so<00:02:41.270> they<00:02:41.390> have<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.780> couple<00:02:42.050> of<00:02:42.110> points<00:02:42.380> they<00:02:42.590> got

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
so they have a couple of points they got

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.540 
so they have a couple of points they got
all<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:44.440> basic<00:02:45.440> needs<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:46.250> they're

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
all the the the basic needs and they're

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.920 
all the the the basic needs and they're
pretty<00:02:46.730> cool<00:02:46.880> little<00:02:47.000> guys<00:02:47.240> especially<00:02:47.600> for

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
pretty cool little guys especially for

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.510 
pretty cool little guys especially for
the<00:02:47.990> price<00:02:48.140> are<00:02:48.410> very<00:02:48.590> cheap<00:02:48.860> comparatively

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
the price are very cheap comparatively

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.580 
the price are very cheap comparatively
the<00:02:49.910> only<00:02:50.120> downside<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:50.810> really<00:02:51.200> see<00:02:51.410> to

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
the only downside that I really see to

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.200 
the only downside that I really see to
them<00:02:51.740> is<00:02:51.920> that<00:02:52.100> sometimes<00:02:52.520> their<00:02:52.700> parts<00:02:53.000> fall

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
them is that sometimes their parts fall

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.690 
them is that sometimes their parts fall
off<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.660> these<00:02:54.290> figures<00:02:54.530> are<00:02:54.770> made<00:02:54.920> for<00:02:55.250> eight

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
off and these figures are made for eight

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.760 
off and these figures are made for eight
and<00:02:56.000> up<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.480> just<00:02:56.840> would<00:02:56.990> be<00:02:57.020> great<00:02:57.350> if<00:02:57.560> maybe

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
and up and just would be great if maybe

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.800 
and up and just would be great if maybe
they<00:02:57.950> didn't<00:02:58.160> always<00:02:58.250> fall<00:02:58.550> off<00:02:58.730> maybe<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.270> just

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
they didn't always fall off maybe I just

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.900 
they didn't always fall off maybe I just
got<00:02:59.990> like<00:03:00.200> sergeant<00:03:00.560> Johnson<00:03:00.920> his<00:03:01.370> right<00:03:01.670> boot

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
got like sergeant Johnson his right boot

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.580 
got like sergeant Johnson his right boot
really<00:03:02.300> likes<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.600> come<00:03:02.780> off<00:03:02.900> sometimes<00:03:03.080> and

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
really likes to come off sometimes and

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.320 
really likes to come off sometimes and
like<00:03:04.070> right<00:03:04.250> now<00:03:04.340> it's<00:03:04.520> on<00:03:04.610> fine<00:03:04.880> but<00:03:05.210> then

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
like right now it's on fine but then

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.880 
like right now it's on fine but then
later<00:03:05.450> I'll<00:03:05.900> be<00:03:06.050> handling<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.680> I'll<00:03:06.740> fall

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
later I'll be handling it and I'll fall

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.970 
later I'll be handling it and I'll fall
out<00:03:07.070> so<00:03:07.250> they're<00:03:08.240> definitely<00:03:08.450> not<00:03:08.690> figures<00:03:09.410> to

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
out so they're definitely not figures to

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.590 
out so they're definitely not figures to
really<00:03:10.220> be<00:03:10.340> handled<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.820> whole<00:03:11.060> lot<00:03:11.270> they're

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
really be handled a whole lot they're

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.030 
really be handled a whole lot they're
they're<00:03:11.870> definitely<00:03:12.350> more<00:03:12.620> on<00:03:12.920> the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
they're definitely more on the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.890 
they're definitely more on the
collectable<00:03:13.520> side<00:03:13.700> I'd<00:03:13.880> say<00:03:14.120> but<00:03:14.750> they<00:03:14.870> are

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
collectable side I'd say but they are

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.240 
collectable side I'd say but they are
still<00:03:15.200> pretty<00:03:15.380> cool<00:03:15.590> that's<00:03:15.770> Toys<00:03:16.070> R<00:03:16.130> Us

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
still pretty cool that's Toys R Us

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.550 
still pretty cool that's Toys R Us
exclusives<00:03:16.850> I<00:03:17.000> think<00:03:17.209> they're<00:03:17.570> pretty<00:03:17.720> worth

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
exclusives I think they're pretty worth

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.070 
exclusives I think they're pretty worth
picking<00:03:18.830> up<00:03:19.130> overall<00:03:19.610> I'd<00:03:19.760> probably<00:03:19.940> give<00:03:20.209> up

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
picking up overall I'd probably give up

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.810 
picking up overall I'd probably give up
probably<00:03:21.380> I<00:03:21.620> would<00:03:21.890> give<00:03:22.070> these<00:03:22.220> guys<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.459> five

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
probably I would give these guys a five

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.630 
probably I would give these guys a five
out<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.000> five<00:03:23.890> besides<00:03:24.890> for<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.220> fact<00:03:25.550> that

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
out of five besides for the fact that

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.949 
out of five besides for the fact that
