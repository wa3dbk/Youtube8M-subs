 They would be super long and as you already 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.940
 I said earlier without buying anything or 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.579
 put false eyelashes because you wear 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.800
 that suddenly, you do not want to put on 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.920
 the eyelashes or like you're not one of those 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.920
 that bring you fake things in your face 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.509
 I 'm going to show you this trick 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.090
 incredible and with things that I imagine that 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.670
 you must have in your set of 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.130
 makeup that we are going to occupy we are going to 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.740
 occupy a single for tabs 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.740
 2the mascara and a subtracter of eyelashes 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.630
 then with the mascara that you create that you 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.930
 It gives very little thickness and is the one that we are going to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.930
 occupy 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.429
 and then with the tab reviews 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.429
 we will make our tab 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.180
 then we will take our second mascara 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.630
 and we will put another layer of mask 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.630
 tabs 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.830

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.390

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.729
