00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.749
 instructions 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.839
 So let's get down to business 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:01:01.940
 the already brilliant code just to give a 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:05.190
 but I did not even call her 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.040
 That emotion that opens a 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.540
 box of nokia galera to every box of one 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.220
 that the picture is a 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.900
 mother's queue emotion 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.780
 this device is what it seems to me 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.010
 be a very successful cell phone in the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.300
 because I think of a beautiful 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.400
 so it only seems that they arrive in the amazon 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.440
 I buy I only buy the ones I sight 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.110
 that the push if she is going to sell to damn 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.190
 It's very beautiful, it 's very flashy. 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.180
 so here the headphones what you see in it a 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.650
 partner 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:42.950
 that same phone the lumia 520 is a phone 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:46.010

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.650
 we will see here the power 1,200 million 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.880
 foot 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:05.750
 the battery nokia instruction manuals 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.459
 asha 503 from sim 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.950
 no one ever uses this manual 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.890
 I think that nokia could save not 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.150
 send the manual and make a 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.150
 value of the use of the devices 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:27.190

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.150
 only that the design differed galera to 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.290
 nokia sends well even in handsets 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.019
 low cost 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.470

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:56.489

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.489
 from top to bottom 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.389

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.349

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:43.669
 key that is not even considered a 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:49.370
 your 5-megapixel camera with 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:53.169
 flash led is an excellent footprint 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.000
 3 inch screen english portuguese 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.949
 Continue 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.560
 I already had a break in the unit on 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.539

 presenting some basic functions right 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:56.210
 there is the design of the device 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.990
 of course it has to disappear as a 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.240
 nokia one who thinks 501 is what i said 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.669

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.590
 whatsapp is released yet this one already 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:08.180

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.190

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.599
 in the app store here for you 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:17.720

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:20.599
 60 days I think not here the toast 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:24.949
 I will not go into detail the fm radio and 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:26.449
 rock to music the device has 13 genÃ© tem 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.159
 a control here also has a central 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:31.759
 notifications 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:33.680
 you control kyoei fire everything else and 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:38.930
 Let's go in settings here. 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:43.380
 the device upgrade module is the 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:46.250
 directly from the device itself. 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.250
 using wifi 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.100
 so people basically this is not the 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.770
 It's just a box and it 's not boxing. 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.840
 I'll do the review this week 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.480
 the device for those who are 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.850
 Thinking about buying one and knowing more about it 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.500

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.500
