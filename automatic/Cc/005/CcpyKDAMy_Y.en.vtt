this extended range in infrared
capturing<00:01:01.250> ability<00:01:01.790> I<00:01:02.030> think<00:01:02.510> is<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:02.629> huge

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
capturing ability I think is a huge

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.140 
capturing ability I think is a huge
reason<00:01:03.229> why<00:01:03.409> there's<00:01:03.739> a<00:01:03.799> lot<00:01:04.100> of<00:01:04.150> resurgence

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
reason why there's a lot of resurgence

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.539 
reason why there's a lot of resurgence
in<00:01:05.330> doing<00:01:05.930> infrared<00:01:06.439> photography<00:01:06.799> these<00:01:07.340> days

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
capturing at different wavelengths of

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.729 
capturing at different wavelengths of
the<00:02:10.489> infrared<00:02:11.090> spectrum<00:02:11.379> so<00:02:12.379> i<00:02:12.409> think<00:02:12.680> i

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
the infrared spectrum so i think i

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.760 
the infrared spectrum so i think i
really<00:02:12.950> like<00:02:13.190> color<00:02:13.610> number<00:02:14.000> two<00:02:14.269> as<00:02:14.569> a<00:02:14.599> start

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
really like color number two as a start

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.550 
really like color number two as a start
and<00:02:16.040> next<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:16.880> have<00:02:17.120> lightened<00:02:17.930> highlights

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
and next we have lightened highlights

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.310 
and next we have lightened highlights
this<00:02:19.340> controls<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.150> luminosity<00:02:20.960> of<00:02:20.990> the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
this controls the luminosity of the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.440 
this controls the luminosity of the
highlights<00:02:21.890> within<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.610> image<00:02:22.820> so<00:02:23.420> that

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
highlights within the image so that

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.540 
highlights within the image so that
defaults<00:02:24.050> at<00:02:24.140> thirty-three<00:02:24.890> percent<00:02:25.070> if<00:02:25.430> we

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
defaults at thirty-three percent if we

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.890 
defaults at thirty-three percent if we
move<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.120> right<00:02:26.300> we're<00:02:26.570> going<00:02:26.750> to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
move that to the right we're going to

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.260 
move that to the right we're going to
increase<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.100> we'll<00:02:28.910> watch<00:02:29.030> the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
increase that and we'll watch the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.660 
increase that and we'll watch the
highlights<00:02:29.540> increase<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.470> if<00:02:31.220> we<00:02:31.370> decrease

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
highlights increase and if we decrease

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.240 
highlights increase and if we decrease
that<00:02:31.910> well<00:02:32.390> will<00:02:32.930> decrease<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.800> highlights

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
that well will decrease the highlights

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.490 
that well will decrease the highlights
so<00:02:34.910> let's<00:02:35.360> bring<00:02:35.570> that<00:02:35.750> down<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:35.960> think<00:02:36.170> about

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
so let's bring that down I think about

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.490 
so let's bring that down I think about
seven<00:02:37.040> percent<00:02:37.220> looks<00:02:37.610> really<00:02:37.880> nice<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.500> next

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
seven percent looks really nice and next

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.710 
seven percent looks really nice and next
we<00:02:39.620> have<00:02:39.770> brightness<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.640> this<00:02:41.090> controls<00:02:41.540> the

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
we have brightness and this controls the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.990 
we have brightness and this controls the
overall<00:02:42.290> brightness<00:02:42.710> of<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.190> image<00:02:43.340> it

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
overall brightness of the image it

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.180 
overall brightness of the image it
defaults<00:02:44.420> at<00:02:44.540> forty<00:02:44.930> two<00:02:45.170> percent<00:02:45.440> if<00:02:45.890> we<00:02:46.040> move

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
defaults at forty two percent if we move

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.710 
defaults at forty two percent if we move
that<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.610> right<00:02:46.850> will<00:02:47.120> increase<00:02:47.540> the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
that to the right will increase the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.960 
that to the right will increase the
brightness<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.370> left<00:02:49.490> will<00:02:49.700> darken

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
brightness and to the left will darken

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.610 
brightness and to the left will darken
the<00:02:50.210> image<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.630> for<00:02:50.810> this<00:02:50.930> one<00:02:51.080> I<00:02:51.110> think<00:02:51.230> let's

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
the image and for this one I think let's

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.140 
the image and for this one I think let's
bump<00:02:51.830> that<00:02:52.040> up<00:02:52.070> a<00:02:52.250> little<00:02:52.370> bit<00:02:52.580> I<00:02:54.940> think<00:02:55.940> that's

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
bump that up a little bit I think that's

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.500 
bump that up a little bit I think that's
pretty<00:02:56.300> good<00:02:56.540> at<00:02:56.660> fifty-three<00:02:57.470> percent<00:02:57.650> and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
pretty good at fifty-three percent and

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.420 
pretty good at fifty-three percent and
next<00:02:59.510> is<00:02:59.630> contrast<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.590> defaults<00:03:01.010> at<00:03:01.130> twenty

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
next is contrast that defaults at twenty

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.190 
next is contrast that defaults at twenty
one<00:03:01.730> percent<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.660> controls<00:03:03.080> the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
one percent and this controls the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.820 
one percent and this controls the
overall<00:03:03.770> contrast<00:03:04.490> of<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.850> image<00:03:05.710> so<00:03:06.710> if<00:03:06.770> we

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
overall contrast of the image so if we

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.170 
overall contrast of the image so if we
move<00:03:07.010> that<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.340> right<00:03:07.430> will<00:03:07.610> increase<00:03:08.030> the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
move that to the right will increase the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.970 
move that to the right will increase the
contrast<00:03:08.420> if<00:03:08.990> we<00:03:09.110> move<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.530> left<00:03:09.590> will

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
contrast if we move it to the left will

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.830 
contrast if we move it to the left will
decrease<00:03:10.520> the<00:03:10.700> contrast<00:03:11.240> and<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.510> think<00:03:11.720> for

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
decrease the contrast and I think for

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.750 
decrease the contrast and I think for
this<00:03:11.990> one<00:03:12.140> won't<00:03:12.470> decrease<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.070> contrast<00:03:13.580> is

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
this one won't decrease the contrast is

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.880 
this one won't decrease the contrast is
to<00:03:13.880> touch<00:03:14.060> we'll<00:03:14.630> take<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:15.050> down<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.410> sixteen

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
to touch we'll take that down to sixteen

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.430 
to touch we'll take that down to sixteen
percent<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:16.940> we<00:03:17.060> have<00:03:17.240> a<00:03:17.270> lot<00:03:17.630> of<00:03:17.660> contrast<00:03:18.260> in

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
percent so we have a lot of contrast in

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.420 
percent so we have a lot of contrast in
the<00:03:18.470> image<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:18.860> let's<00:03:19.010> go<00:03:19.130> down<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.310> the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
the image so let's go down to the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.180 
the image so let's go down to the
histogram<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.360> we'll<00:03:20.720> just<00:03:20.900> hover<00:03:21.170> over<00:03:21.620> the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
histogram and we'll just hover over the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.740 
histogram and we'll just hover over the
button<00:03:22.459> that<00:03:22.580> will<00:03:22.610> show<00:03:23.000> us<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.209> clipped

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
button that will show us the clipped

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.380 
button that will show us the clipped
shadows<00:03:24.350> if<00:03:24.560> we<00:03:24.920> click<00:03:25.160> on<00:03:25.310> that<00:03:25.490> we<00:03:26.120> can<00:03:26.240> come

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
shadows if we click on that we can come

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.350 
shadows if we click on that we can come
up<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.780> shadows<00:03:27.170> protection<00:03:27.709> slider<00:03:28.010> and

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
up to the shadows protection slider and

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.000 
up to the shadows protection slider and
move<00:03:29.360> that<00:03:29.600> to<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.870> right<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.410> as<00:03:30.560> we<00:03:30.709> remove

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
move that to the right and as we remove

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.070 
move that to the right and as we remove
the<00:03:31.040> red<00:03:31.400> we<00:03:31.640> remove<00:03:31.970> those<00:03:32.150> clipped<00:03:32.540> shadows

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
the red we remove those clipped shadows

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.199 
the red we remove those clipped shadows
so<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.070> think<00:03:34.130> we're<00:03:34.370> perfect<00:03:34.550> right<00:03:34.910> there<00:03:34.940> at

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
so I think we're perfect right there at

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.510 
so I think we're perfect right there at
thirty<00:03:35.540> two<00:03:35.840> percent<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:37.040> let's<00:03:37.160> check<00:03:37.340> the

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
thirty two percent so let's check the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.100 
thirty two percent so let's check the
highlights<00:03:38.030> if<00:03:38.390> we're<00:03:38.570> clipping<00:03:38.840> any

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
highlights if we're clipping any

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.720 
highlights if we're clipping any
highlights<00:03:39.320> we've<00:03:39.740> got<00:03:39.950> some<00:03:40.160> clipping<00:03:40.490> going

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
highlights we've got some clipping going

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.730 
highlights we've got some clipping going
on<00:03:40.850> so<00:03:41.090> we'll<00:03:41.240> click<00:03:41.480> on<00:03:41.660> that<00:03:41.870> keep<00:03:42.560> that

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
on so we'll click on that keep that

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.770 
on so we'll click on that keep that
green<00:03:42.980> so<00:03:43.160> we<00:03:43.250> can<00:03:43.400> show<00:03:43.580> it<00:03:43.730> then<00:03:44.480> come<00:03:44.690> over

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
green so we can show it then come over

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.110 
green so we can show it then come over
to<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.170> highlights<00:03:45.590> protection<00:03:46.160> slider<00:03:46.400> and

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
to the highlights protection slider and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.720 
to the highlights protection slider and
as<00:03:47.209> we<00:03:47.360> move<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:47.990> right<00:03:48.230> will<00:03:49.100> darken

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
as we move that to the right will darken

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.850 
as we move that to the right will darken
our<00:03:49.970> highlights<00:03:50.360> so<00:03:50.959> I<00:03:51.020> like<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.230> go<00:03:51.470> just

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
our highlights so I like to go just

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.340 
our highlights so I like to go just
enough<00:03:52.250> we<00:03:52.430> might<00:03:52.580> leave<00:03:52.790> just<00:03:53.120> a<00:03:53.330> little<00:03:53.360> bit

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
enough we might leave just a little bit

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.860 
enough we might leave just a little bit
of<00:03:54.530> green<00:03:54.950> because<00:03:55.520> they're<00:03:55.870> typically

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
of green because they're typically

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.130 
of green because they're typically
should<00:03:57.170> be<00:03:57.350> some<00:03:58.250> pure<00:03:58.700> white<00:03:59.000> so<00:03:59.600> I<00:03:59.630> like<00:03:59.930> that

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
should be some pure white so I like that

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.920 
should be some pure white so I like that
right<00:04:00.350> at<00:04:00.500> eighty<00:04:00.740> percent<00:04:01.600> so<00:04:02.600> we'll<00:04:02.720> go<00:04:02.810> back

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
right at eighty percent so we'll go back

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.199 
right at eighty percent so we'll go back
down<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.410> histogram<00:04:03.980> will<00:04:04.280> turn<00:04:04.520> off<00:04:04.760> the

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
down to the histogram will turn off the

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.650 
down to the histogram will turn off the
show<00:04:05.780> clip<00:04:06.050> highlights<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:07.330> now<00:04:08.330> let's<00:04:08.480> go<00:04:08.570> up

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
show clip highlights and now let's go up

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.850 
show clip highlights and now let's go up
to<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.840> top<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.260> we'll<00:04:09.380> click<00:04:09.620> on<00:04:09.770> the
