everything and we have a little bit of

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.480 
everything and we have a little bit of
choreo<00:01:13.940> left<00:01:14.180> in<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.510> squeezer<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:18.490> flow

choreo left in the squeezer and flow
regulators<00:01:20.030> are<00:01:20.180> in<00:01:20.270> both<00:01:20.450> of<00:01:20.600> these<00:01:20.690> this<00:01:20.930> one

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
regulators are in both of these this one

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.880 
regulators are in both of these this one
has<00:01:21.260> a<00:01:21.520> Garvey<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:22.610> it<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:24.380> I'll<00:01:24.470> just<00:01:24.650> put

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
has a Garvey in it and I'll just put

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.630 
has a Garvey in it and I'll just put
some<00:01:24.920> on<00:01:25.220> this<00:01:25.400> board<00:01:26.890> they're<00:01:27.890> both<00:01:28.310> very

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
some on this board they're both very

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.580 
some on this board they're both very
very<00:01:28.790> thin<00:01:29.150> inks<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:29.990> can<00:01:30.140> mix<00:01:30.320> them<00:01:30.440> with

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
very thin inks so you can mix them with

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.170 
very thin inks so you can mix them with
whatever<00:01:30.770> you<00:01:31.010> like<00:01:33.460> they're<00:01:34.460> more<00:01:35.150> base<00:01:35.420> inks

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
whatever you like they're more base inks

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.040 
whatever you like they're more base inks
so<00:01:38.180> you<00:01:38.270> might<00:01:38.420> want<00:01:38.570> to<00:01:38.600> mix<00:01:38.720> them<00:01:38.930> with

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
so you might want to mix them with

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.240 
so you might want to mix them with
something<00:01:39.230> else<00:01:39.470> that's<00:01:39.800> what<00:01:39.980> I<00:01:40.070> would

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
something else that's what I would

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.940 
something else that's what I would
suggest

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.010 

and<00:01:44.950> of<00:01:45.880> course<00:01:46.180> everybody<00:01:46.420> knows<00:01:46.690> about<00:01:46.810> the

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
and of course everybody knows about the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.380 
and of course everybody knows about the
curvy<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.680> White<00:01:48.250> Marsh<00:01:48.520> mix<00:01:48.880> it<00:01:49.060> which<00:01:49.210> they

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
curvy and White Marsh mix it which they

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.800 
curvy and White Marsh mix it which they
usually<00:01:49.540> use<00:01:49.780> violet<00:01:50.320> Garvey<00:01:50.650> but<00:01:51.369> I<00:01:51.810> I

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
usually use violet Garvey but I I

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.950 
usually use violet Garvey but I I
definitely<00:01:53.500> think<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.770> red<00:01:53.920> Garvey<00:01:54.310> is<00:01:54.960> much

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
definitely think the red Garvey is much

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.120 
definitely think the red Garvey is much
much<00:01:56.680> better<00:01:57.960> Ling<00:01:58.960> strip<00:01:59.320> straight<00:01:59.860> down<00:02:00.040> to

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
much better Ling strip straight down to

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.920 
much better Ling strip straight down to
the<00:02:00.220> floor<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.520> course<00:02:00.790> they<00:02:01.780> probably

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
the floor of course they probably

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.010 
the floor of course they probably
feeding<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.530> Sun<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.770> bit<00:02:03.009> like<00:02:03.909> most<00:02:04.479> inks<00:02:04.840> do

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
feeding the Sun a bit like most inks do

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.370 
feeding the Sun a bit like most inks do
the<00:02:05.200> hand<00:02:05.380> black<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.600> we<00:02:07.720> have<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:07.990> quarry<00:02:08.259> on

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
the hand black so we have the quarry on

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.620 
the hand black so we have the quarry on
the<00:02:08.470> left<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:08.800> Garvey<00:02:09.100> on<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.310> right<00:02:09.569> now<00:02:10.569> as

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
the red here it's a true red it looks a

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.650 
the red here it's a true red it looks a
little<00:02:30.489> bit<00:02:30.670> lighter<00:02:30.880> than<00:02:30.970> lighter

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
little bit lighter than lighter

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.790 
little bit lighter than lighter
blood-red<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.940> really<00:02:34.720> really<00:02:35.140> thin<00:02:35.590> ink

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
blood-red it is really really thin ink

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.220 
blood-red it is really really thin ink
so<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.760> would<00:02:37.000> definitely<00:02:37.480> suggest<00:02:37.540> mixing<00:02:37.989> it

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
so I would definitely suggest mixing it

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.370 
so I would definitely suggest mixing it
with<00:02:38.319> some<00:02:38.590> highly<00:02:38.890> pigmented<00:02:39.190> ink<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:40.380> it'll

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
with some highly pigmented ink and it'll

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.720 
with some highly pigmented ink and it'll
probably<00:02:41.500> look<00:02:41.800> amazing<00:02:42.220> I'm<00:02:42.400> thinking<00:02:42.670> about

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
probably look amazing I'm thinking about

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.340 
probably look amazing I'm thinking about

choreo link is really good probably for

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.220 
choreo link is really good probably for
mixing<00:03:15.820> maybe<00:03:16.269> even<00:03:16.540> better<00:03:16.720> than<00:03:16.810> Garvey

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
mixing maybe even better than Garvey

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.259

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:43.839 
recommend mixing those two since choreo
