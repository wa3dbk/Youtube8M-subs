 lenses that are 5 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.660

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.510
 very long preproduction to be able 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.580

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.650
 result is incredible 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.200
 we have a very nice visual movie 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.510
 a story that engages romance action 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.700
 suspense I think the elements so that 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.490
 they loved it was not my character the 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.270
 reader was called puppy 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.310
 he is a warrior taxi driver 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.280
 calm ambitious clearly but 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.470
 quite like good wave very well more 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.570
 well as quiet because the experience 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.670
 show mint is to work with friends 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.140
 it's a movie that says the same thing 17 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.280
 days and it's something that seemed to me 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.630
 impossible but 6 are 17 days at night 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.160
 much of the movie so 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.530
 we had to change every night 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.140
 for 17 days an experience note 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.760
 adapted to a note because they can be 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.620
 make fast low movies 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.470
 budget with good quality with good 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.410
 stories and it's a note to always do 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.760

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.860

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.700

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.700
 tell how you think 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.530
 I have the German here but do not want 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.209
 say nothing 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.940
 however I have a manuscript that 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.980
 can be the key to everything and then 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.620
 we have to wait for them to communicate 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.849
 pay attention to us 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.849
 hear you are smoking 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.210
 and this one that makes the network here so that 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.070
 let see if I can not speak watching 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.260
 not perfect German there are words that do not 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.410
 I understand then that this is a good 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.440
 motivation be very careful 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.780
 everything around me disappeared when 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:58.910
 they went on stage or on stage 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:58.910
 of the oasis and the mask of that boy 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.700
 the girl 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.970
 I need in the bathroom to read 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.790
 Well, what are you in the head 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.660

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.660

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.800

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.800

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:37.999

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.880

 the puppy finished to spend with me 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.210

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.430

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.770
 I found the puppy weights 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.770
 dice forever recorded 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.370
 you do not want to earn a clear ticket 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.759
 my children from these ports and you 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.759
