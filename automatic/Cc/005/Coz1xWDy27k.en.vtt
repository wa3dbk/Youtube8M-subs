00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
 some things to be better understood 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.660
 without confusion 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.999
 it can be said that basically there are two types of translation 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:10.289
 well that one 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.939
 more frequent it is more widespread than we could define biphasic 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:15.470
 and also on lost 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.740
 and another that we could define as monophasic than the electrowelded one 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.980
 crack iPhone 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.130
 let's see the drm 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.289
 the biphasic is that in which dentist enter an implant that is nothing else 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.069
 than a titanium screw 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:31.890
 and who talks to me 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.890
 cullen price opening size 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.270
 gingival ie sisco the gum inserts the screw and then wound suture 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.670
 and the plant is left submerged beneath it for a variable time, however 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.430
 always a few months 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.000
 rents increase osseointegration than in simple terms 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.390
 means that the live must stick to the bone 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.140
 it's just red d 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.790
 another small intervention to discover the plant 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.600
 insert the internal lucila single and sad digital abutment 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.510
 christ after which after the meeting the tooth is filled 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:10.970
 definitive 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.580
 summing up 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.720
 we have to have two surgeries 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.220
 one for inserting the screw and the other for re-opening the insertion 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.990
 of the stump 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.600
 sending this implantology is normally not immediate but reported 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.540
 that is, time is not put on the tooth, it is not put on immediately but it takes a few months 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.840
 that is the time of repentance of the plant 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.520
 the tunisia rambla 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.710
 ie between electrowelded immediate load 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.140
 differs for 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.500
 from that of making oneself understand that the intuition of the vine 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.600
 happens imagines gingival trust ie does not make wood does not open 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.729
 to see a painful as we said before masturbation 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.620
 slowly through headless list 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.910
 pole once the implants that differ from those described have been inserted 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.840
 first why 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.590
 they are all with peaches with me too 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.590
 pin that comes out of the gum on which 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.929
 built the web 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.239
 and these will be welded together with one speaks of titanium 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.749
 berlusconi charlie solidarity 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:22.589
 to make stable that it was indispensable conditions for a better 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.199
 integration 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:28.429
 in this way it is possible to immediately put in the temporary chriqui teeth 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:32.969
 liquidate the patient with a temporary organization 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.879
 immediate and this is what is called immediate load ie the 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.689
 patient immediately works his teeth even with the necessary precautions 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:45.379
 summing up this type of lighting system April 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.390
 the impression of plants 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.590
 trans gingiva ie without opening of the gingiva 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.470
 and the application of temporary teeth after welding them in the same 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.130
 sitting 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.720
 which means that we must not reopen the gum with telgate that we have seen 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.169
 let's see the pros and cons of the reader now 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.320
 regarding the insertion 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.310
 of implants 1 need for surgery with all 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.079
 post intervention consequences 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.609
 which bank works with most recent 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.689
 something that just from the minimum terms regarding the inclusion of 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:21.700
 plants in the 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.149
 electro 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:25.989
 2 is not needed 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.459
 the second reopening surgery for press bed 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.799
 siapton rutime the electrowelded immediate load that is not 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.040
 possible tests falsehood sabor minimum percentage 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:45.019
 4 it is said that the percentage of implant rooting is higher 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.389
 for the physical phase 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.439
 which however songwriter contest 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.689
 it is said that the management of the prosthesis is to make the teeth more beautiful either 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:58.409
 better for biphasic, but this too depends on many factors to take away 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.359
 professional capacity 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.540
 September antonello electrowelded and less expensive engineers than that of Farsi 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:09.129
 thank you because in general you cost installations if you have 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.689
 I need the professional's interventions on the chair 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.569
 having said that the study is practiced for him types of implantology that he applies 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:18.569
 the second decade
