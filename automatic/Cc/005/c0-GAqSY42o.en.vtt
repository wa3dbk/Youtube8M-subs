difference height wise obviously the

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.090 
difference height wise obviously the
tablet<00:01:15.150> here<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.390> quite<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> bit<00:01:15.750> smaller

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
tablet here it's quite a bit smaller

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.249 
tablet here it's quite a bit smaller
narrower<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.400> good<00:01:17.610> inch<00:01:17.850> narrower<00:01:18.420> makes

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
narrower it's good inch narrower makes

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.630 
narrower it's good inch narrower makes
it<00:01:19.380> easier<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.710> hold<00:01:19.890> one-handed<00:01:20.520> your

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
it easier to hold one-handed your

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.980 
it easier to hold one-handed your
fingers<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.090> really<00:01:21.270> wrap<00:01:21.420> around<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.869> you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
fingers can really wrap around and you

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.999 
fingers can really wrap around and you
can<00:01:22.140> still<00:01:22.259> even<00:01:22.380> use<00:01:22.530> your<00:01:22.590> thumb<00:01:22.890> to

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
can still even use your thumb to

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.609 
can still even use your thumb to
interact<00:01:23.340> where<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.450> Kindle<00:01:24.720> obviously<00:01:25.439> bit

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
interact where the Kindle obviously bit

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.649 
interact where the Kindle obviously bit
wider<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.280> 4:3<00:01:26.850> ratio<00:01:27.030> screen<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.540> mean

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
wider with the 4:3 ratio screen I mean

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.080 
wider with the 4:3 ratio screen I mean
they<00:01:27.869> both<00:01:28.049> have<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> same<00:01:28.470> 6-inch<00:01:29.280> size

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
they both have the same 6-inch size

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.969 
they both have the same 6-inch size
screen<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:30.780> with<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> ratio<00:01:31.590> difference

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
screen but with the ratio difference

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.080 
screen but with the ratio difference
there<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.250> quite<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.460> bit<00:01:32.610> different<00:01:32.640> so

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
there it's quite a bit different so

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.480 
there it's quite a bit different so
obviously<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.079> tablet<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.009> got<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> taller

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
obviously the tablet it's got a taller

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.039 
obviously the tablet it's got a taller
screen<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.090> narrower<00:01:36.450> screen<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:36.930> they're

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
screen and narrower screen but they're

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.160 
screen and narrower screen but they're
both<00:01:37.170> labeled<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:37.920> 6<00:01:38.400> inches<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.930> far<00:01:40.110> as

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
both labeled as 6 inches so as far as

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.020 
both labeled as 6 inches so as far as
resolution<00:01:40.650> goes<00:01:40.920> resolutions<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.700> little<00:01:41.939> bit

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
resolution goes resolutions a little bit

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.840 
resolution goes resolutions a little bit
better<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> tablet<00:01:42.810> yet<00:01:42.960> 252<00:01:43.829> dots<00:01:44.640> per

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
better on the tablet yet 252 dots per

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.870 
better on the tablet yet 252 dots per
inch<00:01:44.880> where<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.540> Kindle<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:46.979> got<00:01:47.100> 212

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
inch where the Kindle here it's got 212

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.569 
inch where the Kindle here it's got 212
the<00:01:48.180> paperwhite<00:01:49.049> does<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:50.130> let's<00:01:50.369> go<00:01:50.460> ahead

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
the paperwhite does so let's go ahead

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.219 
the paperwhite does so let's go ahead
and<00:01:50.880> talk<00:01:51.060> about<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.479> reading<00:01:51.810> features<00:01:52.020> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
and talk about the reading features a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.499 
and talk about the reading features a
little<00:01:52.560> bit<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.030> when<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.149> comes<00:01:54.360> to

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
little bit here so when it comes to

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.480 
little bit here so when it comes to
reading<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.439> Kindle<00:01:55.829> paperwhite<00:01:55.860> has<00:01:56.460> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
reading the Kindle paperwhite has a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.910 
reading the Kindle paperwhite has a
front<00:01:56.820> light<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.840> read<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> dark<00:01:58.619> and

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
front light so you read in the dark and

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.660 
front light so you read in the dark and
in<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.159> light

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
in the light

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.270 
in the light
obviously<00:02:00.540> with<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> tablet<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.950> has<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
obviously with the tablet it has the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.700 
obviously with the tablet it has the
backlight<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:04.020> quite<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.259> bit<00:02:04.439> brighter

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
backlight so it's quite a bit brighter

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.289 
backlight so it's quite a bit brighter
so<00:02:04.829> right<00:02:05.159> here<00:02:05.310> both<00:02:05.520> devices<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
so right here both devices have the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.240 
so right here both devices have the
brightness<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.110> guess<00:02:07.500> there's<00:02:07.680> one<00:02:07.829> off<00:02:08.039> on

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
brightness I guess there's one off on

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.249 
brightness I guess there's one off on
brightness<00:02:09.239> being<00:02:09.450> Mac's<00:02:09.690> there<00:02:09.869> but<00:02:10.050> now<00:02:10.170> we

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
brightness being Mac's there but now we

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.110 
brightness being Mac's there but now we
got<00:02:10.379> maximus<00:02:10.800> sitting<00:02:11.099> on<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.489> paperwhite<00:02:11.970> as

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
got maximus sitting on the paperwhite as

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.589 
got maximus sitting on the paperwhite as
you<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.330> see<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.629> lot

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
you can see it's a lot

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.050 
you can see it's a lot
more<00:02:14.470> subdued<00:02:14.950> it's<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.280> lot<00:02:15.400> easier<00:02:15.879> on<00:02:15.939> the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
more subdued it's a lot easier on the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.569 
more subdued it's a lot easier on the
eyes<00:02:16.180> as<00:02:16.599> far<00:02:16.810> as<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.200> lighting<00:02:17.500> goes<00:02:17.829> and<00:02:18.129> it

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
eyes as far as the lighting goes and it

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.960 
eyes as far as the lighting goes and it
definitely<00:02:19.060> has<00:02:19.209> more<00:02:19.569> of<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:20.019> range<00:02:20.379> as<00:02:20.860> far<00:02:21.790> as

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
definitely has more of a range as far as

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.550 
definitely has more of a range as far as
brightness<00:02:22.299> goes<00:02:22.629> to<00:02:22.840> we<00:02:23.019> got<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.170> swipe<00:02:23.379> down

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
brightness goes to we got a swipe down

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.020 
brightness goes to we got a swipe down
from<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.769> top<00:02:23.980> here<00:02:24.220> we<00:02:24.400> get<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.670> brightness

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
from the top here we get the brightness

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.520 
from the top here we get the brightness
sitting<00:02:25.299> on<00:02:25.390> this<00:02:25.569> one<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:25.959> let's<00:02:26.110> go<00:02:26.200> all<00:02:26.439> the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
sitting on this one so let's go all the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.479 
sitting on this one so let's go all the
way<00:02:26.560> minimum<00:02:27.069> on<00:02:27.220> both<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.489> these<00:02:27.579> now<00:02:29.489> so

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
way minimum on both of these now so

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.720 
way minimum on both of these now so
obviously<00:02:31.060> with<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.329> paperwhite<00:02:32.250> it's<00:02:33.250> just

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
obviously with the paperwhite it's just

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.729 
obviously with the paperwhite it's just
the<00:02:34.420> light<00:02:34.629> really<00:02:34.840> doesn't<00:02:35.140> even<00:02:35.260> show<00:02:35.530> right

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
the light really doesn't even show right

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.589 
the light really doesn't even show right
here<00:02:35.890> there's<00:02:36.190> enough<00:02:36.849> ambient<00:02:37.239> light<00:02:37.480> in<00:02:37.569> the

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
here there's enough ambient light in the

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.539 
here there's enough ambient light in the
room<00:02:37.659> but<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:38.440> camera<00:02:38.769> is<00:02:38.799> picking<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.190> up<00:02:39.280> but

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
room but the camera is picking it up but

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.430 
room but the camera is picking it up but
so<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.359> basically<00:02:40.569> what<00:02:40.720> you've<00:02:40.930> got<00:02:41.200> as

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
so this is basically what you've got as

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.429 
so this is basically what you've got as
far<00:02:42.250> as<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.579> lowest<00:02:42.879> setting<00:02:43.209> on<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.750> each

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
far as the lowest setting on the each

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.780 
far as the lowest setting on the each
device<00:02:44.859> here<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:45.220> it's<00:02:45.340> almost<00:02:45.489> it's

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
device here so it's almost it's

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.759 
device here so it's almost it's
virtually<00:02:46.150> off<00:02:46.299> on<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.659> paperwhite<00:02:47.049> when<00:02:47.680> you

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
virtually off on the paperwhite when you

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.589 
virtually off on the paperwhite when you
have<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:47.980> on<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.129> lowest<00:02:48.250> setting<00:02:48.549> so<00:02:49.390> the

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
have it on the lowest setting so the

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:50.819 
have it on the lowest setting so the
biggest<00:02:49.750> difference<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.379> the<00:02:50.530> screens

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
biggest difference in the screens

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.970 
biggest difference in the screens
obviously<00:02:51.519> with<00:02:51.700> ink<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.299> LCD<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.379> just<00:02:53.769> comes

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
obviously with ink and LCD is just comes

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.430 
obviously with ink and LCD is just comes
with<00:02:54.069> light<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.420> if<00:02:55.690> you're<00:02:55.900> like<00:02:56.079> in<00:02:56.230> bright

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
with light so if you're like in bright

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.920 
with light so if you're like in bright
light<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:57.220> highly<00:02:57.849> reflective<00:02:58.359> on<00:02:58.480> tablets

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
light it's highly reflective on tablets

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.869 
light it's highly reflective on tablets
or<00:02:59.409> as<00:02:59.560> Kindles<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.280> more<00:03:00.459> light<00:03:00.609> you<00:03:00.639> have

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
or as Kindles the more light you have

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.309 
or as Kindles the more light you have
this<00:03:01.150> basically<00:03:01.659> the<00:03:01.810> better<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.079> screen

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
this basically the better the screen

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.289 
this basically the better the screen
looks<00:03:02.590> so<00:03:02.799> with<00:03:03.040> Ian<00:03:03.340> Kindles<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:03.819> tablets

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
looks so with Ian Kindles so tablets

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.180 
looks so with Ian Kindles so tablets
obviously<00:03:05.139> turn<00:03:05.349> into<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.590> mirror<00:03:05.920> so<00:03:06.099> if

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
obviously turn into a mirror so if

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.069 
obviously turn into a mirror so if
you're<00:03:06.310> outside<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.819> becomes<00:03:07.329> really<00:03:07.629> hard<00:03:07.900> to

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
you're outside it becomes really hard to

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.960 
you're outside it becomes really hard to
actually<00:03:08.980> even<00:03:09.159> see<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.489> text<00:03:09.760> with<00:03:09.879> the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
actually even see the text with the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.309 
actually even see the text with the
maximum<00:03:10.359> brightness<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.870> when<00:03:11.230> you're

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
maximum brightness and when you're

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.750 
maximum brightness and when you're
outside<00:03:11.440> with<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.829> Kindle<00:03:12.129> you<00:03:12.400> actually

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
outside with the Kindle you actually

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.740 
outside with the Kindle you actually

the<00:04:46.360> reading<00:04:46.690> features<00:04:46.990> go<00:04:47.170> of<00:04:47.350> course<00:04:47.560> within

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
the reading features go of course within

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.400 
the reading features go of course within
a<00:04:48.160> tablet<00:04:48.970> you<00:04:49.090> got<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.420> different<00:04:50.140> colored

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
a tablet you got the different colored

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.650 
a tablet you got the different colored
highlights<00:04:50.860> so<00:04:51.100> you<00:04:51.160> do<00:04:51.340> get<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:52.060> option<00:04:52.450> for

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
highlights so you do get the option for

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.330 
highlights so you do get the option for
the<00:04:53.110> multicolored<00:04:53.710> highlights<00:04:54.040> and<00:04:54.220> that's

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
the multicolored highlights and that's

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.020 
the multicolored highlights and that's
not<00:04:54.430> something<00:04:54.610> you're<00:04:54.820> gonna<00:04:54.970> have

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
not something you're gonna have

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.750 
not something you're gonna have
obviously<00:04:55.480> on<00:04:55.630> an<00:04:55.720> inch<00:04:55.960> Kindle<00:04:56.550> so<00:04:57.550> when<00:04:57.670> it

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
obviously on an inch Kindle so when it

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.610 
obviously on an inch Kindle so when it
comes<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.000> font<00:04:58.240> choices<00:04:58.540> it's<00:04:59.140> very<00:04:59.320> similar

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
comes to font choices it's very similar

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.600 
comes to font choices it's very similar
between<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.980> two<00:05:00.010> I<00:05:00.130> mean<00:05:00.310> you've<00:05:00.430> got<00:05:00.520> the

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
between the two I mean you've got the

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.240 
between the two I mean you've got the
same<00:05:00.760> sort<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.150> line<00:05:01.750> spacing<00:05:02.530> margin<00:05:03.010> layouts

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
same sort of line spacing margin layouts

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.440 
same sort of line spacing margin layouts
Kindles<00:05:03.610> always<00:05:03.790> have<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.000> same<00:05:04.120> three

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
Kindles always have the same three

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.850 
Kindles always have the same three
settings<00:05:04.840> for<00:05:05.020> love<00:05:05.140> margins<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:05.680> line

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
settings for love margins and line

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.310 
settings for love margins and line
spacing<00:05:06.240> so<00:05:07.240> like<00:05:07.630> with<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:07.990> tablets

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
spacing so like with the tablets

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.810 
spacing so like with the tablets
obviously<00:05:08.650> you<00:05:08.710> get<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.950> different<00:05:09.280> options

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
obviously you get the different options

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.640 
obviously you get the different options
for<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.360> different<00:05:10.690> background<00:05:11.080> colors<00:05:11.410> so

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
for the different background colors so

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.110 
for the different background colors so
Kindle<00:05:12.220> e-readers<00:05:12.520> you<00:05:12.610> don't<00:05:12.790> have<00:05:12.940> the

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
Kindle e-readers you don't have the

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.330 
Kindle e-readers you don't have the
inverted<00:05:14.050> text<00:05:14.410> option<00:05:14.770> you<00:05:14.830> don't<00:05:14.950> have<00:05:15.130> the

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
inverted text option you don't have the

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.240 
inverted text option you don't have the
green<00:05:16.210> or<00:05:16.510> the<00:05:16.540> tan<00:05:17.080> colored<00:05:17.710> options<00:05:18.040> at<00:05:18.130> all

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
green or the tan colored options at all

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.130 
green or the tan colored options at all
so<00:05:18.490> with<00:05:18.970> the<00:05:19.060> color<00:05:19.270> you<00:05:19.360> get<00:05:19.750> that<00:05:19.870> option

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
so with the color you get that option

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.870 
so with the color you get that option
and<00:05:20.650> there's<00:05:20.830> a<00:05:20.920> couple<00:05:21.100> of<00:05:21.310> different<00:05:21.670> font

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
and there's a couple of different font

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.670 
and there's a couple of different font
choices<00:05:22.120> in<00:05:22.390> here<00:05:22.540> there's<00:05:22.720> not<00:05:22.870> a<00:05:23.110> whole<00:05:23.500> lot

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
choices in here there's not a whole lot

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.170 
choices in here there's not a whole lot
of<00:05:23.710> difference<00:05:24.070> between<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.550> fonts<00:05:24.850> between

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
of difference between the fonts between

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.490 
of difference between the fonts between
these<00:05:25.390> two<00:05:25.600> but<00:05:25.840> there's<00:05:26.020> a<00:05:26.110> couple<00:05:26.320> of

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
these two but there's a couple of

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.720 
these two but there's a couple of
different<00:05:26.800> choices<00:05:26.980> like<00:05:27.280> George's

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
different choices like George's

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.570 
different choices like George's
available<00:05:28.180> on<00:05:28.330> the<00:05:29.260> tablet<00:05:30.130> here<00:05:30.280> where<00:05:30.460> it's

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
available on the tablet here where it's

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.050 
available on the tablet here where it's
not<00:05:30.700> available<00:05:30.820> on<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:31.270> Kindle<00:05:32.700> but<00:05:33.700> the<00:05:33.850> font

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
not available on the Kindle but the font

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.900 
not available on the Kindle but the font
sizes<00:05:34.270> I<00:05:34.630> mean<00:05:35.380> you've<00:05:35.530> got<00:05:35.710> the<00:05:35.830> whole<00:05:35.980> gambit

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
sizes I mean you've got the whole gambit

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.580 
sizes I mean you've got the whole gambit
of<00:05:37.000> font<00:05:37.210> sizes<00:05:37.450> from<00:05:37.720> super<00:05:37.960> huge<00:05:38.170> super

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
of font sizes from super huge super

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.530 
of font sizes from super huge super
small<00:05:38.800> so<00:05:38.860> that's<00:05:39.700> basically<00:05:40.060> covered<00:05:40.420> on

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
small so that's basically covered on

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.750 
small so that's basically covered on
both<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:40.840> these

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.520 

so<00:05:45.760> both<00:05:46.240> devices<00:05:46.690> offer<00:05:46.840> landscape<00:05:47.350> mode

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
so both devices offer landscape mode

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.050 
so both devices offer landscape mode
obviously<00:05:47.680> with<00:05:48.040> the<00:05:48.100> tablet<00:05:48.460> you<00:05:48.520> just<00:05:48.790> flip

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
obviously with the tablet you just flip

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.760 
obviously with the tablet you just flip
it<00:05:49.150> over<00:05:49.270> and<00:05:49.420> it<00:05:49.720> automatically<00:05:50.320> goes<00:05:50.440> to

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
it over and it automatically goes to

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.230 
it over and it automatically goes to
landscape<00:05:51.040> mode<00:05:51.190> with<00:05:51.520> the<00:05:51.580> Kindle<00:05:51.790> e-readers

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
landscape mode with the Kindle e-readers

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.430 
landscape mode with the Kindle e-readers
they<00:05:52.330> don't<00:05:52.450> have<00:05:52.570> that<00:05:52.660> sensor<00:05:53.110> so<00:05:53.230> you<00:05:53.320> can

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
they don't have that sensor so you can

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.990 
they don't have that sensor so you can
just<00:05:53.590> go<00:05:53.740> in<00:05:53.860> here<00:05:54.100> and<00:05:54.340> hit<00:05:54.760> the<00:05:54.880> actual

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
just go in here and hit the actual

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.850 
just go in here and hit the actual
button<00:05:55.450> to<00:05:55.600> switch<00:05:55.870> over<00:05:56.290> to<00:05:56.320> landscape<00:05:56.710> mode

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
button to switch over to landscape mode

button to switch over to landscape mode
another<00:05:57.820> thing<00:05:58.060> that<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:58.450> Kindles<00:05:59.380> have<00:05:59.530> is

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
another thing that the Kindles have is

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.160 
another thing that the Kindles have is
vocabulary<00:06:00.670> builder<00:06:00.940> so<00:06:01.510> like<00:06:01.690> any<00:06:01.900> word<00:06:02.140> that

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
vocabulary builder so like any word that

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.630 
vocabulary builder so like any word that
you<00:06:02.440> highlight<00:06:02.830> and<00:06:03.010> look<00:06:03.130> up<00:06:03.280> the<00:06:03.460> dictionary

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
you highlight and look up the dictionary

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.910 
you highlight and look up the dictionary
adds<00:06:04.120> to<00:06:04.330> the<00:06:04.420> vocabulary<00:06:04.720> list<00:06:05.230> and<00:06:05.680> then<00:06:05.800> you

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
adds to the vocabulary list and then you

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.730 
adds to the vocabulary list and then you
can<00:06:06.330> study<00:06:07.330> these<00:06:07.600> words<00:06:07.840> and<00:06:08.170> then<00:06:08.320> Markham's

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
can study these words and then Markham's

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.980 
can study these words and then Markham's
master<00:06:09.100> delete<00:06:09.430> them<00:06:09.610> get<00:06:10.510> some<00:06:10.660> different

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
master delete them get some different

master delete them get some different
usage<00:06:11.800> ideas<00:06:12.190> form<00:06:12.400> as<00:06:12.520> well<00:06:12.670> where<00:06:12.910> it<00:06:12.940> was

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
usage ideas form as well where it was

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.300 
usage ideas form as well where it was
used<00:06:13.270> so<00:06:13.750> you<00:06:14.080> got<00:06:14.200> the<00:06:14.320> flashcards<00:06:14.920> here<00:06:15.070> for

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
used so you got the flashcards here for

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.490 
used so you got the flashcards here for
the<00:06:15.480> vocabulary<00:06:16.480> builder<00:06:17.110> so<00:06:17.260> that's<00:06:17.410> a

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
the vocabulary builder so that's a

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.320 
the vocabulary builder so that's a
feature<00:06:17.650> you<00:06:17.800> don't<00:06:18.100> have<00:06:18.340> on<00:06:18.580> the<00:06:18.850> tablets

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
feature you don't have on the tablets

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.420 
feature you don't have on the tablets
for<00:06:20.200> whatever<00:06:20.350> reason<00:06:20.800> they<00:06:20.890> never<00:06:21.040> I<00:06:21.160> do<00:06:21.250> that

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
for whatever reason they never I do that

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.770

the differences between these devices

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:37.420 
the differences between these devices

mostly the size difference of course
it's<00:07:37.879> kind<00:07:37.969> of<00:07:38.059> hard<00:07:38.210> to<00:07:38.240> believe<00:07:38.509> that<00:07:38.689> the

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:38.809 
it's kind of hard to believe that the

00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:40.420 
it's kind of hard to believe that the
tablets<00:07:39.199> actually<00:07:39.379> $20<00:07:39.979> cheaper<00:07:40.249> than<00:07:40.370> the

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:40.430 
tablets actually $20 cheaper than the

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.399 
tablets actually $20 cheaper than the
paperwhite<00:07:40.789> but<00:07:41.089> that's<00:07:41.870> just<00:07:42.020> sort<00:07:42.229> of<00:07:42.349> how

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:42.409 
paperwhite but that's just sort of how
