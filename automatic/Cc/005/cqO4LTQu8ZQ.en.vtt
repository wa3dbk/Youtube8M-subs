in<00:03:22.419> a<00:03:22.479> day<00:03:22.629> well<00:03:23.379> unfortunately<00:03:23.949> that's

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
in a day well unfortunately that's

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.789 
in a day well unfortunately that's
individualistic<00:03:25.359> notice<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.019> say<00:03:26.229> liquid<00:03:26.500> and

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
individualistic notice I say liquid and

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.339 
individualistic notice I say liquid and
not<00:03:26.889> water<00:03:27.159> the<00:03:27.669> reason<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.180> is<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:29.019> lot<00:03:29.229> of

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
not water the reason is is a lot of

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.189 
not water the reason is is a lot of
stuff<00:03:29.560> like<00:03:29.829> tea<00:03:30.189> or<00:03:30.549> juice<00:03:30.939> or<00:03:31.359> anything<00:03:31.930> like

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
stuff like tea or juice or anything like

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.080 
stuff like tea or juice or anything like
that<00:03:32.340> counts<00:03:33.340> towards<00:03:33.430> your<00:03:33.699> fluid<00:03:34.000> intake

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
that counts towards your fluid intake

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.689 
that counts towards your fluid intake
all<00:03:34.930> right<00:03:35.139> so<00:03:35.349> it's<00:03:35.680> not<00:03:35.769> just<00:03:35.859> water<00:03:36.489> you

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:36.699 
all right so it's not just water you

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.069 
all right so it's not just water you
have<00:03:36.849> to<00:03:36.879> be<00:03:37.060> drinking<00:03:37.419> you<00:03:37.540> can<00:03:37.689> count<00:03:37.900> those

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
have to be drinking you can count those

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.140 
have to be drinking you can count those
things<00:03:38.290> as<00:03:38.470> well<00:03:38.680> there<00:03:39.310> are<00:03:39.340> some<00:03:39.489> products

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
things as well there are some products

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.449 
things as well there are some products
out<00:03:40.269> there<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:40.540> are<00:03:41.019> more<00:03:41.349> water<00:03:41.979> neutral

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
out there that are more water neutral

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.550 
out there that are more water neutral
like<00:03:42.669> say<00:03:42.879> coffee<00:03:43.209> it's<00:03:43.900> as<00:03:44.079> much<00:03:44.229> of<00:03:44.409> a

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
like say coffee it's as much of a

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.879 
like say coffee it's as much of a
diuretic<00:03:44.859> as<00:03:45.459> it<00:03:46.030> is<00:03:46.449> a<00:03:46.750> hydrator<00:03:47.290> so<00:03:47.769> it's

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
diuretic as it is a hydrator so it's

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.890 
diuretic as it is a hydrator so it's
kind<00:03:48.040> of<00:03:48.069> a<00:03:48.189> net<00:03:48.370> neutral<00:03:48.759> drink<00:03:49.090> whereas<00:03:49.780> if

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
kind of a net neutral drink whereas if

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.780 
kind of a net neutral drink whereas if
you<00:03:49.989> take<00:03:50.199> something<00:03:50.379> like<00:03:50.500> beer<00:03:51.129> or<00:03:51.340> hard

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
you take something like beer or hard

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.270 
you take something like beer or hard
liquor<00:03:52.049> well<00:03:53.049> that's<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.379> water<00:03:53.620> negative<00:03:54.069> so

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
liquor well that's a water negative so

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.140 
liquor well that's a water negative so
what<00:03:54.489> you're<00:03:54.609> going<00:03:54.729> to<00:03:54.759> do<00:03:54.879> is<00:03:54.970> you're<00:03:55.060> going

how much water or broth or liquid

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.220 
how much water or broth or liquid
approximately<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.300> takes<00:04:43.510> in<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:43.720> day<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.930> get

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
approximately it takes in a day to get

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.620

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
then just drink that keep in mind stuff

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.850 
then just drink that keep in mind stuff
like<00:04:49.150> energy<00:04:49.510> drinks<00:04:49.870> like<00:04:50.200> I<00:04:50.350> drink<00:04:50.560> every

urine<00:04:53.500> color<00:04:53.740> so<00:04:54.130> it's<00:04:54.280> very<00:04:54.430> difficult<00:04:54.760> to

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
urine color so it's very difficult to

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.580 
urine color so it's very difficult to
determine<00:04:55.390> if<00:04:55.630> you're<00:04:55.960> adequately<00:04:56.290> hydrated

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
determine if you're adequately hydrated

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.040 
determine if you're adequately hydrated
with<00:04:57.160> all<00:04:57.190> those<00:04:57.520> food<00:04:57.760> colorings<00:04:58.240> in<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:58.540> so

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
with all those food colorings in it so

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.420 
with all those food colorings in it so
you<00:04:59.110> need<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.500> figure<00:04:59.590> out<00:04:59.770> how<00:05:00.010> much<00:05:00.130> water

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
you need to figure out how much water

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.160 
you need to figure out how much water
your<00:05:00.640> body<00:05:00.820> needs<00:05:01.030> in<00:05:01.180> a<00:05:01.240> day<00:05:01.450> before<00:05:02.080> you

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
your body needs in a day before you

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.140 
your body needs in a day before you
start<00:05:02.410> putting<00:05:02.770> all<00:05:02.860> those<00:05:03.010> chemicals<00:05:03.490> in<00:05:03.640> so

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
start putting all those chemicals in so

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.670 
start putting all those chemicals in so
maybe<00:05:04.270> take<00:05:04.510> a<00:05:04.540> day<00:05:04.660> or<00:05:04.930> two<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.110> just<00:05:05.440> figure

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
maybe take a day or two to just figure

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.750 
maybe take a day or two to just figure
that<00:05:05.890> out<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.160> then<00:05:06.280> go<00:05:06.430> back<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:06.610> your

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
that out and then go back to your

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.540 
that out and then go back to your

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550
