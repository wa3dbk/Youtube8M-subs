I<00:01:50.380> gather<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:52.370> quantum<00:01:52.880> axis<00:01:53.560> fast<00:01:54.560> in<00:01:54.920> steel

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
I gather the quantum axis fast in steel

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.860 
I gather the quantum axis fast in steel
ball<00:01:55.490> bend<00:01:55.760> you<00:01:55.910> have<00:01:56.120> this<00:01:56.240> thing<00:01:56.510> as<00:01:56.660> loose

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
ball bend you have this thing as loose

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.680 
ball bend you have this thing as loose
as<00:01:57.080> possible<00:01:57.160> and<00:01:58.160> this<00:01:58.520> damn<00:01:58.820> thing<00:01:59.240> will<00:01:59.450> not

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
as possible and this damn thing will not
