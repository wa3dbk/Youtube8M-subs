make a stained glass Sun catcher using

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.179 
make a stained glass Sun catcher using
the<00:00:18.539> copper<00:00:18.930> foil<00:00:19.170> method<00:00:20.060> in<00:00:21.060> fact<00:00:22.130> you'll<00:00:23.130> be

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
the copper foil method in fact you'll be

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.410 
the copper foil method in fact you'll be
making<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.910> Sun<00:00:24.269> catcher<00:00:25.160> to<00:00:26.160> start<00:00:26.460> off<00:00:26.670> I'm

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
making this Sun catcher to start off I'm

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.990 
making this Sun catcher to start off I'm
gonna<00:00:27.570> be<00:00:27.750> telling<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.529> about<00:00:28.710> various<00:00:29.670> types

gonna be telling you about various types

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.740 
gonna be telling you about various types
of<00:00:30.150> glass<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.840> tools<00:00:32.030> then<00:00:33.030> we'll<00:00:33.329> move<00:00:33.480> on

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
of glass and tools then we'll move on

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.590 
of glass and tools then we'll move on
how<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.079> properly<00:00:34.590> cut<00:00:35.010> glass<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.760> break<00:00:36.329> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
how to properly cut glass and break it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.900 
how to properly cut glass and break it
not<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.410> for<00:00:37.530> straight<00:00:37.829> lines<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.399> also<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
not just for straight lines but also the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.590 
not just for straight lines but also the
more<00:00:39.090> difficult<00:00:39.329> curves<00:00:41.090> will<00:00:42.090> grind<00:00:42.329> our

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
more difficult curves will grind our

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.139 
more difficult curves will grind our
glass<00:00:42.870> down<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.370> nice<00:00:44.670> smooth

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
glass down so that we have nice smooth

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.020 
glass down so that we have nice smooth
edges<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.809> foil<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.730> apply

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
edges and foil it so that we can apply

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.810 
edges and foil it so that we can apply
our<00:00:48.059> solder<00:00:48.920> once<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.129> solder<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.640> together

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
our solder once we solder it together

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.510 
our solder once we solder it together
we're<00:00:51.780> going<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.199> applying<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.800> patina<00:00:53.190> so

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
we're going to be applying a patina so

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.150 
we're going to be applying a patina so
that<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.820> achieve<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.270> rich<00:00:54.989> black<00:00:55.590> finish

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
that we achieve that rich black finish

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250 
that we achieve that rich black finish
on<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.969> solder<00:00:57.210> lines<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.960> people

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
on the solder lines that people

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.459 
on the solder lines that people
associate<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.160> stained<00:00:59.460> glass<00:01:00.469> finally

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
associate with stained glass finally

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.590 
associate with stained glass finally
we'll<00:01:01.710> frame<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.489> polish<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.449> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
we'll frame it and polish it so that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.080 
we'll frame it and polish it so that
it's<00:01:03.719> ready<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.320> display<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:05.100> your<00:01:05.159> home<00:01:05.850> or

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
but that can cause a serious problem for

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.250 
but that can cause a serious problem for
you<00:05:44.780> if<00:05:45.020> you<00:05:45.440> get<00:05:45.590> distracted<00:05:46.810> your<00:05:47.810> soldering
