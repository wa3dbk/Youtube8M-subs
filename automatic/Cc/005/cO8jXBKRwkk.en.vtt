00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.509
 today we are going to prepare some quesadillas 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.480
 with meat the first step is to make 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:25.390
 our dough to make tortillas 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.660
 we use three cups of maseca 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.789
 and a cup of flour to make the 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.589
 mix and form our most here the 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.379
 we have already ready this mix and also 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:38.170
 do not forget to add water and a 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.150
 little bit of salt and on this side we have 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.120
 and the ground beef that we put here 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.820
 with a little oil but remember that 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.219
 it also releases the meat a lot and fat 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.960
 Well here we have it already cooking 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.719
 we also add salt if they want 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.270
 add the onion and garlic so that it is 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.460
 this area a little bit and right now 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.320
 we come back to see how the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.540
 we prepare 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.940
 here we have half an onion and a piece of 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.610
 cilantro that we are going to finely chop 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.570
 to add them to our quesadillas 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.710
 we already have the ground meat here 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.840
 remember that you can buy a kilo 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.460
 half a kilo of ground beef depending 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.800
 of the amount of quesadillas that go 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.800
 to do now we are going to prepare the 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.050
 mass to start doing them is not 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.200
 forget the cheese that is the main thing 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.970
 which is sadr or mozzarella cheese 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.220
 now let's start doing them now 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.789
 We are going to prepare the dough for the 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.830
 quesadillas we add 3 cups of 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:40.600
 maseca and one of flour and water 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.610
 the water and we are going to calculate 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.009
 As I told you before, do not worry 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.009
 so watery or so hard 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.280
 you can also add salt 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.400
 and knead until there is one 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.190
 consistency 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.710
 good to start doing them once 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.900
 that already have the mass well ready kneaded 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.580
 we make little balls of this size 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.540
 size of your hand smaller as 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.070
 want 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.630
 remember that depending on the size of 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.940
 that they do so, the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.660
 large or small quesadilla and here 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.230
 we already have a 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.230
 we're going 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.070
 and now we put it to the comal 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.050
 let's put our tortilla in the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.900
 comal 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.790
 we wait for cooking on one side the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.730
 we turn around and wait for it to cook 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.140
 also from the other side and we're going back to 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.150
 flip and that's when we're going to place the 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.150
 cheese and meat 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.400
 once the tortilla is well cooked 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.880
 on both sides we are going to add the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.270
 cheese a considerable amount and the 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.270
 meat 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.320
 the truth is we are staying a little 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.290
 the tortillas are not going well 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.950
 well there are days going by that are not 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.230
 being very burned 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.459
 but we'll double it and wait for 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.459
 it melts and that 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.780
 we check them to see if a 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.780
 it melted sunk the ingredients 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.850
 let's see if agassi is ready 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.390
 I remember a little more 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.140
 remember to flip it on the other side 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.140
 also for what 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.700
 and do not forget to add the lemon 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.630
 sec everything they want us like that 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.470
 We usually add the onion and 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.470
 cilantro and lemon and a very spicy sauce 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.010
 Well, it seems that here already the list 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.500
 our quesadilla we are going to place him 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.919
 our plate to be able to put all 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.919
 the ingredients 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.680
 here we go 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.570
 add center this already seems 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.110
 but hey we added cilantro 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.460
 lemon 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.460
 and a little salt 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:42.709
 and our red sauce 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:49.080
 and a very rich one has enjoyed closing and 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.300
 we accompany that our favorite drink 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.810
 this is cooking to taste we are going to 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.810

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.620
