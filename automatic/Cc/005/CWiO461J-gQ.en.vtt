00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.849
 Hi people 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.950
 I'm going to meet a request today that 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.830
 sent by email about how 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.949
 transforms score that has change 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.550
 qav engine is in the middle of it that the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.720
 team already had a hard time 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.949
 transpose but in fact a very 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.570
 not simple 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.609
 not much difference than that 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.990
 another video that I posted here is not 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.330
 so I'll try to be very fast here 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.910
 because it's very simple even here in a 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.460
 music here is in my biggest there is one 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.210
 point it goes to ours having bigger 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.760
 here and then it comes back to me the most 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.300
 What he wants to do is instead of being well. 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.559
 bigger 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.559
 gift is 26 bigger is bigger he wants it to be 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.280
 It is better to give the largest 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.649
 new 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.420
 ie he wants to anticipate the music 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.329
 whole 1cm so below 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.000
 so very simple, we are the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.350
 is to select everything to control with the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.710
 command a mac shift 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.930
 transposition and here it gives two options, 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.390
 transform declare storefront here by 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.390
 duality of the part itself or by interval 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.689
 winning here by break we want 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.090
 descending in an attic 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.900
 because he is a follower in the then second 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.390
 smaller 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.000
 here you can also move if you 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.460
 want to put the group followed by 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.470
 Always good furniture reviewed since 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.079
 people think it's just oki printing and 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.060
 It's not like that, he always does. 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.770
 bullshit this way it gets bad so need 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.229
 always so when you transfer legal 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.490
 review is cool so I want to have only one 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:49.409
 second smaller below 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:51.780
 ok here they have my biggest one there in the middle of the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.200
 bigger here in his 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.479
 and here in the end again 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.210
 so that's it folks hope to have helped 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.310
 take the doubts if you do not understand 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.290
 can in the comments that gives you the maximum 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.290
 that you can and that's it
