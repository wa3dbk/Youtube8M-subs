 the atmosphere of the game 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.910
 the stone balls rest on the little ones 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.360
 islands that gradually go under 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.400
 water 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.340

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.790
 boxes in the booklet you will find the rules 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.260
 games and inside the organizer arranged 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.930
 balls and rings 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.480
 note in the game there is no gaming 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.630
 fields it is made of plastic 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.239
 Rings included forty nine 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.030

 balls for the standard version of the game 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.320
 thirty seven rings are used 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.900
 make one hexagon with 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.750
 side four rings sort 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.650
 balls by color and place them next to 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.190
 playing field 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.600
 this is a general reserve randomly 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.690
 select the player who will walk 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.479
 the player must execute his first move 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.909
 either of the two actions either expose 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.940
 one ball on the playing field and remove 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.990
 one ring either grab one or 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.290
 more balls 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.320
 consider in detail every action of your own 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.420
 move the player chooses one ball from the total 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.210
 stock note 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.500
 you can choose a ball of any color all 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.869
 common balls 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.390
 after the choice is made player 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.530
 place the ball on any unallocated 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.080
 the ring then the player should if possible 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.099
 remove one free ring free 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.850
 rings are considered not occupied by balls and 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.790
 located on the edge 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.580
 playing field removal principle 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.590
 free ring is simple we can withdraw 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.230
 its hexagon only 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.690
 If we do not change the position of others 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.960
 rings for example we can take any 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.360
 ring with the edge of the hexagon while we 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.400
 can not take rings located 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.510
 inside the hexagon so how are they 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.540
 will change the position of the outer rings of the case 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.780
 if at the beginning of a player's turn there 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.380
 the ability to grab the ball he owes it 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.230
 make grabbing balls going on 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.070
 the principle of checkers one ball jumps 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.960
 through another 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.110
 you can grab the ball only 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.020
 If the balls are on neighboring 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.450
 rings and then the ball through which you 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.690
 want to jump there is free space 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.970
 when capturing the color of the balls does not have 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.060
 values also no matter which player 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.310
 placed these balls on the field for example 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.340
 you can jump over with a black ball 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.500
 through gray or gray ball through 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.920
 another gray choice is yours 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.860
 after the ball is captured ring with 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.250
 the playing field is not removed and the playerâ€™s turn 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.740
 ends when arises 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.800
 the ability to capture multiple balls 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.010
 the player must do it according to the principle 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.800
 checkers when placing the ball on the game 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.290
 field and subsequent removal of the ring 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.960
 the player can isolate a group of one 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.000
 or multiple balls isolate 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.180
 group is possible only if 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.240
 all rings in the group are occupied by balls 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.750
 for example a player can isolate one 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.410
 ball 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.110
 a group of three balls but he ca n't 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.750
 isolate this group by removing the ring 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.890
 since not all the rings in this group 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:08.370
 busy with balls isolating the player group 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.890
 picks up all the balls and all the rings from 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.960
 this isolated group game 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.440
 ends when one of the players 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.310
 pick up either three balls of each color 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.910
 either 5 gray balls or 6 black 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.960
 balls 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.690
 either four white balls 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.889
 more experienced players can expand 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:35.470
 playing field 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:38.020
 using 4043 44 or all 48 rings and 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.650
 Conclusion review a few tips on 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.690
 the most valuable white balls in the game 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.120

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.580
 try to sacrifice your opponent black 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.370
 ball to later 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.069
 get white always remember 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.380
 possibility of isolating a group of balls 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:59.229
 force your opponent to free you 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.349
 ring binders and the next turn 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.840
 pick yourself a group do not despair 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:07.539
 if your opponent scored much more 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.940
 balls than you just one competently 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:13.570
 planned combination and you will become

 abstract tactical game for two 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.419
 players in which you will need 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.000
 think over your actions for a few 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.970
 steps forward and build traps for 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.580
 Opponents of the game is difficult because the game 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.970

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.990
 brawn is a kind of giveaway game 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.419
 when you need to give the enemy 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.150
 less to earn more 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.280
 remember that the key to success is time 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.440
 give your opponent a trojan horse and 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.110
 of course try to avoid yourself 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.300
