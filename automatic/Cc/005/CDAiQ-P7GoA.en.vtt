00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:43.410 

there<00:00:41.679> are<00:00:41.949> four<00:00:42.219> basic<00:00:42.609> steps<00:00:42.640> to<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.179> sky

there are four basic steps to the sky
the<00:00:44.379> first<00:00:44.649> is<00:00:44.920> to<00:00:45.190> keep<00:00:45.339> the<00:00:45.550> beat<00:00:45.760> with<00:00:46.030> the

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
the first is to keep the beat with the

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.869 
the first is to keep the beat with the
upper<00:00:46.480> half<00:00:46.690> of<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:46.989> body<00:00:47.460> bowing<00:00:48.460> forward

basic<00:01:11.369> step<00:01:11.580> number<00:01:11.729> two<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.439> practically<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
basic step number two is practically the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.219 
basic step number two is practically the
same<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.130> step<00:01:14.369> number<00:01:14.549> one<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
same as step number one but with the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.490 
same as step number one but with the
addition<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.130> side<00:01:17.369> step<00:01:18.200> first<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
addition of a side step first to the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.889 
addition of a side step first to the
rights<00:01:19.680> by<00:01:20.250> moving<00:01:20.580> at<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> right<00:01:21.180> leg<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.720> the
