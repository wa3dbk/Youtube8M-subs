lizard which is one of my favorite
villains<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.040> guess<00:02:55.220> he<00:02:55.400> won't<00:02:55.520> be<00:02:56.620> playing<00:02:57.620> the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
villains I guess he won't be playing the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.520 
villains I guess he won't be playing the
lizard<00:02:58.130> but<00:02:58.340> who<00:02:58.490> knows<00:02:58.610> maybe<00:02:58.880> in<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.150> future

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
lizard but who knows maybe in the future

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.040 
lizard but who knows maybe in the future
you<00:03:00.530> know<00:03:00.950> tells<00:03:01.400> him<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.940> your<00:03:02.840> web

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
you know tells him that your web

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.840 
you know tells him that your web
slinging<00:03:03.350> is<00:03:03.590> too<00:03:03.800> slow<00:03:04.100> but<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.640> bike<00:03:04.820> is

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
slinging is too slow but the bike is

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.350 
slinging is too slow but the bike is
faster<00:03:05.570> you<00:03:06.470> know<00:03:06.590> because<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.550> web<00:03:08.060> car

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
faster you know because the web car

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.810 
faster you know because the web car
juices<00:03:08.720> are<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.110> expensive<00:03:09.650> like<00:03:10.250> really

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
juices are so expensive like really

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.580 
juices are so expensive like really
expensive<00:03:12.250> gasoline<00:03:13.250> is<00:03:13.820> expensive<00:03:14.540> I<00:03:14.840> mean<00:03:15.470> I

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
expensive gasoline is expensive I mean I

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.690 
expensive gasoline is expensive I mean I
don't<00:03:15.800> know<00:03:15.860> maybe<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.220> shield<00:03:16.520> has

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
don't know maybe the shield has

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.670 
don't know maybe the shield has
subsidies<00:03:17.480> for<00:03:17.660> gasoline<00:03:18.140> I<00:03:18.170> don't<00:03:18.320> know<00:03:18.560> how

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
subsidies for gasoline I don't know how

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.920 
subsidies for gasoline I don't know how
but<00:03:18.950> I<00:03:19.190> mean<00:03:19.820> it's<00:03:19.910> kind<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.209> stupid<00:03:20.510> if<00:03:20.840> you

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
but I mean it's kind of stupid if you

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.460 
but I mean it's kind of stupid if you
think<00:03:21.170> about<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.470> that<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:23.090> bike<00:03:23.420> can<00:03:23.930> go<00:03:24.080> a<00:03:24.290> lot

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
think about it that a bike can go a lot

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.590 
think about it that a bike can go a lot
faster<00:03:24.680> than<00:03:24.980> spider-man's<00:03:25.580> web<00:03:25.970> slinging<00:03:26.300> I

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
faster than spider-man's web slinging I

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.140 
faster than spider-man's web slinging I
mean<00:03:27.170> it's<00:03:27.380> just<00:03:27.470> really<00:03:27.830> really<00:03:28.150> really

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
mean it's just really really really

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.960 
mean it's just really really really
ridiculous<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.190> hope<00:03:31.430> it<00:03:31.610> doesn't<00:03:31.880> really

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
ridiculous and I hope it doesn't really

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.260 
ridiculous and I hope it doesn't really
affect<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:33.200> story<00:03:33.890> too<00:03:34.100> much<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.520> mean<00:03:34.550> I<00:03:34.940> know

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
affect the story too much I mean I know

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.660 
affect the story too much I mean I know
why<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.200> bike<00:03:36.440> was<00:03:36.470> there<00:03:36.950> because<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.489> toy

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
why the bike was there because the toy

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.610 
why the bike was there because the toy
company<00:03:38.180> told<00:03:38.450> you<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:38.780> put<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.110> bike<00:03:39.290> in<00:03:39.530> the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
company told you to put the bike in the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.670 
company told you to put the bike in the
show<00:03:39.920> which<00:03:40.910> I<00:03:41.180> really<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.810> think<00:03:41.900> that<00:03:42.440> just

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
show which I really I think that just

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.270 
show which I really I think that just
bring<00:03:42.920> it<00:03:43.100> just<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.640> just<00:03:44.410> takes<00:03:45.410> away<00:03:45.770> the

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
bring it just it just takes away the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.190 
bring it just it just takes away the
creativity<00:03:46.790> from<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.270> show<00:03:47.450> maybe<00:03:47.870> it<00:03:48.050> was

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
creativity from the show maybe it was

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.960 
creativity from the show maybe it was
there<00:03:48.380> I<00:03:48.410> day<00:03:48.560> maybe<00:03:48.890> it's<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.190> toy<00:03:49.459> companies

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
there I day maybe it's the toy companies

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.880 
there I day maybe it's the toy companies
idea<00:03:50.330> but<00:03:50.510> I<00:03:50.540> think<00:03:50.600> it's<00:03:50.930> just<00:03:50.989> ridiculous<00:03:51.709> in

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
idea but I think it's just ridiculous in

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.310 
idea but I think it's just ridiculous in
my<00:03:51.920> opinion<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.580> that's<00:03:52.900> something<00:03:53.900> that<00:03:54.080> I

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
my opinion and that's something that I

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.030 
my opinion and that's something that I
wish<00:03:54.680> they<00:03:54.980> didn't<00:03:55.280> do<00:03:56.110> but<00:03:57.110> I<00:03:57.140> understand<00:03:57.800> and

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
wish they didn't do but I understand and

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.620 
wish they didn't do but I understand and
trying<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.310> talk<00:03:58.520> make<00:03:58.760> they're<00:03:59.090> trying<00:03:59.480> to

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
trying to talk make they're trying to

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.280 
trying to talk make they're trying to
sell<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.230> toys<00:04:00.440> which<00:04:00.890> i<00:04:01.160> think<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.610> know<00:04:02.290> you

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
sell the toys which i think you know you

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.800 
sell the toys which i think you know you
know<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.709> don't<00:04:04.310> really<00:04:04.640> like<00:04:04.790> but<00:04:05.300> you<00:04:05.360> know<00:04:05.660> as

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
know I don't really like but you know as

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.570 
know I don't really like but you know as
long<00:04:06.020> as<00:04:06.200> they<00:04:06.350> as<00:04:06.560> long<00:04:06.920> as<00:04:07.070> they<00:04:07.190> don't<00:04:07.310> use

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
long as they as long as they don't use

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.920 
long as they as long as they don't use
it<00:04:07.730> that<00:04:07.760> much<00:04:07.940> then<00:04:08.180> that's<00:04:08.780> fine<00:04:08.900> with<00:04:09.320> me

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
it that much then that's fine with me

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.800 
it that much then that's fine with me
I<00:04:09.959> really<00:04:10.560> have<00:04:10.739> no<00:04:10.920> problem<00:04:11.370> with<00:04:11.489> it<00:04:11.519> but

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
I really have no problem with it but

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.020 
I really have no problem with it but
come<00:04:12.810> on<00:04:12.890> you<00:04:13.890> know<00:04:14.010> now<00:04:14.280> they<00:04:14.430> got<00:04:14.609> some<00:04:14.849> other

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
essentials to that spider-man does not

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.349 
essentials to that spider-man does not
need<00:04:17.600> but<00:04:19.070> again<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.459> know<00:04:20.579> I<00:04:20.609> understand

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359
