what<00:01:43.560> month<00:01:43.799> actually<00:01:44.189> does<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:45.030> he<00:01:45.390> borrows

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
what month actually does is he borrows

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.200 
what month actually does is he borrows
the<00:01:46.140> whole<00:01:46.500> thing<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:46.890> his<00:01:47.070> ring<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.609> his

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the whole thing with his ring and his

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.370 
the whole thing with his ring and his
middle<00:01:48.479> finger<00:01:53.840> I'm<00:01:54.840> sure<00:01:55.020> there's<00:01:55.229> some

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
middle finger I'm sure there's some

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.109 
middle finger I'm sure there's some
reason<00:01:55.649> why<00:01:55.770> he<00:01:55.859> does<00:01:56.039> that<00:01:56.069> may<00:01:56.609> sound<00:01:56.909> I

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
reason why he does that may sound I

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.160 
reason why he does that may sound I
can't<00:01:57.390> hear<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:57.600> difference<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:58.020> he's<00:01:58.140> a

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
can't hear the difference but he's a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.499 
can't hear the difference but he's a
professional<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.090> that's<00:02:00.090> probably<00:02:00.329> when<00:02:00.479> he

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
professional so that's probably when he

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.919 
professional so that's probably when he
it<00:02:01.140> sounds<00:02:01.469> better<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.860> him<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.789> yeah<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.600> think

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
it sounds better to him but yeah I think

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:09.770 
it sounds better to him but yeah I think
it's<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.170> same<00:02:04.350> thing<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:09.239> yeah<00:02:09.390> that's<00:02:09.660> your

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
it's the same thing so yeah that's your

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.680 
it's the same thing so yeah that's your
