reading is not having a indication of
where<00:00:41.700> that's<00:00:41.879> at<00:00:42.649> so<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.860> very<00:00:43.980> important

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
where that's at so it's very important

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.779 
where that's at so it's very important
to<00:00:44.610> go<00:00:44.789> ahead<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.090> get<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.539> gauge<00:00:46.530> set<00:00:46.950> an<00:00:47.640> AC

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
to go ahead and get a gauge set an AC

manifold gauge set and hook up and get

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.950 
manifold gauge set and hook up and get
the<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.840> readings<00:00:52.320> low<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.890> high<00:00:53.010> side

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
the get the readings low and high side

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.750 
the get the readings low and high side
once<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.020> know<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:55.920> you'll<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.670> able

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
once you know that then you'll be able

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.119 
once you know that then you'll be able
to<00:00:57.000> determine<00:00:57.690> what's<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
to determine what's going on with the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.869 
to determine what's going on with the
system<00:00:59.520> if<00:00:59.730> it's<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.000> little<00:01:00.270> charge<00:01:01.160> if<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
system if it's a little charge if the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.429 
system if it's a little charge if the
readings<00:01:03.210> are<00:01:03.390> too<00:01:03.600> high<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.170> could<00:01:04.320> be

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
readings are too high it could be

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.190 
readings are too high it could be
overcharged<00:01:05.570> there's<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.659> variety<00:01:06.930> of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
overcharged there's a variety of

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.289 
overcharged there's a variety of
different<00:01:07.409> pressure<00:01:07.799> readings<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.610> they<00:01:09.180> all

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
different pressure readings and they all

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.100 
different pressure readings and they all
mean<00:01:09.540> different<00:01:09.900> things<00:01:10.850> but<00:01:11.850> anyways<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.210> get

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
mean different things but anyways I get

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.830 
mean different things but anyways I get
an<00:01:13.200> 80<00:01:13.380> gauge<00:01:13.740> set<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.159> don't<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.520> one

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
an 80 gauge set if you don't have one

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.380 
an 80 gauge set if you don't have one
you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.020> find<00:01:16.350> one<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.180> one

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
you can find one like like this one

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.920 
you can find one like like this one
right<00:01:18.540> here

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.030 

and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:26.250> also<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:26.760> you<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.480> are<00:01:28.170> 12<00:01:28.710> or

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and then also if you have a are 12 or

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.210 
and then also if you have a are 12 or
