00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
it more accurately he was able to do a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.520 
it more accurately he was able to do a
lot<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.390> different<00:00:36.899> things<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
lot of different things with the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.709 
lot of different things with the
football<00:00:37.980> today<00:00:38.190> wasn't<00:00:38.700> perfect<00:00:39.120> he<00:00:39.450> still

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
football today wasn't perfect he still

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.569 
football today wasn't perfect he still
missed<00:00:39.960> some<00:00:40.140> throws<00:00:40.440> he's<00:00:41.070> got<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.430> get

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
missed some throws he's got to get

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.610 
missed some throws he's got to get
better<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.210> terms<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.629> his<00:00:42.780> overall<00:00:43.230> accuracy

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
better in terms of his overall accuracy

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.010 
better in terms of his overall accuracy
but<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> was<00:00:44.399> much<00:00:44.610> better<00:00:44.850> here<00:00:45.270> than<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.899> was

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
but it was much better here than it was

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.500 
but it was much better here than it was
a<00:00:46.050> little<00:00:46.350> bit<00:00:46.500> how<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.129> balance<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:48.030> Pro

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
a little bit how do you balance that Pro

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600 
a little bit how do you balance that Pro
day<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:49.200> his<00:00:49.379> three-year<00:00:49.860> body<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.219> work<00:00:50.399> at

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.389 
day with his three-year body of work at
Louisville<00:00:51.030> well<00:00:51.780> every<00:00:52.129> workout<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.370> have

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
Louisville well every workout you have

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.520 
Louisville well every workout you have
is<00:00:53.910> important<00:00:54.390> everything<00:00:54.660> matters<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.469> I

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
is important everything matters but I

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.979 
is important everything matters but I
think<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.129> pro<00:00:56.640> date<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.300> run<00:00:57.570> by<00:00:57.600> an

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
think a pro date that is run by an

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.590 
think a pro date that is run by an
independent<00:00:58.260> quarterback<00:00:59.219> coach<00:00:59.670> probably

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
independent quarterback coach probably

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.720 
independent quarterback coach probably
matters<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.050> little<00:01:01.289> bit<00:01:01.620> less<00:01:01.920> than<00:01:02.520> what

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
matters a little bit less than what

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.429 
matters a little bit less than what
you're<00:01:02.879> gonna<00:01:03.059> see<00:01:03.390> him<00:01:03.629> do<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.989> these<00:01:04.080> private

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
him on my team I think he translates
