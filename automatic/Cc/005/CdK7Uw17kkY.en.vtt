00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.560
 in the benefit 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.730
 I already have a young Ajax that put him on 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.769
 participate more with it and that there 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.559
 nec trainer just to detect a community service 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.779
 the supporters want to read and count 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:17.329
 after a good match 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.249
 just once in rotterdam with 0 5 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.800
 the residents of The Hague silent the entire stadium 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.659
 it makes sense that the winnings then 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:26.800
 we play 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.330
 there gave more than fifteen matches because of course you can also send well 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.890
 even with such a school yes psv things are a bit off the mark 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.870
 that was nothing in it 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.870
 as now there are 3 2 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.890
 4 are parents 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.770
 that the neighbors 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.090
 celebrate the ajacids 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.270
 they encounter a friend of mine x from the condroz 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.090
 speak your children's destiny 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.270
 9 it's just the one family 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.660
 yes it is not really ajax or feyenoord psv it is always very nice funeral 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.150
 ajax and feyenoord 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.890

 I don't really have what we need has risen 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.380
 after making a bit of the end last week, and you did 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.680
 it actually was 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.680
 on the other hand, they were the national champions 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.020
 there sales rose by the anp 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.680

 kenneth vermeer 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.310

 stellendam amsterdam ten dam 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.590
 Amsterdam Amsterdam Amsterdam

 only that is the us 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.100
 the man 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.149
 we sit 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.530
 hit the scooter driver 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.140
 what were those guys who 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.660
 are Dutch 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.479
 there are also 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.949
 what nonsense 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.280
 to the players before the game 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.050
 yes we have a hunger men could be obstructed by ajax 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.809
 feyenoord 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:21.250
 now actually 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.069
 few customers have played against yesterday 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.599
 which it was actually even more scanner and of course we think there is one 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.849
 have a good time 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.480
 yes we know it is an important competition always a classic one 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.109
 it is whole 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:39.089
 they simply read through the central training sessions and then quickly 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:42.949
 here it was seen for that time 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:44.249
 year 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:45.499
 the door 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:49.379
 We also talk to the director of all brands after a tip of a bit too 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.260
 avest actually from this year again gain time from you just like last year 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.399
 of course we don't swallow what rhijn anp says there are strong ones this year 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:59.289
 2 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:01.419
 yes i added 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.549
 Amsterdam youngsters in particular 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.230
 especially for the day with many residents for a 2 0 lead 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.150
 Warsaw self-confidence 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.949
 who can see nowadays 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.989
 we have to call municipalities from us 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.720
 what a whining 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.399
 but I think it's one 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:19.709
 if you like that 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.469
 When you see this this is a sign that you are confident if you have to start like this 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.559
 the midfielder of one 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:26.929
 the smoked sausage and 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:28.300
 you can be you 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.340
 so went with a lot of smoke I understand that the former was a lot better with 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.299
 ajax but the residents care 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.760
 that the statements by hatch that we are the best fifteen must go
