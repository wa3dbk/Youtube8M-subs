well you see behind me is a 30-foot tall
a<00:00:02.370> craft<00:00:02.730> and<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.360> reason<00:00:03.629> why<00:00:03.720> we<00:00:03.870> chose<00:00:03.899> this

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
a craft and the reason why we chose this

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.970 
a craft and the reason why we chose this
boat<00:00:04.560> it's<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.609> vintage<00:00:06.080> boat<00:00:07.080> from<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.470> late

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
boat it's a vintage boat from the late

boat it's a vintage boat from the late
60s<00:00:08.429> it's<00:00:08.760> solid<00:00:09.240> fiberglass<00:00:09.929> they<00:00:10.230> didn't

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
60s it's solid fiberglass they didn't

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.379 
60s it's solid fiberglass they didn't
use<00:00:10.620> any<00:00:10.860> wood<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.400> hull<00:00:11.580> after<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
use any wood in the hull after the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.360 
use any wood in the hull after the
construction<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:13.049> this<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.410> about<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.679> 1<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.309> a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
construction of this is about a 1 and a

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.210 
construction of this is about a 1 and a
half<00:00:14.610> inch<00:00:14.910> thick<00:00:15.210> fiberglass<00:00:15.830> the<00:00:16.830> colors

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
half inch thick fiberglass the colors

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.779 
half inch thick fiberglass the colors
are<00:00:17.550> retro<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.660> teal<00:00:18.900> color<00:00:18.930> it's<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.039> fashion

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
are retro that teal color it's a fashion

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.029 
are retro that teal color it's a fashion
from<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.750> late<00:00:22.020> 60s<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.529> think<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.830> coming

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
from the late 60s I think it's coming

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.320 
from the late 60s I think it's coming
back<00:00:23.310> into<00:00:23.519> style<00:00:23.789> because<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.210> new

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
back into style because the new

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.359 
back into style because the new
bennetto's<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.650> they<00:00:25.740> call<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.039> Monte

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
bennetto's that they call the Monte

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.730 
bennetto's that they call the Monte
Carlo<00:00:26.550> 5<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.330> stuff<00:00:27.539> I've<00:00:27.779> got<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.199> color<00:00:28.500> on

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
Carlo 5 and stuff I've got this color on

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.070 
Carlo 5 and stuff I've got this color on
the<00:00:28.830> hull<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.189> well<00:00:29.420> so<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:30.599> think<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:30.900> going

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
the hull as well so we think it's going

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.250 
the hull as well so we think it's going
to<00:00:31.109> take<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:32.149> your<00:00:33.149> people<00:00:33.420> will<00:00:33.660> like<00:00:34.230> that

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
to take a your people will like that

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.650 
to take a your people will like that
color<00:00:34.649> again<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.820> solid<00:00:36.000> big<00:00:36.390> hole

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
color again but it's a solid big hole

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.280 
color again but it's a solid big hole
it's<00:00:36.960> designed<00:00:37.350> by<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.790> believe<00:00:39.020> the<00:00:40.020> hull

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
it's designed by I believe the hull

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.139 
it's designed by I believe the hull
design<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.510> monk<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.780> might<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.440> edit

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
design is a monk you might have to edit

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.880 
design is a monk you might have to edit
but<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.450> solid<00:00:46.170> they<00:00:46.620> see<00:00:47.309> where<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.780> V

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
but it's a solid they see where the V

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.040 
but it's a solid they see where the V
shallow<00:00:49.890> heat<00:00:50.360> and<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.539> got<00:00:51.719> twin

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
shallow heat and it's got twin

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.860 
shallow heat and it's got twin
propellers<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:53.399> stick<00:00:53.670> out<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.850> shafts<00:00:54.270> on

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
propellers that stick out of shafts on

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.709 
propellers that stick out of shafts on
the<00:00:55.649> back<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.430> boat<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.910> rudders<00:00:57.300> behind

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the back of the boat with rudders behind

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.160 
the back of the boat with rudders behind
them<00:00:59.000> underneath<00:01:00.000> if<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.570> get<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> shot<00:01:01.020> of

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
them underneath if you can get a shot of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.789 
them underneath if you can get a shot of
that<00:01:02.359> so<00:01:03.359> that's<00:01:04.019> what<00:01:04.229> we're<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.559> power

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that so that's what we're going to power

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.830 
that so that's what we're going to power
with<00:01:05.220> our<00:01:05.250> electric<00:01:06.000> motors<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.600> these

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
with our electric motors is these

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.330 
with our electric motors is these
propellers<00:01:07.350> we're<00:01:07.680> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.860> keep<00:01:08.040> all<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
propellers we're going to keep all the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.480 
propellers we're going to keep all the
same<00:01:08.549> running<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.409> if<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> larger

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
same running here if we can get a larger

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.120 
same running here if we can get a larger
propeller<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.150> may<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.260> looks<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.650> we're

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
propeller we may but it looks like we're

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.649 
propeller we may but it looks like we're
going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.520> attach<00:01:14.820> our<00:01:15.030> motor<00:01:15.210> directly

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
going to just attach our motor directly

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.010 
going to just attach our motor directly
to<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> first<00:01:17.939> prototype

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
to this to for the first prototype

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.740 
to this to for the first prototype
and<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.490> rudders<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:20.939> quite<00:01:21.119> small<00:01:21.420> so

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
and the rudders are quite small so

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.179 
and the rudders are quite small so
there's<00:01:21.960> not<00:01:22.079> a<00:01:22.140> lot<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.470> drag<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> water

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
there's not a lot of drag in the water

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.310 
there's not a lot of drag in the water
the<00:01:23.490> boat<00:01:23.640> floats<00:01:24.090> quite<00:01:24.420> well<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.960> planes

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the boat floats quite well and it planes

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.760 
the boat floats quite well and it planes
really<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.280> well<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.899> few<00:01:28.229> horsepower

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
really really well with a few horsepower

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.410 
really really well with a few horsepower
so<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.520> might<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:30.000> able<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.240> get<00:01:30.330> it

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
so we think you might be able to get it

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.960 
so we think you might be able to get it
up<00:01:30.540> planing<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.170> well<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:32.250> could<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.490> an<00:01:32.670> edit

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
up planing as well that could be an edit

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:42.639 
up planing as well that could be an edit
to<00:01:39.049> we'll<00:01:40.049> talk<00:01:40.229> about<00:01:40.380> now<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
to we'll talk about now the
