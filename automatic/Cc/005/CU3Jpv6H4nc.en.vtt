was about four and a half pounds there's

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.000 
was about four and a half pounds there's
been<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.510> lot<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.690> four<00:02:24.990> or<00:02:25.140> five<00:02:25.320> six<00:02:25.710> pound

fish<00:02:26.280> caught<00:02:26.520> this<00:02:26.730> year<00:02:27.000> which<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.660> very

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
fish caught this year which is very

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.870 
fish caught this year which is very
pleasant<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.890> starting<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.340> really<00:02:29.520> fish

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
pleasant it's starting to really fish

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.750 
pleasant it's starting to really fish
well<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.110> think<00:02:31.370> should<00:02:32.370> be<00:02:32.490> what<00:02:32.610> do<00:02:32.670> you

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
well and I think should be what do you

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.450 
well and I think should be what do you
stop<00:02:33.000> thanks<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.750> lot<00:02:33.810> now<00:02:34.170> thank<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.740> back

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.210 

so<00:02:38.150> there's<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:38.390> reason<00:02:38.660> why<00:02:38.780> we<00:02:38.990> we<00:02:39.920> have<00:02:40.040> this

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
so there's a reason why we we have this

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.670 
so there's a reason why we we have this
term<00:02:40.460> called<00:02:40.730> summer<00:02:41.090> doldrums<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:42.350> fishing

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
term called summer doldrums the fishing

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.530 
term called summer doldrums the fishing
the<00:02:42.860> interior<00:02:43.250> legs<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.820> small<00:02:44.060> tote<00:02:44.330> lakes

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
the interior legs the small tote lakes

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.330 
the interior legs the small tote lakes
and<00:02:45.080> that's<00:02:45.230> simply<00:02:45.380> because<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.980> gets<00:02:46.130> pretty

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
and that's simply because it gets pretty

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.220 
and that's simply because it gets pretty
hot<00:02:46.580> up<00:02:46.760> here<00:02:46.790> we've<00:02:47.210> endured<00:02:47.540> almost<00:02:47.960> five

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
hot up here we've endured almost five

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.640 
hot up here we've endured almost five
weeks<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.650> pretty<00:02:49.310> intense<00:02:49.730> heat<00:02:50.470> up<00:02:51.470> in<00:02:51.590> the

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
weeks of pretty intense heat up in the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.640 
weeks of pretty intense heat up in the
kamloops<00:02:52.100> area<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.820> year<00:02:52.990> so<00:02:53.990> when<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.470> get

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
kamloops area this year so when you get

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
hot weather to get warm water

you<00:03:00.020> get<00:03:00.260> more<00:03:00.620> lethargic<00:03:00.920> fish<00:03:01.580> they're<00:03:01.970> not

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
you get more lethargic fish they're not

that aggressively feeding during the
daytime<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:05.360> you'll<00:03:05.540> also<00:03:05.720> see<00:03:06.020> legs<00:03:06.310> go<00:03:07.310> into

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
daytime and you'll also see legs go into

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.730 
daytime and you'll also see legs go into
a<00:03:07.640> severe<00:03:08.120> algae<00:03:08.420> bloom<00:03:08.690> so<00:03:09.290> we're<00:03:09.440> on<00:03:09.470> late

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
a severe algae bloom so we're on late

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.080 
a severe algae bloom so we're on late
and<00:03:09.920> lake<00:03:10.040> right<00:03:10.220> now<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.520> you<00:03:10.610> can<00:03:10.760> look<00:03:10.940> in

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
and lake right now and you can look in

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.700 
and lake right now and you can look in
the<00:03:11.210> water<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.720> can<00:03:11.870> see<00:03:12.050> there's<00:03:12.260> some<00:03:12.290> algae

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
the water you can see there's some algae

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.800 
the water you can see there's some algae
in<00:03:12.770> the<00:03:12.830> water<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.700> you'll<00:03:13.910> also<00:03:14.120> see<00:03:14.480> clumps

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
in the water and you'll also see clumps

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.220 
in the water and you'll also see clumps
of<00:03:15.050> bottom<00:03:16.040> vegetation<00:03:16.760> or<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:17.540> try<00:03:17.810> this<00:03:17.870> off

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
of bottom vegetation or to try this off

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.810 
of bottom vegetation or to try this off
the<00:03:18.410> bottom<00:03:18.770> of<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:18.920> lake<00:03:19.100> that<00:03:19.130> float<00:03:19.550> up<00:03:19.790> to

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
the bottom of the lake that float up to

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.910 
the bottom of the lake that float up to
the<00:03:20.090> surface<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.720> lake<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.500> there's<00:03:21.710> just

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
the surface of the lake so there's just

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.800 
the surface of the lake so there's just
some<00:03:22.100> methane<00:03:22.490> and<00:03:22.700> hydrogen<00:03:22.760> sulfide<00:03:23.480> gas

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
some methane and hydrogen sulfide gas

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.050 
some methane and hydrogen sulfide gas
being<00:03:24.170> released<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.190> kind<00:03:25.430> of<00:03:25.490> peels<00:03:25.790> off

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
being released and it kind of peels off

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.510 
being released and it kind of peels off
a<00:03:26.090> little<00:03:26.360> layer<00:03:26.600> of<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:27.020> that's<00:03:27.980> that

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
a little layer of that that's that

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.730 
a little layer of that that's that
matter<00:03:28.940> that<00:03:29.300> organic<00:03:29.990> matter<00:03:30.200> that's<00:03:30.500> on<00:03:30.650> the

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
matter that organic matter that's on the

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.140 
matter that organic matter that's on the
bottom<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.280> floats<00:03:31.520> to<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.730> surface<00:03:31.790> of

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
bottom and it floats to the surface of

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.940 
bottom and it floats to the surface of
the<00:03:32.240> light<00:03:32.390> so<00:03:33.200> when<00:03:33.350> we're<00:03:33.440> fishing<00:03:33.830> the

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
the light so when we're fishing the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.950

summer doldrums even though fishing can

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.720 
summer doldrums even though fishing can
be<00:03:35.990> tough<00:03:36.320> there<00:03:36.860> can<00:03:37.100> be<00:03:37.130> some<00:03:37.400> really<00:03:37.610> good

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
be tough there can be some really good
