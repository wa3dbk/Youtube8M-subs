all<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.250> time<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.880> I'm<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.780> learned<00:01:09.990> to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
all the time and so I'm just learned to

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.210 
all the time and so I'm just learned to
be<00:01:10.260> I'll<00:01:10.350> do<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.860> then<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.040> think

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
be I'll do that and then I think

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.090 
be I'll do that and then I think
defensively<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.970> well<00:01:12.560> learn<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.799> become<00:01:13.920> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.649 
defensively as well learn to become a
better<00:01:14.280> defender<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.509> be<00:01:15.630> more
