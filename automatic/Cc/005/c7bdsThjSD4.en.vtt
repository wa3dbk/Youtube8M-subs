up but we got morgy but more of the lego
customs<00:00:16.609> but<00:00:17.609> i<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:19.020> i<00:00:19.400> can't<00:00:20.400> speak<00:00:20.640> today<00:00:20.820> I

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
customs but i have i can't speak today I

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.590 
customs but i have i can't speak today I
haven't<00:00:21.840> done<00:00:22.100> it<00:00:23.100> like<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.460> custom<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.390> while

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
haven't done it like a custom in a while

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:33.979 
haven't done it like a custom in a while
so<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.529> think<00:00:25.949> well<00:00:26.760> like<00:00:30.859> why<00:00:31.859> does<00:00:32.189> not<00:00:32.630> make<00:00:33.630> a

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
so I think well like why does not make a

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.850 
so I think well like why does not make a
number<00:00:34.590> one<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.430> did<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.500> it's<00:00:40.500> actually<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
number one so I did and it's actually a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.680 
number one so I did and it's actually a
lego<00:00:41.100> custom<00:00:42.620> but<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.420> lot<00:00:45.570> of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
lego custom but that so it's a lot of

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.860 
lego custom but that so it's a lot of
custom<00:00:46.140> made<00:00:46.500> again<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.480> it's<00:00:48.480> actually<00:00:48.629> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
custom made again and it's actually a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.680 
custom made again and it's actually a
marble<00:00:49.230> maze<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.460> small<00:00:50.910> marble<00:00:51.480> maze

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
marble maze it's a small marble maze

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.189 
marble maze it's a small marble maze
South<00:00:52.170> best<00:00:52.739> because<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.390> my<00:00:54.539> first<00:00:54.570> one

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
South best because this is my first one

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.650 
South best because this is my first one
so<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:55.920> not<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.520> best<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.420> just

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
so it's not really the best it's just

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.310 
so it's not really the best it's just
really<00:00:57.930> small<00:00:59.390> but<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:01.280> do<00:01:02.280> blankets<00:01:03.049> because<00:01:04.049> I

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
really small but I do blankets because I

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.859 
really small but I do blankets because I
made<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.650> obviously<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.570> is

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
made it obviously but so what this is

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.560 
made it obviously but so what this is
that<00:01:10.909> put<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> more<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> marble<00:01:14.570> and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that put the more you get a marble and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.390 
that put the more you get a marble and
you<00:01:15.720> get<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.439> marble<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.159> just

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
you get you get a marble and you just

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.010 
you get you get a marble and you just
you<00:01:18.119> know<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.240> try<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.990> move<00:01:19.400> yeah<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:21.659> board

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
you know you try to move yeah the board

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.160 
you know you try to move yeah the board
in<00:01:22.229> order<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.890> move<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.330> here's<00:01:24.869> like

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
in order for it to move so here's like

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.969 
in order for it to move so here's like
you're<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.799> ramp<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:26.820> where<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.240> gotta<00:01:27.509> use

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
you're a ramp here where you gotta use

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.160 
you're a ramp here where you gotta use
get<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.159> rim<00:01:29.340> that's<00:01:29.939> all<00:01:30.150> over<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> ramp<00:01:30.780> it

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
get the rim that's all over the ramp it

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.929 
get the rim that's all over the ramp it
may<00:01:31.320> seem<00:01:31.380> possible<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.729> actually<00:01:33.240> words

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
may seem possible but it actually words

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.219 
may seem possible but it actually words
then<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.390> gotta<00:01:36.570> keep<00:01:36.869> moving

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
then you know you gotta keep moving

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.080 
then you know you gotta keep moving

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.880 

it's<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.760> pretty<00:03:14.030> hard<00:03:14.329> stores<00:03:14.750> start<00:03:15.530> since

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
it's a pretty hard stores start since

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.390 
it's a pretty hard stores start since
ramp<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.400> variable<00:03:18.069> mmm<00:03:20.980> alright<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:22.250> let's

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
ramp is variable mmm alright so let's

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.680 
ramp is variable mmm alright so let's
try<00:03:22.640> again<00:03:23.200> fair<00:03:24.200> see<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.310> just<00:03:25.579> ran<00:03:25.970> over<00:03:26.660> to

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
try again fair see so I just ran over to

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.009 
try again fair see so I just ran over to
ramp<00:03:27.049> it<00:03:27.549> goes<00:03:28.549> really<00:03:28.700> fast<00:03:29.090> so<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.510> probably

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
ramp it goes really fast so you probably

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.940 
ramp it goes really fast so you probably
couldn't<00:03:30.410> see<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:30.859> but<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:33.310> so<00:03:34.310> yeah<00:03:35.150> I

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
couldn't see that but and so yeah I

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.860 
couldn't see that but and so yeah I
might<00:03:36.950> be<00:03:37.160> wondering<00:03:37.400> well<00:03:37.819> why<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:38.239> at<00:03:38.630> this

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
might be wondering well why you at this

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.110 
might be wondering well why you at this
look<00:03:39.109> why<00:03:39.560> do<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.739> add<00:03:40.280> this<00:03:40.639> little<00:03:40.819> thing

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
look why do you add this little thing

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.990 
look why do you add this little thing
here<00:03:41.150> well<00:03:42.109> you<00:03:42.500> know<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:42.680> but<00:03:43.430> you<00:03:43.549> start<00:03:43.819> off

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
here well you know you but you start off

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.390 
here well you know you but you start off
this<00:03:44.690> thing<00:03:44.959> goes<00:03:45.230> really<00:03:45.560> fast<00:03:45.889> but<00:03:46.340> you're

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
this thing goes really fast but you're

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.400 
this thing goes really fast but you're
not<00:03:46.639> you<00:03:47.000> know<00:03:47.030> how<00:03:47.239> you<00:03:47.299> move<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.780> board<00:03:48.049> and

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
not you know how you move the board and

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.539 
not you know how you move the board and
so<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:49.190> know<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:49.880> goes<00:03:50.150> off<00:03:50.450> this<00:03:50.660> ramp<00:03:50.989> and

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
so you know it goes off this ramp and

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:57.370 
so you know it goes off this ramp and
they<00:03:52.549> might<00:03:52.760> even<00:03:52.940> just<00:03:53.180> go<00:03:53.420> whew<00:03:53.920> so<00:03:56.380> you

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
they might even just go whew so you

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.289 
they might even just go whew so you
might<00:03:57.590> not<00:03:57.680> know<00:03:57.829> I'm<00:03:57.980> talking<00:03:58.250> about<00:03:58.310> but<00:03:58.730> so

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
I just have this ramp I mean this is a

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.900 
I just have this ramp I mean this is a
bang<00:04:02.329> whatever<00:04:03.139> it's<00:04:03.319> called<00:04:03.500> just<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.670> you

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
know it blots it so it doesn't go flying
