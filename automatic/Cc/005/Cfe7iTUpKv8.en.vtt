00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
exploded on the left is a transmitter

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
exploded on the left is a transmitter
and<00:01:16.780> on<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.110> right<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.700> bomb<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.869> goes<00:01:20.049> off

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290

and on the right the bomb it goes off
when<00:01:20.500> it<00:01:20.590> receives<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:21.130> specific<00:01:21.610> signal<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:23.049> I

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
when it receives a specific signal if I

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.050 
when it receives a specific signal if I
can<00:01:23.380> separate<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.009> transmitter<00:01:24.670> from<00:01:24.850> the

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
can separate the transmitter from the

can separate the transmitter from the
explosive<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:26.439> bomb<00:01:26.680> will<00:01:26.829> be<00:01:26.950> deactivated

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
explosive the bomb will be deactivated

explosive the bomb will be deactivated
the<00:01:28.210> question<00:01:28.689> is<00:01:28.890> which<00:01:29.890> cable<00:01:30.520> do<00:01:30.640> i<00:01:30.670> cut<00:01:31.060> to

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
the question is which cable do i cut to

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.990 
the question is which cable do i cut to
deactivate<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:32.049> bomb<00:01:32.430> only<00:01:33.430> one<00:01:33.640> cable

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
deactivate the bomb only one cable

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.510 
deactivate the bomb only one cable
reaches<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.630> bomb<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:35.740> means<00:01:36.100> that<00:01:36.430> the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
reaches the bomb that means that the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.910 
reaches the bomb that means that the
rest<00:01:36.729> of<00:01:36.880> them<00:01:37.030> are<00:01:37.119> decoys<00:01:37.770> cutting<00:01:38.770> the

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
rest of them are decoys cutting the

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.700 
rest of them are decoys cutting the
correct<00:01:39.280> line<00:01:39.520> will<00:01:39.820> disconnect<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.420> bomb<00:01:40.710> if

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
correct line will disconnect the bomb if

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.830 
correct line will disconnect the bomb if
I<00:01:41.890> make<00:01:42.070> a<00:01:42.100> mistake<00:01:42.719> it's<00:01:43.719> all<00:01:43.960> over
