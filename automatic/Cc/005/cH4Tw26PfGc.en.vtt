00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
and that's that's the end of the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.230 
and that's that's the end of the
analysis<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:02.009> me<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.610> I'd<00:02:02.700> love<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.090> have

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
analysis for me and I'd love to have

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.200 
analysis for me and I'd love to have
solved<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.500> particular<00:02:05.310> problem<00:02:05.610> sooner

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
solved that particular problem sooner

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.789 
solved that particular problem sooner
and<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.840> thought<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.049> was<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> good<00:02:07.469> solution

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
and I thought that was a good solution

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.889 
and I thought that was a good solution
and<00:02:08.190> there<00:02:08.700> were<00:02:08.759> plenty<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.119> resources<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.750> do

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
and there were plenty of resources to do

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.460 
and there were plenty of resources to do
it<00:02:09.929> but<00:02:10.229> we<00:02:11.009> will<00:02:11.280> not<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.670> bad<00:02:11.849> business

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
it but we will not do bad business

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.290 
it but we will not do bad business
we<00:02:12.650> won't<00:02:12.890> we<00:02:13.820> won't<00:02:13.850> as<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.720> board<00:02:15.140> compel

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
we won't we won't as a board compel

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.090 
we won't we won't as a board compel
management<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.600> take<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.960> player<00:02:18.290> on<00:02:18.560> terms

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
management to take a player on terms

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.190 
management to take a player on terms
that<00:02:19.220> they<00:02:19.400> think<00:02:19.460> are<00:02:19.760> not<00:02:19.910> sensible<00:02:20.300> because

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
that they think are not sensible because

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.360 
that they think are not sensible because
you<00:02:21.290> know<00:02:21.380> if<00:02:21.470> you're<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.680> football<00:02:21.980> manager
