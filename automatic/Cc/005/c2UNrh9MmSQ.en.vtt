A deck of Normal, penduluns monsters !

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.640
They pendulum effect is : If you have an "Igknight" card in your other Pendulum Zone: You can destroy both that card and this card,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:40.660
and if you do, add 1 FIRE Warrior-Type monster from your Deck or Graveyard to your hand.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.760
This helps you alot in the speed of the deck .

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.340
You can use they pendulum effect add a card to your hand

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.200
use outher card in your hand to make a pendulum summon.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.640
Summoning the monster of you add to your hand

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.280
and the monster that you destroyed to activate the pendulum effect .

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:06.080
We will have basicaly 3 of each Igknight pendulum monster.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.000
First we will have 3x  Igknight Caliber.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.140
3x Igknight  Musket.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.440
They are the low penduluns scale monsters .

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.720
3x  Igknight Eagle.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.600
3x Igknight Magnum .

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.180
3x Igknight Riot .

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.180
3x Igknight Dragunov .

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.440
and 1x Igknight Avenger , some persons do not like

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.140
but is effect is pretty cool and you can special summon it easily  using pendulum monsters that you summoned before.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.060
When you summon it you send your monsters to the extra because they are pendulum ,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.060
so you can pendulum summon they again making a new field .

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.840
For the same reason we will have 1x Stinger.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.060
We will have 1x Rescue hamster, because its effect allows  you add two penduluns monsters

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.760
with the same name to your hand, you use  three monsters of each Igknight  so this help

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.600
you add penduluns monsters to your hand and giving more speed for the deck .
