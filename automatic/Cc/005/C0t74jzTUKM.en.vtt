demonstrate how a plastic bottle trap is
used<00:00:07.630> to<00:00:07.870> capture<00:00:08.410> small<00:00:08.590> fish<00:00:09.130> along<00:00:10.059> the

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
used to capture small fish along the

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.000 
used to capture small fish along the
edges<00:00:10.539> of<00:00:10.570> a<00:00:10.809> stream<00:00:11.079> channel

this<00:00:15.640> bottle<00:00:16.090> craps<00:00:16.390> you<00:00:16.570> just<00:00:16.900> put<00:00:17.110> them

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
this bottle craps you just put them

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.730 
this bottle craps you just put them
along<00:00:17.290> the<00:00:17.650> edge<00:00:17.770> of<00:00:17.980> the<00:00:18.100> creek<00:00:18.610> channel<00:00:18.670> in

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
along the edge of the creek channel in

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.260 
along the edge of the creek channel in
what<00:00:20.740> looked<00:00:20.950> like<00:00:21.040> the<00:00:21.160> tract<00:00:21.490> of<00:00:21.520> habitats

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
what looked like the tract of habitats

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.620 
what looked like the tract of habitats
for<00:00:22.510> juvenile<00:00:22.990> trout<00:00:23.380> and<00:00:27.180> we'll<00:00:28.180> see<00:00:28.360> what<00:00:28.510> we

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
for juvenile trout and we'll see what we

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:36.720 
for juvenile trout and we'll see what we
caught<00:00:28.900> in<00:00:29.080> this<00:00:29.170> first<00:00:29.470> one<00:00:29.710> here<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:36.250> we<00:00:36.580> got

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
caught in this first one here and we got

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.860 
caught in this first one here and we got
a<00:00:36.760> bunch<00:00:36.970> of<00:00:37.150> fish<00:00:37.449> I<00:00:39.059> don't<00:00:40.059> know<00:00:40.540> if<00:00:40.690> there's

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
a bunch of fish I don't know if there's

a bunch of fish I don't know if there's
any<00:00:41.020> trout<00:00:41.410> in<00:00:41.590> there<00:00:41.770> but<00:00:42.010> I'll<00:00:42.129> just<00:00:42.160> put<00:00:42.910> my
