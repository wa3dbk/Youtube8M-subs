adventures 2010 recently built a two

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.189 
adventures 2010 recently built a two
piece<00:00:13.710> table<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.660> one<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.809> problems<00:00:16.109> we

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
piece table and one of the problems we

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.340 
piece table and one of the problems we
face<00:00:16.379> with<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.990> you<00:00:18.990> know<00:00:19.080> when<00:00:19.260> you

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
face with this is you know when you

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.400 
face with this is you know when you
actually<00:00:19.500> put<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.520> two<00:00:20.699> pieces<00:00:20.850> together<00:00:21.410> you

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
actually put the two pieces together you

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.750 
actually put the two pieces together you
know<00:00:22.529> how<00:00:22.890> do<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.070> hold<00:00:23.160> them<00:00:23.310> together<00:00:23.430> to

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
know how do you hold them together to

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.220 
know how do you hold them together to
keep<00:00:23.910> people<00:00:24.180> from<00:00:24.210> like<00:00:24.480> bumping<00:00:24.810> them<00:00:24.930> apart

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
keep people from like bumping them apart

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.109 
keep people from like bumping them apart
and<00:00:25.380> stuff<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.830> middle<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.099> your<00:00:26.189> game<00:00:26.400> you

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and stuff in the middle of your game you

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.759 
and stuff in the middle of your game you
know<00:00:27.210> one<00:00:27.420> models<00:00:27.960> falling<00:00:28.260> down<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> cracks

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
know one models falling down the cracks

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.900 
know one models falling down the cracks
in<00:00:28.949> between<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> two<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.240> here's<00:00:30.480> my<00:00:31.910> here's

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
in between the two so here's my here's

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.350 
in between the two so here's my here's
one<00:00:33.149> half<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.480> my<00:00:33.600> table<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:35.149> there's<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
one half of my table and there's the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.389 
one half of my table and there's the
other<00:00:36.450> half<00:00:36.570> there<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.050> bought<00:00:37.290> these<00:00:37.469> last

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
other half there I bought these last

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.410 
other half there I bought these last
spring<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.260> I<00:00:40.260> said<00:00:40.890> use<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:41.790> kind<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.300> like

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
spring and I said use like kind of like

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.959 
spring and I said use like kind of like
giant<00:00:42.809> staples<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.770> hold<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.340> together<00:00:44.520> what

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
giant staples to hold this together what

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.139 
giant staples to hold this together what
I<00:00:45.000> did<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:45.539> was<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.649> drilled<00:00:47.579> holes<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
I did here was I drilled holes on the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.170 
I did here was I drilled holes on the
side<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:49.530> put<00:00:49.770> magnets<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.430> there<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.940> I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
side and then put magnets in there and I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.979 
side and then put magnets in there and I
put<00:00:52.219> put<00:00:53.219> magnets<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.969> both<00:00:54.180> sides<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.809> that

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
put put magnets in in both sides so that

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.990 
put put magnets in in both sides so that
they<00:00:55.140> actually<00:00:55.440> stick<00:00:55.680> together<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:56.789> you

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
they actually stick together when you

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.360 
they actually stick together when you
bring<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> two<00:00:57.719> pieces<00:00:57.930> together<00:00:58.370> now

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
bring the two pieces together now

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.439 
bring the two pieces together now
obviously<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.879> important<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.270> get<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
obviously it's important to get the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.880 
obviously it's important to get the
polarity<00:01:00.899> right<00:01:01.079> there<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.739> don't

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
polarity right there because you don't

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.009 
polarity right there because you don't
want<00:01:02.070> your<00:01:02.250> two<00:01:03.000> pieces<00:01:03.149> pushing<00:01:03.600> apart<00:01:03.870> you

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
want your two pieces pushing apart you

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.679 
want your two pieces pushing apart you
want<00:01:04.140> him<00:01:04.229> pulling<00:01:04.379> together<00:01:07.460> there's<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.689> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
want him pulling together there's a the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.929 
want him pulling together there's a the
biggest<00:01:09.900> magnet<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.530> used<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.070> think<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
biggest magnet I used I think in the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.700 
biggest magnet I used I think in the
future<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.299> want<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.659> probably<00:01:13.290> use<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> little

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
future I want to probably use a little

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.080 
future I want to probably use a little
bigger<00:01:14.040> maintenance<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.760> was<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> little

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
bigger maintenance so it was a little

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.359 
bigger maintenance so it was a little
stronger<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:16.080> all<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> did<00:01:16.740> was<00:01:16.890> drill<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> hole

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
stronger but all I did was drill a hole

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.490 
stronger but all I did was drill a hole
push<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.090> magnet<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.960> then<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.380> cover

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
push the magnet in and then just cover

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.560 
push the magnet in and then just cover
it<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.770> epoxy

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
it in epoxy

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.510 
it in epoxy
once<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.780> had<00:01:21.990> one<00:01:22.200> side<00:01:22.439> done<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.250> was<00:01:23.369> all

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
once I had one side done and it was all

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.420 
once I had one side done and it was all
dried<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.299> stuck<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> magnet<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
dried I stuck the magnet to it for the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.580 
dried I stuck the magnet to it for the
other<00:01:26.610> side<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:27.869> pushed<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.409> two

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
other side and then pushed the two

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.539 
other side and then pushed the two
pieces<00:01:29.310> together<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:30.119> make<00:01:31.009> an<00:01:32.009> imprint<00:01:32.310> on

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
pieces together to make an imprint on

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.249 
pieces together to make an imprint on
the<00:01:33.119> other<00:01:33.270> piece<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.659> knew<00:01:33.840> where<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:33.990> drill

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the other piece so I knew where to drill

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.429 
the other piece so I knew where to drill
so<00:01:34.439> everything<00:01:34.710> was<00:01:34.829> lined<00:01:34.979> up<00:01:35.189> perfectly

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
so everything was lined up perfectly

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.810 
so everything was lined up perfectly
um<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.680> real<00:01:37.799> nice<00:01:37.950> because<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.430> know<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.579> got

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
um it's real nice because you know I got

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.580 
um it's real nice because you know I got
my<00:01:39.030> tables<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.600> leaning<00:01:40.140> up<00:01:40.259> against<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
my tables just leaning up against the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.800 
my tables just leaning up against the
wall<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:42.329> phone<00:01:42.570> was

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
wall like this and the phone was

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.230 
wall like this and the phone was
starting<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.200> warp<00:01:43.640> but<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> magnets<00:01:45.090> will

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
starting to warp but the magnets will

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.060 
starting to warp but the magnets will
actually<00:01:45.540> hold<00:01:45.659> them<00:01:45.780> straight<00:01:45.960> once<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.500> put

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
actually hold them straight once I put

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.499 
actually hold them straight once I put
it<00:01:47.159> together<00:01:47.280> because<00:01:47.579> they<00:01:47.909> kind<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.240> warped

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
it together because they kind of warped

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.830 
it together because they kind of warped
in<00:01:48.600> opposite<00:01:48.990> directions<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:51.509> only<00:01:51.720> other

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
in opposite directions the only other

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.910 
in opposite directions the only other
thing<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.110> think<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.380> change<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.220> only<00:01:53.490> put<00:01:53.820> a

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
thing I think I change is I only put a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.649 
thing I think I change is I only put a
magnet<00:01:55.920> there<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.490> then<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> magnet<00:01:57.360> all<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
magnet there and then a magnet all the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.990 
magnet there and then a magnet all the
way<00:01:57.750> down<00:01:57.930> at<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> bottom<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.770> probably<00:01:59.759> put

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
way down at the bottom I probably put

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.120 
way down at the bottom I probably put
one<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> middle<00:02:00.479> too<00:02:00.780> because<00:02:01.200> there's<00:02:02.040> a

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
one in the middle too because there's a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.520 
one in the middle too because there's a
bit<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.719> warp<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.350> middle<00:02:04.619> as<00:02:04.770> well<00:02:06.530> so

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
bit of a warp in the middle as well so

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.010 
bit of a warp in the middle as well so
there's<00:02:07.740> that's<00:02:08.220> my<00:02:08.459> gaming<00:02:09.420> table<00:02:09.840> here<00:02:09.989> I

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
there's that's my gaming table here I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.500 
there's that's my gaming table here I
got<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> cut<00:02:10.500> into<00:02:11.030> two<00:02:12.030> three<00:02:12.300> by<00:02:12.450> four

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
got a cut into two three by four

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.850 
got a cut into two three by four
sections<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.470> comes<00:02:13.620> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
sections so it comes to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.100 
sections so it comes to
to<00:02:14.160> make<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> 6x4<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.390> fits<00:02:15.630> in<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> trunk

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
to make a 6x4 and it fits in the trunk

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.800 
to make a 6x4 and it fits in the trunk
of<00:02:16.200> my<00:02:16.260> car<00:02:16.700> just<00:02:17.700> kind<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:17.970> nice<00:02:18.090> if<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.450> ever<00:02:18.570> go

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
of my car just kind of nice if I ever go

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.170 
of my car just kind of nice if I ever go
anywhere

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
anywhere

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.690 
anywhere
I<00:02:21.210> just<00:02:22.020> textured<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.500> with<00:02:22.620> sand<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.640> know

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
I just textured it with sand you know

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.160 
I just textured it with sand you know
glue<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.030> sand<00:02:24.240> down<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.630> then<00:02:24.720> painted<00:02:25.080> it

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
glue the sand down and then painted it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.400 
glue the sand down and then painted it
up<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.590> then<00:02:26.510> glued<00:02:27.510> some<00:02:27.660> flock<00:02:27.900> down<00:02:27.930> over

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
up and then glued some flock down over

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.040 
up and then glued some flock down over
that<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:29.430> flock<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.670> just<00:02:30.090> saying<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.480> sawdust

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
that the flock is just saying it sawdust

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.590 
that the flock is just saying it sawdust
that<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.290> died
