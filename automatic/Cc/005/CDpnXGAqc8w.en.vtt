00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.699
 the craftsman was the first to arouse interest in music 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.819
 because he is 4 years older 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.400
 then he started to play alone by then 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.619
 I still do not 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.230
 did not accompany her sister 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.070
 elano arrived later so get later to start singing with me 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.220
 It was one night as soon as it was out of the light. 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.390
 I was there and we went out with my guitar 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.730
 Then the cta with the song you'll see 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.970
 zezé di camargo and luciano 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.220
 and I did not reach her refrain can not reach very high producer 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.240
 country music has a lot of it 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.190
 and then 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.170
 The Netherlands arrived, everything was dark so I was there 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.750
 with the guitar singing and she arrived 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.960
 and started to sing the chorus 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.390
 and other ways I started with this second black bike 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.870
 and I said 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.220
 I think elano also has the gift of music where he was born to sing 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.220
 in fact I was already playing for 17 years 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.860
 but 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.439
 I was not interested 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.229
 to pursue a professional career only sang without 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.900
 the joke 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.900
 and it was from then on we started rehearsing 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.030
 start the air 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.200
 the idea of ​​singing together 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.290
 by the time I started singing it was very evident how the doubles as 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.950
 joão paulo daniel leandro and leonardo 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.460
 the eyes are paio 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.990
 and certainly one of the doubles that 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.170
 but it was a reference for me 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.200
 It was joão paulo daniel 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.910
 mebaza much in their career in their history 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.659
 and this is how he aroused the greatest interest in pro music. 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.470
 so it was reaching 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.230
 the success that the hudson moment would like you to tell this story of 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.270
 her job 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.660
 I do not think you even buy more 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.840
 so far since you started in the management 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.050
 not really if when I started web it was a choice 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.660
 I think I always went 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.859
 Marcu the fate of my life would say yes that way 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.980
 because until then I worked as a mason 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.779
 and I was able to put some money together 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:22.289
 I could not even put together money at the time, I know what you feel and only a few dollars 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.209
 so I had bought wanted to buy a guitar with the horse 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.819
 this time all my friends a year 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.760
 I dealt with cabalero is very involved in rodeo 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.209
 miner of things have got 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.610
 all animals a horse pasture ii more 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.980
 I used to like guitar just imagine if the father did not want him to buy a 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.659
 horse say that there was no place 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.599
 to take home and not accept that he bought horse and it was so 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.959
 strong 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.959
 I thought about this moment a lot and I ended up buying a guitar 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:59.479
 and then everything started, I do not think 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.699
 part of a simple decision 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.809
 our life 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.569
 Then I started learning guitar. 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.019
 the first guitar making course 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.819
 whenever I am encouraging me much speaks narration 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.129
 is going very well and continue to fartal learn guitar I started to do 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.309
 keyboard 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:21.309
 and so on honestly by instrument 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:25.409
 and so it was with the money he earned 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:26.989
 worked all day 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.420
 he bought 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.809
 little by little these things become necessary 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:34.079
 understand that such a microphone 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.169
 the keyboard at that time I was still in the first 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.389
 with the music and still working also as serpentine he 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.949
 I studied at night 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.439
 and then start doing barzinho soon 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.749
 I do not know how to play main shows 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:54.799
 birthday party until total remarriage this season 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:57.499
 in the morning 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:59.369
 after that period 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:00.639
 after all 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.939
 thing I saw she had talent and such 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.510
 I speak German I think if I could start from there I started to 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.829
 sing with membership in a bar s 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.299
 and also every Wednesday in enchanted years and the elderly 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.259
 but I was more of a break so to have his voice because he sang 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.809
 all that time 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:25.180
 and it was alone so I sang more ready to give him a rest 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.460
 and also took it very seriously so I never thought 'I have 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.990
 I wanted to follow even that 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.159
 in a professional way 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:36.419
 so it took more because those people watching me 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.699
 I signed I did not resist and I went away so I did not feel very well 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.409
 I liked to sing 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.419
 I really enjoyed singing 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.419
 but did not intend to take seriously 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.860
 at this time we started to make bar 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.449
 it is clear that we have 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.589
 I was 10 years old 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:03.770
 larsson was 14 years old 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.360
 Nobody got hurt 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.029
 my two great influences of the image this is a lie 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:13.370
 It's true, my children, I used to do it. 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.180
 in our city 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.319
 It's always had a lot 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.639
 much as our parents 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.240

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.080
 in this period 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.339
 we had to vote for relatives 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:35.490

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.490

 people want us to do 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.849
