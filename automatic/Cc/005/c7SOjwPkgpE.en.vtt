00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
they get to a really hard part they'll

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.740 
they get to a really hard part they'll
have<00:01:08.250> no<00:01:08.430> idea<00:01:08.760> how<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.060> play<00:01:09.300> it<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
should be played or how to work on it so

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.670 
should be played or how to work on it so
that<00:01:12.090> eventually<00:01:12.510> they'll<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.290> able<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> play

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
that eventually they'll be able to play

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.310 
that eventually they'll be able to play
it<00:01:13.799> well<00:01:14.450> so<00:01:15.450> when<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.719> put<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.020> all<00:01:16.110> together

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
it well so when they put it all together

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.039 
it well so when they put it all together
some<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.369> may<00:01:17.399> go<00:01:17.700> well<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.630> lot<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.869> it

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
some of it may go well and a lot of it

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.039 
some of it may go well and a lot of it
falls<00:01:19.290> apart<00:01:19.740> very<00:01:20.729> often<00:01:21.000> students<00:01:21.780> don't

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
falls apart very often students don't

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.899 
falls apart very often students don't
even<00:01:22.290> put<00:01:22.469> things<00:01:22.710> together<00:01:22.920> they<00:01:23.579> have<00:01:23.640> lots

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
even put things together they have lots

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.999 
even put things together they have lots
of<00:01:24.119> songs<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.689> pieces<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.350> music<00:01:25.530> hanging

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
of songs and pieces of music hanging

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.609 
of songs and pieces of music hanging
around<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.700> are<00:01:26.789> just<00:01:26.969> that<00:01:27.180> pieces<00:01:27.960> they

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
around that are just that pieces they

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.810 
around that are just that pieces they
can't<00:01:28.890> really<00:01:29.009> play<00:01:29.250> anything<00:01:29.549> from

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
can't really play anything from

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.609 
can't really play anything from
beginning<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.299> end<00:01:30.329> without<00:01:31.020> having<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
beginning to end without having the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.529 
beginning to end without having the
music<00:01:31.920> fall<00:01:32.159> apart<00:01:32.460> at<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.640> hard<00:01:32.909> spots<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
music fall apart at the hard spots and

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.539 
music fall apart at the hard spots and
that's<00:01:34.140> all<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:34.890> don't<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.189> how

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
that's all because they don't know how

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.300 
that's all because they don't know how
to<00:01:35.579> practice<00:01:36.119> correctly<00:01:36.859> when<00:01:37.859> you<00:01:38.039> sit<00:01:38.280> down

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
to practice correctly when you sit down

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
to practice correctly when you sit down
to<00:01:38.460> practice<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.450> are<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> teacher<00:01:40.020> that

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
to practice you are the teacher that

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.709 
to practice you are the teacher that
means<00:01:41.250> most<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.759> time<00:01:42.000> you're<00:01:42.509> your<00:01:42.689> own

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
means most of the time you're your own

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.929 
means most of the time you're your own
guitar<00:01:42.960> teacher<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:44.189> teacher<00:01:44.219> you<00:01:44.729> take

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939

lessons<00:01:45.420> from<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:45.990> very<00:01:46.229> little<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.590> make

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
lessons from can do very little to make

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.349 
lessons from can do very little to make
you<00:01:46.920> play<00:01:47.130> better<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.880> don't<00:01:48.030> know<00:01:48.210> how<00:01:48.329> to

you play better if you don't know how to

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.149 
you play better if you don't know how to
teach<00:01:48.630> yourself<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.259> train<00:01:49.619> your<00:01:49.770> fingers

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
teach yourself and train your fingers

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.550 
teach yourself and train your fingers
when<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.460> practice<00:01:50.969> and<00:01:51.180> that's<00:01:51.899> why<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.200> teach

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
when you practice and that's why I teach

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.209 
when you practice and that's why I teach
everyone<00:01:52.950> how<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.549> practice<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.560> how<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.039> I<00:01:56.159> do

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
everyone how to practice so how do I do

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.599 
everyone how to practice so how do I do
this<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.759> do<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.929> by<00:01:58.049> teaching<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.890> loss<00:01:59.280> of

this I do it by teaching you a loss of

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.609 
this I do it by teaching you a loss of
how<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.030> fingers<00:02:00.539> learn<00:02:00.750> new<00:02:00.960> movements<00:02:01.439> and

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
how the fingers learn new movements and

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.529 
how the fingers learn new movements and

and I mean anyone who uses these methods

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.479 
and I mean anyone who uses these methods
will<00:02:18.810> learn<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.500> teach<00:02:19.709> themselves<00:02:19.980> whatever

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489

same work that the pros actually do to

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.800 
same work that the pros actually do to
play<00:02:31.860> at<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.099> level<00:02:32.159> but<00:02:33.060> that's<00:02:33.239> up<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.599> you
