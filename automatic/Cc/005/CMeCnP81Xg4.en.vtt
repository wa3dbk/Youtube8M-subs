inflicted a lot of damage that one was

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.150 
inflicted a lot of damage that one was
only<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> approximate<00:00:40.230> size<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.800> kitchen

only the approximate size of a kitchen
table<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:42.270> asteroid<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:43.219> 150<00:00:44.219> feet<00:00:44.520> wide

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
table this asteroid was 150 feet wide

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.360 
table this asteroid was 150 feet wide
now<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> don't<00:00:46.469> know<00:00:46.559> about<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:46.980> when<00:00:47.219> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
now I don't know about you but when I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.850 
now I don't know about you but when I
hear<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> terms<00:00:48.090> asteroid<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.200> meteor<00:00:49.559> and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
hear the terms asteroid and meteor and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.470 
hear the terms asteroid and meteor and
things<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.309> i<00:00:50.700> always<00:00:50.789> think<00:00:51.270> of

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
things like that i always think of

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.510 
things like that i always think of
hollywood<00:00:51.930> flicks<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.530> armageddon<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
hollywood flicks like armageddon and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.209 
hollywood flicks like armageddon and
deep<00:00:53.879> impact<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:55.140> what<00:00:55.410> would<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:55.980> be

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
deep impact but what would it really be

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.430 
deep impact but what would it really be
like<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:56.879> an<00:00:57.000> asteroid<00:00:57.510> or<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> meteor<00:00:58.050> hit<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
like if an asteroid or a meteor hit the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.889 
like if an asteroid or a meteor hit the

about all this media hype that was

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.940 
about all this media hype that was
surrounded<00:01:10.020> by<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.140> asteroid<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.710> just

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
surrounded by this asteroid that just

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.280 
surrounded by this asteroid that just
passed<00:01:11.159> by<00:01:11.280> how<00:01:12.180> close<00:01:12.450> was<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
passed by how close was it really to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.230 
passed by how close was it really to
earth<00:01:13.350> well<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.950> didn't<00:01:14.280> hit<00:01:14.400> us<00:01:14.460> that's<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
earth well it didn't hit us that's the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.060 
earth well it didn't hit us that's the
good<00:01:15.390> news<00:01:15.680> it<00:01:16.680> passed<00:01:17.159> within<00:01:17.750> about<00:01:19.070> 17,000

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
good news it passed within about 17,000

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.010 
good news it passed within about 17,000
miles<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.970> surface<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> earth<00:01:21.600> that's

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
miles of the surface of the earth that's

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.660 
miles of the surface of the earth that's
actually<00:01:22.470> inside<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.009> belt<00:01:23.460> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
actually inside the belt of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.999 
actually inside the belt of
geostationary<00:01:24.600> communication<00:01:25.439> satellites

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
geostationary communication satellites

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.730 
geostationary communication satellites
which<00:01:26.340> relay<00:01:27.180> your<00:01:27.659> programs<00:01:28.200> around<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
which relay your programs around the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.590 
which relay your programs around the
world<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.960> terms<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.799> how<00:01:32.310> close<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:32.909> it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
world so in terms of how close it was it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.190 
world so in terms of how close it was it
was<00:01:33.960> pretty<00:01:34.170> close<00:01:34.439> now<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:36.479> point<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.900> though

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
was pretty close now the point is though

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
was pretty close now the point is though
that<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.619> did<00:01:37.860> miss<00:01:38.130> us<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.880> big<00:01:39.119> thing

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
that it did miss us the the big thing

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.690 
that it did miss us the the big thing
about<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.780> particular<00:01:40.049> asteroid<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.430> that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
about this particular asteroid is that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.560 
about this particular asteroid is that
it<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> largest<00:01:42.540> one<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.079> its<00:01:43.520> size

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
it is the largest one of its size

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.590 
it is the largest one of its size
caliber<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:46.500> come<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.070> close<00:01:47.360> since<00:01:48.360> we've

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
caliber to come this close since we've

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.990 
caliber to come this close since we've
been<00:01:48.810> observing<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.320> heavens<00:01:49.649> now<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.880> have

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
been observing the heavens now we have

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.179 
been observing the heavens now we have
only<00:01:51.149> been<00:01:51.360> able<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.750> observe<00:01:52.200> objects<00:01:52.979> of

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
only been able to observe objects of

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.240 
only been able to observe objects of
this<00:01:53.399> size<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.210> predict<00:01:54.750> their<00:01:54.990> paths<00:01:55.350> within

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
this size and predict their paths within

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.980 
this size and predict their paths within
perhaps<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.060> last<00:01:57.270> 20<00:01:57.659> years<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.460> an

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
perhaps the last 20 years so we have an

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.590 
perhaps the last 20 years so we have an
inventory<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.670> several<00:02:02.670> thousand<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.479> these

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
inventory of several thousand of these

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.200 
inventory of several thousand of these
objects<00:02:04.290> whose<00:02:04.530> orbital<00:02:05.130> paths<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:05.729> know<00:02:05.939> we

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
objects whose orbital paths we know we

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.550 
objects whose orbital paths we know we
know<00:02:06.390> when<00:02:06.570> they're<00:02:06.689> going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> come<00:02:07.049> close<00:02:07.290> to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
know when they're going to come close to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.130 
know when they're going to come close to
us<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.369> forth<00:02:08.599> but<00:02:09.599> we<00:02:09.810> don't

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
us and so on and so forth but we don't

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.680 
us and so on and so forth but we don't
know<00:02:10.410> where<00:02:10.440> they<00:02:10.770> all<00:02:10.800> are<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.390> some

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
know where they all are so this in some

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.380 
know where they all are so this in some
ways<00:02:12.900> is

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
ways is

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.540 
ways is
of<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.569> wake-up<00:02:13.780> call<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.560> us<00:02:14.710> because<00:02:14.980> there

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
of a wake-up call to us because there

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.360 
of a wake-up call to us because there
are<00:02:15.760> other<00:02:16.060> objects<00:02:16.840> out<00:02:16.990> there<00:02:17.020> which<00:02:18.010> will

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
are other objects out there which will

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.610 
are other objects out there which will
come<00:02:18.760> close<00:02:19.030> which<00:02:19.569> will<00:02:19.840> probably<00:02:20.170> come

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
come close which will probably come

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.309 
come close which will probably come
closer<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.310> as<00:02:22.209> was<00:02:22.510> very<00:02:22.900> aptly

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
closer and as was very aptly

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.090 
closer and as was very aptly
demonstrated<00:02:23.590> this<00:02:24.310> morning<00:02:24.819> over<00:02:25.060> Russia

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
demonstrated this morning over Russia

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.490 
demonstrated this morning over Russia
can<00:02:27.100> actually<00:02:27.730> hit<00:02:28.030> us<00:02:28.209> now<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:28.990> difference

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
can actually hit us now the difference

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.350 
can actually hit us now the difference
between<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.100> one<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.550> hit<00:02:30.730> over<00:02:31.120> Russia

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
between the one that hit over Russia

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.540 
between the one that hit over Russia
this<00:02:31.690> morning<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.910> 2012<00:02:33.930> da14<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.890> on<00:02:36.370> the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
this morning and 2012 da14 is on the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.390 
this morning and 2012 da14 is on the
order<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.880> one<00:02:37.209> or<00:02:37.360> two<00:02:37.510> orders<00:02:38.050> of<00:02:38.080> magnitude

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
order of one or two orders of magnitude

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.100 
order of one or two orders of magnitude
in<00:02:39.400> size<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:41.160> we<00:02:42.160> see<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.670> fair<00:02:43.150> number<00:02:43.420> of<00:02:43.630> these

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
in size so we see a fair number of these

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.070 
in size so we see a fair number of these
smaller<00:02:44.650> meter<00:02:45.190> size<00:02:45.610> objects<00:02:46.510> enter<00:02:46.930> the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
smaller meter size objects enter the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.040 
smaller meter size objects enter the
Earth's<00:02:47.260> atmosphere<00:02:47.620> burn<00:02:48.520> up<00:02:48.730> or<00:02:49.020> come<00:02:50.020> down

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
Earth's atmosphere burn up or come down

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.270 
Earth's atmosphere burn up or come down
more<00:02:50.739> or<00:02:50.920> less<00:02:50.980> harmlessly<00:02:51.670> in<00:02:51.940> places<00:02:53.280> almost

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
more or less harmlessly in places almost

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.270 
more or less harmlessly in places almost
all<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.610> time<00:02:54.820> there's<00:02:55.750> something<00:02:56.110> like

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
all the time there's something like

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.120 
all the time there's something like
10,000<00:02:57.280> tons<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:58.290> meteoric<00:02:59.290> material<00:02:59.950> that

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
10,000 tons of meteoric material that

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.160 
10,000 tons of meteoric material that
rains<00:03:00.489> down<00:03:00.850> continuously<00:03:01.600> on<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.050> earth

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
rains down continuously on the earth

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.030 
rains down continuously on the earth
every<00:03:02.380> day<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.420> let<00:03:05.410> me<00:03:05.440> ask<00:03:05.530> this<00:03:05.769> what<00:03:05.950> would

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
every day so let me ask this what would

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.340 
every day so let me ask this what would
happen<00:03:06.370> if<00:03:06.580> an<00:03:06.970> asteroid<00:03:07.510> hit<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.900> earth<00:03:08.019> I

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
happen if an asteroid hit the earth I

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.660 
happen if an asteroid hit the earth I
want<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.590> show<00:03:08.739> you<00:03:08.800> a<00:03:08.890> picture<00:03:09.160> really<00:03:09.340> fast

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
want to show you a picture really fast

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.310 
want to show you a picture really fast
this<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.269> picture<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.870> crater<00:03:11.110> in

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
this is a picture of the crater in

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.229 
this is a picture of the crater in
Arizona<00:03:11.739> commonly<00:03:12.250> known<00:03:12.400> as<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.820> Barringer

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
Arizona commonly known as the Barringer

Arizona commonly known as the Barringer
crater<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:13.780> was<00:03:14.170> created<00:03:14.380> about<00:03:14.850> 50,000<00:03:15.850> years

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
crater it was created about 50,000 years

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.270 
crater it was created about 50,000 years
ago<00:03:16.090> its<00:03:16.480> massive<00:03:17.350> obviously<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:17.980> mean<00:03:18.130> if

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
ago its massive obviously I mean if

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.580 
ago its massive obviously I mean if
something<00:03:18.549> like<00:03:18.670> this<00:03:18.730> were<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:19.870> hit<00:03:19.989> us<00:03:20.230> today

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
something like this were to hit us today

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.860 
something like this were to hit us today
what<00:03:21.160> type<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.340> damage<00:03:21.940> would<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.209> cause<00:03:22.360> well

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
what type of damage would it cause well

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.780 
what type of damage would it cause well
let's<00:03:23.170> consider<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.739> fact<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.160> if<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.670> were

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
let's consider the fact that if it were

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.160 
let's consider the fact that if it were
to<00:03:24.910> land<00:03:25.120> in<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.420> meat<00:03:25.570> in<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.840> middle<00:03:26.049> of<00:03:26.140> a

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
to land in the meat in the middle of a

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.229 
to land in the meat in the middle of a
major<00:03:26.320> metropolitan<00:03:26.650> area<00:03:27.489> so<00:03:27.790> for<00:03:28.150> instance

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
major metropolitan area so for instance

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.800 
major metropolitan area so for instance
if<00:03:28.690> 2012<00:03:29.650> da14<00:03:30.489> were<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.180> land<00:03:31.420> on<00:03:31.660> the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
if 2012 da14 were to land on the

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.530 
if 2012 da14 were to land on the
National<00:03:32.320> Mall<00:03:32.730> we<00:03:33.730> would<00:03:33.910> not<00:03:34.030> be<00:03:34.090> here<00:03:34.420> to

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
National Mall we would not be here to

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.810 
National Mall we would not be here to
talk<00:03:34.720> about<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.620> would<00:03:35.950> be<00:03:36.160> roughly<00:03:36.489> the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
talk about it it would be roughly the

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.289 
talk about it it would be roughly the
equivalent<00:03:37.350> destruction<00:03:38.350> of<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.950> two<00:03:39.070> or<00:03:39.489> three

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
equivalent destruction of a two or three

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.710 
equivalent destruction of a two or three
Megaton<00:03:41.140> nuclear<00:03:41.579> warhead<00:03:42.579> so<00:03:43.299> we're<00:03:43.540> talking

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
Megaton nuclear warhead so we're talking

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.830 
Megaton nuclear warhead so we're talking
about<00:03:44.310> basically<00:03:45.310> blast<00:03:45.880> damage<00:03:46.480> that<00:03:46.720> would

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
about basically blast damage that would

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.750 
about basically blast damage that would
probably<00:03:47.410> wipe<00:03:47.680> out<00:03:47.950> most<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.579> structures

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
probably wipe out most of the structures

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.430 
probably wipe out most of the structures
in<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.299> District<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.780> Columbia<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.350> the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
in the District of Columbia and the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.500 
in the District of Columbia and the
surrounding<00:03:50.950> suburbs<00:03:51.160> so<00:03:52.000> just<00:03:52.299> the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
surrounding suburbs so just the

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.990 
surrounding suburbs so just the
tri-state<00:03:52.900> area<00:03:52.930> or<00:03:53.350> beyond<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:53.920> would<00:03:54.850> be

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
tri-state area or beyond that would be

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.150 
tri-state area or beyond that would be
within<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.510> Beltway<00:03:55.799> there<00:03:56.799> are<00:03:56.920> probably

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
within the Beltway there are probably

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.890 
within the Beltway there are probably
some<00:03:57.519> people<00:03:57.910> that<00:03:58.000> would<00:03:58.150> argue<00:03:58.510> that<00:03:58.540> might

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
some people that would argue that might

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.160 
some people that would argue that might
be<00:03:59.049> a<00:03:59.079> good<00:03:59.350> thing<00:03:59.410> but<00:04:00.299> not<00:04:01.299> as<00:04:01.690> far<00:04:01.870> as<00:04:01.900> I'm

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
be a good thing but not as far as I'm

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.630 
be a good thing but not as far as I'm

concerned but in terms of you know
planet-wide<00:04:07.540> destruction<00:04:08.440> that's<00:04:08.620> still<00:04:08.890> a

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
planet-wide destruction that's still a

relatively small a relatively small

relatively small a relatively small
event<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:14.019> is<00:04:14.320> generally<00:04:15.130> accepted<00:04:15.430> now<00:04:16.030> that

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
event it is generally accepted now that

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.719 
event it is generally accepted now that
an<00:04:16.720> asteroid<00:04:17.380> perhaps<00:04:19.140> 15<00:04:20.140> kilometers<00:04:21.039> or<00:04:21.400> so

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
an asteroid perhaps 15 kilometers or so

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.980 
an asteroid perhaps 15 kilometers or so
in<00:04:21.970> diameter<00:04:22.800> impacted<00:04:23.820> about<00:04:24.820> 65<00:04:25.599> million

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.150

years<00:04:26.320> ago

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
years ago

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.360 
years ago
and<00:04:27.250> that<00:04:28.000> event<00:04:28.450> basically<00:04:29.020> ended<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:30.190> rule

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
and that event basically ended the rule

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.200 
and that event basically ended the rule
of<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.610> dinosaurs<00:04:31.290> so<00:04:32.640> even<00:04:33.640> though<00:04:33.670> we're

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
of the dinosaurs so even though we're

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.150 
of the dinosaurs so even though we're
talking<00:04:34.570> vast<00:04:35.020> differences<00:04:35.680> in<00:04:35.830> scale<00:04:36.130> here

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
talking vast differences in scale here

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.470 
talking vast differences in scale here
but<00:04:36.730> every<00:04:37.360> time<00:04:37.660> you<00:04:37.870> increase<00:04:38.590> by<00:04:38.890> say<00:04:39.480> one

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
but every time you increase by say one

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.170 
but every time you increase by say one
order<00:04:40.750> of<00:04:40.870> magnitude<00:04:41.020> in<00:04:41.920> the<00:04:42.100> size<00:04:42.460> of<00:04:42.940> the

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
order of magnitude in the size of the

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.170 
order of magnitude in the size of the
object<00:04:43.750> you're<00:04:43.960> increasing<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.800> volume<00:04:45.730> and

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
object you're increasing the volume and

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.300 
object you're increasing the volume and
the<00:04:46.300> mass<00:04:46.570> of<00:04:46.810> that<00:04:47.020> object<00:04:47.230> by<00:04:47.710> a<00:04:47.740> factor<00:04:48.130> of

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
the mass of that object by a factor of

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.550 
the mass of that object by a factor of
three<00:04:48.700> or<00:04:48.820> four<00:04:49.120> orders<00:04:49.570> of<00:04:49.600> magnitude<00:04:50.320> and

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
three or four orders of magnitude and

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.390 
three or four orders of magnitude and
therefore<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.460> destructive<00:04:52.060> power<00:04:52.090> so<00:04:52.780> is<00:04:53.110> it

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
therefore the destructive power so is it

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.220 
therefore the destructive power so is it
inevitable<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.640> we<00:04:55.150> are<00:04:55.660> going<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:55.960> be<00:04:56.050> hit

inevitable that we are going to be hit

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.380 
inevitable that we are going to be hit
by<00:04:56.350> asteroids<00:04:56.920> it's<00:04:57.640> just<00:04:58.060> going<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.300> happen

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
by asteroids it's just going to happen

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.360 
by asteroids it's just going to happen
whether<00:04:58.720> it's<00:04:58.900> 20<00:04:59.200> years<00:04:59.410> or<00:04:59.590> 2,000<00:05:00.250> years

sights of something out there we don't
know<00:05:06.670> I<00:05:06.970> can<00:05:07.270> tell<00:05:07.450> you<00:05:07.600> confidently<00:05:08.500> that<00:05:08.980> of

know I can tell you confidently that of

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.270 
know I can tell you confidently that of
the<00:05:09.550> thirteen<00:05:10.450> hundred<00:05:10.810> or<00:05:10.990> so<00:05:11.280> known

the thirteen hundred or so known

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.300 
the thirteen hundred or so known
near-earth<00:05:13.170> asteroids<00:05:14.170> none<00:05:14.860> of<00:05:15.010> them<00:05:15.160> are

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
near-earth asteroids none of them are

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.130 
near-earth asteroids none of them are
going<00:05:15.490> to<00:05:15.580> hit<00:05:15.730> us<00:05:15.910> within<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.360> next<00:05:16.600> thousand

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
going to hit us within the next thousand

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.870 
going to hit us within the next thousand
years<00:05:17.200> but<00:05:17.620> what<00:05:17.800> I<00:05:17.830> can't<00:05:18.190> tell<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.610> anything

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
years but what I can't tell you anything

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.290 
years but what I can't tell you anything
about<00:05:19.150> is<00:05:19.510> the<00:05:20.200> other<00:05:20.440> two<00:05:21.340> or<00:05:21.370> three<00:05:21.760> thousand

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
about is the other two or three thousand

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.270 
about is the other two or three thousand
of<00:05:22.480> those<00:05:22.810> objects<00:05:23.590> that<00:05:23.800> we<00:05:23.950> haven't

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
of those objects that we haven't

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.010 
of those objects that we haven't
discovered<00:05:24.640> yet<00:05:25.800> so<00:05:27.360> it's<00:05:28.360> something<00:05:28.660> that<00:05:28.900> we

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
discovered yet so it's something that we

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.750 
discovered yet so it's something that we
do<00:05:29.170> have<00:05:29.380> to<00:05:29.560> keep<00:05:29.740> an<00:05:29.890> eye<00:05:30.010> on<00:05:30.040> it<00:05:30.520> has

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
do have to keep an eye on it has

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.420 
do have to keep an eye on it has
happened<00:05:31.240> in<00:05:31.330> historic<00:05:31.930> times<00:05:32.160> there<00:05:33.160> was<00:05:33.310> an

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
very remote area it was so remote that

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.570 
very remote area it was so remote that
it<00:05:56.050> took<00:05:56.200> them<00:05:56.380> almost<00:05:56.530> 20<00:05:57.010> years<00:05:57.130> to<00:05:57.340> get<00:05:57.430> an

it took them almost 20 years to get an

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.930 
it took them almost 20 years to get an
expedition<00:05:58.150> in<00:05:58.300> there<00:05:58.510> to<00:05:58.630> study<00:05:58.900> it<00:05:59.169> but<00:05:59.940> it

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
expedition in there to study it but it

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.360 
expedition in there to study it but it
can<00:06:01.270> happen<00:06:01.300> it's<00:06:02.169> a<00:06:02.290> very<00:06:02.590> interesting<00:06:02.830> topic

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
can happen it's a very interesting topic

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.280 
can happen it's a very interesting topic
and<00:06:03.820> i'm<00:06:03.940> sure<00:06:04.180> this<00:06:04.570> is<00:06:04.630> not<00:06:04.750> going<00:06:04.990> to<00:06:05.050> be<00:06:05.169> the

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
and i'm sure this is not going to be the

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.870 
and i'm sure this is not going to be the
last<00:06:05.470> time<00:06:05.680> that<00:06:05.740> we<00:06:06.070> hear<00:06:06.280> about<00:06:06.310> something

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
last time that we hear about something

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.610 
last time that we hear about something
like<00:06:07.030> this<00:06:07.150> happening<00:06:07.600> and<00:06:07.840> questions<00:06:08.410> being

like this happening and questions being
