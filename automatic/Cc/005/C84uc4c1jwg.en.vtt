00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
amount of space i got to move about if i

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.360 
amount of space i got to move about if i
do<00:00:45.339> that<00:00:45.699> you'll<00:00:45.940> see<00:00:46.059> my<00:00:46.150> hands<00:00:46.510> disappear

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
and i've also had to stand the camera on

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.009 
and i've also had to stand the camera on
its<00:00:50.979> side<00:00:51.309> so<00:00:51.670> that<00:00:51.940> it<00:00:52.030> can<00:00:52.180> record<00:00:52.449> this<00:00:52.750> and

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
its side so that it can record this and

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.570 
its side so that it can record this and
get<00:00:53.320> all<00:00:53.589> of<00:00:53.860> me<00:00:54.010> in<00:00:54.269> so<00:00:55.290> i<00:00:56.290> can<00:00:57.070> actually<00:00:57.250> walk

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.869 
get all of me in so i can actually walk
around<00:00:58.000> and<00:00:59.040> the<00:01:00.040> other<00:01:00.159> thing<00:01:00.400> i<00:01:00.460> can<00:01:00.610> do<00:01:00.699> is<00:01:00.729> i

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
can do that and turn to a different

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.789 
can do that and turn to a different
camera<00:01:03.129> position<00:01:04.049> now<00:01:05.049> one<00:01:05.260> of<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.470> things<00:01:05.530> i

and then actually present them all in

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.739 
and then actually present them all in
one<00:01:48.159> sort<00:01:48.999> of<00:01:49.170> program<00:01:50.170> so<00:01:51.159> that's<00:01:51.969> sort<00:01:52.509> of<00:01:52.630> an

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
one sort of program so that's sort of an

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:54.539 
one sort of program so that's sort of an
idea<00:01:53.049> I've<00:01:53.229> got<00:01:53.409> now<00:01:53.590> if<00:01:53.710> you<00:01:53.829> do<00:01:54.009> want<00:01:54.219> to<00:01:54.369> take

part if you've got a little snippet of

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.219 
part if you've got a little snippet of
video<00:01:56.740> that<00:01:56.979> you<00:01:57.039> think<00:01:57.280> quite<00:01:57.490> funny<00:01:57.819> and
