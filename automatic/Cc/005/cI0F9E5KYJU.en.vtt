prop now basically what I did was I took

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:26.700 
prop now basically what I did was I took
a<00:01:19.140> pillow<00:01:20.140> case<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:25.140> look<00:01:26.140> because<00:01:26.560> it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
a pillow case and just look because it

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.950 
a pillow case and just look because it
had<00:01:26.829> this<00:01:27.009> rim<00:01:27.369> on<00:01:27.609> this<00:01:27.789> braid<00:01:28.329> on<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.780> it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
had this rim on this braid on it it

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.099 
had this rim on this braid on it it
looked<00:01:29.200> like<00:01:29.409> a<00:01:29.890> bed<00:01:30.850> or<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:31.210> frame<00:01:31.689> bit<00:01:31.960> so

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
looked like a bed or a frame bit so

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.440 
looked like a bed or a frame bit so
that's<00:01:32.289> why<00:01:32.409> I<00:01:32.439> use<00:01:32.770> that<00:01:33.039> and<00:01:33.850> I<00:01:33.939> took<00:01:34.210> it<00:01:34.329> and

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
that's why I use that and I took it and

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.429 
that's why I use that and I took it and
I<00:01:34.569> started<00:01:34.990> off<00:01:35.079> by<00:01:35.939> cutting<00:01:36.939> small<00:01:37.780> circle

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
I started off by cutting small circle

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.499 
I started off by cutting small circle
and<00:01:38.710> cut<00:01:39.460> all<00:01:39.639> the<00:01:39.759> way<00:01:39.819> down<00:01:40.030> in<00:01:40.179> a<00:01:40.270> small

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
and cut all the way down in a small

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.359 
and cut all the way down in a small
circle<00:01:40.929> in<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.079> and<00:01:41.259> that's<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.889> fit<00:01:42.069> the<00:01:42.189> neck

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
circle in it and that's to fit the neck

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.010 
circle in it and that's to fit the neck
and<00:01:42.579> then<00:01:42.670> that<00:01:42.880> stretches<00:01:43.420> out<00:01:43.569> and<00:01:43.719> I<00:01:43.810> had<00:01:43.929> to

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
and then that stretches out and I had to

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.429 
and then that stretches out and I had to
play<00:01:44.229> with<00:01:44.259> that<00:01:44.619> a<00:01:44.649> lot<00:01:44.889> and<00:01:46.109> this<00:01:47.109> is<00:01:47.229> kind<00:01:47.409> of

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
fastened like this and then their necks

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.309

I<00:02:00.490> took<00:02:01.020> al<00:02:02.249> foldable<00:02:03.249> wire<00:02:03.609> that<00:02:04.509> I<00:02:04.569> find<00:02:04.840> at

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
I took al foldable wire that I find at

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:07.559 
I took al foldable wire that I find at
the<00:02:05.049> hardware<00:02:05.079> store<00:02:05.469> I<00:02:06.060> measured<00:02:07.060> how<00:02:07.179> big<00:02:07.450> it

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
the hardware store I measured how big it

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:08.960 
the hardware store I measured how big it
was<00:02:07.779> all<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.289> way<00:02:08.350> around

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
was all the way around

was all the way around
put<00:02:09.970> this<00:02:10.090> wire<00:02:10.420> in<00:02:10.899> all<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.740> way<00:02:11.800> around<00:02:12.130> the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
put this wire in all the way around the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.450 
put this wire in all the way around the
frame

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.600 

all<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.960> way<00:02:17.050> around<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.710> frame<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.340> this

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
all the way around the frame of this

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.690 
all the way around the frame of this
thing<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.300> put<00:02:19.510> this<00:02:19.660> wire<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:20.380> actually<00:02:21.280> hot

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
thing I put this wire I actually hot

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.410 
thing I put this wire I actually hot
glued<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.180> wire<00:02:22.710> all<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.770> way<00:02:24.460> around<00:02:25.000> so

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
glued the wire all the way around so

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.170 
glued the wire all the way around so
it's<00:02:26.200> right<00:02:26.500> up<00:02:26.710> against<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.220> braid<00:02:27.610> and

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
it's right up against this braid and

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.910 
it's right up against this braid and
what<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.600> does<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.050> holds<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.500> up<00:02:29.680> when

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
what that does is that holds it up when

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.030 
what that does is that holds it up when
you<00:02:30.040> hold<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.400> up<00:02:30.490> like<00:02:30.520> this<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:32.110> holds<00:02:32.710> it<00:02:32.830> up

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
you hold it up like this it holds it up

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.370 
you hold it up like this it holds it up
it<00:02:33.670> keeps<00:02:33.850> it<00:02:34.090> stiff<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:35.380> also<00:02:35.530> use<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.010> to

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
it keeps it stiff and I also use it to

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.950 
it keeps it stiff and I also use it to
fasten<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.500> together<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:39.280> have<00:02:39.610> two<00:02:40.180> loops<00:02:40.600> here

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
fasten it together I have two loops here

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.250 
fasten it together I have two loops here
I<00:02:41.640> have<00:02:42.640> two<00:02:42.850> loops<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.360> I<00:02:43.420> just<00:02:43.630> hook<00:02:43.990> those

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
I have two loops and I just hook those

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.830 
I have two loops and I just hook those
loops<00:02:44.590> behind<00:02:45.040> their<00:02:45.220> back<00:02:45.540> behind<00:02:46.540> their

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
loops behind their back behind their

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.680 
loops behind their back behind their
neck<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:48.310> on<00:02:48.490> this<00:02:48.640> side<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.060> see<00:02:49.330> it's<00:02:49.480> real

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
neck and on this side you see it's real

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.580 
neck and on this side you see it's real
sloppy<00:02:51.060> but<00:02:52.060> let's<00:02:52.210> go<00:02:52.330> back<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.510> this<00:02:52.720> side<00:02:52.930> so

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
sloppy but let's go back to this side so

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.730 
sloppy but let's go back to this side so
I<00:02:53.620> tried<00:02:54.330> hooking<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.840> way<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.500> that

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
I tried hooking it this way and that

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.920 
I tried hooking it this way and that
didn't<00:02:57.070> work<00:02:57.190> very<00:02:57.220> well<00:02:57.580> so<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.480> found<00:02:58.810> the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
didn't work very well so I found the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.900 
didn't work very well so I found the
best<00:02:59.080> and<00:02:59.500> fastest<00:03:00.010> thing<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.250> do<00:03:00.400> is<00:03:00.550> just<00:03:00.790> to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
best and fastest thing to do is just to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.760 
best and fastest thing to do is just to
have<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.510> wire<00:03:01.720> go<00:03:01.930> all<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.170> way<00:03:02.200> through<00:03:02.470> and

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
have the wire go all the way through and

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.910 
have the wire go all the way through and
then<00:03:03.310> just<00:03:03.610> take<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.090> two<00:03:04.270> hooks<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:04.990> hook

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
then just take the two hooks and hook

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.210 
then just take the two hooks and hook
them<00:03:06.190> together<00:03:07.090> like<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.050> they're<00:03:09.040> very

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
them together like that and they're very

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.500 
them together like that and they're very
flexible<00:03:09.490> and<00:03:09.940> bendable<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:11.190> then<00:03:12.510> inside

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
flexible and bendable and then inside

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.960 
flexible and bendable and then inside
here<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:14.140> make<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.410> stand<00:03:14.710> up<00:03:14.950> more<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.430> put<00:03:15.940> a

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
here to make it stand up more I put a

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.730 
here to make it stand up more I put a
piece<00:03:16.300> of<00:03:16.360> cardboard<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:17.230> comes<00:03:17.410> down<00:03:17.680> to

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
piece of cardboard it comes down to

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.950 
piece of cardboard it comes down to
about<00:03:17.890> here<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:19.240> reason<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.630> didn't<00:03:19.810> want<00:03:19.930> it

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
about here the reason I didn't want it

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.540 
about here the reason I didn't want it
to<00:03:20.110> come<00:03:20.260> further<00:03:20.500> is<00:03:20.710> because<00:03:21.070> there's<00:03:21.280> a

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
to come further is because there's a

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.060 
to come further is because there's a
round<00:03:21.970> circle<00:03:22.330> right<00:03:22.630> here<00:03:23.020> where<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.740> person

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
round circle right here where the person

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.370 
round circle right here where the person
puts<00:03:24.310> their<00:03:24.370> hands<00:03:24.940> through<00:03:25.240> on<00:03:25.480> both<00:03:26.380> sides

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
puts their hands through on both sides

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.020 
puts their hands through on both sides
because<00:03:29.380> I<00:03:29.470> tried<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.130> other<00:03:30.370> ways<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:30.880> I

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
because I tried it other ways and I

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.250 
because I tried it other ways and I
didn't<00:03:31.270> think<00:03:31.420> it<00:03:31.480> looked<00:03:31.510> realistic<00:03:32.110> with

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
didn't think it looked realistic with

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.570 
didn't think it looked realistic with
the<00:03:32.350> puppet<00:03:32.710> hands<00:03:32.860> I<00:03:32.980> like<00:03:33.160> their<00:03:33.340> hands

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
the puppet hands I like their hands

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.860 
the puppet hands I like their hands
better<00:03:34.800> so<00:03:35.800> I<00:03:35.860> cut<00:03:36.100> this<00:03:36.580> slot<00:03:37.270> a<00:03:37.300> little<00:03:37.750> bit

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
better so I cut this slot a little bit

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.970 
better so I cut this slot a little bit
bigger<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:39.070> hot-glued<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:43.020> it<00:03:44.020> I<00:03:44.410> bend<00:03:44.860> it

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
bigger and I hot-glued the it I bend it

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.590 
bigger and I hot-glued the it I bend it
back<00:03:45.220> so<00:03:45.520> it<00:03:45.670> wouldn't<00:03:45.910> cut<00:03:46.090> their<00:03:46.240> neck<00:03:46.420> and

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
back so it wouldn't cut their neck and

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.440 
back so it wouldn't cut their neck and
put<00:03:46.780> hot<00:03:46.990> glue<00:03:47.020> on<00:03:47.350> on<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:49.270> is

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
put hot glue on on that and so that is

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.920 
put hot glue on on that and so that is
padded<00:03:49.990> on<00:03:50.230> this<00:03:50.410> cardboard<00:03:50.770> right<00:03:51.130> here<00:03:51.430> and

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
padded on this cardboard right here and

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.080 
padded on this cardboard right here and
then<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:53.020> glued<00:03:53.350> on<00:03:53.680> I<00:03:54.100> find<00:03:54.340> a<00:03:54.520> little<00:03:54.760> kids
