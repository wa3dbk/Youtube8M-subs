greater goal of this system we're

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.260 
greater goal of this system we're
looking<00:02:26.770> at<00:02:26.920> trying<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.250> incorporate<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.790> very

looking at trying to incorporate a very
very<00:02:28.480> safe<00:02:28.900> system<00:02:29.530> as<00:02:29.680> well<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.190> we've

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
very safe system as well so we've

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.290 
very safe system as well so we've
achieved<00:02:31.330> or<00:02:32.010> incorporated<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.190> tracking<00:02:34.060> in

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
combination of these two things working

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.710
