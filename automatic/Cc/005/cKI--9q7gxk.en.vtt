00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
this is the main screen here each track

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.890 
this is the main screen here each track
here<00:00:34.520> represents<00:00:35.059> different<00:00:35.210> instrument

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.800 

if<00:00:42.770> I<00:00:42.920> look<00:00:43.880> at<00:00:43.970> the<00:00:44.060> pattern<00:00:44.360> that's<00:00:44.540> on<00:00:44.690> each

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
if I look at the pattern that's on each

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.390 
if I look at the pattern that's on each
track<00:00:45.050> you<00:00:45.230> look<00:00:45.380> at<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:45.620> sequence<00:00:45.890> or<00:00:46.160> screen

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
track you look at the sequence or screen

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.270 
track you look at the sequence or screen
here<00:00:47.110> this<00:00:48.110> is<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.290> multi-touch<00:00:48.770> screen<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:49.250> I

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
here this is a multi-touch screen so I

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.970 
here this is a multi-touch screen so I
can<00:00:49.370> zoom<00:00:49.640> in<00:00:49.790> and<00:00:49.940> zoom<00:00:49.970> out<00:00:50.150> like<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:50.830> if<00:00:51.830> I

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
can zoom in and zoom out like so if I

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.980 
can zoom in and zoom out like so if I
want<00:00:52.130> to<00:00:52.220> move<00:00:52.370> on<00:00:52.490> a<00:00:52.550> node<00:00:52.790> around<00:00:53.060> I<00:00:53.240> can<00:00:53.420> move

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
want to move on a node around I can move

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.960 
want to move on a node around I can move
it<00:00:54.110> around<00:00:54.170> with<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:54.680> know<00:00:54.740> my<00:00:54.920> touch<00:00:55.460> me<00:00:55.700> I

fingers or i can use your shoe sole

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.850 
fingers or i can use your shoe sole
for<00:01:01.430> no<00:01:01.520> input<00:01:02.020> can<00:01:03.020> use<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.320> buttons<00:01:03.620> to

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
for no input can use the buttons to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.039 
for no input can use the buttons to
completely<00:01:04.580> do<00:01:04.909> it<00:01:05.059> all<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.390> input<00:01:05.630> with<00:01:05.780> just

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
completely do it all the input with just

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.420 
completely do it all the input with just
the<00:01:06.140> buttons<00:01:06.470> if<00:01:06.590> you'd<00:01:06.710> like<00:01:06.860> or<00:01:07.130> you<00:01:07.159> can<00:01:07.400> use

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
the buttons if you'd like or you can use

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.580 
the buttons if you'd like or you can use
the<00:01:07.790> screen<00:01:08.619> into<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:09.850> touching<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:10.970> like<00:01:11.000> this

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
the screen into it touching it like this

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:19.950 
the screen into it touching it like this
if<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.770> record<00:01:13.159> you<00:01:13.369> can<00:01:13.460> do<00:01:13.580> it<00:01:13.670> in<00:01:13.729> real<00:01:13.880> time

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.719 

so<00:01:20.960> that's<00:01:21.649> basically<00:01:21.890> how<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.250> sequencer

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
so that's basically how the sequencer

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.060 
so that's basically how the sequencer
part<00:01:22.909> of<00:01:22.970> it<00:01:23.090> works<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:24.229> scent<00:01:24.470> screen<00:01:24.830> here

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
part of it works the scent screen here

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.200 
part of it works the scent screen here
will<00:01:25.220> let<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:25.430> adjust<00:01:25.520> all<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.000> parameters

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
will let you adjust all the parameters

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.389 
will let you adjust all the parameters
for<00:01:26.630> every<00:01:26.869> sound<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:27.350> know<00:01:29.890> if<00:01:30.890> I<00:01:31.040> wanna<00:01:31.220> you

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
for every sound you know if I wanna you

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.680 
for every sound you know if I wanna you
know<00:01:31.430> be

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.830 

I<00:01:37.780> can<00:01:38.140> do<00:01:38.260> all<00:01:38.380> of<00:01:38.410> that<00:01:39.540> different<00:01:40.540> effects

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
I can do all of that different effects

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:51.360 
I can do all of that different effects
on<00:01:40.930> each<00:01:41.110> on<00:01:41.470> each<00:01:41.650> other<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:50.100> we've<00:01:51.100> got<00:01:51.340> a

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
on each on each other and we've got a

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.100 
on each on each other and we've got a
number<00:01:51.700> of<00:01:51.880> different<00:01:52.000> synthesis<00:01:52.600> algorithms

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
number of different synthesis algorithms

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.560 
number of different synthesis algorithms
so<00:01:53.290> it<00:01:53.410> will<00:01:53.530> do<00:01:53.650> like<00:01:53.860> FM<00:01:54.220> synthesis<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:55.420> will

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
so it will do like FM synthesis it will

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.030 
so it will do like FM synthesis it will
also<00:01:55.720> do<00:01:55.960> standard<00:01:56.350> uh<00:01:56.470> subtractive

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
also do standard uh subtractive

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.030 
also do standard uh subtractive
synthesis<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.790> oscillator<00:01:58.750> sync<00:01:59.050> pulse

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
synthesis and oscillator sync pulse

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.070 
synthesis and oscillator sync pulse
width<00:02:00.190> modulation<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:01.030> various<00:02:01.360> other<00:02:01.630> types

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
width modulation and various other types

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.850 
width modulation and various other types
of<00:02:02.290> us<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:02.830> techniques<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:05.320> can<00:02:05.350> throw<00:02:05.680> these

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
of us and techniques you can throw these

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.910 
of us and techniques you can throw these
modulator<00:02:06.430> LFO<00:02:07.330> zonda<00:02:07.900> every<00:02:08.170> parameter<00:02:08.530> on

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
modulator LFO zonda every parameter on

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.410 
modulator LFO zonda every parameter on
the<00:02:09.010> synthesizer<00:02:09.720> they're<00:02:10.720> very<00:02:10.929> easy<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:12.070> use

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.150 

you<00:02:15.540> can<00:02:15.720> design<00:02:16.170> your<00:02:16.349> own<00:02:16.410> wave<00:02:16.740> form<00:02:17.040> we

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
you can design your own wave form we

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.520 
you can design your own wave form we
call<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.550> step<00:02:17.730> modulator<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:19.230> if<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.380> take

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
call this is step modulator so if I take

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:44.520 
call this is step modulator so if I take
this<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:19.980> put<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.840> catch<00:02:22.080> baby

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.410 

you<00:02:45.280> can<00:02:45.459> use<00:02:45.580> these<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.940> get<00:02:46.030> these<00:02:46.180> very

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
you can use these to get these very
