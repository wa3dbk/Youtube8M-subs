00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
to have the adjustable cuffs on the legs

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.420 
to have the adjustable cuffs on the legs
for<00:00:20.919> length<00:00:21.099> and<00:00:21.279> you<00:00:21.340> can<00:00:21.460> also<00:00:21.579> trim<00:00:21.939> as<00:00:22.210> well

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
for length and you can also trim as well

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.729 
for length and you can also trim as well
but<00:00:24.430> I<00:00:24.820> triple-checked<00:00:25.470> quadruple-checked

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
but I triple-checked quadruple-checked

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.979 
but I triple-checked quadruple-checked
the<00:00:27.040> rise<00:00:27.270> measurements<00:00:28.270> on<00:00:28.480> this<00:00:28.720> pattern

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
the rise measurements on this pattern

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.700 
the rise measurements on this pattern
and<00:00:29.410> hers<00:00:30.130> was<00:00:30.310> 16<00:00:30.700> inches<00:00:31.029> and<00:00:31.540> it<00:00:32.470> made<00:00:32.649> me

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
and hers was 16 inches and it made me

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.740 
and hers was 16 inches and it made me
look<00:00:32.800> good<00:00:32.860> from<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:33.250> front<00:00:33.489> but<00:00:33.640> it<00:00:34.360> doesn't

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
look good from the front but it doesn't

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.950 
look good from the front but it doesn't
cover<00:00:34.989> it<00:00:35.230> all<00:00:35.440> from<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:35.890> back<00:00:36.070> so<00:00:36.820> I<00:00:37.329> don't

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
cover it all from the back so I don't

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.930 
cover it all from the back so I don't
know<00:00:38.140> it<00:00:38.320> might<00:00:38.530> be<00:00:38.559> sewing<00:00:39.100> error<00:00:40.199> but<00:00:41.199> I

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
know it might be sewing error but I

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.540 
know it might be sewing error but I
can't<00:00:42.940> imagine<00:00:43.059> it<00:00:43.660> being<00:00:43.929> sewing<00:00:44.649> her<00:00:44.890> at

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
can't imagine it being sewing her at

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.910 
can't imagine it being sewing her at
this<00:00:45.670> point<00:00:45.789> with<00:00:46.149> this<00:00:46.300> big<00:00:46.570> of<00:00:46.719> a<00:00:46.920> mistake

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
this point with this big of a mistake

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.840 
this point with this big of a mistake
she<00:00:48.219> could<00:00:48.550> cielos<00:00:48.969> learn<00:00:49.120> how<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.269> roll<00:00:49.480> over

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
she could cielos learn how to roll over

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.220 
she could cielos learn how to roll over
so<00:00:51.850> I<00:00:52.949> guess<00:00:53.949> if<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:55.449> way<00:00:55.570> I<00:00:55.600> could<00:00:55.839> possibly

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
so I guess if the way I could possibly

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.060 
so I guess if the way I could possibly
fix<00:00:56.499> it<00:00:56.710> would<00:00:56.829> be<00:00:56.949> to<00:00:57.160> add<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:59.469> know<00:00:59.589> a<00:00:59.620> band

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
fix it would be to add you know a band

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.619 
fix it would be to add you know a band
at<00:01:00.339> the<00:01:00.370> top<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:00.879> plus<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.149> other<00:01:01.269> thing<00:01:01.510> is

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
at the top and plus the other thing is

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.419 
at the top and plus the other thing is
too<00:01:01.809> is<00:01:01.929> there's<00:01:02.109> no<00:01:02.289> there's<00:01:02.829> no<00:01:02.890> waist<00:01:03.159> band

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
too is there's no there's no waist band

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.830 
too is there's no there's no waist band
so<00:01:03.820> it<00:01:04.449> sort<00:01:04.989> of<00:01:05.050> fits<00:01:05.940> along<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:07.210> top<00:01:07.420> because

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
so it sort of fits along the top because

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.200 
so it sort of fits along the top because
it's<00:01:08.020> on<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.260> ribbing<00:01:08.620> but<00:01:09.430> I<00:01:09.460> can't<00:01:09.940> I<00:01:10.180> just

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
it's on the ribbing but I can't I just

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.060 
it's on the ribbing but I can't I just
can't<00:01:10.420> I<00:01:10.810> mean<00:01:11.110> it's<00:01:11.260> already<00:01:11.380> poking<00:01:11.680> out<00:01:11.980> at

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
can't I mean it's already poking out at

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.490 
can't I mean it's already poking out at
the<00:01:12.160> top<00:01:12.370> I<00:01:12.400> can't<00:01:12.730> imagine<00:01:12.790> it<00:01:13.270> actually<00:01:13.840> you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
the top I can't imagine it actually you

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.170 
the top I can't imagine it actually you
know<00:01:14.530> functioning<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.490> way<00:01:15.610> that<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:15.940> should

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
know functioning the way that it should

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.880 
know functioning the way that it should
function<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.520> I<00:01:18.960> think<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.170> real<00:01:20.350> problem<00:01:20.530> is

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
function so I think the real problem is

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.610 
function so I think the real problem is
that<00:01:20.920> she's<00:01:21.250> has<00:01:21.430> you<00:01:21.610> split<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.480> pattern<00:01:25.620> in

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
that she's has you split the pattern in

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.380 
that she's has you split the pattern in
the<00:01:26.920> pattern<00:01:27.220> she<00:01:27.400> has<00:01:27.550> you<00:01:27.700> split<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.180> rise

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
the pattern she has you split the rise

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.100 
the pattern she has you split the rise
in<00:01:28.840> half<00:01:29.140> exactly<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.310> there's<00:01:31.000> more<00:01:31.240> rise<00:01:31.630> in

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
in half exactly and there's more rise in

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.260 
in half exactly and there's more rise in
the<00:01:32.380> back<00:01:32.620> that<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.400> need<00:01:33.640> then<00:01:34.450> in<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.690> front

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
the back that you need then in the front

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.490 
the back that you need then in the front
because<00:01:37.270> of<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.990> know<00:01:38.050> either<00:01:38.200> your

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
because of the you know either your

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.920 
because of the you know either your
rounded<00:01:38.890> bootie<00:01:39.190> so<00:01:39.910> I'm<00:01:40.240> wondering<00:01:40.630> if<00:01:40.900> that

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
rounded bootie so I'm wondering if that

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.320 
rounded bootie so I'm wondering if that
was<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.230> problem<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:42.700> might<00:01:42.820> be<00:01:42.970> something<00:01:43.300> to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
was a problem it might be something to

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.240 
was a problem it might be something to
try<00:01:43.630> on<00:01:43.690> your<00:01:43.870> own<00:01:43.930> if<00:01:44.350> you<00:01:44.470> have<00:01:44.710> extra

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
try on your own if you have extra

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.580 
try on your own if you have extra
sweaters<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.730> other<00:01:45.850> thing<00:01:46.060> that<00:01:46.590> was

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
sweaters the other thing that was

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.170 
sweaters the other thing that was
difficult<00:01:47.800> for<00:01:48.040> me<00:01:48.250> as<00:01:48.340> well<00:01:48.520> as<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.700> used<00:01:48.820> a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
difficult for me as well as I used a

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.660 
difficult for me as well as I used a
small<00:01:49.540> female<00:01:49.990> you<00:01:50.920> know<00:01:51.040> a<00:01:51.070> small<00:01:51.430> adult

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
small female you know a small adult

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.700 
small female you know a small adult
sweater<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.360> would<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:53.050> definitely<00:01:53.560> use<00:01:53.680> a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
sweater I would you definitely use a

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.500 
sweater I would you definitely use a
medium<00:01:54.190> or<00:01:54.340> up<00:01:54.460> because<00:01:54.850> these<00:01:54.970> legs<00:01:55.270> are<00:01:55.450> a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
medium or up because these legs are a

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.720 
medium or up because these legs are a
little<00:01:55.750> snug<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.590> know<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:57.100> even<00:01:57.250> Ella<00:01:57.550> who

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
little snug you know and even Ella who

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.100 
little snug you know and even Ella who
has<00:01:57.880> kind<00:01:58.090> of<00:01:58.180> skinny<00:01:58.390> legs<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.840> begin<00:01:59.080> with<00:01:59.260> so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
has kind of skinny legs to begin with so

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.630 
has kind of skinny legs to begin with so
you<00:02:02.110> know<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.260> simple<00:02:02.440> pattern<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:02.980> follow<00:02:03.130> but

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
you know a simple pattern to follow but

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.000 
you know a simple pattern to follow but
I'm<00:02:04.030> not<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:04.360> huge<00:02:04.870> fan<00:02:04.900> of<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.470> results<00:02:05.860> myself

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
I'm not a huge fan of the results myself
