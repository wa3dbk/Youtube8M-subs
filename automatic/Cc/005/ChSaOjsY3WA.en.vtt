00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
to show you the 501 reflector well the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.400 
to show you the 501 reflector well the
pleasure<00:00:11.209> that<00:00:11.330> I<00:00:11.450> must<00:00:11.750> have<00:00:11.959> for<00:00:12.230> most

pleasure that I must have for most
studios<00:00:12.709> they're<00:00:13.039> really<00:00:13.279> good<00:00:13.490> to<00:00:14.059> get<00:00:14.240> the

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
studios they're really good to get the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.000 
studios they're really good to get the
really<00:00:14.539> unique<00:00:14.809> lighting<00:00:15.170> to<00:00:15.559> bounce<00:00:15.709> light

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
really unique lighting to bounce light

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.710 
really unique lighting to bounce light
especially<00:00:16.250> if<00:00:16.520> your<00:00:16.609> location<00:00:17.119> shooter<00:00:17.390> you

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
especially if your location shooter you

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.849 
especially if your location shooter you
definitely<00:00:17.960> want<00:00:18.260> one<00:00:18.320> of<00:00:18.380> these<00:00:18.500> because<00:00:18.680> you

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
definitely want one of these because you

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.769 
definitely want one of these because you
never<00:00:18.980> know<00:00:19.100> what<00:00:19.310> the<00:00:19.369> Sun<00:00:19.759> or<00:00:20.029> lights<00:00:20.539> going

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
never know what the Sun or lights going

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.269 
never know what the Sun or lights going
to<00:00:20.869> be<00:00:20.960> like<00:00:21.109> but<00:00:21.380> it<00:00:21.439> also<00:00:21.560> works<00:00:21.859> really<00:00:21.980> well

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
to be like but it also works really well

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.609 
to be like but it also works really well
studios<00:00:22.880> looks<00:00:23.359> like<00:00:23.480> there's<00:00:23.660> a<00:00:23.900> bluebird

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
studios looks like there's a bluebird

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.259 
studios looks like there's a bluebird
bouncing<00:00:24.949> light<00:00:25.099> off<00:00:25.249> the<00:00:25.369> Sun<00:00:25.609> off<00:00:25.880> a<00:00:25.939> light

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
bouncing light off the Sun off a light

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.509 
bouncing light off the Sun off a light
off<00:00:26.570> of<00:00:26.990> a<00:00:27.199> lot<00:00:27.679> of<00:00:27.800> things<00:00:27.890> they<00:00:28.099> work<00:00:28.249> really

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
off of a lot of things they work really

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.599 
off of a lot of things they work really
well<00:00:28.669> so<00:00:29.329> if<00:00:29.839> you<00:00:30.829> don't<00:00:30.919> have<00:00:31.099> one<00:00:31.159> these<00:00:31.369> is<00:00:31.519> a

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
well so if you don't have one these is a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.090 
well so if you don't have one these is a
definite<00:00:31.970> must-have<00:00:32.150> and<00:00:32.480> not<00:00:32.570> too<00:00:32.720> expensive

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
definite must-have and not too expensive

definite must-have and not too expensive
they<00:00:34.100> come<00:00:34.250> in<00:00:34.340> three<00:00:34.370> different<00:00:34.640> sizes<00:00:34.940> you

they come in three different sizes you

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.050 
they come in three different sizes you
can<00:00:35.480> win<00:00:35.660> 20<00:00:35.960> inch<00:00:36.110> 38<00:00:36.500> to<00:00:36.620> 40<00:00:36.920> inch<00:00:37.070> I<00:00:37.340> have<00:00:38.030> a

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
can win 20 inch 38 to 40 inch I have a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.390 
can win 20 inch 38 to 40 inch I have a
30<00:00:38.480> inch<00:00:38.570> in<00:00:38.810> my<00:00:38.900> hand<00:00:39.080> right<00:00:39.110> now<00:00:39.230> um<00:00:39.530> this<00:00:40.220> is

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
30 inch in my hand right now um this is

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.010 
30 inch in my hand right now um this is
the<00:00:40.700> size<00:00:40.880> i<00:00:41.000> like<00:00:41.150> to<00:00:41.240> use<00:00:41.300> its<00:00:41.630> really<00:00:41.870> good

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
the size i like to use its really good

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.200 
the size i like to use its really good
can<00:00:42.560> hold<00:00:42.740> in<00:00:42.830> one<00:00:42.860> hand<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:43.580> you<00:00:43.700> can<00:00:43.850> hold<00:00:44.090> it

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
can hold in one hand and you can hold it

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.120 
can hold in one hand and you can hold it
in<00:00:44.480> one<00:00:44.930> hand<00:00:45.170> when<00:00:45.470> you're<00:00:45.590> shooting<00:00:45.800> if<00:00:46.040> you

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
in one hand when you're shooting if you

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.440 
in one hand when you're shooting if you
need<00:00:46.250> a<00:00:46.310> bounce<00:00:46.460> a<00:00:46.580> light<00:00:46.760> with<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.090> camera<00:00:47.390> in

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
need a bounce a light with the camera in

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.710 
need a bounce a light with the camera in
hand<00:00:47.660> the<00:00:47.810> works<00:00:48.050> pretty<00:00:48.530> well<00:00:48.650> for<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:49.010> um

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
hand the works pretty well for that um

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.210 
hand the works pretty well for that um
with<00:00:50.720> a<00:00:50.750> 5<00:00:50.990> 11<00:00:51.350> there's<00:00:51.530> five<00:00:51.770> different<00:00:51.800> ways

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
with a 5 11 there's five different ways

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.490 
with a 5 11 there's five different ways
you<00:00:52.250> can<00:00:52.490> use<00:00:52.610> this<00:00:52.820> report<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:54.290> first

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
you can use this report and the first

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.680 
you can use this report and the first
way<00:00:54.710> you<00:00:55.100> can<00:00:55.250> see<00:00:55.370> right<00:00:55.400> now<00:00:55.550> is<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:56.390> silver

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
way you can see right now is the silver

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.030 
way you can see right now is the silver
and<00:00:56.990> the<00:00:57.020> silver<00:00:57.350> is<00:00:57.380> way<00:00:57.530> I<00:00:57.560> like<00:00:57.800> to<00:00:57.830> use<00:00:58.010> a

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
and the silver is way I like to use a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.140 
and the silver is way I like to use a
lot<00:00:58.190> of<00:00:58.220> works<00:00:58.430> just<00:00:58.520> like<00:00:58.640> a<00:00:58.730> mirror<00:00:59.030> it

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
lot of works just like a mirror it

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.560 
lot of works just like a mirror it
bounces<00:00:59.780> like<00:00:59.990> pretty<00:01:00.590> well<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:02.390> thing<00:01:02.540> about

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
bounces like pretty well the thing about

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.910 
bounces like pretty well the thing about
it<00:01:02.810> it<00:01:02.870> does<00:01:03.020> bounce<00:01:03.230> a<00:01:03.350> little<00:01:03.440> bit<00:01:03.620> of<00:01:03.710> cooler

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
it it does bounce a little bit of cooler

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.859 
it it does bounce a little bit of cooler
like<00:01:04.189> so<00:01:04.729> there's<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.059> couple<00:01:05.509> of<00:01:05.689> ways<00:01:05.780> from

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
like so there's a couple of ways from

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.270 
like so there's a couple of ways from
using<00:01:06.170> normalize<00:01:06.530> it<00:01:06.650> sounds<00:01:06.860> a<00:01:06.890> little<00:01:07.130> cool

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
using normalize it sounds a little cool

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.399 
using normalize it sounds a little cool
light<00:01:07.490> I<00:01:07.700> like<00:01:08.060> this<00:01:08.149> way<00:01:08.299> a<00:01:08.329> lot<00:01:08.509> but<00:01:08.749> there's

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
light I like this way a lot but there's

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.529 
light I like this way a lot but there's
five<00:01:09.619> poison<00:01:10.039> can<00:01:10.159> use<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:10.399> so<00:01:10.579> the<00:01:11.149> back<00:01:11.329> side

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
five poison can use it so the back side

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.289 
five poison can use it so the back side
is<00:01:11.780> it<00:01:12.289> black<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:12.829> black<00:01:13.310> is<00:01:13.520> used<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:13.969> kill

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
is it black and black is used to kill

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:15.910 
is it black and black is used to kill
light<00:01:14.539> so<00:01:14.780> if<00:01:14.960> it's<00:01:15.109> too<00:01:15.350> bright<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:15.619> you

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
light so if it's too bright and you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.499 
light so if it's too bright and you
don't<00:01:16.249> late<00:01:16.399> in<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.520> certain<00:01:16.700> way<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.329> is

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
don't late in a certain way this is

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.719 
don't late in a certain way this is
decide<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:18.020> want<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.259> choose<00:01:18.439> now<00:01:19.219> to<00:01:19.249> get<00:01:19.579> the

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
decide you want to choose now to get the

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.609 
decide you want to choose now to get the
other<00:01:19.909> three<00:01:20.509> ways<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:20.929> reflector<00:01:21.289> basically

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
other three ways the reflector basically

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.499 
other three ways the reflector basically
it's<00:01:21.740> as<00:01:21.859> if<00:01:22.039> it<00:01:22.189> is<00:01:22.310> if<00:01:22.609> it<00:01:22.670> right<00:01:22.819> here<00:01:22.969> and

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
it's as if it is if it right here and

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.510 
it's as if it is if it right here and
you<00:01:23.569> unzip<00:01:24.049> it<00:01:24.170> with<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.859> white<00:01:25.039> cover<00:01:25.310> you

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
you unzip it with the white cover you

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.130 
you unzip it with the white cover you
want<00:01:25.759> so<00:01:26.359> when<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.509> take<00:01:26.659> it<00:01:26.749> out<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.929> disc

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
want so when you take it out the disc

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.289 
want so when you take it out the disc
right<00:01:27.289> here<00:01:27.560> is<00:01:27.920> actually<00:01:28.069> the<00:01:28.700> fifth<00:01:28.909> one<00:01:29.090> and

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299
