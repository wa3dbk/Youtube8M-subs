 kind 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.840
 this is our video reviews welcomes you 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.750
 maxi company 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.910
 sports in this video review we will be with 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.230
 you consider the company's products 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.170
 adidas exactly 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.400
 boxing training gloves with 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.400
 name tactics about 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.260
 as in all video reviews, I repeat 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.960
 that all adidas products 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.090
 comes to us in such bags 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.460
 which country barcode is indicated 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.690
 manufacturer explore gloves town 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.180
 scoop date of production of goods and so 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.780
 further still there are pictures of the same 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.670
 goods but in other colors 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.980
 by the way these gloves 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.960
 happen in blue and black light but to us 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.960
 they are only available in black 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.450
 I want to immediately say that the gloves 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.350
 all imitation leather 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:21.399
 this part is velcro cuff palm 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:24.310
 imitation leather finger all wanted 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.560
 would mark the design of these gloves 2013 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.679
 years they are very different in design 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.929
 especially the cuff has changed a lot 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:37.840
 such inserts have appeared here 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:41.530
 such pretty tough more made 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.399
 Beauty has become so to speak Velcro 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.399
 thinner 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.660
 in the palm of our hand we had a perforation for 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.660
 arm ventilation 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:07.950
 palm stuffing poly max very soft 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:11.330
 material is very good catching counter 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.950
 punches with such a soft palm 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.000
 the glove itself fills the shock part 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.820
 high pressure foam glove itself 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.100
 the shock part is very tough that's why 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:29.490
 if you miss a beat with such a glove who 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:32.790
 it will not be sweetly delivered to us these 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.950
 gloves in 10 and 12 functions in this 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.110
 case we are considering the top ten 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.710
 right here you can see how they are 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.710
 sit on hand 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.140
 frankly for me a dozen 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.630
 pretty little me here 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.690
 there is almost no room for steam bandage 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.950
 But despite the fact that my palm, too 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.910
 not big and it will create a certain 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.350
 problem when I start model by 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.200
 principle molding good glove 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.150
 clamped without effort that is easy well 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.480
 Of course there are gloves that 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.260
 pressed easier but at the expense of filling 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.890
 foam that's high pressure it does 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.989
 a little squeeze more problematic but in 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.850
 In principle, everything is fine, the finger will turn in 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:32.989
 under shit it is already standard almost 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.989
 all gloves 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:47.690
 Further 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:53.910
 the lining is created from the fabric on the sides 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:56.070
 we see the mesh for what are meant 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.820
 first of all tactics 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:03.600
 designed for training naturally 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.030
 for competitions they will not fit 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.790
 be for domestic competition 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.030
 clubs and so on again you will 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.850
 resolve this issue by a trainer for 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.530
 competitions in Ukraine in the city and 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.530
 Europe you already know 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:27.810
 need special gloves either with 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:29.670
 stamped with either a hologram but for 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.200
 In addition, I would not use these 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.960
 shells gloves 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.080
 as they would buy from leatherette 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.790
 shells gloves from preferably say 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.910
 since on the shells 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:46.200
 power strikes are mostly practiced 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.900
 and it will be destructive for 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.740
 your gloves to extend 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.080
 their life 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.390
 you can take purchase yourself just 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.240
 on shells separately gloves and these 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.910
 use exclusively training 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.890
 goals in pairs from above robot koch well 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.020
 possible points for and of course in 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.660
 the end of our video review we are with you 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.500
 let's weigh the gloves tactics about 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:16.650
 supplier to manufacturers declared weight in 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:20.600
 10 functions I set scales in grams 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.600
 in order to be more accurate 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:32.900
 forest gloves 300 grams exactly if 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:35.749
 translate 300 grams of function 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:40.759
 it turns out 10 and fifty eight 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:41.779
 oz in my opinion this difference is not 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:46.550
 critical and 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:48.889
 and you have to decide for yourself and remember better 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.900
 worthy to lose than doubtful 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:54.370
 to win to train the best with you was 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.370
