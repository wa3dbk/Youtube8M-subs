00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.240
 fawcett with people welcome to the ether 

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:06.459
 official I am terrified polis and here they 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.400
 I leave with the six recordings of origins 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:11.740
 in spanish latin with the last date da 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.300
 because I tried it three times and good 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.140
 I let the recordings in Latin that 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.140
 they are fine until later 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.570
 the texts of the ancients describe a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.900
 contraption they called for the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.180
 amplify 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.670
 I am convinced that the object is 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.970
 vital to access the energy of the 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.340
 elementary stones unfortunately in 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.489
 our excavations we have not achieved 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.770
 recover the rod nor the stones feel 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.809
 that despite everything we must continue forward 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.489
 I have moved some plans to create 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.530
 replicas of the rods from 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.470
 descriptions found in the camera 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.910
 main have then that begins its 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.910
 manufacture immediately 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.339
 the investigation of element 115 follows 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.859
 throwing unexpected results the 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.290
 conversion process creates fields of 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:08.229
 localized energy that look like 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.450
 function as portals of those that 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.479
 objects of indeterminate origin arise 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.539
 my hypothesis as strange as I can 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.119
 It seems that this transfer of 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.180
 matter could be happening through 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.250
 of spacetime I think the answer 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.280
 could be in the stones rubrics 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.679
 broken on the mound the 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.990
 channeling enough energy from 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:35.759
 the conversion generators to that 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.759
 place may be fruitful 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.910
 it was pure coincidence that we opened the 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.070
 Seal the main chamber 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.680
 repeated attempts to use force 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.080
 gross were ineffective and left 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.170
 our exhausted and frustrated men 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.660
 one with the idea of ​​easing one's attention 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.940
 of the soldiers brought a gramophone to the 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.600
 camera 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.840
 or from artists known as surfing their 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.360
 place for our amazement while 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.720
 we listened to the first bars of the 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.690
 music the seal began to open not 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.810
 I can avoid asking myself if there will be no more 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.350
 recordings that reveal other areas of 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.350
 the catacombs 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.519
 the girl's voice calls me with more 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:30.620
 frequency that never at first only 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.530
 he talked about his imprisonment in a kingdom 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.590
 mythical known as the letter now 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.470
 she says she is my daughter although I know that 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.870
 I do not have any 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.350
 I'm afraid I might be losing the 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.350
 judgment 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.190
 when I woke up this morning I found out 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.530
 of the mysterious events that happened 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.050
 during the night the workers of the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.420
 installation of the generators said 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.150
 have seen old figures that 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.460
 they emerged from the earth would doubt their 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.980
 story if it were not because of the 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.540
 morning many of the men were 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.540
 dead or missing 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.140
 when the 115 is channeled to the stones 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.870
 ancient an energy field seems 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.680
 drag unknown objects to our 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.380
 actually it is possible 500 115 this 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.410
 altering the space-time continuum 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.110
 as it could but an old box created 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.230
 eons ago will bring weapons of different 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.540
 you were maybe even from our own 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.370
 future one more study is necessary 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.480
 exhaustive about these powerful e 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.480
 unpredictable forces 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.579
 only a madman would create a machine 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.580
 how is this that works with intervention 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:57.400
 human in 115 to the ancient stones 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.530
 an energy field seems to crawls 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.980
 monks struggle to control the 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.980
 generators it is possible that the element 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.980
 115
