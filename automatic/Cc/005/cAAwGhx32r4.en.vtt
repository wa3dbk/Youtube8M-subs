host<00:00:06.500> tomato<00:00:06.799> water<00:00:07.069> nope<00:00:07.460> and<00:00:07.819> it<00:00:07.939> separates

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
host tomato water nope and it separates

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.260 
host tomato water nope and it separates
into<00:00:08.600> the<00:00:08.750> water<00:00:08.930> and<00:00:09.230> the<00:00:10.070> puck<00:00:10.280> and<00:00:10.850> it's<00:00:11.120> the

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:11.270 
into the water and the puck and it's the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.579 
into the water and the puck and it's the
solids<00:00:11.690> all<00:00:12.139> the<00:00:12.290> solids<00:00:12.650> of<00:00:12.740> it<00:00:12.889> and<00:00:13.509> it's

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:14.589 
solids all the solids of it and it's

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.570 
solids all the solids of it and it's
much<00:00:15.589> quicker<00:00:15.860> than<00:00:16.040> making<00:00:16.340> this

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
much quicker than making this

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.300 
much quicker than making this
classically<00:00:17.590> cheesecloth<00:00:18.590> with<00:00:18.919> some<00:00:19.070> salt

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
classically cheesecloth with some salt

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.970 
classically cheesecloth with some salt
over<00:00:19.849> a<00:00:19.880> day

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.240 

so<00:00:23.550> when<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.270> do<00:00:24.690> this<00:00:24.870> obviously<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:26.070> do

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
so when you do this obviously you can do

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.410 
so when you do this obviously you can do
upwards<00:00:26.790> of<00:00:26.940> six<00:00:27.530> so<00:00:28.530> you<00:00:29.310> could<00:00:29.430> do<00:00:29.520> two<00:00:29.760> you

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
upwards of six so you could do two you

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.870 
upwards of six so you could do two you
can<00:00:30.600> do<00:00:30.720> three<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.620> can<00:00:31.770> do<00:00:31.920> four<00:00:32.250> can't<00:00:32.730> do

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
can do three you can do four can't do

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.380 
can do three you can do four can't do
five<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.350> six<00:00:37.430> so<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.059> look<00:00:39.239> at

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
five you can do six so if you look at

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.840 
five you can do six so if you look at
you<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.290> two<00:00:40.559> obviously<00:00:41.130> right<00:00:41.340> yeah<00:00:41.670> you

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
you can do two obviously right yeah you

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.930 
you can do two obviously right yeah you
can<00:00:42.000> counterbalance<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.870> three<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.500> works

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
can counterbalance the three that works

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.830 
can counterbalance the three that works
yeah<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.059> has<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.450> counterbalance<00:00:46.080> before

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
yeah it has to be counterbalance before

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.840 
yeah it has to be counterbalance before
what<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.380> can't<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.280> can't<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.610> one

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
what you can't do one you can't do one

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.970 
what you can't do one you can't do one
because<00:00:51.300> that's<00:00:51.510> there<00:00:52.260> won't<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.590> balance

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
because that's there won't be a balance

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.470 
because that's there won't be a balance
for<00:00:53.220> it<00:00:53.400> right<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:53.970> couldn't<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.300> put

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
for it right but you couldn't just put

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.450 
for it right but you couldn't just put
in<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.690> deadweight<00:00:54.930> make<00:00:55.890> an<00:00:56.010> equal<00:00:56.310> weight

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
in a deadweight make an equal weight

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.010 
in a deadweight make an equal weight
yeah<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.060> course<00:00:57.240> I<00:00:57.270> mean<00:00:57.540> you<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:57.840> put

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
yeah of course I mean you can put

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.880 
yeah of course I mean you can put
another<00:00:59.060> exactly<00:01:00.060> like<00:01:00.630> just<00:01:00.900> vessels<00:01:01.740> in

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
another exactly like just vessels in

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.070 
another exactly like just vessels in
here<00:01:02.130> you<00:01:02.340> kept<00:01:02.579> water<00:01:02.910> obviously<00:01:03.510> yeah<00:01:03.990> you

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
here you kept water obviously yeah you

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.749 
here you kept water obviously yeah you
can't<00:01:04.410> have<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:05.160> you<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.550> have<00:01:05.640> it

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
can't have but you have to have it

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.030 
can't have but you have to have it
there's<00:01:06.660> a<00:01:06.750> there's<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.170> problem<00:01:07.470> though<00:01:07.830> if

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
there's a there's a problem though if

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.100 
there's a there's a problem though if
you<00:01:08.190> do<00:01:08.369> certain<00:01:08.580> things<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:09.060> say<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.420> were

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
you do certain things like say you were

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.859 
you do certain things like say you were
doing<00:01:10.440> yours<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.640> water<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
doing yours with a water as a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.620 
doing yours with a water as a
counterbalance<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.520> um<00:01:14.790> now<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.420> would

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
counterbalance this is um now you would

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.469 
counterbalance this is um now you would
think<00:01:15.660> with<00:01:16.170> forces<00:01:16.820> it<00:01:17.820> would<00:01:17.940> it<00:01:18.270> would<00:01:18.420> be

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
think with forces it would it would be

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.090 
think with forces it would it would be
fine<00:01:18.750> because<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> equal<00:01:19.470> force<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.979> is

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
fine because of the equal force of is

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.219 
fine because of the equal force of is
equal<00:01:20.369> weight<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.970> problem<00:01:21.300> is<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.630> when

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
equal weight the problem is is that when

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.170 
equal weight the problem is is that when
this<00:01:22.410> starts<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:22.920> condense<00:01:23.160> you'll<00:01:23.820> see<00:01:24.030> it

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
this starts to condense you'll see it

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.020 
this starts to condense you'll see it
here<00:01:25.040> when<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.190> starts<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.490> condense<00:01:26.700> down

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
here when it starts to condense down

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.150 
here when it starts to condense down
here<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.479> forces<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.289> are<00:01:28.440> being<00:01:28.470> pulled

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
here the forces that are being pulled

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.730 
here the forces that are being pulled
down<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.940> the<00:01:30.030> bottom<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:31.110> gonna<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.530> more

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
down at the bottom is gonna be more

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.070 
down at the bottom is gonna be more
right<00:01:32.220> your<00:01:32.850> density<00:01:33.060> will<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.479> will<00:01:33.960> be

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
right your density will be will be

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.040 
right your density will be will be
different<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.039> if<00:01:35.160> you<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.399> something<00:01:35.759> like

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
different so if you have something like

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.540 
different so if you have something like
like<00:01:37.050> this<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.679> instance<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.220> will<00:01:38.340> maybe

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
like this for instance that will maybe

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.340 
like this for instance that will maybe
produce<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:39.179> water<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.929> have<00:01:40.080> just

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
produce a water and then you have just

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.680 
produce a water and then you have just
water<00:01:40.649> this<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.399> pretty<00:01:41.819> balanced<00:01:42.450> all<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
water this is pretty balanced all the

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.660 
water this is pretty balanced all the
way<00:01:42.810> through<00:01:43.080> whereas<00:01:43.440> when<00:01:44.039> this<00:01:44.190> comes<00:01:44.459> down

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
way through whereas when this comes down

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.120 
way through whereas when this comes down
and<00:01:45.060> well<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.630> forces<00:01:45.990> won't<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.319> quite<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and well the forces won't be quite the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.340 
and well the forces won't be quite the
same<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.630> our<00:01:48.959> pure<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:50.330> yeah<00:01:51.330> well<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.050> could

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
same so our pure a so yeah well it could

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.859 
same so our pure a so yeah well it could
it<00:01:52.560> mean<00:01:52.740> maybe<00:01:53.100> or<00:01:53.220> maybe<00:01:53.310> not<00:01:53.459> but<00:01:53.720> who's<00:01:54.720> to

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
it mean maybe or maybe not but who's to

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.440 
it mean maybe or maybe not but who's to
say<00:01:55.580> you<00:01:56.580> don't<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:56.819> want<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.090> test<00:01:57.300> it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
say you don't really want to test it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.660 
say you don't really want to test it
which<00:01:57.720> is<00:01:57.899> usually<00:01:58.619> if<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.069> there's<00:01:59.399> there's

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
which is usually if you there's there's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.850 
which is usually if you there's there's
videos<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.509> shown<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:01.080> these<00:02:01.380> rotors

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
videos I have shown like these rotors

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.540 
videos I have shown like these rotors
like<00:02:03.289> blowing<00:02:04.289> out<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.920> machines<00:02:05.280> like
