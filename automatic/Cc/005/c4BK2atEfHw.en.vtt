of<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.650> gun<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.099> made<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.849> where<00:00:26.939> it's

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
of this gun and made it to where it's

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.490 
of this gun and made it to where it's
harder<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.390> kill<00:00:27.599> people<00:00:27.720> up<00:00:27.960> close<00:00:28.199> but<00:00:28.380> you

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
harder to kill people up close but you

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.830 
harder to kill people up close but you
can<00:00:28.769> still<00:00:29.010> do<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.340> they<00:00:29.970> also<00:00:30.150> increase<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
can still do it they also increase the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.200 
can still do it they also increase the
recoil<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.830> fmg9<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.030> more

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
recoil of the fmg9 so this is more

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.209 
recoil of the fmg9 so this is more
focused<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> akimbo<00:00:34.020> not<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.800> single<00:00:35.100> one

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
focused on the akimbo not the single one

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.090 
focused on the akimbo not the single one
even<00:00:35.489> though<00:00:35.579> they<00:00:35.730> both<00:00:35.940> did<00:00:36.210> receive<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
even though they both did receive a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.790 
even though they both did receive a
recoil<00:00:38.100> upgrade<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:39.030> fmg9<00:00:39.480> akimbo<00:00:40.170> shoots

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
recoil upgrade the fmg9 akimbo shoots

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.260 
recoil upgrade the fmg9 akimbo shoots
towards<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.309> sky<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.879> will<00:00:42.030> see<00:00:42.149> that

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
towards the sky and you will see that

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.080 
towards the sky and you will see that
later<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.750> video<00:00:43.020> they<00:00:43.980> also<00:00:44.190> fix<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> cm

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
later on this video they also fix the cm

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.930 
later on this video they also fix the cm
901<00:00:45.500> grenade<00:00:46.500> launcher<00:00:46.890> glitch<00:00:47.160> where<00:00:47.489> if<00:00:47.730> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
901 grenade launcher glitch where if you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.190 
901 grenade launcher glitch where if you
peregrine<00:00:48.329> they<00:00:48.450> launched<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> gun<00:00:49.020> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
peregrine they launched on the gun it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.470 
peregrine they launched on the gun it
would<00:00:49.289> range<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> rate<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> fire<00:00:50.460> from<00:00:50.940> 600

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
would range the rate of fire from 600

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.709 
would range the rate of fire from 600
bullets<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:52.219> 666<00:00:53.219> bullets<00:00:53.789> which<00:00:54.180> really<00:00:54.510> did

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
bullets to 666 bullets which really did

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.000 
bullets to 666 bullets which really did
make<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> difference<00:00:55.440> because<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.710> could<00:00:55.860> drop

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
make a difference because you could drop

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.369 
make a difference because you could drop
people<00:00:56.190> extremely<00:00:56.670> quicker<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.899> here's<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
people extremely quicker so here's the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.439 
people extremely quicker so here's the
red<00:00:58.680> dot<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:58.920> grenade<00:00:59.640> launcher<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.239> left

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
red dot and grenade launcher on the left

is the red dot on the right is a grenade
launcher<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> cm<00:01:02.969> 901<00:01:03.149> as<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.290> tell

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
launcher of the cm 901 as you can tell

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.109 
launcher of the cm 901 as you can tell
they<00:01:04.680> shoot<00:01:04.949> at<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> exact<00:01:05.580> same<00:01:05.760> rate<00:01:06.000> of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
they shoot at the exact same rate of

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.850 
they shoot at the exact same rate of
fire<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.450> would<00:01:06.540> be<00:01:06.600> 600<00:01:07.229> volts<00:01:07.409> per<00:01:07.560> minute

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
fire that would be 600 volts per minute

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.890 
fire that would be 600 volts per minute
now<00:01:08.010> or<00:01:08.610> per<00:01:08.790> second<00:01:09.150> now<00:01:09.240> or<00:01:09.420> whatever<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.810> is

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
now or per second now or whatever it is

I<00:01:09.930> don't<00:01:10.140> even<00:01:10.200> know<00:01:10.409> yeah<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.250> per<00:01:11.460> minute

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
I don't even know yeah it's per minute

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.300 
I don't even know yeah it's per minute
I'm<00:01:11.820> pretty<00:01:11.970> sure<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:13.290> really<00:01:13.830> nerfs

is nowhere near able to compete with it
um<00:01:29.630> I'm<00:01:30.630> gonna<00:01:30.750> put<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.170> down<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
um I'm gonna put it down there with the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.460 
um I'm gonna put it down there with the
shotguns<00:01:32.250> kind<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.990> just<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.079> little<00:01:34.380> bit

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
shotguns kind of just a little bit

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.690 
shotguns kind of just a little bit
better<00:01:34.619> than<00:01:34.920> them<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.220> course<00:01:35.340> because<00:01:35.549> it

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
better than them of course because it

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.130 
better than them of course because it
isn't<00:01:35.939> automatic<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.570> can't<00:01:36.780> spray<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
isn't automatic and you can't spray and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.870 
isn't automatic and you can't spray and
pray<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.500> but<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.250> don't<00:01:38.820> see

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
pray with it but I really don't see

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.370 
pray with it but I really don't see
anybody<00:01:39.360> using<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.780> gun<00:01:39.960> unless<00:01:40.170> they're

then there you go they can use this gun
and<00:01:49.140> they<00:01:49.470> won't<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.770> any<00:01:49.890> problems<00:01:50.340> they'll

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
be able to use it probably get a

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.179 
be able to use it probably get a
gameplay<00:01:52.140> because<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.680> still<00:01:53.100> an

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
gameplay because this is still an

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.010 
gameplay because this is still an
automatic<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.909> very<00:01:54.149> easy<00:01:54.360> weapon<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.990> use

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
automatic in a very easy weapon to use

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.109 
automatic in a very easy weapon to use
but<00:01:55.530> they've<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.159> made<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.520> lot<00:01:56.670> harder<00:01:56.729> to

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
but they've just made it a lot harder to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.420 
but they've just made it a lot harder to
use<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.600> here's<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> fmg9<00:01:58.560> basically<00:01:59.280> what

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
use and here's the fmg9 basically what

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.830 
use and here's the fmg9 basically what
this<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.729> I'm<00:01:59.880> killing<00:02:00.119> somebody<00:02:00.299> from<00:02:00.540> far

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
this is I'm killing somebody from far

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.440 
this is I'm killing somebody from far
away<00:02:00.890> with<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.040> gun<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.579> as<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.060> tell<00:02:03.090> I

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
away with this gun and as you can tell I

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.999 
away with this gun and as you can tell I
have<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.810> really<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.320> think<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.799> out

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
have to really like think this out

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.280 
have to really like think this out
before<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.790> could<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.240> killed<00:02:06.420> him<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.719> lot

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
before I could have killed him a lot

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.919 
before I could have killed him a lot
easier<00:02:07.619> with<00:02:07.979> these<00:02:08.160> things<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.640> now<00:02:09.569> as<00:02:09.810> you

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
easier with these things and now as you

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.360 
easier with these things and now as you
can<00:02:10.020> see<00:02:10.080> I'm<00:02:10.379> shooting<00:02:10.770> just<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:11.190> ham

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
can see I'm shooting just going ham

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.100 
can see I'm shooting just going ham
right<00:02:11.580> here<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:12.090> laying<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.660> trigger<00:02:12.900> down

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
right here like laying the trigger down

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.770 
right here like laying the trigger down
and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.780 
and
shooting<00:02:14.319> towards<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.010> sky<00:02:15.220> like<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.580> said

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
shooting towards the sky like I said

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.150 
shooting towards the sky like I said
before<00:02:16.080> I'm<00:02:17.080> not<00:02:17.140> trying<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.560> control<00:02:17.740> that<00:02:18.010> at

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
before I'm not trying to control that at

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160 
before I'm not trying to control that at
all<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.790> can<00:02:19.090> control<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.660> little<00:02:19.690> bit<00:02:20.050> but

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
all you can control it a little bit but

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.990 
all you can control it a little bit but
it<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.319> really<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.370> really<00:02:21.610> really<00:02:21.760> hard

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
it is really it is really really hard

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.410 
it is really it is really really hard
too<00:02:22.590> now<00:02:23.590> i<00:02:23.620> would<00:02:23.920> suggest<00:02:24.190> using<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.700> mp9<00:02:25.030> as

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
too now i would suggest using the mp9 as

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.210 
too now i would suggest using the mp9 as
a<00:02:25.450> secondary<00:02:25.930> it's<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.560> lot<00:02:26.680> better<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.069> gun

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
a secondary it's a lot better of a gun

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.420 
a secondary it's a lot better of a gun
if<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.490> can<00:02:27.670> still<00:02:27.880> use<00:02:27.910> these<00:02:28.150> akimbo<00:02:28.390> fmg9

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
if you can still use these akimbo fmg9

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.979 
if you can still use these akimbo fmg9
correctly<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:31.209> do<00:02:31.270> good<00:02:31.540> with<00:02:31.690> them<00:02:31.870> I'll

once<00:02:38.739> I<00:02:38.830> like<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.100> a<00:02:39.160> lot<00:02:39.280> better<00:02:39.430> than<00:02:39.700> these

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
once I like it a lot better than these

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.910 
once I like it a lot better than these
things<00:02:40.030> now<00:02:40.239> considering<00:02:41.110> these<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.560> recoil

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
things now considering these the recoil

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.580 
things now considering these the recoil
on<00:02:42.130> them<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.550> just<00:02:42.580> so<00:02:43.330> extreme<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.380> is

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
on them is just so extreme that it is

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.490 
on them is just so extreme that it is
very<00:02:44.800> hard<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.010> control<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:46.420> yeah<00:02:47.140> that's<00:02:47.320> that

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
very hard to control so yeah that's that

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.340 
very hard to control so yeah that's that
here's<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.459> top<00:02:48.730> 95<00:02:49.209> basically<00:02:49.930> I'm<00:02:50.080> showing

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
one shot and that's from about 10 to 12

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.559 
one shot and that's from about 10 to 12
meters<00:03:02.050> away<00:03:02.319> and<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:03.100> very<00:03:03.190> sad<00:03:03.790> that<00:03:04.450> it

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
meters away and that is very sad that it

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.840 
meters away and that is very sad that it
dropped<00:03:04.870> him<00:03:05.050> that<00:03:05.319> quick<00:03:05.709> I<00:03:05.920> really<00:03:06.670> don't

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
dropped him that quick I really don't

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.830 
dropped him that quick I really don't
think<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:07.090> should<00:03:07.120> drop<00:03:07.360> him<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.600> quick<00:03:07.750> I

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
think it should drop him that quick I

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.120 
think it should drop him that quick I
think<00:03:08.019> should<00:03:08.170> be<00:03:08.230> two<00:03:08.410> bullets<00:03:08.769> in<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.920> foot

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
think should be two bullets in the foot

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.030 
think should be two bullets in the foot
from<00:03:09.310> this<00:03:09.430> far<00:03:09.640> away<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:10.480> kill<00:03:11.140> him<00:03:11.260> here<00:03:11.800> I'm

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
from this far away to kill him here I'm

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.830 
from this far away to kill him here I'm
showing<00:03:12.220> off<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.550> spread<00:03:12.880> how<00:03:13.180> I'm<00:03:13.540> gonna<00:03:13.690> hit

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
showing off the spread how I'm gonna hit

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.780 
showing off the spread how I'm gonna hit
him<00:03:13.989> in<00:03:14.050> one<00:03:14.230> shot<00:03:14.470> there<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:15.100> can<00:03:15.370> still<00:03:15.640> do

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
him in one shot there you can still do

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.490 
him in one shot there you can still do
that<00:03:15.819> but<00:03:16.150> if<00:03:16.239> he<00:03:16.330> was<00:03:16.480> moving<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.290> would<00:03:17.380> be<00:03:17.470> a

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
that but if he was moving it would be a

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.050 
that but if he was moving it would be a
lot<00:03:17.769> harder<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.220> do<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.579> you'd<00:03:18.670> have<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.910> hit<00:03:19.030> a

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
lot harder to do and you'd have to hit a

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.050 
lot harder to do and you'd have to hit a
lot<00:03:19.120> more<00:03:19.360> bullets<00:03:19.750> uh<00:03:20.709> it's<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:21.610> little<00:03:21.790> harder

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
lot more bullets uh it's a little harder

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.340 
lot more bullets uh it's a little harder
to<00:03:22.120> hit<00:03:22.239> now<00:03:22.390> there<00:03:22.540> is<00:03:22.660> more<00:03:22.870> spread<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.290> do

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
to hit now there is more spread and I do

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.020 
to hit now there is more spread and I do
