00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:22.340
 and what happens puppies are in orbit 7 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.680
 with vito and with iquique but this will not be 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.080
 a gameplay but a news I've already 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.450
 improved the orbit server 7 before 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.119
 I was on a very slow pc that cost him 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.100
 very much to hold a server and now it's 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.410
 in a much more powerful PC capable of 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.030
 hold up to 100 people and I think that 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.250
 is more the orders that would have to 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.020
 try it but good so far we have not 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.660
 reached 100 people so we go with 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.820
 calm now no longer has falls there is no 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.059
 lag I think we have arrived the other day 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.430
 about 60 people peak without any 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.290
 trace of lage on the server so it goes 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.180
 wonderfully 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.940
 the map is still the same continues with 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.920
 the same rules and it's still premium 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.510
 that is, you can only enter if 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.519
 you have the purchased game that you have 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.740
 bought by minecraft internet you have 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.830
 what to buy online 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.660
 digitally 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.160
 is what I tell you, nothing has changed 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.140
 so everything the same is simply that 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.970
 we have changed from the pc server to 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.620
 is on a more powerful new PC and now 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.700
 Hold the server without any kind of 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.260
 problem 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.820
 you do not have to register anywhere 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.010
 to enter you simply put in orbit 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.430
 7 in the IP that they ask you in multiplayer 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.860
 and to play I will start a new series with 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.990
 the guys on the server but for 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.580
 make it a little more interesting to install 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.380
 some plugins to improve the 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.790
 playability during these days that has 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.240
 been doing tests on the server 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.160
 to see if it works or it already has a 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.370
 whole day opened the new server in 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.840
 ufc and has not fallen has not had the aha 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.289
 state of wonder 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.759
 well that's all I just wanted to give you that 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.530
 information and from now 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.990
