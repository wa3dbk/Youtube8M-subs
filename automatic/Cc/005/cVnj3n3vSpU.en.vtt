00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.670
 7 Hello today we have December 25 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.790
 today was a clear sunny day but 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.199
 it is now 6 5 hours 20 minutes 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:20.490
 the sun sets now it will be dark and 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:24.740
 so we turn on the lights in our 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.199
 greenhouses install shields 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:38.840
 the kidneys are already being seen 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:38.840
 special case because before the light becomes 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:56.040
 the white cord over there lies this 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.730
 by chance like 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.879
 we have a magnetic starter and 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.560
 went process 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:11.360
 Now our lamp and in 19 minutes I'll dial 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.369
 mode and our seedlings will be dedicated 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.740
 yesterday it had to be done for three hours 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.640
 day acer man in the street is not a good day 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.670
 had a passport to the wind 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:30.660
 a pair of very overcast rain and therefore when 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.640
 cyp3a property today we do this 5 i 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.530
 slightly will be provided us somewhere 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.600
 till nine o'clock in the evening 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:42.590
 so that light day was about 12 hours 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:47.720
 less make no sense because 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:55.890
 the plant needs everything to see that our lamps 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:58.130
 inflames and as I said we put on 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.939
 circle 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.720
 screen screens 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.720
 reflects 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.440
 the light that would go out by 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.500
 Ostap it still reflects all the same 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.820
 plants get more and one more for 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.560
 positive moment that we need 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.980
 turn on the heating anyway z 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.810
 will become cold 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:29.830
 lamp as said 300 degrees 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:33.310
 heats up and we will have an extra 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.209
 seedling heating 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.739

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:42.410
