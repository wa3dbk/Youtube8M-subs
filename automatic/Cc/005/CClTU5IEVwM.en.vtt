00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
converted dragons down but we have to

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.900 
converted dragons down but we have to
hold<00:04:00.129> it<00:04:00.250> up<00:04:00.340> always<00:04:00.760> so

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910

up
so<00:04:07.800> after<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.520> surgery<00:04:09.080> animals<00:04:10.080> get<00:04:10.260> cold

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
so after the surgery animals get cold

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.100 
so after the surgery animals get cold
especially<00:04:10.890> these<00:04:11.400> poor<00:04:11.760> guys<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.360> can't

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
especially these poor guys that can't

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.660 
especially these poor guys that can't
regulate<00:04:13.410> their<00:04:13.560> body<00:04:13.860> temperature<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:14.550> we

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
regulate their body temperature so we

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.509 
regulate their body temperature so we
have<00:04:14.820> him<00:04:14.940> on<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.150> hot<00:04:15.420> rock<00:04:16.130> Pat<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:17.459> he

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
have him on a hot rock Pat it so he

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.430 
have him on a hot rock Pat it so he
doesn't<00:04:17.820> get<00:04:17.880> burned<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.540> we<00:04:18.900> have<00:04:19.110> a<00:04:19.140> lender

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
but we cut off the what happened was

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.409 
but we cut off the what happened was
he's<00:05:51.210> actually<00:05:51.960> an<00:05:52.290> outdoor<00:05:52.970> bearded<00:05:53.970> dragon

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
he's actually an outdoor bearded dragon

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.090 
he's actually an outdoor bearded dragon
most<00:05:54.600> of<00:05:54.780> the<00:05:54.840> time<00:05:55.080> he<00:05:55.320> lives<00:05:55.560> out<00:05:55.800> in<00:05:56.040> the

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
most of the time he lives out in the

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.890 
most of the time he lives out in the
yard<00:05:56.490> and<00:05:56.850> they<00:05:57.180> bring<00:05:57.360> him<00:05:57.510> in<00:05:57.630> when<00:05:57.750> it's

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
yard and they bring him in when it's

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.130 
yard and they bring him in when it's
cold<00:05:58.190> but<00:05:59.190> they<00:05:59.700> think<00:05:59.760> maybe<00:06:00.120> a<00:06:00.270> raccoon<00:06:00.570> got

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
cold but they think maybe a raccoon got

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.550 
cold but they think maybe a raccoon got
ahold<00:06:01.380> of<00:06:01.590> him<00:06:01.800> or<00:06:02.130> a<00:06:02.160> cat<00:06:02.840> and<00:06:03.840> he<00:06:03.870> got<00:06:04.440> away
