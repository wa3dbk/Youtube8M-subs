00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.179 
ramp to one meter and stay there I asked
for<00:00:18.630> extra<00:00:18.750> details<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.619> ramp<00:00:19.800> had<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.100> be

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
for extra details the ramp had to be

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.210 
for extra details the ramp had to be
two-and-a-half<00:00:20.730> meters<00:00:21.000> long<00:00:21.859> which<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:22.890> what

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
two-and-a-half meters long which is what

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.609 
two-and-a-half meters long which is what
this<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:26.750> it<00:00:27.750> ends<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.170> at<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.380> meter

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
this one is and it ends up at a meter

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.830 
this one is and it ends up at a meter
high<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:30.890> I've<00:00:31.890> modified<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.790> car<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.630> my

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
high and I've modified this car that my

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.220 
high and I've modified this car that my
grandson<00:00:34.649> made<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:35.370> Christmas<00:00:36.230> actually

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
grandson made for Christmas actually

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
it's the same components from a car that

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.959 
it's the same components from a car that
I<00:00:39.989> made<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.530> before<00:00:41.010> Christmas<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> took

I made just before Christmas that I took

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.410 
I made just before Christmas that I took
apart<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.629> let<00:00:42.750> him<00:00:42.930> reassemble<00:00:44.149> so<00:00:45.149> I'll<00:00:45.239> put

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
apart and let him reassemble so I'll put

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.160 
apart and let him reassemble so I'll put
links<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.260> notes<00:00:48.829> and<00:00:50.840> I'll<00:00:51.840> show

links to that in the notes and I'll show
you<00:00:52.309> what<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> did<00:00:57.140> okay<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.440> challenge<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you what I did okay the challenge is to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.529 
you what I did okay the challenge is to
go<00:00:59.699> up<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.030> rap<00:01:01.039> meter<00:01:02.039> high<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.730> about<00:01:03.120> two<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
go up a rap meter high and about two and

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.200 
go up a rap meter high and about two and
a<00:01:03.629> half<00:01:03.660> meters<00:01:04.290> long<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.949> that's<00:01:05.909> what<00:01:06.119> I've

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
a half meters long so that's what I've

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.429 
a half meters long so that's what I've
constructed

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:25.069 

so<00:01:14.219> first<00:01:14.640> attempt<00:01:23.719> right<00:01:24.719> but<00:01:24.960> we're

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
so first attempt right but we're

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.529 
so first attempt right but we're
supposed<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.409> stay<00:01:25.710> at<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.950> top<00:01:26.189> attend<00:01:26.759> at

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
supposed to stay at the top attend at

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.840 
supposed to stay at the top attend at
least<00:01:27.569> 10<00:01:27.990> seconds<00:01:28.530> right<00:01:29.310> we'll<00:01:29.490> try<00:01:29.640> again

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
least 10 seconds right we'll try again

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.990 
least 10 seconds right we'll try again
all<00:01:30.390> I've<00:01:30.539> done<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.020> I've<00:01:31.429> wired<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.819> rubber

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
all I've done is I've wired the rubber

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.130 
all I've done is I've wired the rubber
bands<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.569> the<00:01:33.689> back<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.079> they<00:01:34.200> can't<00:01:34.439> fly<00:01:34.740> off

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
bands on the back so they can't fly off

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.569 
bands on the back so they can't fly off
so<00:01:37.140> they're<00:01:37.289> permanently<00:01:37.890> fixed<00:01:38.219> to<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.399> back

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
so they're permanently fixed to the back

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:54.090 
so they're permanently fixed to the back
axle

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.150 

okay<00:01:55.100> that's<00:01:55.880> right<00:01:56.120> again<00:01:56.710> I'm<00:01:57.710> not<00:01:57.920> sure

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
okay that's right again I'm not sure

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.010 
okay that's right again I'm not sure
whether<00:01:58.700> we're<00:01:58.880> supposed<00:01:59.120> to<00:01:59.210> start<00:01:59.630> from<00:01:59.900> the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
whether we're supposed to start from the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.340 
whether we're supposed to start from the
ground<00:02:00.170> or<00:02:00.680> start<00:02:01.040> on<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.900> slope<00:02:02.900> so<00:02:03.230> I'm

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
ground or start on the slope so I'm

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.080 
ground or start on the slope so I'm
starting<00:02:03.860> on<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.220> slope<00:02:04.520> at<00:02:04.730> the<00:02:04.790> beginning

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
starting on the slope at the beginning

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.810 
starting on the slope at the beginning
of<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.270> slope<00:02:11.830> need<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.950> wind<00:02:13.160> up<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.460> bit<00:02:13.610> more

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
of the slope need to wind up a bit more

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:23.020 
of the slope need to wind up a bit more
this<00:02:14.000> time<00:02:20.710> I'm<00:02:21.710> planning<00:02:22.280> is<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.550> jamz

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
this time I'm planning is the jamz

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:41.270 
this time I'm planning is the jamz
itself<00:02:23.540> against<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:23.990> top

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.980 

still<00:02:45.300> obviously<00:02:46.300> bit<00:02:46.510> more<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.870> this

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
still obviously bit more to this

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.680 
still obviously bit more to this
challenge<00:02:47.260> than<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.620> thought

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
challenge than I thought

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.350 
challenge than I thought
right<00:02:49.690> I'm<00:02:49.900> going<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.050> try<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.260> modification

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
right I'm going to try a modification

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.270 
right I'm going to try a modification
I've<00:02:52.360> cut<00:02:52.720> up<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:53.050> plastic<00:02:53.910> pop<00:02:54.910> bottle<00:02:56.250> cut<00:02:57.250> a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
I've cut up a plastic pop bottle cut a

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.560 
I've cut up a plastic pop bottle cut a
strip<00:02:57.640> off<00:02:57.820> it<00:02:59.310> there's<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.430> couple<00:03:01.210> of<00:03:01.270> little

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
strip off it there's a couple of little

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.930 
strip off it there's a couple of little
notches<00:03:02.440> I've<00:03:02.770> cut<00:03:02.980> in<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.280> which<00:03:03.430> line<00:03:03.790> up

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
notches I've cut in it which line up

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.520 
notches I've cut in it which line up
with<00:03:04.090> where<00:03:04.240> the<00:03:04.390> wheels<00:03:04.690> are<00:03:07.260> that's<00:03:08.260> visible

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
with where the wheels are that's visible

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.960 
with where the wheels are that's visible
or<00:03:08.890> not<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:09.570> shall<00:03:10.570> hot<00:03:10.780> glue<00:03:11.310> this<00:03:12.310> plastic

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
or not I shall hot glue this plastic

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.650 
or not I shall hot glue this plastic
strip<00:03:13.330> onto<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:14.050> chassis<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:16.090> idea<00:03:16.450> is

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
strip onto the chassis and the idea is

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.280 
strip onto the chassis and the idea is
that<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.990> wheels<00:03:17.200> can<00:03:17.470> go<00:03:17.680> forwards<00:03:19.140> but<00:03:20.140> when

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
that the wheels can go forwards but when

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.110 
that the wheels can go forwards but when
they<00:03:20.410> try<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.680> roll<00:03:20.890> back<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.550> will<00:03:21.670> dig<00:03:21.910> into

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
they try and roll back it will dig into

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.040 
they try and roll back it will dig into
the<00:03:22.390> plastic<00:03:24.180> don't<00:03:25.180> know<00:03:25.300> if<00:03:25.360> that's<00:03:25.540> visible

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
the plastic don't know if that's visible

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.030 
the plastic don't know if that's visible
or<00:03:26.200> not<00:03:27.840> we'll<00:03:28.840> see<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:29.380> might<00:03:29.620> help<00:03:29.800> anyway

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
or not we'll see that might help anyway

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.780 
or not we'll see that might help anyway
right<00:03:33.040> then<00:03:33.960> flick<00:03:34.960> my<00:03:35.200> bits<00:03:36.070> of<00:03:36.220> plastic<00:03:36.640> out

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
right then flick my bits of plastic out

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.570 
right then flick my bits of plastic out
the<00:03:36.940> way<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:37.810> I<00:03:37.840> can<00:03:38.070> wine<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.310> wheels

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
the way so I can wine the wheels

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:57.630 
the way so I can wine the wheels
backwards

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.950 

that<00:03:58.640> looks<00:03:58.850> good<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.240> me

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.860 

okay<00:04:02.960> summary<00:04:03.530> time<00:04:05.980> if<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.100> can<00:04:07.220> see<00:04:07.490> that's

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
okay summary time if you can see that's

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.950 
okay summary time if you can see that's
my<00:04:08.870> one<00:04:09.140> meter<00:04:09.970> height<00:04:12.940> as<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.210> car<00:04:14.480> sitting

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
my one meter height as the car sitting

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:22.270 
my one meter height as the car sitting
patiently<00:04:20.020> so<00:04:21.020> I<00:04:21.049> have<00:04:21.140> no<00:04:21.320> idea<00:04:21.590> what<00:04:21.830> design

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
patiently so I have no idea what design

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.220 
patiently so I have no idea what design
the<00:04:22.520> ramp<00:04:22.730> should<00:04:23.030> have<00:04:23.150> been<00:04:23.360> but<00:04:23.810> that's<00:04:24.020> the

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
the ramp should have been but that's the

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.560 
the ramp should have been but that's the
ramp<00:04:24.410> that<00:04:24.590> I<00:04:24.620> made<00:04:25.660> it's<00:04:26.660> just<00:04:28.240> over<00:04:29.240> two<00:04:29.420> and

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
ramp that I made it's just over two and

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.330 
ramp that I made it's just over two and
a<00:04:29.600> half<00:04:29.780> meters<00:04:30.260> long<00:04:30.590> in<00:04:31.840> fact<00:04:32.840> I<00:04:32.930> think<00:04:32.990> it's

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
a half meters long in fact I think it's

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.510 
a half meters long in fact I think it's
it's<00:04:34.340> 2.5<00:04:34.820> -<00:04:35.540> there<00:04:36.640> I<00:04:38.830> stuck<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:39.860> big<00:04:40.100> block<00:04:40.340> of

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
it's 2.5 - there I stuck a big block of

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.130 
it's 2.5 - there I stuck a big block of
wood<00:04:40.640> at<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:40.880> end<00:04:41.030> there<00:04:41.270> so<00:04:41.300> it<00:04:41.630> doesn't<00:04:41.870> fly

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
wood at the end there so it doesn't fly

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.830 
wood at the end there so it doesn't fly
off<00:04:42.170> and<00:04:42.530> hit<00:04:42.650> my<00:04:42.800> windows<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:45.050> car<00:04:45.290> itself<00:04:45.800> is

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
off and hit my windows the car itself is

grandson assembled at Christmastime the
only<00:05:09.350> modifications<00:05:10.250> I've<00:05:10.490> done<00:05:10.730> to<00:05:11.000> it<00:05:11.150> is

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
only modifications I've done to it is

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.680 
only modifications I've done to it is
I've<00:05:12.190> trimmed<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.460> front<00:05:13.670> axle<00:05:14.150> so<00:05:14.360> it<00:05:14.390> fits

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
I've trimmed the front axle so it fits

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.060 
I've trimmed the front axle so it fits
inside<00:05:15.230> my<00:05:15.560> track<00:05:17.440> so<00:05:18.440> that's<00:05:18.710> no<00:05:18.890> different

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
inside my track so that's no different

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.860 
inside my track so that's no different
to<00:05:19.370> what<00:05:19.460> it<00:05:19.580> was<00:05:19.700> anyway<00:05:22.480> I've<00:05:23.480> got<00:05:23.600> three

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
to what it was anyway I've got three

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.420 
to what it was anyway I've got three
lots<00:05:24.050> of<00:05:24.200> rubber<00:05:24.380> bands<00:05:24.680> on<00:05:24.920> there<00:05:25.130> but<00:05:25.340> that's

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
lots of rubber bands on there but that's

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.220 
lots of rubber bands on there but that's
irrelevant<00:05:25.610> it<00:05:26.120> just<00:05:26.300> depends<00:05:26.630> what<00:05:26.780> sort<00:05:27.110> of

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
irrelevant it just depends what sort of

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.910 
irrelevant it just depends what sort of
rubber<00:05:27.470> bands<00:05:27.740> you're<00:05:28.010> allowed<00:05:28.190> to<00:05:28.400> use<00:05:29.920> the

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
rubber bands you're allowed to use the

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.380 
rubber bands you're allowed to use the
big<00:05:31.130> modification<00:05:33.550> was<00:05:34.550> to<00:05:34.760> stick<00:05:35.030> this<00:05:35.210> bit

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
big modification was to stick this bit

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
big modification was to stick this bit
of<00:05:35.650> plastic<00:05:36.650> on<00:05:36.830> it<00:05:36.980> that<00:05:37.220> I<00:05:37.250> cut<00:05:37.550> from<00:05:37.790> a<00:05:38.410> pop

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
of plastic on it that I cut from a pop

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.180 
of plastic on it that I cut from a pop
bottle<00:05:39.740> and<00:05:41.020> that<00:05:42.020> acts<00:05:42.290> as<00:05:42.470> a<00:05:42.530> ratchet

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
bottle and that acts as a ratchet

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.970 
bottle and that acts as a ratchet
because<00:05:43.580> it<00:05:44.050> digs<00:05:45.050> into<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:45.530> back<00:05:45.680> wheels

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
because it digs into the back wheels

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.120 
because it digs into the back wheels
there<00:05:46.400> to<00:05:46.640> stop<00:05:46.850> them<00:05:46.970> rolling<00:05:47.330> backwards<00:05:48.130> so

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
there to stop them rolling backwards so

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.470 
there to stop them rolling backwards so
that's<00:05:49.340> how<00:05:49.520> my<00:05:49.700> car<00:05:50.890> stops<00:05:51.890> nicely<00:05:52.520> when<00:05:53.390> it

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
that's how my car stops nicely when it

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.570 
that's how my car stops nicely when it
gets<00:05:53.660> to<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:53.900> top

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
gets to the top

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.280 
gets to the top
gives<00:05:56.580> forwards<00:05:57.090> but<00:05:57.840> it<00:05:57.960> doesn't<00:05:58.200> go

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
gives forwards but it doesn't go

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.230 
gives forwards but it doesn't go
backwards<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:01.110> whales<00:06:01.650> have<00:06:02.010> got<00:06:02.240> rubber

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240
