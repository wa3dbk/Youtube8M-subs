champion table now we just did a simple

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.910 
champion table now we just did a simple
one<00:00:15.059> last<00:00:15.299> video<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.049> I'd<00:00:16.500> like<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.740> said<00:00:16.890> I

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
one last video and I'd like I said I

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.900 
one last video and I'd like I said I
would<00:00:16.980> be<00:00:17.100> uploading<00:00:17.460> all<00:00:17.550> three<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.820> these

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
would be uploading all three of these

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.640 
would be uploading all three of these
videos<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.420> one<00:00:18.570> day<00:00:18.750> but<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.529> whole

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
videos in one day but the whole

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.380 
videos in one day but the whole
difference<00:00:20.039> with<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.340> one<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.359> is

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
difference with this one is that it is

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.240 
difference with this one is that it is
flush<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> fork<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.949> can<00:00:23.039> see<00:00:23.130> you

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
flush to the fork as you can see you

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.980 
flush to the fork as you can see you
don't<00:00:23.369> see<00:00:23.550> any<00:00:23.880> carpets<00:00:24.359> or<00:00:24.480> anything<00:00:24.689> like

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
don't see any carpets or anything like

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.929 
don't see any carpets or anything like
that<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.560> also<00:00:25.769> uses<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.460> T<00:00:26.730> flip-flop

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
that and it also uses a T flip-flop

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.910 
that and it also uses a T flip-flop
instead<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.689> holding<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.109> pulse<00:00:28.320> through<00:00:28.859> a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
instead of holding the pulse through a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.560 
instead of holding the pulse through a
chest<00:00:29.490> now<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.820> should<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.119> got<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.359> out<00:00:30.539> of

inside<00:00:42.180> my<00:00:42.420> enchantment<00:00:42.750> table<00:00:43.050> right<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:43.440> I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
inside my enchantment table right here I

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.650 
inside my enchantment table right here I
just<00:00:43.860> see<00:00:44.129> my<00:00:44.280> enchantment<00:00:44.700> room<00:00:45.000> pops<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:45.480> out

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
just see my enchantment room pops up out

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.840 
just see my enchantment room pops up out
of<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.870> ground<00:00:46.079> obviously<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.430> flush<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
of the ground obviously it is flush to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.040 
of the ground obviously it is flush to
the<00:00:47.940> floor<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.360> completely<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.960> I

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
the floor and is completely in it I

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.869 
the floor and is completely in it I
guess<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.350> also<00:00:49.530> hidden<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.010> well<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
guess it's also hidden as well so it's a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
guess it's also hidden as well so it's a
hit<00:00:51.090> flush<00:00:51.390> hittin<00:00:51.690> enchantment<00:00:52.350> table<00:00:52.649> room

we have a dropper right here going into

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.550 
we have a dropper right here going into
this<00:04:07.820> dropper<00:04:08.270> this<00:04:08.750> dropper<00:04:09.110> is<00:04:09.170> going<00:04:09.350> into

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
this dropper this dropper is going into

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.290 
this dropper this dropper is going into
this<00:04:09.709> dropper<00:04:10.160> and<00:04:10.310> then<00:04:10.700> this<00:04:10.850> dropper<00:04:11.209> is

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
this dropper and then this dropper is

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.210 
this dropper and then this dropper is
going<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.570> be<00:04:11.720> going<00:04:11.959> into<00:04:12.110> a<00:04:12.290> hopper<00:04:12.860> oh<00:04:12.980> we're

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
going to be going into a hopper oh we're

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.470 
going to be going into a hopper oh we're
going<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.400> need<00:04:13.580> three<00:04:13.880> hoppers<00:04:14.209> that<00:04:14.300> means

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
going to need three hoppers that means

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.360 
going to need three hoppers that means
we're<00:04:14.630> going<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.810> need<00:04:14.959> three<00:04:15.140> hoppers<00:04:15.500> not

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
we're going to need three hoppers not

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.190 
we're going to need three hoppers not
two<00:04:16.730> so<00:04:17.090> I'll<00:04:17.390> probably<00:04:17.570> just<00:04:17.750> say<00:04:17.959> that<00:04:18.109> in

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
two so I'll probably just say that in

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.360 
two so I'll probably just say that in
the<00:04:18.260> beginning<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.650> video<00:04:18.770> so<00:04:19.070> we<00:04:19.190> don't

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
the beginning of the video so we don't

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.099 
the beginning of the video so we don't
mess<00:04:19.760> up<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.090> whole<00:04:20.180> way<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.600> then<00:04:20.989> we're

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
mess up the whole way and then we're

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.330 
mess up the whole way and then we're
gonna<00:04:21.200> put<00:04:21.350> a<00:04:21.380> hopper<00:04:21.650> going<00:04:21.830> into<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.160> back

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340

a comparator going this way I see the
comparator<00:04:37.800> came<00:04:37.950> on<00:04:38.070> because<00:04:38.250> there's<00:04:38.400> an

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
comparator came on because there's an

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.820 
comparator came on because there's an
item<00:04:38.640> in<00:04:38.820> there<00:04:38.970> right<00:04:39.090> now<00:04:39.440> I'm<00:04:40.440> gonna<00:04:40.650> put<00:04:40.800> a

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
dust we're gonna put another repeater

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.300 
dust we're gonna put another repeater
and<00:04:54.270> then<00:04:54.930> put<00:04:55.050> redstone<00:04:55.260> dust<00:04:55.560> going<00:04:55.770> all<00:04:56.040> the

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.140 
top into top top of these torches like
this<00:05:43.020> so<00:05:43.320> go<00:05:43.470> around<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.740> whole<00:05:43.830> tyre<00:05:44.070> thing

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.820 

go<00:05:48.150> every<00:05:48.750> single<00:05:48.930> sticky<00:05:49.260> piston<00:05:49.620> should

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
go every single sticky piston should

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.560 
go every single sticky piston should
extend<00:05:50.190> up<00:05:50.840> go<00:05:51.840> and<00:05:52.080> one<00:05:52.710> more<00:05:52.890> like<00:05:53.070> that

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
extend up go and one more like that

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.640 
extend up go and one more like that
that's<00:05:54.570> what<00:05:54.720> we're<00:05:54.840> going<00:05:54.930> to<00:05:55.050> go<00:05:55.290> ahead<00:05:55.500> and

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
that's what we're going to go ahead and

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
go obviously it won't extend up if you

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.620 
go obviously it won't extend up if you
have<00:06:01.710> a<00:06:01.740> discus<00:06:02.580> on<00:06:02.760> this<00:06:03.000> redstone<00:06:03.300> dust<00:06:03.479> is

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.030 
have a discus on this redstone dust is
on<00:06:03.750> then<00:06:03.900> they're<00:06:04.080> not<00:06:04.200> going<00:06:04.380> to<00:06:04.470> extend<00:06:04.740> out

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
on then they're not going to extend out

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.010 
on then they're not going to extend out
