00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.920
 very good guys here we are in others 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.330
 gt5 languages online and in this case os 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.620
 I bring a new speed test and in 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.200
 this case they face chance in 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.360
 shenyang the environment against the fighter 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.040
 effectively the sector of that car the 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.470
 fastest car from gta 5 online a day 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.089
 today against the fighter the plane more 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.859
 fast gta 5 as you already know the 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.599
 vehicle goes fast saying it clear but 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.609
 the environment the face now we will see 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.230
 some guys before commenting tell you is 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.880
 super important that the pse environment not 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.829
 are you nothing to the maximum vales environment 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.089
 it's totally standard and you're still going 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.429
 to see what the environment does against 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.840
 hunt so imagine that if this 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.800
 environment was tuned because it is not 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.120
 next to you because we were 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.280
 doing with the creator of games worth 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.019
 If this video supports you a lot 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.820
 better in an upcoming video within about 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.559
 days then raise others with him the center 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.730
 not created but for this we will need 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.170
 much longer since we will have to 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.179
 catch the hunt center do not take it 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.620
 up there etcetera and also the hunt 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.760
 always almost explodes then then 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.370
 we will have to catch a fighter every time 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.170
 we're going to do it and so on so 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.850
 I say if you like this video very much this 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.929
 hunting against that environment then put the 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.219
 comments leave a like and then 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.749
 soon the best I bring you a 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.550
 center not tuned against the fighter voucher 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.809
 then shortly before starting too 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.309
 before I start, I will not be seeing it 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.989
 the telephone operators seeing as good the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.790
 hunting 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.229
 gives a bit of a beating to the environment 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.670
 but you're going to see what we're going to do 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.799
 two ways the tel is worth first you go to 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.720
 see how a person mounts on top of 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.540
 hunting and is already assembled waiting for 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.369
 we give the beginning of the exit of the 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.479
 race and then you will see good and 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.530
 You are also going to see how another person 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.420
 is mounted the center is my waiting 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.649
 we want the exit beep and 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.119
 then you will see how the two go out to 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.649
 the time and the hunt obviously has 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.479
 much more acceleration than the environment 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.009
 because you see that they eat them and then 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.689
 the fighter has much more speed 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.789
 maximum not that of environment but what 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.649
 it happens then that we are going to make another 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.530
 kind of speed test in which 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.390
 the fighter or you are going to say good give and 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.440
 is that if you are like the center, 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.179
 has assembled but is that the other person 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.409
 you have already left the race in the 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.670
 speed test and the other person 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.319
 is still riding on the fighter not 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.970
 no no to see this way we are 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.289
 doing because the way hunting 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.490
 previous as you have already seen once 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.170
 that the person is already mounted the fighter 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.429
 is on then what happens to the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.929
 be on because the engines are 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.330
 to the maximum and only only with pressing 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.100
 the r2 ignites the propeller and already 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.420
 runs a selective amount a 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.099
 impressive acceleration and that between 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.260
 quotes is not valid because now 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.240
 we are doing the way in which 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.520
 the environment starts to run since the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.990
 hunting ignites the passing engines that 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.210
 from the previous form and the hunt had 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.140
 the engines prepared and in this one is 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.880
 this way we are doing now 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.280
 we are doing what the environment 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.870
 it comes out just when the fighter turns on 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.190
 the engines is just when you are 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.450
 getting into the plane are sort of 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.220
 beep you click and then already 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.260
 listen to the fighter then it already puts that 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.580
 moment that environment comes out fast before and 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.110
 good before but not at the same time 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.540
 the engines are turned on and then the 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.440
 hunting as you see does not accelerate so fast 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.120
 as when they already have the motor 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.680
 prepared that he sees it a little unfair not 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.190
 for in certain it is not better than to do it 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.840
 with the newly fired fighter so 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.120
 say it no longer with all the engines 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.650
 prepared then and you see that with the 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.420
 unlit engines that is to say with the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.710
 newly ignited engines the center does not 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.990
 has more acceleration than what comes to 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.450
 be the fighter but obviously later you see 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.220
 that the two reach the end of the in the 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.480
 clover airport totally at 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.370
 limit or both reach almost to the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.110
 same time so we could say that 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.000
 in the length of what comes to be the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.410
 Trevor airport the two are very 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.720
 very, very close, but yes 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.070
 obviously the airport was longer 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.510
 obviously the fighter would win since the 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.610
 hunting as you know is a plane of 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.200
 propulsion is a military aircraft one of 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.700
 the most powerful aircraft in the world 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.800
 then obviously he has to 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.730
 run more than a car and it's the best 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.230
 world car probably has 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.190
 run more than the car but as you see 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.349
 is the length of what is the 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.000
 Trevor airport the center does not 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.379
 plant much face time good much load 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.250
 not that many times he wins because 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.480
 always comes a little before a 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.040
 a little bit later then that's 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.360
 difference quite but as you can see the 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.980
 At the end of the day there are times when 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.180
 you win, but what happens then? 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.560
 obviously if it were longer then the 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.840
 hunting was eaten that the fighter and a 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.730
 speed the highest tip speed of the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.870
 gta 5 game as well as the guys 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.519
 then the truth a speed test 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.810
 pretty pretty cool you have me 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.459
 asked for a lot yesterday I strike a tweet and I 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.410
 you all said yes so here's what 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.610
 you have the truth, imagine the center 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.160
 totally tuned 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.480
 I would even think to see what would happen 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.459
 with the fighter already with the engines 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.870
 preparations is worth now that I look for 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.910
 prepared engines the fighter shoots a lot 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.860
 but the center of a tunnel to the maximum is 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.739
 that really is the center to the maximum is 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.239
 an outrageous thing so I do not know what 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.430
 would happen if you want me to make a text 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.260
 later of elaborated video 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.610
 a pretty pretty even test 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.230
 which I hope the state assigns 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.489
 true this video you can see everything if you have 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.230
 liked to subscribe have been the 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.230
 taiz and see you in the next goodbye
