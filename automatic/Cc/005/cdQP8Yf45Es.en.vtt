of memory using a micro SD card and you
can<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.890> course<00:01:53.159> use<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.430> 5<00:01:53.850> volt<00:01:54.119> one<00:01:54.420> ampere

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
can of course use the 5 volt one ampere

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.530 
can of course use the 5 volt one ampere
port<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.979> charge<00:01:56.009> your<00:01:56.549> devices<00:01:56.850> using<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.390> USB

port to charge your devices using a USB
cable<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.229> recharge<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.770> pretty<00:01:59.009> fast<00:01:59.340> since

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
cable and recharge is pretty fast since

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.240 
cable and recharge is pretty fast since
it's<00:02:00.180> one<00:02:00.360> ampere<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.469> that's<00:02:01.680> all<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.159> you

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
it's one ampere so that's all that you

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.639 
it's one ampere so that's all that you
get<00:02:02.399> inside<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.909> box<00:02:03.119> really<00:02:03.540> nice<00:02:03.899> portable
