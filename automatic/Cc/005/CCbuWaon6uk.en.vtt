and<00:03:30.030> then<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.750> blurs<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.440> little<00:03:31.560> more<00:03:31.860> right

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
and then it blurs it a little more right

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.009 
and then it blurs it a little more right
here<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:32.549> you<00:03:32.640> see<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:32.940> you're<00:03:33.180> not<00:03:33.600> able<00:03:33.780> to

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
here is you see that you're not able to

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.009 
here is you see that you're not able to
see<00:03:34.170> very<00:03:34.530> clearly<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:35.730> apps<00:03:36.150> behind<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.989> like

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
see very clearly the apps behind it like

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.250 
see very clearly the apps behind it like
it<00:03:37.350> was<00:03:37.380> before<00:03:37.680> or<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.640> can<00:03:38.930> decrease<00:03:39.930> the

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
it was before or you can decrease the

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.979 
it was before or you can decrease the
blurriness<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:42.180> can<00:03:42.329> see<00:03:42.630> straight

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
blurriness and you can see straight

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.440 
blurriness and you can see straight
through<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.530> but<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.220> has<00:03:44.370> like<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.670> dimmed

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
through it but it has like a dimmed

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.710 
through it but it has like a dimmed
background<00:03:46.110> so<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:47.130> kind<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.820> like<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.390> prefer

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
background so I kind of like it I prefer

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.740 
background so I kind of like it I prefer
it<00:03:49.110> like<00:03:49.560> in<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.799> middle<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.280> now<00:03:51.239> below<00:03:51.540> that

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
it like in the middle and now below that

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.240 
it like in the middle and now below that
we<00:03:51.900> do<00:03:52.200> have<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.560> dark<00:03:52.829> and<00:03:52.980> amount

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
we do have the dark and amount

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.490 
we do have the dark and amount
percentage<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.510> if<00:03:54.630> we<00:03:54.720> go<00:03:54.840> all<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.200> way<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.320> a

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
percentage so if we go all the way to a

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.870 
percentage so if we go all the way to a
hundred<00:03:55.860> percent<00:03:56.390> then<00:03:57.390> it'll<00:03:58.290> completely

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
hundred percent then it'll completely

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.880 
hundred percent then it'll completely
darken<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.120> background<00:04:00.410> as<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.530> see<00:04:01.680> there

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
darken the background as you see there

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.690 
darken the background as you see there
and<00:04:02.220> if<00:04:02.940> we<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.299> course<00:04:03.980> decrease<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.190> all<00:04:05.400> the

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
and if we of course decrease it all the

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.039 
and if we of course decrease it all the
way<00:04:05.760> down<00:04:06.000> it's<00:04:06.420> going<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.630> be<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.810> little

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
way down it's going to be a little

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.170 
way down it's going to be a little
lighter<00:04:07.320> than<00:04:07.620> what<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.130> was<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.970> yeah<00:04:09.090> I'm

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
lighter than what it was but yeah I'm

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.759 
lighter than what it was but yeah I'm
going<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.420> go<00:04:09.540> ahead<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:09.989> leave<00:04:10.200> it<00:04:10.380> in<00:04:10.530> the

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
going to go ahead and leave it in the

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.259 
going to go ahead and leave it in the
middle<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.160> then<00:04:11.820> right<00:04:12.000> here<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.209> the

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
middle and then right here in the

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.319 
middle and then right here in the
animation<00:04:12.660> so<00:04:13.500> if<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:13.860> decrease<00:04:14.100> it<00:04:14.549> it'll

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
animation so if I decrease it it'll

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.270 
animation so if I decrease it it'll
quickly<00:04:15.510> do<00:04:15.840> an<00:04:15.959> animation<00:04:16.260> so<00:04:16.680> if<00:04:16.769> I<00:04:16.859> swipe<00:04:17.040> up

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
quickly do an animation so if I swipe up

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.880 
quickly do an animation so if I swipe up
you<00:04:17.640> see<00:04:17.820> how<00:04:17.910> quickly<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.390> did<00:04:18.600> it<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.709> then

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
you see how quickly that did it and then

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.550 
you see how quickly that did it and then
we<00:04:20.010> go<00:04:20.190> ahead<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.750> change<00:04:21.750> this<00:04:21.900> lighter<00:04:22.349> all

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
we go ahead and change this lighter all

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.860 
we go ahead and change this lighter all
the<00:04:22.620> way<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.919> right<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:24.090> slowly<00:04:24.390> fades

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
the way to the right and it slowly fades

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.960 
the way to the right and it slowly fades
into<00:04:25.229> your<00:04:25.680> notifications<00:04:26.490> right

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
into your notifications right

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.270 
into your notifications right
they're<00:04:27.090> so<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.720> mean<00:04:28.170> either<00:04:28.500> way<00:04:28.680> I<00:04:28.920> mean<00:04:29.040> I

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
they're so I mean either way I mean I

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.120 
they're so I mean either way I mean I
kind<00:04:29.730> of<00:04:29.760> like<00:04:29.910> it<00:04:29.940> in<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.240> middle<00:04:30.390> once<00:04:30.930> again

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
kind of like it in the middle once again

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.890 
kind of like it in the middle once again
and<00:04:32.130> right<00:04:32.880> below<00:04:33.000> that<00:04:33.120> we<00:04:33.360> have<00:04:33.390> been<00:04:33.720> able

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
and right below that we have been able

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.590 
and right below that we have been able
to<00:04:34.050> pull<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.860> refresh<00:04:35.010> so<00:04:35.910> that<00:04:36.060> means<00:04:36.300> if<00:04:36.480> we

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
to pull to refresh so that means if we

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.370 
to pull to refresh so that means if we
have<00:04:36.720> that<00:04:36.870> enabled<00:04:37.290> I<00:04:38.570> can<00:04:39.570> simply<00:04:39.870> swipe<00:04:40.140> up

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
have that enabled I can simply swipe up

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.110 
have that enabled I can simply swipe up
and<00:04:40.620> then<00:04:40.800> pull<00:04:41.040> this<00:04:41.190> down<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:41.760> you'll<00:04:41.880> see

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
and then pull this down and you'll see

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.570 
and then pull this down and you'll see
it<00:04:42.300> refreshing<00:04:42.930> right<00:04:43.080> there<00:04:43.320> just<00:04:44.190> like<00:04:44.310> that

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
it refreshing right there just like that

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.750 
it refreshing right there just like that
so<00:04:45.180> that<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:45.930> what<00:04:46.110> that<00:04:46.320> does<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.890> include

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
so that is what that does and include

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.360 
so that is what that does and include
the<00:04:47.970> notification<00:04:48.600> count<00:04:48.810> if<00:04:49.020> i<00:04:49.380> disable<00:04:50.040> that

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
the notification count if i disable that

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.420 
the notification count if i disable that
you<00:04:51.030> might<00:04:51.240> have<00:04:51.480> just<00:04:51.660> seen<00:04:51.840> that<00:04:51.990> right<00:04:52.140> now

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
you might have just seen that right now

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.880 
you might have just seen that right now
if<00:04:53.430> I<00:04:53.520> swipe<00:04:53.940> up<00:04:54.240> it<00:04:54.810> doesn't<00:04:55.020> show<00:04:55.470> how<00:04:55.710> many

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890
