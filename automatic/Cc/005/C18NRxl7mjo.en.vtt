which is a spectacular vehicle you were

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.130 
which is a spectacular vehicle you were
telling<00:00:24.060> us<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> different<00:00:24.570> features<00:00:24.689> about

telling us the different features about
it<00:00:25.289> what<00:00:26.039> makes<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.340> different<00:00:26.490> from<00:00:26.670> a

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
it what makes it different from a

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.220 
it what makes it different from a
regular<00:00:27.210> Cayenne

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230

you<00:00:28.650> know<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> puzzle<00:00:29.189> board<00:00:29.279> now<00:00:29.460> is

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
you know the puzzle board now is

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.640 
you know the puzzle board now is
everything<00:00:29.760> with<00:00:29.970> hybrid<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.260> Porsche

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
everything with hybrid and so Porsche

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.139 
everything with hybrid and so Porsche
just<00:00:31.859> didn't<00:00:32.099> jump<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.489> they<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.759> think<00:00:33.059> they

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
just didn't jump in they I think they

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.580 
just didn't jump in they I think they
did<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> lot<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.540> research<00:00:33.930> before<00:00:34.140> he<00:00:34.380> came<00:00:34.530> out

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
did a lot of research before he came out

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.130 
did a lot of research before he came out
with<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> hybrids<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:36.510> tell<00:00:36.660> us<00:00:36.719> about<00:00:36.840> this

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
with the hybrids so tell us about this

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.410 
with the hybrids so tell us about this
what<00:00:37.320> makes<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.649> different<00:00:38.070> than<00:00:38.420> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
what makes this different than the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.030 
what makes this different than the
previous<00:00:39.809> generation<00:00:40.290> Cayenne<00:00:40.649> as<00:00:40.770> far<00:00:40.980> as

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
previous generation Cayenne as far as

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.760 
previous generation Cayenne as far as
now<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.219> got<00:00:41.430> now<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> hybrid<00:00:43.640> v6

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
now you got now you have a hybrid v6

to<00:05:07.479> learn<00:05:07.600> today<00:05:08.020> was<00:05:08.200> that<00:05:08.350> you<00:05:09.100> PDK<00:05:09.910> isn't<00:05:10.479> an

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
to learn today was that you PDK isn't an

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.140 
to learn today was that you PDK isn't an
option<00:05:10.720> it's<00:05:11.490> kitronik<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:12.640> that's<00:05:12.790> because

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
option it's kitronik and that's because

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.170 
option it's kitronik and that's because
of<00:05:13.270> the<00:05:13.390> towing<00:05:13.810> right<00:05:13.960> correct<00:05:14.590> yes<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.550> all

of the towing right correct yes the all

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.219 
of the towing right correct yes the all
of<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.570> new<00:05:16.690> Cayennes

of the new Cayennes
for<00:05:18.010> 2011<00:05:18.669> have<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.900> Tiptronic<00:05:20.229> transmission

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
for 2011 have the Tiptronic transmission

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.820 
for 2011 have the Tiptronic transmission
it's<00:05:21.940> now<00:05:22.090> an<00:05:22.270> 8-speed<00:05:22.720> transmission<00:05:22.840> but<00:05:23.710> the

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
it's now an 8-speed transmission but the

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.070 
it's now an 8-speed transmission but the
reason<00:05:24.130> we<00:05:24.250> use<00:05:24.280> a<00:05:24.430> Tiptronic<00:05:25.060> versus<00:05:25.510> the<00:05:25.630> PDK

I<00:06:01.370> would<00:06:02.300> imagine<00:06:02.480> this<00:06:02.750> technology<00:06:03.320> may<00:06:03.500> make

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
I would imagine this technology may make

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
it to other Porsche models as well I

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.830 
it to other Porsche models as well I
suppose<00:06:07.430> that<00:06:07.490> is<00:06:07.760> always<00:06:07.910> a<00:06:08.030> possibility<00:06:08.270> I

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
suppose that is always a possibility I

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.330 
suppose that is always a possibility I
believe<00:06:09.410> there<00:06:09.560> was<00:06:09.590> a<00:06:09.680> statement<00:06:10.010> yesterday

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
believe there was a statement yesterday

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.730 
believe there was a statement yesterday

Porsches<00:06:13.100> interest<00:06:13.430> and<00:06:13.790> hybrids<00:06:14.510> across

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
Porsches interest and hybrids across

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.780 
Porsches interest and hybrids across
different<00:06:15.680> model<00:06:15.890> platforms<00:06:16.310> in<00:06:16.430> the<00:06:16.460> future

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
different model platforms in the future

different model platforms in the future
of<00:06:17.180> course<00:06:17.300> we<00:06:17.480> don't<00:06:17.570> have<00:06:17.690> any<00:06:17.810> dates<00:06:19.090> to

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
of course we don't have any dates to

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.210 
of course we don't have any dates to
approximate<00:06:20.570> at<00:06:20.720> this<00:06:20.810> time<00:06:20.990> I<00:06:21.320> think<00:06:21.950> what

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
approximate at this time I think what

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.740 
approximate at this time I think what
we're<00:06:22.340> looking<00:06:22.610> here<00:06:22.760> is<00:06:22.910> that<00:06:23.120> you<00:06:23.480> can<00:06:23.600> go

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
we're looking here is that you can go

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.750 
we're looking here is that you can go
green<00:06:24.050> you<00:06:24.710> can<00:06:24.830> get<00:06:24.950> a<00:06:24.980> hybrid<00:06:25.370> and<00:06:25.580> you<00:06:25.640> don't

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
green you can get a hybrid and you don't

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.200 
green you can get a hybrid and you don't
have<00:06:25.820> to<00:06:25.970> sacrifice<00:06:26.150> any<00:06:26.630> performance
