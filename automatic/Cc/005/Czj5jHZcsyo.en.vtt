actually<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.860> tried<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.250> couple<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.550> years

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
actually I tried it a couple of years

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.190 
actually I tried it a couple of years
ago<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.030> didn't<00:00:39.239> work<00:00:39.360> too<00:00:39.600> well<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.110> gonna

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
ago it didn't work too well so I'm gonna

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.110 
ago it didn't work too well so I'm gonna
try<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:40.950> more<00:00:41.010> time

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
try it one more time

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.430 
try it one more time
before<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.600> go<00:00:42.809> back<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> my<00:00:43.290> regular<00:00:45.200> soil<00:00:46.200> mix

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
before I go back to my regular soil mix

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.700 
before I go back to my regular soil mix
that<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> make<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.570> I<00:00:48.570> put<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.440> water

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
that I make and I put it in water

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.500 
that I make and I put it in water
overnight<00:00:50.100> last<00:00:50.550> night<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.090> now<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
overnight last night it is now the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.689 
overnight last night it is now the
beginning<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:52.110> February<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.920> Central<00:00:53.520> Florida

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
beginning of February in Central Florida

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.689 
beginning of February in Central Florida
and<00:00:54.210> we're<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.289> our<00:00:55.829> temperatures<00:00:56.309> are<00:00:56.489> about

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
and we're in our temperatures are about

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.819 
and we're in our temperatures are about
mid<00:00:57.059> 50s<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.730> I<00:01:00.210> thought<00:01:00.600> I'd<00:01:00.750> start<00:01:01.050> now<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
mid 50s so I thought I'd start now and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.340 
mid 50s so I thought I'd start now and
here's<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.879> picture<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> seed<00:01:03.930> starting

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
potting mix by Miracle Grow and here's

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.399 
potting mix by Miracle Grow and here's
the<00:01:07.380> other<00:01:07.409> thirty-six<00:01:08.689> cells<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.049> will

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the other thirty-six cells that I will

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.090 
the other thirty-six cells that I will
start<00:01:10.920> another<00:01:11.820> set<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.270> seedlings<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:13.049> two<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
start another set of seedlings in two to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.770 
start another set of seedlings in two to
four<00:01:14.400> weeks<00:01:14.430> depending<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.330> how<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.720> goes

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
four weeks depending on how this goes

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.140 
four weeks depending on how this goes
and<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.920> course<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.310> drop<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.729> into<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
and of course you drop that into the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.679 
and of course you drop that into the
water<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:19.430> might<00:01:20.430> use<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> different<00:01:21.270> potting

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
water I might use a different potting

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.260 
water I might use a different potting
soil<00:01:21.900> mix<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> next<00:01:22.740> seedlings<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.340> that

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
soil mix for the next seedlings and that

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.700 
soil mix for the next seedlings and that
will<00:01:24.420> probably<00:01:24.630> absorb<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> water<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.560> little

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
will probably absorb the water a little

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.340 
will probably absorb the water a little
bit<00:01:25.950> better<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.540> see<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> hexagon

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
bit better as you can see the hexagon

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.190 
bit better as you can see the hexagon
shape<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.670> reason<00:01:30.119> why<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.329> purchased<00:01:30.659> this

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
shape is the reason why I purchased this

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.490 
shape is the reason why I purchased this
particular<00:01:32.360> setup<00:01:33.360> because<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.200> supposed

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
particular setup because it's supposed

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.330 
particular setup because it's supposed
to<00:01:34.619> allow<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.950> roots<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.180> go<00:01:36.299> straight<00:01:36.720> down

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
to allow the roots to go straight down

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.120 
to allow the roots to go straight down
instead<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.460> twisting<00:01:39.270> around<00:01:39.439> here<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
instead of twisting around here is the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.240 
instead of twisting around here is the
clear<00:01:41.729> cover<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.509> goes<00:01:42.720> over<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.439> found<00:01:43.860> my

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
clear cover that goes over it I found my

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.850 
clear cover that goes over it I found my
popsicle<00:01:44.790> sticks<00:01:45.060> we're<00:01:45.329> too<00:01:45.570> high<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.140> later

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
popsicle sticks we're too high so later

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.060 
popsicle sticks we're too high so later
on<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.070> broke<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> part<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> bottom<00:01:49.070> in

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
on I broke a part of it on the bottom in

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.440 
on I broke a part of it on the bottom in
order<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.750> somewhat<00:01:51.750> seal<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.490> down<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.210> that

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
order to somewhat seal it down so that

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.810 
order to somewhat seal it down so that
the<00:01:54.780> moisture<00:01:55.229> condensation<00:01:55.950> will<00:01:56.610> stay

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the moisture condensation will stay

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.999 
the moisture condensation will stay
inside<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.689> sort<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.079> water<00:01:58.409> itself

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
inside of it and sort of water itself

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.399 
inside of it and sort of water itself
later<00:01:59.430> on<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.369> can<00:02:02.610> see<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.790> made<00:02:03.180> my<00:02:03.409> little

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
later on so you can see I made my little

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.150 
later on so you can see I made my little

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
remember what type of seeds I planted so

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.130 
remember what type of seeds I planted so
I'm<00:02:10.709> going<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.030> grow<00:02:12.030> two<00:02:12.270> rows<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.720> Detroit

growing radishes it's supposed to be a
simple<00:02:29.130> thing<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.460> grow<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.760> actually<00:02:30.000> put<00:02:30.390> some

simple thing to grow I actually put some

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.420 
simple thing to grow I actually put some
in<00:02:30.690> my<00:02:30.840> container<00:02:31.170> gardens<00:02:31.680> but<00:02:32.220> I'm<00:02:32.310> gonna

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
in my container gardens but I'm gonna

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.860 
in my container gardens but I'm gonna
try<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.690> use<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:34.740> in<00:02:35.060> this<00:02:36.060> particular<00:02:36.510> system

what<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.680> normally<00:02:38.100> do<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.400> take<00:02:38.550> my<00:02:38.610> little

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
what I normally do is I take my little

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.150 
what I normally do is I take my little
popsicle<00:02:39.360> sticks<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.840> make<00:02:39.990> two<00:02:40.320> little<00:02:40.680> indent

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
popsicle sticks I make two little indent

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.880 
popsicle sticks I make two little indent
on<00:02:41.420> somewhat<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.720> side<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.290> each<00:02:43.650> little

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
on somewhat of the side of each little

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.100 
on somewhat of the side of each little
pod<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.700> can<00:02:44.940> drop<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.330> seeds<00:02:45.570> in<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.870> but

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
pod so I can drop the seeds in it but

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.650 
pod so I can drop the seeds in it but
the<00:02:46.260> soil<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:46.860> dry<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:48.240> can<00:02:48.300> see<00:02:48.540> it's

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
the soil is so dry you can see it's

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.420 
the soil is so dry you can see it's
coming<00:02:48.930> off<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.470> stick<00:02:49.770> normally<00:02:50.280> when

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
coming off on the stick normally when

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.790 
coming off on the stick normally when
the<00:02:50.550> soil<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.000> damp<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.810> doesn't<00:02:52.260> come<00:02:52.440> off<00:02:52.470> on

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
the soil is damp it doesn't come off on

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.090 
the soil is damp it doesn't come off on
the<00:02:52.920> stick<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.489> it's<00:02:53.640> kind<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.970> messy

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
the stick and so it's kind of a messy

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.290 
the stick and so it's kind of a messy
process<00:02:56.100> that's<00:02:56.520> going<00:02:56.610> through<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:56.970> still

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
process that's going through I still

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.400 
process that's going through I still
ended<00:02:57.600> up<00:02:57.800> putting<00:02:58.800> soil<00:02:59.370> up<00:02:59.760> on<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.090> top<00:03:00.360> of

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
ended up putting soil up on the top of

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.310 
ended up putting soil up on the top of
the<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:02.010> top<00:03:02.160> off<00:03:02.430> each<00:03:02.790> cell<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.200> was

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
the to top off each cell so that it was

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.130 
the to top off each cell so that it was
completely<00:03:04.830> covered<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.720> you'll<00:03:06.720> see<00:03:06.959> that

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
completely covered and you'll see that

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.300 
completely covered and you'll see that
in<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.530> little<00:03:07.650> bit<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:09.860> planted<00:03:10.860> all<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.190> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
in a little bit I planted all of the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.020 
in a little bit I planted all of the
seedlings<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:13.100> push<00:03:14.100> them<00:03:14.340> down<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.820> little

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
seedlings and push them down a little

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.540 
seedlings and push them down a little
bit<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.570> then<00:03:16.020> I<00:03:16.050> sprayed<00:03:16.590> more<00:03:16.830> water<00:03:17.100> on<00:03:17.340> it

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
bit and then I sprayed more water on it

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.970 
bit and then I sprayed more water on it
and<00:03:17.760> then<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.360> topped<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.900> again<00:03:19.230> with<00:03:19.769> more

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
and then I topped it again with more

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.199 
and then I topped it again with more
soil<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.430> seems<00:03:20.610> like<00:03:20.760> this<00:03:20.940> particular

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
soil it seems like this particular

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.720 
soil it seems like this particular
systems<00:03:21.870> I'm<00:03:22.709> just<00:03:22.950> still<00:03:23.220> trying<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.519> figure

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
systems I'm just still trying to figure

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.650 
systems I'm just still trying to figure
it<00:03:23.910> out<00:03:24.680> but<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:26.120> takes<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.239> little<00:03:27.330> bit<00:03:27.420> more

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
it out but it takes a little bit more

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.110 
it out but it takes a little bit more
time<00:03:27.930> than<00:03:28.260> how<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.620> normally<00:03:29.130> do<00:03:29.280> my<00:03:29.430> seeds<00:03:29.760> in

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
time than how I normally do my seeds in

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.009 
time than how I normally do my seeds in
my<00:03:30.420> leftover<00:03:31.230> when<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.220> buy<00:03:32.459> plants<00:03:32.820> from<00:03:33.239> one

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
my leftover when I buy plants from one

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.250 
my leftover when I buy plants from one
of<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.670> places<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:35.940> don't<00:03:36.120> need<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.420> add<00:03:36.570> more

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
of the places I don't need to add more

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.060 
of the places I don't need to add more
seed<00:03:38.269> potting<00:03:39.269> soil<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.780> top<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.380> the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
seed potting soil on the top and the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.680 
seed potting soil on the top and the
water<00:03:41.310> used<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:41.700> absorbs<00:03:42.090> from<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.360> bottom

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
water used the absorbs from the bottom

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.800 
water used the absorbs from the bottom
so<00:03:43.380> what<00:03:43.650> I'm<00:03:43.739> doing<00:03:43.799> now<00:03:44.070> is<00:03:44.549> I'm<00:03:45.090> just

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
so what I'm doing now is I'm just

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.680 
so what I'm doing now is I'm just
bringing<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.920> top<00:03:47.130> so<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.910> don't<00:03:48.000> flood

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
bringing the top so that I don't flood

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.470 
bringing the top so that I don't flood
the<00:03:48.870> water<00:03:49.080> on<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.410> top<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.799> it<00:03:49.950> or<00:03:50.480> dislodge

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
the water on the top of it or dislodge

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.160 
the water on the top of it or dislodge
the<00:03:51.840> seeds<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.340> give<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.610> a<00:03:53.670> good<00:03:53.790> soaking

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
the seeds and I give it a good soaking

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.860 
the seeds and I give it a good soaking
do<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.380> for<00:03:55.650> about<00:03:55.739> 30<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.670> 60<00:03:56.720> seconds<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:57.810> I

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
do that for about 30 to 60 seconds so I

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.020 
do that for about 30 to 60 seconds so I
can<00:03:57.930> get<00:03:58.200> more<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.739> water<00:03:58.980> on<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.700> new

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
can get more of the water on the new

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.509 
can get more of the water on the new
soil<00:04:00.360> which<00:04:00.930> was<00:04:01.170> totally<00:04:01.620> dry<00:04:01.860> from<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.310> bag

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
soil which was totally dry from the bag

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.350 
soil which was totally dry from the bag
on<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.450> top<00:04:03.660> there<00:04:03.950> now<00:04:04.950> just<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.430> recap<00:04:05.549> this

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
on the top there now just to recap this

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.410 
on the top there now just to recap this
particular<00:04:06.810> system<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:08.209> according<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.330> the

box and the shape of the hexagon it's

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.080 
box and the shape of the hexagon it's
supposed<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.959> allow<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.500> see<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:14.190> roots<00:04:14.670> to

there<00:04:19.859> you<00:04:19.950> can<00:04:20.130> see<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:20.640> then<00:04:21.269> go

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
there you can see it and then go

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.670 
there you can see it and then go
downwards<00:04:22.220> somehow<00:04:23.220> that<00:04:23.669> is

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
downwards somehow that is

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.170 
downwards somehow that is
when<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:26.770> have<00:04:26.890> a<00:04:26.920> hexagon<00:04:27.430> shape<00:04:27.730> versus<00:04:28.150> a

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
when you have a hexagon shape versus a

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.750 
when you have a hexagon shape versus a
square<00:04:28.600> or<00:04:28.780> a<00:04:28.870> circle<00:04:28.900> shape<00:04:29.520> it's<00:04:30.520> supposed

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
square or a circle shape it's supposed

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.490 
square or a circle shape it's supposed
to<00:04:30.820> go<00:04:31.000> downwards<00:04:31.450> which<00:04:31.690> is<00:04:31.870> full<00:04:32.080> so<00:04:32.260> allowed

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
to go downwards which is full so allowed

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.880 
to go downwards which is full so allowed
to<00:04:32.710> make<00:04:32.890> it<00:04:33.130> easier<00:04:33.670> for<00:04:33.840> transplanting

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
to make it easier for transplanting

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.800 
to make it easier for transplanting
directions<00:04:35.890> say<00:04:36.160> to<00:04:36.190> put<00:04:36.850> some<00:04:37.090> seed<00:04:37.390> starting

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
directions say to put some seed starting

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.510 
directions say to put some seed starting
mix<00:04:37.990> like<00:04:38.260> you<00:04:38.680> could<00:04:38.860> use<00:04:39.040> whatever<00:04:39.250> you<00:04:39.490> want

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
mix like you could use whatever you want

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.750 
mix like you could use whatever you want
because<00:04:40.510> I've<00:04:40.780> found<00:04:40.990> success<00:04:41.710> in<00:04:41.890> both<00:04:42.130> well

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
because I've found success in both well

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.730 
because I've found success in both well
actually<00:04:43.030> not<00:04:43.210> so<00:04:43.360> much<00:04:43.510> this<00:04:43.780> one<00:04:44.050> but<00:04:44.260> in<00:04:44.440> in

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
actually not so much this one but in in

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.180 
actually not so much this one but in in
my<00:04:44.890> regular<00:04:45.070> seed<00:04:45.480> soil<00:04:46.480> mix<00:04:46.750> then<00:04:47.530> you<00:04:47.830> plant

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
my regular seed soil mix then you plant

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.730 
my regular seed soil mix then you plant
it<00:04:48.340> according<00:04:48.730> to<00:04:48.760> the<00:04:49.030> directions<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:50.020> when

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
it according to the directions and when

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.680 
it according to the directions and when
you<00:04:50.860> first<00:04:51.070> see<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.310> sprouts<00:04:51.760> coming<00:04:52.090> up<00:04:52.420> you

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
you first see the sprouts coming up you

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.780 
you first see the sprouts coming up you
can<00:04:52.900> open<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.590> dome<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:54.160> little<00:04:54.430> bit<00:04:54.520> so<00:04:54.700> you

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
can open the dome a little bit so you

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.510 
can open the dome a little bit so you
can<00:04:54.820> gets<00:04:55.090> more<00:04:55.480> air<00:04:55.810> in<00:04:56.080> there<00:04:56.410> and<00:04:56.770> when<00:04:57.280> all

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
can gets more air in there and when all

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.310 
can gets more air in there and when all
the<00:04:57.700> seeds<00:04:57.940> have<00:04:58.120> sprouted<00:04:58.180> remove<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.110> dome

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
the seeds have sprouted remove the dome

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.920 
the seeds have sprouted remove the dome
and<00:04:59.620> place<00:04:59.860> in<00:05:00.070> a<00:05:00.160> sunny<00:05:00.370> location<00:05:00.640> and<00:05:01.300> after

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
and place in a sunny location and after

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.720 
and place in a sunny location and after
the<00:05:02.050> first<00:05:02.290> true<00:05:02.590> leaves<00:05:02.830> which<00:05:03.100> is<00:05:03.130> 2<00:05:03.580> to<00:05:03.700> 3

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
the first true leaves which is 2 to 3

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.170 
the first true leaves which is 2 to 3
leaves<00:05:04.890> then<00:05:05.890> you<00:05:06.070> go<00:05:06.190> ahead<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:06.520> thin<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.060> out

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
leaves then you go ahead and thin it out

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.380 
leaves then you go ahead and thin it out
as<00:05:07.570> you<00:05:07.840> saw<00:05:08.080> I<00:05:08.580> made<00:05:09.580> the<00:05:09.730> two<00:05:09.880> little<00:05:10.180> holes

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
as you saw I made the two little holes

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.810 
as you saw I made the two little holes
and<00:05:10.630> I<00:05:10.690> only<00:05:10.840> put<00:05:11.110> two<00:05:11.290> seeds<00:05:11.590> per<00:05:12.010> so<00:05:12.640> that

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
and I only put two seeds per so that

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.370 
and I only put two seeds per so that
makes<00:05:13.000> a<00:05:13.060> little<00:05:13.180> bit<00:05:13.360> easier<00:05:13.720> for<00:05:13.780> me<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.170> thin

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
makes a little bit easier for me to thin

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.100 
makes a little bit easier for me to thin
out<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.680> plants<00:05:15.150> before<00:05:16.150> I<00:05:16.360> remove<00:05:16.750> it<00:05:16.960> and

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
out the plants before I remove it and

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.620 
out the plants before I remove it and
then<00:05:17.380> it<00:05:17.560> says<00:05:17.770> to<00:05:17.980> gently<00:05:18.790> pop<00:05:19.180> out<00:05:19.360> the

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
then it says to gently pop out the

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.150 
then it says to gently pop out the
individual<00:05:21.210> plants<00:05:22.210> from<00:05:22.480> the<00:05:22.660> cells<00:05:22.930> and<00:05:23.350> dig

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
individual plants from the cells and dig

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.250 
individual plants from the cells and dig
a<00:05:24.190> hole<00:05:24.430> and<00:05:24.460> Transplant<00:05:25.180> it<00:05:25.360> I'm<00:05:25.750> doing<00:05:26.110> all

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
a hole and Transplant it I'm doing all

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.160 
container garden gardening now for my
vegetables<00:05:29.710> so<00:05:30.250> I<00:05:30.280> have<00:05:30.460> a<00:05:30.520> variety<00:05:31.090> of

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
vegetables so I have a variety of

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.860 
vegetables so I have a variety of
containers<00:05:32.340> if<00:05:33.340> they<00:05:33.790> are<00:05:33.970> root<00:05:34.210> plants<00:05:34.690> I

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
containers if they are root plants I

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.620 
containers if they are root plants I
will<00:05:35.470> have<00:05:35.590> a<00:05:35.620> deeper<00:05:36.010> container<00:05:36.370> for<00:05:36.640> that<00:05:36.670> so

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
don't put it in direct Sun but I needed

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.450 
don't put it in direct Sun but I needed
it<00:05:46.330> to<00:05:46.510> get<00:05:46.660> warm<00:05:46.960> and<00:05:47.260> it<00:05:47.560> only<00:05:47.710> has<00:05:48.010> Sun<00:05:48.250> for

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
it to get warm and it only has Sun for

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.060 
it to get warm and it only has Sun for
about<00:05:48.610> an<00:05:48.730> hour<00:05:48.910> or<00:05:49.180> so<00:05:49.360> in<00:05:49.780> the<00:05:49.870> morning
