00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.130
 cafp 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.980
 Sponsored 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.980
 2 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.789
 ubs 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.649
 This chaos point is deprived of heart and is accumulated in a group formula accumulation before 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:37.420
 It was done 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.670
 The accumulation station says that it is gradually rising 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.489
 Become 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.420
 When I reached my limit 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.880
 That line of whether to go up or down corresponds to the face sled 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.920
 I do not point 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.850
 so 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.380
 This breakthrough 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.579
 You have to go over aledel to get through 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.429
 Because 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.589
 I showed that breakdown but the rest was told in the lecture 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.100
 But in fact 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.920
 I did my best 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.850
 1 is in public 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.050
 However, in order to let you do it, several people adopt 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:12.940
 I have to clear this 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.830
 It doesn't reach to the break of that here 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.080
 Each person is on his own and he adds himself to the voice from the world 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.820
 I think that I want to go 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.630
 Society by connecting things in the morning 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.540
 Nobunaga that the whole essayist 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.340
 is not it 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.750
 And it declares your area in your area 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.850
 Because it is in the form of passing through 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.290
 A word that it is unlikely that you can do it yourself 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.410
 That's what it means to start with 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.130
 And by networking 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.939
 I want to suspect that the same a set 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.289
 Same genre 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.270
 That 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.890
 This year, people in the same area get crowded with the same awareness 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.750
 I think it's okay to smile in each industry 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.980
 For example, in the city of an advertising agency, it was in the best 4 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.829
 The number of home country masters increased by 7 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.590
 It's gotta 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.050
 Empty air. 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.420
 It is a competitor 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.089
 I think it's a rival advertising agency 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:14.769
 If you were just going back, you could do that kind of thing 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.400
 Children are surprised 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.730
 The world of diesel 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.230
 English nme magazine is a lot of people who know the drama of the day before 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.420
 I think there are 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.810
 That prepayment money said 2012 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.010
 m I would like to go out on the weekend-I would like to avoid as much pain as possible 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.289
 I think 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.809
 Well 2010 is certainly that chaos point 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:37.779
 Though 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:41.059
 Well, expression that is not the very thing that is the end of the century 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:43.739
 The ability to do all that is done 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.739
 No purpose for 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.839
 Tohoku Daiji 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:53.449
 The downside is divided into one-third each to have tens of hours of myself 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:55.099
 As 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.510
 One third of your time 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.810
 First of all, ask about what you should do 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.810
 For my job 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.029
 Even with about one third of the rest, with your own personal activities 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:10.230
 Use a lot of private 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.219
 It's me I myself 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.599
 First of all I like last year and I have everything 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.599
 Even the staff who are citizens but also rich 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:24.019
 One third of the United States is a person who is somehow neither 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.309
 Did you do something for the community or for society 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.559
 If I do something or enter it I am worldshift if it is now 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:31.849
 That volunteer 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.059
 Let's try it and Kuroba 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:40.029
 It has been a quick attack, I've been working on my own 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:41.299
 Expired 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.519
 Something about it 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.519
 I can not do it 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:47.209
 So that 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.209
 The way to use each time 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.709
 People who are seeking work for a company to enjoy eating 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.709
 I think that this is a fake 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.159
 Mr. Aso is positive 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.450
 For society 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.589
 For the region 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:04.119
 I forbid to live on the earth 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:07.229
 Of course part of the main business 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:08.950
 Trading that can do that 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.889
 That 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.059
 Somehow in my private area 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:15.479
 I did not go out at once after partitioning 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.689
 Ordinary of that specifically 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:20.689
 Let's take hours of the person as usage of time 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.199
 Volunteer for such things 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.080
 It happened like that 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.080
 apply sp1 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.370
 Once 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.960
 It is also true that the plan 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.669
 f1 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.669
 Made my own steeped 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.930
 One day will be 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.699
 Nissan is Nissan 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.419
 The theme is that the UK October 24 is under consideration at the beginning 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:56.969
 doing 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.479
 I was thinking that I would do it 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.099
 We participate in nostalgia involuntarily if we think that measures last in April 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:06.469
 Let me know 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:10.770
 We have ws talk originally with another man as a field 

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:11.439
 one 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.360
 It's easy to feel mixed and that 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.389
 Yeah 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.789
 Well done Link site after the first tournament 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.629
 Said that it would be strengthened 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.180
 By all means we are hitting the third eight times
