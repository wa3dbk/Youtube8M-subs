coach Parker had been there all along so

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.850 
coach Parker had been there all along so
we<00:01:31.030> really<00:01:31.420> kind<00:01:31.540> of<00:01:31.780> just<00:01:32.079> kept<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.470> rolling

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
we really kind of just kept it rolling

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
Mount Saint Charles they're all really

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.380 
Mount Saint Charles they're all really
close<00:01:47.320> games<00:01:47.680> I<00:01:48.009> think<00:01:48.219> we<00:01:48.460> we<00:01:48.820> competed<00:01:49.240> real

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
close games I think we we competed real

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.050 
close games I think we we competed real
well<00:01:49.600> as<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.840> team<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.409> think<00:01:50.829> every<00:01:51.759> game<00:01:51.909> we

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
well as a team I think every game we

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.459 
well as a team I think every game we
play<00:01:52.090> them<00:01:52.479> maybe<00:01:52.780> with<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.020> exception<00:01:53.049> of

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
play them maybe with the exception of

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:54.899

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.189 
three-game series so after after you
play<00:03:28.440> one<00:03:28.680> game<00:03:29.690> there's<00:03:30.690> still<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.959> lot<00:03:31.109> of

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
play one game there's still a lot of

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:32.689 
play one game there's still a lot of
hockey<00:03:31.290> left<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.889> be<00:03:31.979> played<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.400> especially

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:32.699 
hockey left to be played and especially

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.930 
hockey left to be played and especially
in<00:03:33.359> the<00:03:33.479> state<00:03:33.720> finals<00:03:34.079> I<00:03:34.169> mean<00:03:34.319> mounted<00:03:34.620> lost

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
in the state finals I mean mounted lost

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.879 
in the state finals I mean mounted lost
handedly<00:03:35.940> in<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.269> first<00:03:36.540> first<00:03:37.169> game<00:03:37.500> for

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
handedly in the first first game for

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.099 
handedly in the first first game for
many<00:03:38.040> years<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.699> so<00:03:39.209> we<00:03:39.419> knew<00:03:39.629> just<00:03:39.900> because

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
many years and so we knew just because

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.689 
many years and so we knew just because
we<00:03:40.229> won<00:03:40.409> one<00:03:40.620> game<00:03:40.829> it<00:03:41.040> wasn't<00:03:41.310> over<00:03:41.549> so

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
we won one game it wasn't over so

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.280 
we won one game it wasn't over so
there's<00:03:41.849> really<00:03:42.060> no<00:03:42.269> complacency

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
there's really no complacency

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.420 
there's really no complacency
I<00:03:46.110> think<00:03:47.110> that<00:03:47.260> game<00:03:47.469> was<00:03:47.620> similar<00:03:47.799> first<00:03:48.250> it

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
I think that game was similar first it

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.949 
I think that game was similar first it
was<00:03:48.519> kind<00:03:48.670> of<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.879> dead<00:03:49.090> heat<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.569> whole<00:03:49.689> game

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
was kind of a dead heat the whole game

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.380 
was kind of a dead heat the whole game
was<00:03:50.500> kind<00:03:50.829> of<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.609> anyone<00:03:52.090> who<00:03:52.180> had<00:03:52.269> been

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
was kind of and anyone who had been

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.970 
was kind of and anyone who had been
around<00:03:52.599> mount<00:03:52.870> for<00:03:53.140> years<00:03:53.469> have<00:03:53.650> known<00:03:53.829> they

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
around mount for years have known they

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.709 
around mount for years have known they
can<00:03:54.129> score<00:03:54.400> in<00:03:54.489> bunches<00:03:54.640> so<00:03:55.390> even<00:03:55.599> though<00:03:55.689> a

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:55.719 
can score in bunches so even though a

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.630 
can score in bunches so even though a
0-0<00:03:56.349> halfway<00:03:56.739> through<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.010> game<00:03:57.040> or<00:03:57.370> whatever

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
0-0 halfway through the game or whatever

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.759 
0-0 halfway through the game or whatever
it<00:03:57.760> was<00:03:57.939> you<00:03:58.930> always<00:03:59.049> knew<00:03:59.260> they<00:03:59.379> could<00:03:59.530> strike

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
it was you always knew they could strike

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:00.599 
it was you always knew they could strike
at<00:03:59.980> any<00:04:00.040> minute

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
at any minute

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.610 
at any minute
well<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.120> think<00:04:01.180> after<00:04:01.720> playing<00:04:01.989> so<00:04:02.290> well<00:04:02.500> the

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
well I think after playing so well the

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.740 
well I think after playing so well the
night<00:04:02.799> before<00:04:02.980> we<00:04:03.400> really<00:04:03.700> really<00:04:04.420> believed

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
night before we really really believed

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.869 
night before we really really believed
in<00:04:04.959> ourselves<00:04:05.079> you<00:04:06.040> know<00:04:06.129> going<00:04:06.340> into<00:04:06.579> it<00:04:06.819> I

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
in ourselves you know going into it I

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.460 
in ourselves you know going into it I
think<00:04:06.970> every<00:04:07.269> team<00:04:07.510> says<00:04:07.840> you<00:04:07.989> know<00:04:08.079> yeah<00:04:08.319> we

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
think every team says you know yeah we

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.740 
think every team says you know yeah we
can<00:04:08.620> do<00:04:08.739> this<00:04:08.920> but<00:04:09.220> we<00:04:09.849> showed<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.299> so<00:04:10.510> well<00:04:10.720> the

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
can do this but we showed it so well the

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.869 
can do this but we showed it so well the
night<00:04:11.049> before<00:04:11.079> that<00:04:11.739> we're<00:04:12.189> really<00:04:12.400> a<00:04:12.489> team<00:04:12.730> to

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
night before that we're really a team to

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.240 
night before that we're really a team to
contend<00:04:13.180> with<00:04:13.329> so<00:04:13.689> I<00:04:13.959> think<00:04:14.530> we<00:04:14.829> had<00:04:14.950> a<00:04:14.980> little

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
contend with so I think we had a little

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.909 
contend with so I think we had a little
bit<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.239> confidence<00:04:16.570> going<00:04:17.049> in<00:04:17.259> after<00:04:17.680> the

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
bit of confidence going in after the

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.430 
bit of confidence going in after the
second<00:04:18.310> period<00:04:18.900> we<00:04:19.900> started<00:04:20.199> to<00:04:20.259> get<00:04:20.320> the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
second period we started to get the

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.200 
second period we started to get the
feeling<00:04:20.799> that<00:04:20.979> we<00:04:21.549> were<00:04:21.639> in<00:04:21.759> control<00:04:22.000> of<00:04:22.120> the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
feeling that we were in control of the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.550 
feeling that we were in control of the
game<00:04:22.270> there's<00:04:23.020> one<00:04:23.169> of<00:04:23.229> those<00:04:23.349> plays<00:04:23.530> that

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
game there's one of those plays that

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.839 
game there's one of those plays that
just<00:04:23.860> happens<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.370> don't<00:04:24.430> think<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:24.729> can

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
just happens I don't think you can

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:25.980 
just happens I don't think you can
really<00:04:25.030> draw<00:04:25.300> it<00:04:25.360> up<00:04:25.509> I<00:04:25.599> think<00:04:25.750> I've<00:04:25.840> actually

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
really draw it up I think I've actually

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.830 
really draw it up I think I've actually
made<00:04:26.229> a<00:04:26.289> mistake<00:04:26.710> playing<00:04:27.099> them<00:04:27.280> as<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.720> was

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
made a mistake playing them as it was

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.360 
made a mistake playing them as it was
probably<00:04:29.110> an<00:04:29.259> odd-man<00:04:29.440> rush<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:30.070> I<00:04:30.099> came

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
probably an odd-man rush and I came

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.620 
probably an odd-man rush and I came
across<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.880> ice<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.240> could<00:04:31.419> have<00:04:31.509> been

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
across the ice I could have been

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.870 
across the ice I could have been
probably<00:04:32.410> easily<00:04:32.530> beaten<00:04:32.949> by<00:04:33.070> one<00:04:33.280> pass<00:04:33.520> I<00:04:33.759> got

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
probably easily beaten by one pass I got

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.300 
probably easily beaten by one pass I got
to<00:04:34.030> trying<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.300> lucky<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:35.620> went<00:04:35.889> down<00:04:36.099> and

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
to trying to lucky and went down and

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.909 
to trying to lucky and went down and
luckily<00:04:37.300> made<00:04:37.570> it<00:04:37.690> made<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:37.900> good<00:04:38.080> shot<00:04:38.259> no<00:04:38.620> one

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
luckily made it made a good shot no one

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.610 
luckily made it made a good shot no one
