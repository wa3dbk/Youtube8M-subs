so<00:02:22.319> let's<00:02:22.349> have<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.709> look<00:02:22.860> at<00:02:22.980> what<00:02:23.129> they've<00:02:23.250> got

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
so let's have a look at what they've got

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.580 
so let's have a look at what they've got
included<00:02:23.879> here<00:02:24.030> they've<00:02:24.450> got<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.659> typical<00:02:25.140> am-3

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.199 
included here they've got a typical am-3

there<00:02:30.540> are<00:02:30.629> eight<00:02:30.750> pin<00:02:30.959> power<00:02:31.140> connectors<00:02:31.680> and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
there are eight pin power connectors and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.770 
there are eight pin power connectors and
it's<00:02:31.980> ideal<00:02:32.310> location<00:02:32.849> up<00:02:32.970> at<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.209> top<00:02:33.420> left

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
it's ideal location up at the top left

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.660 
it's ideal location up at the top left
and<00:02:33.989> then<00:02:34.560> I've<00:02:34.769> actually<00:02:34.950> had<00:02:35.220> questions

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
and then I've actually had questions

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.979 
and then I've actually had questions
about<00:02:35.760> what<00:02:36.060> makes<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.390> an<00:02:36.480> ideal<00:02:36.780> location

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
about what makes it an ideal location

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.050 
about what makes it an ideal location
the<00:02:37.680> reason<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.159> that<00:02:38.189> that's<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.670> easiest

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
the reason is that that's the easiest

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.849 
the reason is that that's the easiest
place<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.450> route<00:02:39.810> up<00:02:39.989> behind<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.470> motherboard

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.159 
for 4x only and then we have three PCI
slots<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.239> if<00:03:36.329> you're<00:03:36.480> running<00:03:36.599> crossfire

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
slots so if you're running crossfire

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.569 
slots so if you're running crossfire
you're<00:03:37.349> gonna<00:03:37.440> want<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.739> use<00:03:37.889> these<00:03:38.099> two<00:03:38.340> blue

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
you're gonna want to use these two blue

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.819 
you're gonna want to use these two blue
guys<00:03:38.790> in<00:03:39.090> fact<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.690> one<00:03:39.870> is<00:03:39.900> wired<00:03:40.169> for<00:03:40.470> 8<00:03:40.620> X

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
guys in fact this one is wired for 8 X

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.159 
guys in fact this one is wired for 8 X
only<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:41.129> you'll<00:03:41.370> be<00:03:41.489> running<00:03:41.760> 8<00:03:41.940> X<00:03:42.120> 8<00:03:42.359> X<00:03:42.569> which

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
only so you'll be running 8 X 8 X which

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.619 
only so you'll be running 8 X 8 X which
does<00:03:43.560> not<00:03:43.769> impact<00:03:44.099> performance

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
does not impact performance

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.879 
does not impact performance
significantly<00:03:45.629> and<00:03:45.870> then<00:03:46.349> if<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.530> wanted<00:03:46.769> to

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
significantly and then if you wanted to

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.229 
significantly and then if you wanted to
run<00:03:47.010> 3-way<00:03:47.370> crossfire<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.879> wouldn't<00:03:48.150> really

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
run 3-way crossfire I wouldn't really

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.000 
run 3-way crossfire I wouldn't really
recommend<00:03:48.359> it<00:03:48.900> because<00:03:48.989> this<00:03:49.199> is<00:03:49.319> a<00:03:49.349> 4<00:03:49.620> X<00:03:49.650> slot

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
recommend it because this is a 4 X slot

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.860 
recommend it because this is a 4 X slot
the<00:03:50.459> Northbridge<00:03:50.879> cooling<00:03:51.299> is<00:03:51.449> a<00:03:51.479> pretty

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
the Northbridge cooling is a pretty

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.809 
the Northbridge cooling is a pretty
again<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.319> pretty<00:03:52.620> standard<00:03:53.069> affair<00:03:53.400> you've

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
again a pretty standard affair you've

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.819 
again a pretty standard affair you've
got<00:03:54.090> just<00:03:54.419> a<00:03:54.569> nice<00:03:54.750> little<00:03:54.930> tower<00:03:55.290> heatsink

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
got just a nice little tower heatsink

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.280 
got just a nice little tower heatsink
here<00:03:56.040> with<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.250> little<00:03:56.699> asrock<00:03:57.150> logo<00:03:57.569> one<00:03:58.049> heat

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
here with a little asrock logo one heat
