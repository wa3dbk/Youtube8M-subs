than<00:00:48.420> me<00:00:49.100> stepping<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> direct<00:00:51.570> attack

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
than me stepping in with a direct attack

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.299 
than me stepping in with a direct attack
could<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.350> kind<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.559> dangerous<00:00:52.620> especially<00:00:53.039> if

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
could be kind of dangerous especially if

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.639 
could be kind of dangerous especially if
he's<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> really<00:00:53.789> good<00:00:54.000> counter<00:00:54.600> fighter<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.620> I

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
he's a really good counter fighter so I

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.060 
he's a really good counter fighter so I
want<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.280> become<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> master<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:58.070> indirect

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
want to become a master of the indirect

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.389 
want to become a master of the indirect
attack<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.850> possibly<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.930> case<00:01:01.399> I'm

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
attack so possibly in this case I'm

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.709 
attack so possibly in this case I'm
gonna<00:01:02.699> throw<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> little<00:01:03.030> fake<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.449> him<00:01:03.570> in

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
jab but i'm going to go about it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.340 
jab but i'm going to go about it
indirectly<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.000> i<00:01:09.060> might<00:01:09.420> i've<00:01:09.600> got<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.110> much

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
indirectly so i might i've got this much

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.810 
indirectly so i might i've got this much
distance<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.890> cover<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.340> order<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.610> get<00:01:11.700> in

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
distance to cover in order to get in

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.850 
distance to cover in order to get in
there<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.479> i<00:01:12.600> go<00:01:12.750> direct<00:01:13.200> he's<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> clock

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
there if i go direct he's going to clock

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.770 
there if i go direct he's going to clock
me<00:01:14.040> as<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.250> come<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.729> don't<00:01:15.240> want<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.509> to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
me as I come in I don't want it that to

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.969 
me as I come in I don't want it that to
happen<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.439> want<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.710> go<00:01:16.799> about<00:01:16.920> it

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
happen so I want to go about it

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.370 
happen so I want to go about it
indirectly<00:01:17.670> I'll<00:01:18.119> throw<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> little<00:01:18.780> fake<00:01:19.140> on

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
indirectly I'll throw a little fake on

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.810 
indirectly I'll throw a little fake on
him<00:01:19.590> draw<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.400> punch<00:01:20.729> out<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.770> then<00:01:22.820> finish

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
him draw that punch out and then finish

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.300 
him draw that punch out and then finish
the<00:01:23.970> attack<00:01:24.470> by<00:01:25.470> stepping<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> rest<00:01:26.220> of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the attack by stepping in the rest of

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.480 
the attack by stepping in the rest of
the<00:01:26.369> distance<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.720> an<00:01:27.780> indirect<00:01:28.259> attack

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
the distance so it's an indirect attack

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.789 
the distance so it's an indirect attack
so<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> direct<00:01:30.329> attack<00:01:30.470> nothing<00:01:31.470> precedes

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
so in a direct attack nothing precedes

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
so in a direct attack nothing precedes
it<00:01:31.920> an<00:01:32.100> indirect<00:01:33.030> attack<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.570> usually

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
it an indirect attack is usually

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.920 
it an indirect attack is usually
preceded<00:01:34.380> by<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.650> fake<00:01:35.100> or<00:01:35.450> some<00:01:36.450> kind<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.659> draw

step<00:01:37.259> or<00:01:37.820> something<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.299> sets<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.320> attack

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
step or something that sets the attack
