00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.540
 fourth tutorial in my tutorial 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.460
 row to redstone today we deal 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.280
 give us a bit of the topic 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.740
 you can print plates with pressure plates 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.199
 make all kinds of pointless right 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:33.500
 the easiest way is block too 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:37.980
 block away right here is where the pistes come from 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.430
 it does not need another runway yet 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.030
 to test a run in your weeks 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.210
 the part you expand on it that way 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.399
 nine places not even 9 3 x 3 field 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.350
 is 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.980
 and if someone is running in there now 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.199
 he drove 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.230
 he does not come out anymore no matter 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.910
 what he does we come back from one 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.780
 creative not are we are cool too 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.850
 so this the place 1 of the most popular 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.350
 multiplayer fall although it also 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.229
 the most mundane is you should always 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.670
 be prepared for it 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.520
 another possibility of this thing too 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.900
 it is simply the next bigger one 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.900
 Variant with 3 1 on your side 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.659
 works exactly the same way 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.890
 like the other part just that too 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.840
 just bigger is mine 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.799
 opinion, is also sufficient completely that 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.490
 smaller times like now big ones 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.920
 crowds really behind the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.020
 You can not catch it and you can not do that anyway 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.390
 So you do not have the slopes 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.890
 waste 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.869
 especially pvp so i would 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.909
 do not recommend 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:59.909
 but otherwise it is quite funny kind here 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.299
 to mourn any people here now 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.299
 go in 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.750
 It's not like this anymore 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.300
 it must be easy and fast 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.140
 One way to come out once 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.100
 here 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.930
 brave mode normal but is profit jump 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.600
 with which one comes out but that takes 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.010
 a while until you got out of it 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.010
 something else useless with printing plates 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:46.200
 there are and around a rum go the 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.890
 This is also the case for newbie 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.310
 to catch 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.260
 a very funny method because it comes 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.650
 No longer you have to use the pressure plate 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.800
 reduce it very stupid if one then in the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.300
 productive area and no 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.900
 you can activate pressure plates 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.120
 just suffered accordingly 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.530
 its now fall with plates where you 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.269
 then just there to hang could 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:18.690
 now builds on expand and the whole 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:20.760
 Build like that and stay on for a while, just like you 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.920
 maybe you noticed the first one 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:31.620
 tutorial where I expand myself and already 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:33.630
 actually prefabricated now 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.950
 not the hardest either 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.829
 technology you get now 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.739
 you can imagine last and there below 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:43.560
 the middle three pistes blog on it 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:48.410
 printing plate on it and the whole beautiful 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:51.150
 close does not impose itself on why 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:55.739
 Pustekuchen do not come that way either 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.350
 out quickly then there is another 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.530
 possibility that a little bit funnier 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.209
 to design 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.010
 a hole a bit dark empty 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.310
 No, I 'm just doing it so deeply 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:23.150
 that is also completely justified 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:23.150
 because otherwise as newsfeed on 8 tnt 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:40.340
 st we put in there water tnt together 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.900
 huber and a pressure plate on it so what 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.850
 Now the following happens when I am 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:49.280
 go on it now because I'm with velvet in the 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:51.920
 tnt down and that should actually 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.640
 does not matter now anyway 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:58.580
 but that does not happen 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:06.080
 so tragic that I build you indeed different 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:08.510
 I did not have any to that right now 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.970
 a few senseless things with 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.040
 printing plates should give you something else 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.210
 You can come to me like that in the 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.620
 Write comments 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.890
 then maybe I will 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:22.060
 show future tutorial times 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.060
 until next time
