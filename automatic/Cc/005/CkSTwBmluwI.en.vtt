00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.470
 well this opportunity we are going to do 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.730
 this exercise tells me to and to the function 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.559
 we see that he sees - because where fx 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.789
 been to everything by two rules of 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.789
 correspondence 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:17.930
 first arrange 2 x + 2 when x 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.940
 belongs 0 2 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.800
 and then have the other rule that is 3 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.800
 when there is that belongs 3 to 5 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.920
 now I will have the function that of x 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.310
 that in the same way has two rules 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.760
 of correspondence the first root rule 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.830
 of x when it belongs 14 and that less 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.830
 six when you have to belong 56 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.370
 then let's see the good solution in 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.550
 this video we are going to do for the function 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.079
 sum f more than in the other videos we go 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.300
 to do the others work subtraction and 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.010
 multiplication of functions 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.690
 good in this case the domain of signatures 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.940
 they had taken for the intersection of 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.000
 the domains of f intercepted with the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.860
 domain of g and may have that rule 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.560
 of correspondence of topics that are going to 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.600
 be equal to fx more than x 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.799
 well then the first thing we're going to 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.360
 to do is function f more than in the 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.230
 other video we are going to make the function efe 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.670
 - what and the multiplication of b because 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:25.540
 well let's do the domain first 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:30.490
 df more than in this case come to be equal 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:34.650
 to the domain of efe intercepted with the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.740
 domain that by theory 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.750
 well let's graph the function of 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.130
 fx the domain of the function must x 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.130
 first we have 0 2 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.340
 and then the tenor from 3 to 5 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.409
 but we graph it on the real straight line of 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.689
 3 to 5 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.280
 then the red part that represents the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.320
 domain of the function f 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.820
 now let's do the domain of the 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.900
 function that in this case the first 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.900
 we have 14 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.180
 and then I'm going to have to 5 to 6 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.110
 and then the domain of the function that 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.250
 comes to be the blue part of 14 and of 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.620
 56 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.020
 then let's make the intersection 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.380
 of the domains that comes to be that of the 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.380
 function 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.500
 would be the domain of efe intercepted with 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.950
 the dominate g is to say where the 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.870
 lines both red and blue that 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.870
 they grow in this case from 1 to 2 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.870
 then also crosses from 3 to 4 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.430
 and also point 5 also crossed not 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.520
 it would only be a point then I will 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.870
 take the first part would be 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.870
 from 1 to 2 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.370
 and then we have 3 to 4 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.989
 and finally we have point 5 attached 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.590
 with 5 not with a single point in this case 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.590
 it would be 5 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.530
 and that would be the domain the functions of 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.660
 more what 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.520
 now we can realize that the 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.990
 affected function by greg tower 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.640
 correspondence will be coming in this 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:37.319
 case the function 2x + 2 and function 3 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.890
 then the first one we will call it f 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:45.140
 1 and the other one or we're going to call it effects 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.140
 then it will be f 1 when it is 0 to 2 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.870
 so when x is between 0 and 2 they take 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.240
 the function f 1 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.180
 it would be this part 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.290
 and when it belongs 3 to 5 they take the 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.540
 function f 2 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.670
 now in the same way in the function 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.300
 that existing record each one 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.240
 I'll call it g1 and g2 respectively 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:14.330
 then when x belongs in this case 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:18.560
 of 14 we take the function that one 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.750
 what would this part of 14 be and when there's 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.930
 which belongs from 5 to 6 or to take the 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.290
 function that 2 then now we're going to 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.370
 do the function themes that x good 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.140
 Then the first thing we are going to do 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.110
 part by part according to the domain of 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.180
 the function of signatures that 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.600
 12 when we first that 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.840
 belongs 12 let's add the function of 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.280
 according to the graph we add the function 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.280
 f 1 more than 1 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.550
 because we take in this part in the part 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.640
 black that would be where the 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.420
 two functions of casoria from one more 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:58.950
 one is to say we add f1 that would be this 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.410
 more than one function 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.590
 what would this function be for x that 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.770
 belongs from 1 to 2 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.380
 and then I'm going to take the other part I'm going to 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.689
 take the count that belongs in this 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.080
 case of 3 to 4 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:17.539
 despite this part and not that talking 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.129
 which is the sum of go no more than 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:23.479
 2 where the two lines intersect 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:27.060
 then we are going to suppose to cut 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:30.990
 sentence that one more looks 2 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:34.440
 that one in this case would be square root 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.980
 of x + f 2 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.710
 which in this case would be 3 then they would be 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.610
 square root of x 3 when team of 3 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.470
 to 4 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.900
 and finally 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.680
 I'm going to take the point in this case the 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.680
 point 5 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.630
 that would only be a point in this 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.600
 case this point and sell in the region 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.419
 power of f 2 with g 2 then let's 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.300
 evaluate point 5 in function f 2 more 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:07.930
 that two and we add them in this case f 2 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.930
 monterÃ­a 3 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:14.339
 and point 5 evaluated in the function that 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:16.800
 2 would be 5 minus 6 would be minus 1 and less 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:19.349
 13 would be 2 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.090
 from this point 5 away from the ball this 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:25.240
 part 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.330
 the value would be minus one plus this three 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:32.050
 would be 2 2 would be 2 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.759
 when x equals 5 then that is 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.980
 the answer what for the function 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:37.480
 we see that x 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.650
 sprout would be all do not forget 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.650
