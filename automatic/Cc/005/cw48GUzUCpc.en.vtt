00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
it's actually working for me because I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.849 
it's actually working for me because I
was<00:04:00.150> like<00:04:00.389> to<00:04:00.540> do<00:04:00.630> this<00:04:00.750> in<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.049> video<00:04:01.170> I'm

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
was like to do this in the video I'm

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.620 
was like to do this in the video I'm
just<00:04:02.310> for<00:04:02.730> one<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.970> make<00:04:03.090> sure<00:04:03.269> that<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.480> have

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
just for one to make sure that I have

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.699 
just for one to make sure that I have
spelled<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:03.989> correctly<00:04:04.019> because<00:04:04.319> maybe<00:04:04.590> I

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
spelled it correctly because maybe I

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.170 
spelled it correctly because maybe I
made<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:04.950> mistake<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:05.549> didn't<00:04:05.850> make<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:06.000> new

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180
