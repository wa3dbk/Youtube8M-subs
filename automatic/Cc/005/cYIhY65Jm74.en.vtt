00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:11.080
 [Music] 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.080
 on Thursday, October 24 marked the 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.810
 anniversary of the establishment in 1938 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.810
 of a federal- level minimum wage in 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.360
 the united states were 25 cents the 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.120
 time in the present the minimum pay is 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.610
 puts in the 7 dollars with 25 cents 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.460
 an insufficient amount for 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.860
 survive in a city like new york 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.510
 is very low when when the evil 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.440
 nutrition was fighting in the 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.430
 sixties 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.160
 she was saying that the salary 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.420
 minimum should go up to two pesos and in that 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.730
 year but if it was the year 2013 those were 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.100
 15 pesos and 34 cents are the 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.500
 workers who are doing 50 for 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.410
 hundred what they are that is what they should 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.180
 pay for these types of jobs the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.879
 food chain workers 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.590
 fast and the large surfaces that is 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.390
 where they have created most 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.899
 jobs since the recession 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.060
 they charge the minimum wage however they 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.490
 officially placed below the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.800
 line of poverty and depend on the 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.110
 public aid to get ahead 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.320
 in this way there is the paradox that 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.020
 in the USA you can have work but be 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.360
 technically poor the workers that 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.570
 manifest they ask that the minimum be 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.120
 place at $ 15 an hour 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.030
 and what we ask is that people 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.180
 get a little more really deserves 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.310
 much more but this is just the beginning 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.860
 $ 15 an hour will not cut much 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.510
 in the profits of these companies what 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.100
 what should be done is to cut 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.930
 up to those who earn millions of 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.060
 dollars in their salaries in addition to 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.130
 benefits and without creating any wealth 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.290
 but also in these sectors there are 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.200
 infinity of irregularities and the 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.690
 workers are usually totally 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.360
 unprotected before the law that won 440 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.390
 the hour worked more than 66 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.120
 hours a week I was robbed 20 hours of 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.700
 the week and not just me to many of my

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.450
 they stole us many hours each time they are

 most usual this type of 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.950
 mobilizations asking for a rise of the

 minimum wage of 725 dollars 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.870
 current to at least 15 dollars 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.079
 although it seems a lot of money this 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.719
 amount is too little to live in this
