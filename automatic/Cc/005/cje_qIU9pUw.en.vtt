00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 Let's read it. Loader. I 've heard the captain very well. 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.120
 Do so 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.110
 How do you do some tricky techniques 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.110
 4 cases 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.750
 Five important times of the Olympic Games than I expected 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:28.610
 It was not difficult . It would be better than ever . 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.610
 I thought it would be a lot of psychological burden. 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:37.840
 2 The Olympics will make you feel better because of this 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:41.620
 I could feel more comfortable because I had the idea to do it. 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:46.360
 First of all , because the preparation was so good 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.670
 I do not seem to have much tension because I'm good at it. 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.440
 I do not think I can talk black. 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:57.400
 Now called rattling game, but far 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.520
 7 More comfortable than a few games 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.540
 I think I was acting. 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.540
 After I finished 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:11.500
 Oh, it was not hard for us to think . 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.320

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.740

 In Korea, many athletes 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:56.080

00:01:49.750 --> 00:02:00.360
 The water in the Olympic Games is what we can take care of. 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.360
 Dog thinks it's good to shoot ultra-low support 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.500
 He played a lot of games. 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.450
 As well as each of the other players also brother 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:20.170
 There's a cigarette that good players compete with. 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.170
 I did not play against that rival. 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.580

 All the spirits continue to compete together , so salvation is one 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:47.700
 You'll think of me because you 're throwing me away . This is the result or the result. 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.480
 Before people do this
