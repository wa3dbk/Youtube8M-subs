00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.870 
the backside of the knitting or the purl
side<00:02:13.540> if<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.810> will<00:02:13.990> so<00:02:14.860> I'm<00:02:15.280> going<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.760> be

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
side if you will so I'm going to be

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.310 
side if you will so I'm going to be
starting<00:02:16.300> over<00:02:16.660> here

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
starting over here

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.800 
starting over here
if<00:02:17.380> yours<00:02:18.190> ended<00:02:18.550> on<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.820> other<00:02:18.940> side<00:02:19.240> your

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
if yours ended on the other side your

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.480 
if yours ended on the other side your
fabric<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.380> going<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.590> look<00:02:20.740> like<00:02:20.770> that<00:02:21.130> when

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
fabric is going to look like that when

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.210 
fabric is going to look like that when
you<00:02:21.610> crochet<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.510> either<00:02:22.750> way<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.380> don't<00:02:24.070> see

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
you crochet it either way I don't see

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.320 
you crochet it either way I don't see
why<00:02:24.340> it<00:02:24.430> would<00:02:24.550> make<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> difference<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:27.330> I'm

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
why it would make a difference so I'm

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.699 
why it would make a difference so I'm
going<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:29.170> do<00:02:29.820> single<00:02:30.820> crochets<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.810> between

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
going to do single crochets and between

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.230 
going to do single crochets and between
each<00:02:32.830> stitch<00:02:33.220> I'm<00:02:33.400> going<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.610> do<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.730> chain<00:02:34.000> one

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
each stitch I'm going to do a chain one

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.840 
each stitch I'm going to do a chain one
just<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.750> make<00:02:34.780> sure<00:02:34.959> that<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:36.280> doesn't<00:02:36.580> get

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
just to make sure that it doesn't get

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.790 
just to make sure that it doesn't get
tighter<00:02:37.209> at<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.690> top<00:02:37.930> than<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.350> was<00:02:38.560> when<00:02:38.740> I

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
tighter at the top than it was when I

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.410 
tighter at the top than it was when I
cast<00:02:39.160> on<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:41.170> pulled<00:02:41.500> up<00:02:41.590> one<00:02:41.830> loop<00:02:42.420> I'm
