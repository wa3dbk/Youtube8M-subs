this case could very well suck or it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.050 
this case could very well suck or it
could<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.140> actually<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:13.860> good<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.640> ten

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
the same level of protection and it can

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.240 
the same level of protection and it can
also<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.479> folded<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.350> several<00:01:25.920> different<00:01:26.040> ways

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
also be folded in several different ways

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.609 
also be folded in several different ways
to<00:01:26.759> get<00:01:26.970> those<00:01:27.210> cool<00:01:27.600> viewing<00:01:27.930> angles<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.409> I

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
to get those cool viewing angles so I

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.380 
to get those cool viewing angles so I
have<00:01:28.890> no<00:01:29.009> idea<00:01:29.159> what<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.549> expect<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.270> may

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
have no idea what to expect here it may

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.539 
have no idea what to expect here it may
be<00:01:30.450> awesome<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.200> may<00:01:31.470> not<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.680> awesome<00:01:32.130> let's

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
be awesome it may not be awesome let's

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.039 
be awesome it may not be awesome let's
get<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> unboxing<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.509> see<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:33.900> this

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
get to the unboxing and see what this

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.240 
get to the unboxing and see what this
case<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:36.259> open<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.590> my<00:01:37.710> HTC

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
case is like open it here with my HTC

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:50.100 
case is like open it here with my HTC
pen

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.870 

alright<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:53.630> let's<00:01:53.659> see<00:01:54.369> microfiber<00:01:55.369> cover

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
alright and let's see microfiber cover

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.570 
alright and let's see microfiber cover
and<00:01:56.240> stand<00:01:56.690> so<00:01:56.900> it<00:01:57.110> looks<00:01:57.409> like<00:01:57.530> suede<00:01:58.190> but

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
and stand so it looks like suede but

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.190

going<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:23.060> hold<00:03:23.299> but<00:03:24.109> maybe<00:03:24.350> I'll<00:03:24.500> be

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
going to hold but maybe I'll be

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.000 
going to hold but maybe I'll be
surprised<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:27.609> pop<00:03:28.609> it<00:03:28.790> in<00:03:29.200> pop<00:03:30.200> it<00:03:30.350> in<00:03:30.470> okay<00:03:30.799> it

I'm<00:03:34.489> actually<00:03:34.790> going<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.450> do<00:03:35.690> this<00:03:35.840> I'm

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
I'm actually going to do this I'm

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.690 
I'm actually going to do this I'm
holding<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:36.859> by<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:36.980> case<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:37.430> it's<00:03:37.579> not

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
coming out I really like that so here's

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.949 
coming out I really like that so here's
the<00:03:40.609> difference<00:03:40.760> between<00:03:41.209> this<00:03:41.390> case<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.720> the

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
the difference between this case and the

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.690 
the difference between this case and the
eye<00:03:41.989> of<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.410> ipad<00:03:42.859> case<00:03:43.070> you<00:03:43.190> get<00:03:43.280> from<00:03:43.459> Apple

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
eye of the ipad case you get from Apple

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.819 
eye of the ipad case you get from Apple
you<00:03:44.180> don't<00:03:44.359> get<00:03:44.630> this<00:03:44.840> sort<00:03:45.049> of<00:03:45.079> coverage<00:03:45.530> here

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
you don't get this sort of coverage here

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.650 
you don't get this sort of coverage here
and<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.280> snaps<00:03:46.579> and<00:03:46.820> vertically<00:03:47.239> rather<00:03:47.269> than

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
and it snaps and vertically rather than

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.030 
and it snaps and vertically rather than
going

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
going

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.220 
going
from<00:03:48.159> the<00:03:48.250> side<00:03:48.689> okay<00:03:49.689> so<00:03:49.750> after<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:50.049> few

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
from the side okay so after a few

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.539 
from the side okay so after a few
minutes<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.469> fumbling<00:03:50.739> around<00:03:50.950> I've<00:03:51.219> figured

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
minutes of fumbling around I've figured

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.670 
minutes of fumbling around I've figured
out<00:03:51.730> how<00:03:51.909> to<00:03:51.969> use<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.329> so<00:03:52.750> it<00:03:52.989> latches<00:03:53.230> on<00:03:53.560> the

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
out how to use it so it latches on the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.199 
out how to use it so it latches on the
back<00:03:53.920> which<00:03:54.219> is<00:03:54.340> a<00:03:54.370> little<00:03:54.579> bit<00:03:54.790> annoying<00:03:55.000> and

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
back which is a little bit annoying and

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.670 
back which is a little bit annoying and
I'm<00:03:55.299> a<00:03:55.329> little<00:03:55.719> bit<00:03:55.840> concerned<00:03:55.959> about<00:03:56.319> how

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
I'm a little bit concerned about how

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.709 
I'm a little bit concerned about how
long<00:03:56.950> this<00:03:57.250> will<00:03:57.430> actually<00:03:57.640> last<00:03:58.090> because

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:58.719 
long this will actually last because

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.030 
long this will actually last because
it's<00:03:58.900> using<00:03:59.109> just<00:03:59.439> the<00:03:59.560> leather<00:03:59.769> on<00:04:00.010> leather

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
it's using just the leather on leather

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.009 
it's using just the leather on leather
contact<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.849> hold<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.090> in<00:04:01.150> place<00:04:01.269> never

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
contact to hold it in place never

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.819 
contact to hold it in place never
nevertheless<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.950> ports<00:04:03.370> are<00:04:03.519> all<00:04:03.579> showing

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
nevertheless the ports are all showing

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.199 
nevertheless the ports are all showing
without<00:04:05.829> any<00:04:06.010> obstruction<00:04:06.159> you<00:04:06.819> open<00:04:07.060> it<00:04:07.120> up

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
without any obstruction you open it up

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.660 
without any obstruction you open it up
this<00:04:07.450> way<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:08.019> this<00:04:08.409> is<00:04:08.620> how<00:04:08.829> you<00:04:08.859> get<00:04:09.310> it<00:04:09.459> to

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
this way and this is how you get it to

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.819 
this way and this is how you get it to
sort<00:04:09.970> of<00:04:10.060> prop<00:04:10.359> up<00:04:10.599> okay<00:04:11.260> so<00:04:11.349> you<00:04:11.500> take<00:04:11.680> this

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
sort of prop up okay so you take this

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.280 
sort of prop up okay so you take this
and<00:04:11.890> you<00:04:12.069> slide<00:04:12.400> it<00:04:12.609> in<00:04:12.760> here<00:04:13.420> you<00:04:13.780> push<00:04:14.079> up

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
and you slide it in here you push up

and you slide it in here you push up
like<00:04:14.560> so<00:04:14.829> and<00:04:14.980> then<00:04:15.519> you<00:04:16.090> have<00:04:16.269> two

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
like so and then you have two

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.390 
like so and then you have two
configurations<00:04:16.870> you<00:04:17.440> have<00:04:17.620> standing<00:04:18.160> up<00:04:18.250> like
