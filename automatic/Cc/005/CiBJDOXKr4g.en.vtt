00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
isn't actually going to be that bad I

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.410 
isn't actually going to be that bad I
think<00:02:05.159> I've<00:02:05.250> eaten<00:02:05.399> some<00:02:05.850> wet<00:02:06.000> dog<00:02:06.179> food

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
think I've eaten some wet dog food

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.030 
think I've eaten some wet dog food
before<00:02:06.690> for<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.899> video<00:02:07.140> I'll<00:02:07.319> give<00:02:07.440> this<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.590> shot

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:23.710

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.670 

I'm<00:02:24.720> starting<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.050> feel<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.230> bad<00:02:25.650> about

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
I'm starting to feel really bad about

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:35.110 
I'm starting to feel really bad about
feeding<00:02:26.190> this<00:02:26.310> stuff<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.640> my<00:02:26.760> dogs

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.630 

hmm<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:40.500> taste<00:02:40.740> was<00:02:40.890> awful<00:02:41.340> but<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:41.550> this

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
hmm the taste was awful but if this

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.830 
hmm the taste was awful but if this
means<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.000> get<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.150> bite<00:02:42.390> people<00:02:42.660> when<00:02:42.750> I'm

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840

upset<00:02:43.020> I'm<00:02:43.590> all<00:02:43.770> for<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:45.090> doesn't<00:02:46.050> mean

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
upset I'm all for it that doesn't mean

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.360

eyebrows done
so<00:02:52.830> I'll<00:02:53.190> go<00:02:53.370> do<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.610> right<00:02:53.790> now<00:02:53.940> for<00:02:54.150> this

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
so I'll go do that right now for this

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.670 
so I'll go do that right now for this
challenge<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.600> guys<00:02:54.690> dared<00:02:55.020> me<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.200> dye<00:02:55.500> my

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
challenge you guys dared me to dye my

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.740 
challenge you guys dared me to dye my
eyebrows<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.400> got<00:02:56.580> some<00:02:56.730> red<00:02:56.940> dye<00:02:57.150> here<00:02:57.510> and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
eyebrows so I got some red dye here and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.480 
eyebrows so I got some red dye here and
my<00:02:58.020> eyebrows<00:02:58.380> are<00:02:58.530> actually<00:02:58.830> fairly<00:02:59.100> light

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
my eyebrows are actually fairly light

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.920 
my eyebrows are actually fairly light
even<00:02:59.820> though<00:02:59.910> they<00:03:00.000> look<00:03:00.150> kind<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.450> dark<00:03:00.690> right

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
even though they look kind of dark right

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.240 
even though they look kind of dark right
now<00:03:00.960> but<00:03:01.620> I'm<00:03:01.710> thinking<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.160> could

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
now but I'm thinking that I could

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.710 
now but I'm thinking that I could
probably<00:03:02.370> even<00:03:02.700> do<00:03:02.820> this<00:03:02.940> without<00:03:03.090> bleaching

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
probably even do this without bleaching

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.540 
probably even do this without bleaching
so<00:03:03.960> here<00:03:04.740> we<00:03:04.830> go<00:03:06.650> okay<00:03:07.650> now<00:03:07.920> we<00:03:08.190> look<00:03:08.400> like

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
so here we go okay now we look like

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.820 
so here we go okay now we look like
Ronald<00:03:08.880> McDonald's<00:03:09.300> evil<00:03:09.600> twin<00:03:09.900> let's<00:03:10.710> see
