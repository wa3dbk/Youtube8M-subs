deep<00:02:13.540> cycle<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.590> still<00:02:15.010> doesn't<00:02:15.190> start<00:02:15.550> up<00:02:15.610> the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
deep cycle it still doesn't start up the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.670 
deep cycle it still doesn't start up the
air<00:02:15.820> conditioner<00:02:16.270> right<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.690> would<00:02:17.530> need<00:02:17.620> a

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
air conditioner right I would need a

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.930 
air conditioner right I would need a
true<00:02:18.070> sine<00:02:18.310> wave<00:02:18.490> but<00:02:19.050> fortunately<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.470> 2<00:02:21.400> kW

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
true sine wave but fortunately that 2 kW

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.270 
true sine wave but fortunately that 2 kW
generator<00:02:21.970> out<00:02:22.510> there<00:02:23.430> does<00:02:24.430> just<00:02:24.700> fine<00:02:26.280> so

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
generator out there does just fine so

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.550 
generator out there does just fine so
that's<00:02:27.400> going<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.640> be<00:02:27.760> nice<00:02:28.200> running<00:02:29.200> four

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
that's going to be nice running four

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.550 
that's going to be nice running four
point<00:02:29.830> eight<00:02:29.980> hours<00:02:30.520> off<00:02:30.820> of<00:02:31.180> 1.6<00:02:31.900> gallons<00:02:32.110> of

point eight hours off of 1.6 gallons of
fuel<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:34.180> think<00:02:34.690> that's<00:02:34.840> awesome<00:02:35.340> now<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.370> just

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
fuel I think that's awesome now I just

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.870 
fuel I think that's awesome now I just
need<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.760> top<00:02:37.239> off<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.450> 55-gallon<00:02:37.989> barrel<00:02:41.880> and

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
need to top off a 55-gallon barrel and

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.560 
need to top off a 55-gallon barrel and
we'll<00:02:43.030> be<00:02:43.150> good<00:02:43.300> to<00:02:43.360> go

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
we'll be good to go

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.830 
we'll be good to go
that's<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.560> for<00:02:44.709> now
