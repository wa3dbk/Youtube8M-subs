first<00:01:59.270> so<00:01:59.569> I'm<00:02:00.200> gonna<00:02:00.409> do<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.740> in<00:02:00.859> batches

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
first so I'm gonna do it in batches

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.709 
first so I'm gonna do it in batches
because<00:02:01.459> my<00:02:01.609> breath<00:02:01.849> and<00:02:02.090> my<00:02:02.270> blender<00:02:02.659> is

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
because my breath and my blender is

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.409 
because my breath and my blender is
pretty<00:02:03.020> small<00:02:03.499> as<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.099> can<00:02:04.279> see<00:02:04.549> so<00:02:05.179> I'm<00:02:05.270> just

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:05.419 
pretty small as you can see so I'm just

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:07.510 
pretty small as you can see so I'm just
gonna<00:02:05.569> blend<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:06.049> chilies<00:02:06.409> first<00:02:06.739> cut<00:02:07.399> it

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
gonna blend the chilies first cut it

gonna blend the chilies first cut it
into<00:02:07.700> smaller<00:02:08.360> chunks

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.690 

before<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.319> blend<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.680> gallon<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.130> remember<00:02:19.520> to

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
before you blend a gallon I remember to

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:31.810 
before you blend a gallon I remember to
cut<00:02:19.880> off<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.180> spam

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.280 

so<00:02:32.820> these<00:02:32.940> ingredients<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.480> been<00:02:33.690> blended<00:02:34.140> I

so these ingredients have been blended I
have<00:02:34.560> them<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.130> bowl<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.580> now<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.000> are<00:02:36.210> going

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
have them in a bowl and now we are going

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.530 
have them in a bowl and now we are going
to<00:02:36.510> fry<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.350> blended<00:02:38.190> ingredients<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:39.270> here<00:02:39.480> I

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
to fry the blended ingredients so here I

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.480 
to fry the blended ingredients so here I
have<00:02:39.570> a<00:02:39.750> pen<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.140> then<00:02:40.590> just<00:02:40.830> add<00:02:40.980> three<00:02:41.340> to

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
have a pen and then just add three to

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.660 
have a pen and then just add three to
four<00:02:41.700> tablespoons<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:42.480> oil

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.790 

so<00:02:48.210> we're<00:02:48.390> going<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.570> cook<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.990> until<00:02:49.170> once

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
so we're going to cook this until once

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.730 
so we're going to cook this until once
again<00:02:50.190> until<00:02:51.000> as<00:02:51.270> which<00:02:51.870> Armenia<00:02:52.320> so<00:02:52.590> that

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
again until as which Armenia so that

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.920 
again until as which Armenia so that
means<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.070> won't<00:02:53.160> go<00:02:53.640> into<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.150> darker<00:02:54.570> shade<00:02:54.720> of

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
means it won't go into a darker shade of
