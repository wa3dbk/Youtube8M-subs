00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
I was going to try and find a Polish to

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.570 
I was going to try and find a Polish to
make<00:04:48.020> an<00:04:48.170> ombre<00:04:48.560> with<00:04:48.800> yellow<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:49.310> would<00:04:49.460> have

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
make an ombre with yellow it would have

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.280 
make an ombre with yellow it would have
to<00:04:49.730> be<00:04:49.820> this<00:04:50.000> one<00:04:50.210> because<00:04:50.630> this<00:04:50.810> is<00:04:50.870> what<00:04:51.170> it

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
to be this one because this is what it

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.260 
to be this one because this is what it
does

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
does

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.810 
does
each<00:04:52.600> polish<00:04:53.140> has<00:04:53.290> its<00:04:53.950> own<00:04:54.190> strengths<00:04:54.730> and

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
each polish has its own strengths and

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.170 
each polish has its own strengths and
weakness<00:04:55.270> and<00:04:55.920> every<00:04:56.920> polish<00:04:57.490> can<00:04:57.790> do<00:04:57.910> like

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
weakness and every polish can do like

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.660

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
real opaque color this would be a

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.050 
real opaque color this would be a
nightmare<00:05:04.090> you<00:05:04.660> know<00:05:04.810> but<00:05:05.640> do<00:05:06.640> you<00:05:06.730> see<00:05:06.910> like

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
just adding that little bit when I

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.860 
just adding that little bit when I
topcoat<00:05:08.950> this<00:05:09.250> a<00:05:09.280> second<00:05:09.910> time<00:05:10.210> it's<00:05:10.720> just

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
topcoat this a second time it's just

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.140 
topcoat this a second time it's just
gonna<00:05:10.990> turn<00:05:11.230> a<00:05:11.290> tiny<00:05:11.890> tiny<00:05:12.250> bit<00:05:12.430> yellow<00:05:12.820> and

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
gonna turn a tiny tiny bit yellow and

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.530 
gonna turn a tiny tiny bit yellow and
