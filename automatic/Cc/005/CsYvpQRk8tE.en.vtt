00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
and this may be the solution for

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.900 
and this may be the solution for
yourself<00:00:30.449> now<00:00:30.750> if<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.109> don't<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> Nexus<00:00:32.669> 5

the Google keyboard you can set
shortcuts<00:00:59.219> say<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.850> example<00:01:00.239> I've<00:01:00.359> got<00:01:00.570> a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
shortcuts say for example I've got a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.380 
shortcuts say for example I've got a
shortcut<00:01:00.930> setup<00:01:01.410> which<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.730> email<00:01:05.390> like

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
shortcut setup which is just email like

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.399 
shortcut setup which is just email like
so<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:08.159> then<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.790> comes<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.750> this

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
so and then it comes up with this this

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.440 
so and then it comes up with this this
is<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.650> text<00:01:11.189> I'll<00:01:11.310> set<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> shortcut

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
is my text I'll set with the shortcut

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.660 
is my text I'll set with the shortcut
now<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.290> happens<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.070> it

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
now what happens then is that it

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.300 
now what happens then is that it
automatically<00:01:15.600> suggests<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.799> text<00:01:17.189> that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
automatically suggests the text that

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.760 
automatically suggests the text that
you've<00:01:17.520> assigned<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.420> shortcut<00:01:18.810> as<00:01:19.200> it

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
you've assigned to that shortcut as it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.200 
you've assigned to that shortcut as it
knows<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.369> want<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> make<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> shortcut

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
knows that you want to make a shortcut

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.870 
knows that you want to make a shortcut
now<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.020> way<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.369> go<00:01:23.580> once

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
now the way you do that is you go once

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.760 
now the way you do that is you go once
you've<00:01:24.150> obviously<00:01:24.479> downloaded<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.560> you're

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
you've obviously downloaded it if you're

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.249 
you've obviously downloaded it if you're
not<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> Nexus<00:01:26.820> phone<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.780> go<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
have and then you get this plus sign it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.679 
have and then you get this plus sign it
would<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:37.979> blank<00:01:38.250> I've<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.939> set<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.270> up<00:01:39.420> so

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
would be blank I've just set this up so

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.410 
would be blank I've just set this up so
for<00:01:39.930> example<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.560> bottom<00:01:40.979> text<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.119> bottom

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
for example the bottom text the bottom

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.109 
for example the bottom text the bottom
word<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.320> shortcuts<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.009> email<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.610> then

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
word is the shortcuts of email and then
