00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.949 
although there's no fighting in it there
was<00:03:28.590> like<00:03:28.620> one<00:03:28.980> scene<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.730> some<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.600> think<00:03:30.810> was

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
was like one scene of some I think was

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.069 
was like one scene of some I think was
like<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:32.010> bat<00:03:32.299> wing<00:03:33.299> thing<00:03:33.810> whatever

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
like the the bat wing thing whatever

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.990 
like the the bat wing thing whatever
they're<00:03:34.290> calling<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.769> shooting<00:03:35.640> at<00:03:35.850> some

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
they're calling it shooting at some

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.039 
they're calling it shooting at some
people<00:03:36.269> but<00:03:36.420> other<00:03:36.540> than<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:36.690> it's<00:03:36.900> all<00:03:37.019> just

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
people but other than that it's all just

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.350 
people but other than that it's all just
talking<00:03:37.620> but<00:03:37.769> like<00:03:37.950> it's<00:03:38.130> just<00:03:38.280> very<00:03:38.400> moody<00:03:38.910> I

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
talking but like it's just very moody I

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.870 
talking but like it's just very moody I
guess<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.930> idea<00:03:39.959> is<00:03:40.320> that<00:03:40.440> people<00:03:40.980> are

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
guess the idea is that people are

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.479 
guess the idea is that people are
turning<00:03:42.750> against<00:03:43.170> God<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.829> they're<00:03:44.130> thinking

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
turning against God and they're thinking

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.340 
turning against God and they're thinking
of<00:03:44.579> Superman<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.209> like<00:03:45.390> their<00:03:45.600> God<00:03:45.780> now<00:03:46.079> but

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
of Superman is like their God now but

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.569 
of Superman is like their God now but
like<00:03:46.440> there's<00:03:46.650> some<00:03:46.860> people<00:03:46.980> are<00:03:47.130> calling<00:03:47.370> him

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
like there's some people are calling him

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.039 
like there's some people are calling him
a<00:03:47.640> false<00:03:47.880> prophet<00:03:48.420> because<00:03:48.540> they<00:03:48.690> think<00:03:48.750> he's

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
a false prophet because they think he's

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.660 
a false prophet because they think he's
there<00:03:49.230> basically<00:03:49.470> it's<00:03:49.709> because<00:03:50.160> Superman<00:03:50.400> is

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
there basically it's because Superman is

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.580 
there basically it's because Superman is
basically<00:03:51.030> like<00:03:51.420> an<00:03:51.660> allegory<00:03:52.079> for<00:03:52.140> Jesus

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
basically like an allegory for Jesus

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.039 
basically like an allegory for Jesus
yeah<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.549> always<00:03:53.700> has<00:03:53.940> been<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:54.630> like<00:03:54.780> but

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
yeah it always has been so it's like but

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.840 
yeah it always has been so it's like but
then<00:03:55.170> they're<00:03:55.380> taking<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:55.920> literally<00:03:56.640> now

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
then they're taking that literally now

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.290 
then they're taking that literally now
yeah

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300
