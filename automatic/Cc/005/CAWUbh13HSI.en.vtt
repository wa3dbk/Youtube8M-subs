00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.950 

my<00:00:56.769> first<00:00:57.070> contact<00:00:57.339> with<00:00:57.579> lighting<00:00:58.120> was<00:00:59.460> 1985

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
my first contact with lighting was 1985

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.720 
my first contact with lighting was 1985
when<00:01:01.960> I<00:01:01.989> was<00:01:02.199> a<00:01:02.230> student<00:01:02.500> at<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.800> Bartlett<00:01:03.250> and

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
when I was a student at the Bartlett and

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.320 
when I was a student at the Bartlett and
I<00:01:04.330> was<00:01:04.479> a<00:01:04.509> student<00:01:04.960> with<00:01:05.520> David<00:01:06.520> Lowe<00:01:06.729> was<00:01:07.149> my

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
I was a student with David Lowe was my

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.410 
I was a student with David Lowe was my
professor<00:01:07.810> of<00:01:08.020> lighting<00:01:08.409> at<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.680> time<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.390> he

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
professor of lighting at the time so he

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.870 
professor of lighting at the time so he
was<00:01:10.960> really<00:01:11.409> enthusiastic<00:01:11.799> about<00:01:12.490> lighting

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
was really enthusiastic about lighting

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.840 
was really enthusiastic about lighting
and<00:01:13.240> he<00:01:14.100> transmitted<00:01:15.100> this<00:01:15.250> passion<00:01:15.820> for

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
and he transmitted this passion for

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.090 
and he transmitted this passion for
lighting<00:01:16.240> I've<00:01:16.899> been<00:01:17.140> interest<00:01:17.560> by<00:01:17.830> right

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
lighting I've been interest by right

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.060 
lighting I've been interest by right
since<00:01:18.789> a<00:01:18.939> long<00:01:19.060> time<00:01:19.119> ago<00:01:19.360> but<00:01:19.899> it's<00:01:20.799> mainly

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
since a long time ago but it's mainly

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.460 
since a long time ago but it's mainly
when<00:01:21.880> I<00:01:21.909> was<00:01:22.240> in<00:01:22.420> Japan<00:01:23.159> doing<00:01:24.159> my<00:01:24.369> PhD

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
when I was in Japan doing my PhD

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.980 
when I was in Japan doing my PhD
researchers<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:26.799> and<00:01:27.070> so<00:01:27.310> on<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:28.210> were<00:01:28.450> that

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
researchers and and so on that were that

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.180 
researchers and and so on that were that
were<00:01:29.229> both<00:01:30.270> light<00:01:31.270> on<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.500> facade<00:01:32.860> of<00:01:32.890> the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
were both light on the facade of the

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.779 
were both light on the facade of the
buildings<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:33.940> so<00:01:34.179> on<00:01:34.210> as<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.509> mean<00:01:34.750> of

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
buildings and so on as a mean of

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.279 
buildings and so on as a mean of
communicating<00:01:36.789> I<00:01:36.940> like<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.479> effect<00:01:37.600> of<00:01:38.020> war

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
communicating I like the effect of war

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.949 
communicating I like the effect of war
war<00:01:38.530> sure<00:01:38.740> when<00:01:39.039> especially<00:01:39.789> when<00:01:40.420> a<00:01:40.450> facade

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
war sure when especially when a facade

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.859 
war sure when especially when a facade
was<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.440> texture<00:01:42.009> that<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:42.940> feeling<00:01:43.479> is

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
was the texture that that feeling is

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.389 
was the texture that that feeling is
really<00:01:44.530> amazed<00:01:45.459> me<00:01:45.759> because<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.770> shows<00:01:48.369> the

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
really amazed me because it shows the

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.930 
really amazed me because it shows the
beauty<00:01:49.119> of<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.569> texture<00:01:50.530> with<00:01:51.369> light<00:01:51.580> that's

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
beauty of the texture with light that's

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.199 
beauty of the texture with light that's
really<00:01:52.630> what<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.049> like<00:01:53.350> as<00:01:54.220> effective<00:01:56.940> my<00:01:57.940> first

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
really what I like as effective my first

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:00.539 
really what I like as effective my first
approach<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.509> lighting<00:01:58.869> and<00:01:59.340> maybe<00:02:00.340> at<00:02:00.460> the

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
approach to lighting and maybe at the

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.370 
approach to lighting and maybe at the
time<00:02:00.759> I<00:02:00.789> wasn't<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.420> much<00:02:01.630> aware<00:02:01.930> that<00:02:02.079> it<00:02:02.259> was

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
time I wasn't so much aware that it was

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.950 
time I wasn't so much aware that it was
lying<00:02:02.680> for<00:02:03.250> me<00:02:03.369> was<00:02:03.520> more<00:02:03.670> architecture<00:02:04.329> but

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
lying for me was more architecture but

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.859 
lying for me was more architecture but
after<00:02:05.950> getting<00:02:06.460> into<00:02:06.609> into<00:02:07.180> lighting<00:02:07.509> design

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
after getting into into lighting design

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.529 
after getting into into lighting design
then<00:02:08.709> of<00:02:08.890> course<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:09.910> start<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.239> see<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
then of course you start to see the

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.310 
then of course you start to see the
things<00:02:10.780> in<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:11.019> different<00:02:11.109> way<00:02:11.470> lunge

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
things in a different way lunge

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.620 
things in a different way lunge
photography<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:14.650> began<00:02:15.030> early<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.209> build<00:02:16.480> my

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
photography and began early to build my

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.500 
photography and began early to build my
own<00:02:16.810> light<00:02:17.500> sabers<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.160> all<00:02:18.489> own<00:02:19.120> light

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
own light sabers and all own light

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.699 
own light sabers and all own light
sources<00:02:19.870> as<00:02:20.230> light<00:02:21.070> brush<00:02:21.370> things<00:02:22.120> and

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
sources as light brush things and

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.840 
sources as light brush things and
experiments<00:02:23.709> made<00:02:23.890> flashlights<00:02:24.370> on<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.609> so

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
experiments made flashlights on and so

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.809 
experiments made flashlights on and so
on<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.420> was<00:02:25.570> my<00:02:25.750> approach<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.049> light

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
on that was my approach to light

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.580 
on that was my approach to light
I<00:02:30.060> think<00:02:31.060> it's<00:02:31.209> for<00:02:32.079> the<00:02:32.109> future<00:02:32.439> very

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
I think it's for the future very

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.270 
I think it's for the future very
necessarily<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.760> in<00:02:34.480> photography<00:02:35.079> do<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.530> care

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
necessarily and in photography do I care

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.979 
necessarily and in photography do I care
about<00:02:36.519> light<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:40.569> first<00:02:40.810> picture<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.290> took<00:02:41.760> was

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
about light the first picture I took was

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.309 
about light the first picture I took was
from<00:02:43.989> this<00:02:44.459> patio<00:02:45.459> between<00:02:46.269> buildings<00:02:46.870> you

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
from this patio between buildings you

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.220 
from this patio between buildings you
know<00:02:47.439> this<00:02:47.879> is<00:02:48.879> this<00:02:49.060> place<00:02:49.329> where<00:02:49.599> you<00:02:49.780> were

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
know this is this place where you were

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.360

graduation<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.540> light<00:03:09.780> turning<00:03:10.780> into<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:11.049> shade

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
graduation of light turning into a shade

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:17.819 
graduation of light turning into a shade
like<00:03:13.419> a<00:03:13.450> fade<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.859> lighting<00:03:15.310> is<00:03:15.549> really<00:03:16.829> an

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
like a fade the lighting is really an

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.550 
like a fade the lighting is really an
incredible<00:03:18.519> profession<00:03:19.150> where<00:03:19.560> different

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
incredible profession where different

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.099 
incredible profession where different
fields<00:03:20.980> come<00:03:21.220> together<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.329> think<00:03:22.629> because

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
fields come together and I think because

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.309 
fields come together and I think because
I'm<00:03:23.439> a<00:03:23.669> enthusiastic<00:03:24.720> person<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:26.049> my<00:03:26.200> own

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
I'm a enthusiastic person and my own

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.030 
I'm a enthusiastic person and my own
enthusiasm<00:03:26.680> for<00:03:27.430> light<00:03:28.329> as<00:03:28.569> big<00:03:28.959> so<00:03:29.260> maybe<00:03:29.889> I

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
enthusiasm for light as big so maybe I

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.399 
enthusiasm for light as big so maybe I
can<00:03:30.129> transfer<00:03:30.879> that<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.299> think<00:03:31.870> inspiration

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
can transfer that I think inspiration

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.589 
can transfer that I think inspiration
it's<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.709> most<00:03:33.040> important<00:03:33.549> thing<00:03:33.729> to<00:03:33.849> do<00:03:34.239> as<00:03:34.389> a

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
it's the most important thing to do as a

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.439 
it's the most important thing to do as a
teacher<00:03:34.870> so<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.470> use<00:03:36.030> pictures<00:03:37.030> of<00:03:37.150> James

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449 
teacher so I use pictures of James

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.649 
teacher so I use pictures of James
Terrell<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.109> then<00:03:38.680> fluffing<00:03:39.099> and<00:03:39.659> Richard

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
Terrell and then fluffing and Richard

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.439 
Terrell and then fluffing and Richard
Kelly<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:41.049> course<00:03:41.290> as<00:03:41.859> methods<00:03:42.729> of<00:03:42.849> education

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
Kelly of course as methods of education

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.240 
Kelly of course as methods of education
so<00:03:44.379> that's<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:45.040> way<00:03:45.129> I<00:03:45.159> try<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.579> inspire

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
so that's the way I try to inspire

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.399 
so that's the way I try to inspire
students<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.430> show<00:03:48.879> them<00:03:49.120> pictures<00:03:49.599> of<00:03:50.109> an

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
students I show them pictures of an

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.550 
students I show them pictures of an
early<00:03:50.799> morning<00:03:51.250> light<00:03:52.199> which<00:03:53.199> is<00:03:53.379> I<00:03:53.530> think

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
early morning light which is I think

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.990 
early morning light which is I think
there's<00:03:53.889> nothing<00:03:54.069> more<00:03:54.430> beautiful<00:03:54.639> than

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
there's nothing more beautiful than

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.530 
there's nothing more beautiful than
opening<00:03:55.659> a<00:03:55.780> window<00:03:55.959> and<00:03:56.470> seeing<00:03:56.829> a<00:03:57.069> bright

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
opening a window and seeing a bright

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.469 
opening a window and seeing a bright
clear<00:03:58.540> sky<00:03:59.199> so<00:04:00.129> I<00:04:00.159> think<00:04:00.459> that's<00:04:00.909> something

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:01.479 
clear sky so I think that's something

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.689 
clear sky so I think that's something
that<00:04:01.690> gives<00:04:02.169> you<00:04:02.319> happiness<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:03.129> I<00:04:03.489> think

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:03.699 
that gives you happiness and I think

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:05.819 
that gives you happiness and I think
that<00:04:03.819> light<00:04:04.299> gives<00:04:04.810> happiness<00:04:05.019> in<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.620> same

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
that light gives happiness in the same

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.339 
that light gives happiness in the same
time<00:04:06.069> and<00:04:06.340> it's<00:04:06.430> like<00:04:06.639> music<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.349> something

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
time and it's like music is something

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.559 
time and it's like music is something
which<00:04:08.500> is<00:04:08.650> with<00:04:08.889> us<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.370> would<00:04:10.030> show<00:04:10.329> her<00:04:10.540> a

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
which is with us I would show her a

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.619 
which is with us I would show her a
picture<00:04:11.229> where<00:04:11.560> we<00:04:11.590> see<00:04:12.189> the<00:04:12.699> effect<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.359> light

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
picture where we see the effect of light

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.069 
picture where we see the effect of light
and<00:04:14.109> not<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.889> source<00:04:15.189> to<00:04:15.760> tell<00:04:15.970> them<00:04:16.239> lighting

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
and not the source to tell them lighting

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.860 
and not the source to tell them lighting
is<00:04:17.380> not<00:04:17.530> about<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:18.489> luminaire<00:04:19.000> it's<00:04:19.299> about

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
is not about the luminaire it's about

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.500 
is not about the luminaire it's about
effect<00:04:20.530> of<00:04:20.739> light<00:04:21.010> there<00:04:21.549> would<00:04:21.699> be<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.909> rainbow

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
effect of light there would be a rainbow

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.700 
effect of light there would be a rainbow
that's<00:04:23.409> a<00:04:24.030> very<00:04:25.030> simple<00:04:25.599> method<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.080> present

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
that's a very simple method to present

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.120 
that's a very simple method to present
them

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
them

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.790 
them
of<00:04:27.220> life<00:04:27.460> you<00:04:28.210> don't<00:04:28.420> have<00:04:28.600> an<00:04:29.140> ending<00:04:29.530> to

of life you don't have an ending to

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.640 
of life you don't have an ending to
either<00:04:29.950> side<00:04:30.280> it's<00:04:30.580> an<00:04:30.760> arch<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:32.200> rainbow

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
either side it's an arch and the rainbow

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.860 
either side it's an arch and the rainbow
is<00:04:32.890> something<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.460> makes<00:04:34.030> people<00:04:34.390> happy<00:04:34.570> all

is something that makes people happy all

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.950 
is something that makes people happy all
the<00:04:35.050> time<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.590> will<00:04:35.950> prefer<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.670> show<00:04:37.180> a<00:04:37.210> picture

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
the time I will prefer to show a picture

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.280 
the time I will prefer to show a picture
from<00:04:38.260> the<00:04:38.410> nature<00:04:39.780> but<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:40.810> really<00:04:41.110> have<00:04:41.260> a

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
from the nature but I really have a

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.220 
from the nature but I really have a
favorite<00:04:42.030> painting<00:04:43.030> from<00:04:43.630> Caravaggio

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
favorite painting from Caravaggio

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.060 
favorite painting from Caravaggio
san-tomás<00:04:45.130> and<00:04:45.580> I<00:04:46.570> think<00:04:46.810> really<00:04:47.170> expresses

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
san-tomás and I think really expresses

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.250 
san-tomás and I think really expresses
the<00:04:48.220> quality<00:04:48.790> of<00:04:48.880> light<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.260> directionality

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
the quality of light and directionality

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.910 
the quality of light and directionality
and<00:04:50.590> contrast<00:04:51.370> and<00:04:51.960> vividness<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:53.500> how<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.740> be

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
and contrast and vividness and how to be

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.060 
and contrast and vividness and how to be
realistic<00:04:54.490> but<00:04:55.180> also<00:04:55.450> it<00:04:55.780> reflects<00:04:56.740> the

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
realistic but also it reflects the

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.710 
realistic but also it reflects the
curiosity<00:04:58.000> that<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.270> student<00:04:58.570> should<00:04:58.660> have

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
curiosity that the student should have

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.430 
curiosity that the student should have
by<00:04:59.290> going<00:05:00.100> to<00:05:00.310> into<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:00.970> into<00:05:01.810> detail<00:05:02.200> and

by going to into the into detail and

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.640 
by going to into the into detail and
trying<00:05:02.920> to<00:05:03.100> look<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:03.550> make<00:05:03.820> it<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.960> realize
