you<00:00:04.140> have<00:00:04.259> two<00:00:04.560> curves<00:00:05.690> board<00:00:06.830> its<00:00:07.830> heart

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
you have two curves board its heart

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.509 
you have two curves board its heart
shape<00:00:08.519> up<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.300> down<00:00:09.889> would<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.010> left<00:00:11.280> on

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
shape up and down would you left on

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.370 
shape up and down would you left on
these<00:00:11.670> two<00:00:11.849> curves<00:00:12.120> we<00:00:12.690> can<00:00:12.870> select<00:00:13.049> the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
these two curves we can select the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.340 
these two curves we can select the
surfaces<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:15.000> can<00:00:15.179> take<00:00:15.360> them<00:00:15.480> down<00:00:15.660> and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
surfaces and we can take them down and

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.200 
surfaces and we can take them down and
we<00:00:17.340> can<00:00:17.490> take<00:00:17.670> them<00:00:17.820> back<00:00:18.000> win7<00:00:18.570> enter<00:00:20.210> and

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
we can take them back win7 enter and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.480 
we can take them back win7 enter and
then<00:00:21.240> we're<00:00:21.750> going<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.990> select<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.949> tool<00:00:23.220> or

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
then we're going to select the tool or

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.839 
then we're going to select the tool or
well<00:00:23.699> for<00:00:24.090> living<00:00:24.390> size<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.109> love<00:00:25.980> them<00:00:26.250> and

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
well for living size and love them and

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.720 
well for living size and love them and
this<00:00:27.060> point<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.660> said<00:00:27.869> like<00:00:28.080> them<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.730> clicking

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
this point I said like them and clicking

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.730 
this point I said like them and clicking
it<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.630> time<00:00:30.869> I'm<00:00:31.050> taking<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.470> two

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
it I this time I'm taking a two

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.040 
it I this time I'm taking a two
millimeter<00:00:32.780> outside<00:00:33.800> select<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> object<00:00:35.340> and

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
millimeter outside select the object and

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.889 
millimeter outside select the object and
move<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.290> up<00:00:37.700> into<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.059> surface<00:00:41.540> yeah<00:00:42.540> we're

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
move them up into the surface yeah we're

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.479 
move them up into the surface yeah we're
going<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.110> come<00:00:43.379> back<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.920> select<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
going to come back and select the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.060 
going to come back and select the
surfaces<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.780> delete<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> surfaces<00:00:46.829> from

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
surfaces and we delete the surfaces from

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.950 
surfaces and we delete the surfaces from
here<00:00:49.370> I'm<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.910> select<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.750> ring

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
here I'm going to select the ring

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.650 
here I'm going to select the ring
surpass<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.739> top<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.399> we're<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> do

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
surpass the top and we're going to do

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.430 
surpass the top and we're going to do
the<00:00:54.750> test<00:00:55.020> surface<00:00:56.539> and<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.930> others<00:00:58.289> in

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the test surface and it is others in

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.810 
the test surface and it is others in
price<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:01.109> now<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.280> merge<00:01:02.579> them

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
price so now this not in a merge them

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:14.800 
price so now this not in a merge them
together

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.930 

an<00:01:15.380> exacto<00:01:16.509> and<00:01:17.509> this<00:01:17.810> one<00:01:18.049> too

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.100 

then

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.350 

over<00:01:26.770> here<00:01:28.650> this

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.290 

merge<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:33.870> to<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.590> emerging<00:01:35.130> insight

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.820 

to<00:01:39.300> design<00:01:39.690> organic<00:01:40.260> shape<00:01:40.470> with<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
to design organic shape with the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.080 
to design organic shape with the
software<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.550> so<00:01:42.060> easy<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.810> amazing<00:01:44.090> now

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
software it's so easy it's amazing now

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.719 
software it's so easy it's amazing now
this<00:01:45.300> is<00:01:45.479> our<00:01:45.630> ring<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.110> finished<00:01:46.500> now<00:01:46.800> if

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
this is our ring it's finished now if

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.900 
this is our ring it's finished now if
you<00:01:47.850> think<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> ring<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.390> too<00:01:49.140> high<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:49.910> let's

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
you think the ring is too high and let's

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.030 
you think the ring is too high and let's
say<00:01:51.150> this<00:01:51.930> part<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.650> ring<00:01:52.830> they're

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
say this part of the ring they're

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.160 
say this part of the ring they're
intersecting<00:01:53.790> between<00:01:54.570> each<00:01:54.690> other<00:01:54.869> and

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
intersecting between each other and

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.770 
intersecting between each other and
machine<00:01:56.070> from<00:01:56.310> solid<00:01:56.790> scape<00:01:57.030> doesn't<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.570> it

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
machine from solid scape doesn't like it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.010 
machine from solid scape doesn't like it
not<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.650> problem<00:01:59.159> we<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.210> solution<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.690> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
not a problem we have a solution for it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.609 
not a problem we have a solution for it
and<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.590> point<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:04.080> grabbed<00:02:04.470> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
and this point that we grabbed the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.330 
and this point that we grabbed the
surfaces<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:06.020> over<00:02:07.020> here<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.500> surface<00:02:07.950> I'm

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
surfaces and over here the surface I'm

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.229 
surfaces and over here the surface I'm
going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.759> grab<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.270> surface<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.080> bottom

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
going to grab the surface on the bottom

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.380 
going to grab the surface on the bottom
on<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.450> side<00:02:12.780> too<00:02:13.019> and<00:02:13.400> then<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.730> a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
on this side too and then we have a

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.600 
on this side too and then we have a
control<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.290> here<00:02:18.440> if<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.620> move<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:19.890> translate

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
control in here if I move this translate

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.690 
control in here if I move this translate
up<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.060> down<00:02:21.269> guess<00:02:21.750> what<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.680> piece<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:22.980> over

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
up and down guess what the piece is over

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.560 
up and down guess what the piece is over
under<00:02:24.269> each<00:02:24.540> other<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.230> murder<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.530> second

under each other in the murder of second

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.750 
under each other in the murder of second
the<00:02:27.570> fitting<00:02:28.019> guess<00:02:28.380> our<00:02:28.890> chapel<00:02:29.430> ridge<00:02:29.610> is

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
the fitting guess our chapel ridge is

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.270 
the fitting guess our chapel ridge is
not<00:02:29.940> sharp<00:02:30.209> enough<00:02:30.560> we<00:02:31.560> have<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:32.040> crease

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
not sharp enough we have a crease

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.150 
not sharp enough we have a crease
increase<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:37.170> after<00:02:37.470> we<00:02:37.620> freeze<00:02:37.890> tag

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
increase this and after we freeze tag

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.819 
increase this and after we freeze tag
what<00:02:38.730> we<00:02:38.880> can<00:02:39.090> do<00:02:39.299> we<00:02:39.480> can<00:02:39.510> pull<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.170> surfaces

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
what we can do we can pull the surfaces

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.449 
what we can do we can pull the surfaces
to<00:02:41.670> each<00:02:41.790> other<00:02:42.090> now<00:02:42.570> it's<00:02:42.750> sharp<00:02:43.280> we<00:02:44.280> can

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
to each other now it's sharp we can

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.319 
to each other now it's sharp we can
select<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.030> surfaces<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.660> here<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:47.150> we<00:02:48.150> can

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
select the surfaces in here and we can

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:55.490 
select the surfaces in here and we can
just<00:02:48.510> move<00:02:48.780> them<00:02:50.810> out<00:02:51.810> RN<00:02:54.049> make<00:02:55.049> organic

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
just move them out RN make organic

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.039 
just move them out RN make organic
shapes<00:02:55.890> or<00:02:56.780> we<00:02:57.780> can<00:02:57.959> just<00:02:58.910> move<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.030> in<00:03:00.239> more

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
shapes or we can just move it in more

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.970 
shapes or we can just move it in more
tapered<00:03:02.060> if<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.239> want<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.480> more<00:03:03.690> tapered<00:03:04.079> and

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
easy grab the ring control point down in

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.590 
easy grab the ring control point down in
vinyl<00:03:13.190> select<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.340> control<00:03:14.910> point<00:03:15.209> over

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
vinyl select this control point over

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.979 
vinyl select this control point over
here<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:17.000> this<00:03:18.000> one<00:03:18.269> here<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:18.810> go<00:03:19.560> back<00:03:19.590> to

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
here and this one here and go back to

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.949 
here and this one here and go back to
transform<00:03:21.989> again<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.910> move<00:03:23.910> on<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.540> scale

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
transform again and move on the scale

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.090 
transform again and move on the scale
now<00:03:25.410> we<00:03:25.470> have<00:03:25.799> Square<00:03:26.190> shank<00:03:26.519> link<00:03:27.920> we<00:03:28.920> have

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
now we have Square shank link we have

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.729 
now we have Square shank link we have
much<00:03:29.340> more<00:03:29.700> detail<00:03:30.450> in<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:30.930> organic<00:03:31.350> shape

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
much more detail in this organic shape

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.640 
much more detail in this organic shape
that<00:03:32.340> we<00:03:32.370> can<00:03:32.700> create<00:03:33.000> if<00:03:33.959> we<00:03:34.170> don't<00:03:34.350> like<00:03:34.500> the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
that we can create if we don't like the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.770 
that we can create if we don't like the
top<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:35.100> too<00:03:35.130> high<00:03:35.549> we<00:03:35.850> can<00:03:35.880> just<00:03:36.209> select<00:03:36.390> all

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
top is too high we can just select all

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.870 
top is too high we can just select all
top<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.530> just<00:03:38.040> move<00:03:38.370> it

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
top and just move it

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.290 
top and just move it
to<00:03:39.540> lower<00:03:39.810> higher<00:03:40.440> top<00:03:41.130> make<00:03:41.700> around<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.150> and

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
to lower higher top make around it and

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.150 
to lower higher top make around it and
even<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:44.450> this<00:03:45.450> is<00:03:45.630> what<00:03:45.840> we<00:03:45.960> call<00:03:46.200> t<00:03:46.470> spine<00:03:46.800> and

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
even so this is what we call t spine and

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.370 
even so this is what we call t spine and

surface modeling organic shapes in
jewelry<00:03:50.270> it's<00:03:51.270> not<00:03:51.480> easy<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.960> create<00:03:52.200> this<00:03:52.410> in

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
jewelry it's not easy to create this in

jewelry it's not easy to create this in
basic<00:03:52.980> in<00:03:53.130> Rhino<00:03:53.400> we<00:03:53.880> can<00:03:54.060> create<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.480> but<00:03:54.660> it's

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
basic in Rhino we can create it but it's

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.590 
basic in Rhino we can create it but it's
too<00:03:55.020> hard<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.620> convert<00:03:56.520> all<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.940> surfaces<00:03:57.210> in

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
too hard to convert all the surfaces in

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.650 
too hard to convert all the surfaces in
here<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.110> over<00:03:58.650> or<00:03:58.710> under<00:03:59.100> in<00:03:59.370> one<00:03:59.430> shot<00:03:59.970> and
