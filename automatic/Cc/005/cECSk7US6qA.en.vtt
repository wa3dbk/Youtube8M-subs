wonderful interview that I ruined

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.889

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
because I didn't have the microphone on

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.229 
because I didn't have the microphone on
so<00:00:58.379> he's<00:00:58.859> probably<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.460> little<00:00:59.550> upset<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.090> me

both very passionate about that and I
think<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.710> shows<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> animals<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.060> know

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
think that shows in the animals you know

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.700 
think that shows in the animals you know
and<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.930> try<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.049> make<00:01:46.229> sure<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.530> you

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
and we just try to make sure that you

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.600 
and we just try to make sure that you
know<00:01:46.799> they're<00:01:46.920> nothing<00:01:47.250> less<00:01:47.430> than<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
know they're nothing less than the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.910 
know they're nothing less than the
absolute<00:01:48.060> best<00:01:48.270> when<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.659> offer<00:01:48.869> them<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.350> you

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
absolute best when we offer them and you

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.840 
absolute best when we offer them and you
know<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.549> something<00:01:50.700> that's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
know it's just something that's

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.560 
know it's just something that's
personally<00:01:51.689> very<00:01:51.840> important<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.500> me<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.860> know

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
personally very important to me you know

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.370 
personally very important to me you know
absolutely<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.689> think<00:01:54.780> everyone<00:01:55.229> who's

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
absolutely I think everyone who's

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.410 
absolutely I think everyone who's
watching<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.950> home<00:01:55.979> should<00:01:56.880> realize<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
watching at home should realize the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.330 
watching at home should realize the
difference<00:01:57.719> between<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.990> dealer<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
difference between a dealer and a

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.800 
difference between a dealer and a
breeder<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.090> everyone<00:02:00.420> does<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> bit<00:02:00.780> of

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
breeder so everyone does a bit of

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.499 
breeder so everyone does a bit of
trading<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.770> shuffling<00:02:02.189> things<00:02:02.340> around<00:02:02.520> but

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
trading and shuffling things around but

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.209 
trading and shuffling things around but
you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:03.990> tell<00:02:04.380> those<00:02:04.619> people<00:02:04.680> who<00:02:05.130> are

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
you can tell those people who are

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.399 
you can tell those people who are
actually<00:02:05.399> breeders<00:02:06.000> who<00:02:06.270> put<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> time<00:02:07.110> in

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
actually breeders who put the time in

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.380 
actually breeders who put the time in
and<00:02:07.649> actually<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.429> healthy<00:02:08.819> animals<00:02:09.270> who

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and actually have healthy animals who

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.369 
and actually have healthy animals who
are<00:02:09.479> healthy<00:02:09.720> enough<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.929> breed<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.349> captivity

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
are healthy enough to breed in captivity

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.010 
are healthy enough to breed in captivity
because<00:02:10.979> really<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.610> that's<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.690> biggest

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
because really that that's the biggest

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.760 
because really that that's the biggest
sign<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.500> have

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.810 
sign that you have
the<00:02:13.950> animals<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.550> you're<00:02:14.670> having

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
the animals and that you're having

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.850 
the animals and that you're having
success<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.780> when<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.080> have<00:02:16.260> those<00:02:16.440> animals

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
success is when you have those animals

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.620 
success is when you have those animals
that<00:02:17.010> are<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.910> are<00:02:18.060> obviously<00:02:18.360> healthy

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
that are that are obviously healthy

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.470 
that are that are obviously healthy
