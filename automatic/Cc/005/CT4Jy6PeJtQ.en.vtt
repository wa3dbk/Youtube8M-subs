00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.580
 such a focus is known 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:12.410
 when people shout so loud 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.509
 loud that the glasses burst 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.840
 this is both depth describing and 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.930
 a lot of where it is of course very impressive 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.990
 but very interesting physics of this phenomenon 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.050
 the fact is it is very important on what 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.060
 shouting frequency because it scatters 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.120
 the glass is not just because it's loud 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.320
 shouted because it arises because of you 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.690
 on the phenomenon that is if the sound of the voice 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.680
 has a certain frequency he should 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.200
 have a frequency equal to the purity in the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.149
 glasses here we are here now 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.199
 let's see we won't say that 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.110
 states so he fly here just 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:01:01.890
 physics of this phenomenon let's see this 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:03.239
 the glass has a diameter of 6 cm and its own 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.320
 resonant frequency 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.850
 when we create a sound we will see 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:17.390
 How much does this glass increase 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.540
 signal intensity sensor here 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.330
 piezoceramic 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.960
 the sensor is stuck here with wax means 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.960
 here is dino 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.820
 beeper 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:42.000
 and here it is the usual ordinary low-power 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.000
 0 25 watts and speaker 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.009
 oscilloscope 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.500
 give two inputs on one input we 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.250
 give a signal from the generator to be 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.590
 it can be seen that it does not vary in amplitude 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.170
 bridge at the entrance we signal from this 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.950
 sensor and here's a private look 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.950
 how much signal increases 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.460
 you even downstairs 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.460
 picture 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.850
 this 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.000
 oscillator signal amplitude 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.640
 and this 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.849
 mean amplitude which we remove 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.730
 from here but here why is she floating here 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:41.170
 my voice and here it is stacked so 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.129
 what does it mean here it turns out that if I 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.129
 touch 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.810
 by hand 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.270
 it naturally decreases dramatically 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.270
 amplitude but how does it change 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:08.319
 hansa amm at noise level to another 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.319
 the side here is the most behind our very sharp 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.110
 clear the level of noise 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.110
 and only at resonance 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.020
 very smoothly to here on resonance means 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.740
 signal increases 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:32.000
 70 times that is the quality factor of this one 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:34.040
 the oscillatory system is 70 at the very 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.150
 In fact, its high quality is much higher. 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.860
 reduced by the fact that she touch it 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.430
 sensor 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:48.730
 we reduce amplitude and the staff means 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:56.660
 I will click so that it does not act on the ears 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:58.880
 well that's actually oscillatory 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.280
 the system is a combination 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:06.770
 oscillatory system 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:08.600
 I will write an article about this that 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.490
 is a combined system and how is it 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.490
 It works here these conditions and 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.880
 see together
