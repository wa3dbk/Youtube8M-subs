Diamonds<00:01:39.210> really<00:01:39.509> really<00:01:39.720> fast<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.229> then

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
Diamonds really really fast and then

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.109 
Diamonds really really fast and then
you're<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.650> switch<00:01:41.070> over<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.970> back

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
you're going to switch over and go back

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.399 
you're going to switch over and go back
to<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> block<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.780> diamonds<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.170> we're<00:01:43.290> going

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
to the block of diamonds so we're going

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.840 
to the block of diamonds so we're going
to<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.710> now<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.430> we're<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> try<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
to do that now so we're going to try to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.880 
to do that now so we're going to try to
see<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.869> remember<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.439> 11

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
see if we can get so remember we have 11

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.609 
see if we can get so remember we have 11
blocks<00:01:47.600> all<00:01:48.600> right<00:01:48.780> i<00:01:49.020> think<00:01:49.170> i<00:01:49.320> might<00:01:49.470> have

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
blocks all right i think i might have

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.170 
blocks all right i think i might have
drums<00:01:49.860> them<00:01:50.040> okay<00:01:50.460> there<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:50.759> go<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.090> was

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
drums them okay there we go that was

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.850 
drums them okay there we go that was
kind<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.390> weird<00:01:51.540> alright<00:01:52.110> let's<00:01:52.530> try<00:01:52.590> that

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
kind of weird alright let's try that

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.160 
kind of weird alright let's try that
again<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.850> you're<00:01:54.000> going<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.149> hold<00:01:54.329> X<00:01:54.600> let<00:01:55.020> them

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
again so you're going to hold X let them

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.480 
again so you're going to hold X let them
well<00:01:55.320> come<00:01:55.470> out<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:55.979> you're<00:01:56.070> gonna<00:01:56.159> just

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
well come out and then you're gonna just

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.240 
well come out and then you're gonna just
keep<00:01:56.610> keep<00:01:57.329> doing<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.659> back<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.990> forth<00:01:58.250> it's

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
keep keep doing that back and forth it's

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.950 
keep keep doing that back and forth it's
a<00:01:59.340> little<00:01:59.460> bit<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.119> little<00:02:00.149> difficult<00:02:00.540> but

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
a little bit it's a little difficult but

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.899 
a little bit it's a little difficult but
once<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> hang<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.950> it

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
once you get the hang of it

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.480 
once you get the hang of it
it<00:02:02.999> puts<00:02:03.270> them<00:02:03.390> out<00:02:03.509> pretty<00:02:03.780> quickly<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.490> we're

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
it puts them out pretty quickly so we're

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.980 
it puts them out pretty quickly so we're
going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.729> keep<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:06.030> trying<00:02:06.359> to<00:02:06.450> do<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.749> here

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
going to keep on trying to do this here

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.839 
going to keep on trying to do this here
till<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:07.409> get<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.770> there<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.310> go<00:02:08.399> as<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.700> guys

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
till we get it there we go as you guys

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.150 
till we get it there we go as you guys
can<00:02:08.970> see<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.750> 13<00:02:10.200> blocks<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.709> diamonds

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
can see I now have 13 blocks of diamonds

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.330 
can see I now have 13 blocks of diamonds
and<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:12.269> can<00:02:12.420> do<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.690> up<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.170> 20<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.250> then

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
and you can do this up to 20 and then

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.430 
and you can do this up to 20 and then
you're<00:02:14.459> going<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:14.700> make<00:02:14.910> another<00:02:15.390> slot<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.260> for

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
you're going to make another slot so for

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.020 
you're going to make another slot so for
example<00:02:16.470> say<00:02:16.950> if<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.129> have<00:02:17.280> 20<00:02:17.610> blocks<00:02:17.790> of

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
example say if I have 20 blocks of

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.369 
example say if I have 20 blocks of
diamonds<00:02:18.420> you're<00:02:18.750> going<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.959> need<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.200> take

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
diamonds you're going to need to take

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.020 
diamonds you're going to need to take
one<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.680> these<00:02:19.769> out<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.129> so<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.640> could<00:02:20.879> have

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
one of these out and so you could have

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.449 
one of these out and so you could have
more<00:02:21.209> room<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:22.410> produce<00:02:22.590> more<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.129> diamond

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
more room to produce more of the diamond

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.440 
more room to produce more of the diamond
so<00:02:23.580> we're<00:02:23.730> gonna<00:02:23.819> we're<00:02:24.060> gonna<00:02:24.120> do<00:02:24.299> that<00:02:24.420> now

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
so we're gonna we're gonna do that now

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.150 
so we're gonna we're gonna do that now

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
we're going to stop at 20 blocks will go

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.220 
we're going to stop at 20 blocks will go
to<00:02:26.220> 20<00:02:26.519> blocks<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.690> show<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:28.019> guys

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
to 20 blocks so that I can show you guys

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.530 
to 20 blocks so that I can show you guys
exactly<00:02:28.440> how<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.160> works<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.700> pretty<00:02:30.480> much

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540

like<00:03:00.390> competitive<00:03:00.780> or<00:03:01.170> nothing<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.500> know

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
like competitive or nothing you know

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.170 
like competitive or nothing you know
where<00:03:02.010> it's<00:03:02.099> not<00:03:02.250> considered<00:03:02.760> cheating

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
where it's not considered cheating

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.509 
where it's not considered cheating
pretty<00:03:03.629> much<00:03:03.870> but<00:03:04.650> other<00:03:04.920> than<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.160> it's

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
pretty much but other than that it's

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.400 
pretty much but other than that it's
it's<00:03:05.819> a<00:03:05.940> really<00:03:06.120> cool<00:03:06.329> glitch<00:03:06.540> sometimes<00:03:07.260> I'll

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
it's a really cool glitch sometimes I'll

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.110 
it's a really cool glitch sometimes I'll
do<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.680> if<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:08.220> want<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.430> get<00:03:08.549> ahead<00:03:08.730> but<00:03:08.970> then

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
do it if I want to get ahead but then

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.940 
do it if I want to get ahead but then
again<00:03:09.239> kind<00:03:10.079> of<00:03:10.170> does<00:03:10.319> get<00:03:10.500> boring<00:03:10.650> when<00:03:10.920> you

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
again kind of does get boring when you

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.680 
again kind of does get boring when you
duplicate<00:03:11.519> because<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:12.359> don't<00:03:12.510> get<00:03:12.599> the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
duplicate because you don't get the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.420 
duplicate because you don't get the
satisfaction<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.410> actually<00:03:13.889> mining<00:03:14.280> out<00:03:14.400> a

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
satisfaction of actually mining out a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.150 
satisfaction of actually mining out a
diamond<00:03:14.819> I<00:03:15.000> me<00:03:15.510> some<00:03:15.720> trouble<00:03:15.930> here<00:03:16.160> getting

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
diamond I me some trouble here getting

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.569 
diamond I me some trouble here getting
some<00:03:17.400> ah<00:03:19.069> dang<00:03:20.069> I<00:03:20.190> don't<00:03:20.310> know<00:03:20.370> why<00:03:20.489> it's

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
some ah dang I don't know why it's

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.580 
some ah dang I don't know why it's
taking<00:03:20.819> so<00:03:20.849> long<00:03:21.000> all<00:03:21.959> right<00:03:22.049> we're<00:03:22.260> gonna<00:03:22.380> try

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
taking so long all right we're gonna try

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.199 
taking so long all right we're gonna try
to<00:03:22.650> get<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.889> 20<00:03:23.220> but<00:03:23.430> it's<00:03:23.760> getting<00:03:23.940> it's<00:03:24.150> a

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
to get to 20 but it's getting it's a

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.789 
to get to 20 but it's getting it's a
little<00:03:24.450> difficult<00:03:25.280> hmm<00:03:26.280> let's<00:03:27.239> see<00:03:27.680> maybe<00:03:28.680> if

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
little difficult hmm let's see maybe if

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.180 
little difficult hmm let's see maybe if
we<00:03:28.859> clear<00:03:29.250> out<00:03:29.370> space<00:03:30.919> alright<00:03:31.919> we're<00:03:32.130> going

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
we clear out space alright we're going

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.740 
we clear out space alright we're going
to<00:03:32.310> try<00:03:32.459> clearing<00:03:32.669> out<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:33.000> space<00:03:33.209> real<00:03:33.480> quick

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
to try clearing out of space real quick

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.430 
to try clearing out of space real quick
see<00:03:34.019> if<00:03:34.049> that<00:03:34.380> works<00:03:34.590> if<00:03:34.829> that<00:03:35.010> helps<00:03:35.310> us

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
see if that works if that helps us

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.229 
see if that works if that helps us
eventually<00:03:37.440> it's<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.340> difficult<00:03:38.549> glitch<00:03:39.000> but

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
eventually it's a difficult glitch but

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.759 
eventually it's a difficult glitch but
once<00:03:39.569> you<00:03:39.660> get<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.870> hang<00:03:39.900> of<00:03:40.109> it<00:03:40.260> then<00:03:40.440> you'll

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
once you get the hang of it then you'll

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.319 
once you get the hang of it then you'll
be<00:03:40.950> like<00:03:41.069> Oh<00:03:41.430> Dan<00:03:41.819> is<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.269> cool<00:03:43.910> so<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.150> seems

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
be like Oh Dan is so cool so it seems

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.879 
be like Oh Dan is so cool so it seems
like<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.690> blocks<00:03:46.200> are<00:03:46.349> falling<00:03:46.680> on<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.859> floor

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
like the blocks are falling on the floor

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.009 
like the blocks are falling on the floor
but<00:03:47.639> they're<00:03:47.880> not<00:03:48.030> getting<00:03:48.359> picked<00:03:48.690> up<00:03:48.810> as

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
but they're not getting picked up as

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.120 
but they're not getting picked up as
quickly<00:03:49.700> you're<00:03:50.700> going<00:03:50.849> to<00:03:50.910> try<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.180> again

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
quickly you're going to try this again

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.410 
quickly you're going to try this again
see<00:03:53.130> if<00:03:53.160> we<00:03:53.280> could<00:03:53.400> get<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:53.730> ah

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.150 

what<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.540> house<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:57.959> very<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.470> looks<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:59.040> lot

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
what the house is very it looks a lot

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.650 
what the house is very it looks a lot
more<00:03:59.220> difficult<00:03:59.730> if<00:03:59.819> you're<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.060> host<00:04:00.239> even

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
more difficult if you're the host even

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.220 
more difficult if you're the host even
on<00:04:00.780> just<00:04:01.319> like<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.790> two<00:04:02.790> player<00:04:03.090> or<00:04:03.450> when<00:04:04.080> you're

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
on just like a two player or when you're

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.869 
on just like a two player or when you're
not<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:04.500> host<00:04:04.650> it's<00:04:04.890> still<00:04:05.129> very<00:04:05.280> hard<00:04:05.580> to<00:04:05.700> do

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
not the host it's still very hard to do

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.410 
not the host it's still very hard to do
but<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.530> like<00:04:07.530> this<00:04:07.920> glitch<00:04:08.129> it<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:09.030> fun<00:04:09.269> it's

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
but I like this glitch it it's fun it's

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.640 
but I like this glitch it it's fun it's
a<00:04:09.510> lot<00:04:09.599> more<00:04:09.660> difficult<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.200> do<00:04:10.379> than<00:04:10.530> the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
a lot more difficult to do than the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.130 
a lot more difficult to do than the
other<00:04:10.800> glitches<00:04:11.010> that's<00:04:11.310> for<00:04:11.489> sure<00:04:11.900> but<00:04:12.900> uh

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140
