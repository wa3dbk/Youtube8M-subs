now<00:00:05.560> over<00:00:05.770> here<00:00:06.149> this<00:00:07.149> is<00:00:07.210> a<00:00:07.359> sample<00:00:08.370> a

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
now over here this is a sample a

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.299 
now over here this is a sample a
reference<00:00:10.090> design<00:00:10.450> for<00:00:10.900> mobile<00:00:11.500> an<00:00:11.799> ITX

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
reference design for mobile an ITX

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.730 
reference design for mobile an ITX
system<00:00:13.740> so<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.849> should<00:00:16.090> be<00:00:16.330> for<00:00:16.840> a<00:00:17.259> kind<00:00:17.680> of

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
system so this should be for a kind of

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.830 
system so this should be for a kind of
smartphone<00:00:18.279> what<00:00:18.849> should<00:00:19.000> it<00:00:19.090> be<00:00:19.119> or<00:00:19.420> smaller

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
smartphone what should it be or smaller

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.460 
smartphone what should it be or smaller
UMPC<00:00:20.970> mundo<00:00:21.970> and<00:00:22.470> iPhone<00:00:23.470> type<00:00:23.849> okay<00:00:24.849> so<00:00:25.660> but

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
UMPC mundo and iPhone type okay so but

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.620 
UMPC mundo and iPhone type okay so but
over<00:00:26.770> here<00:00:27.220> we<00:00:27.430> are<00:00:28.390> talking<00:00:28.720> about<00:00:29.140> our<00:00:29.680> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
over here we are talking about our a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.670 
over here we are talking about our a
platform<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.890> is<00:00:33.570> smaller<00:00:34.570> than<00:00:34.780> everything

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
platform that is smaller than everything

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.660 
platform that is smaller than everything
that<00:00:36.219> you<00:00:36.370> can<00:00:36.580> imagine<00:00:37.030> so<00:00:37.210> far<00:00:38.430> because<00:00:39.430> here

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
that you can imagine so far because here

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:47.070 
that you can imagine so far because here
we<00:00:39.760> go<00:00:41.220> that's<00:00:42.220> mobile<00:00:42.520> ITX<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.980> it's<00:00:45.190> a<00:00:45.400> CX<00:00:46.240> 700

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
we go that's mobile ITX so it's a CX 700

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.810 
we go that's mobile ITX so it's a CX 700
chipset<00:00:49.020> my<00:00:50.020> business<00:00:50.470> phone<00:00:50.710> now<00:00:51.250> look<00:00:51.640> at

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
chipset my business phone now look at

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.569 
chipset my business phone now look at
this<00:00:52.000> look<00:00:52.930> at<00:00:53.410> this<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:55.390> this<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:56.620> more<00:00:57.370> than

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
this look at this so this is more than

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.670 
this look at this so this is more than
busy<00:00:57.820> stuff

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
busy stuff

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.220 
busy stuff
this<00:01:00.280> is<00:01:00.400> a<00:01:00.430> new<00:01:00.670> swamp<00:01:01.450> vector<00:01:01.930> for

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
this is a new swamp vector for

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.900 
this is a new swamp vector for
mainboards<00:01:02.800> and<00:01:02.980> I'm<00:01:03.040> holding<00:01:03.250> in<00:01:03.490> my<00:01:03.520> hand

so<00:01:23.650> for<00:01:23.950> eating<00:01:24.310> your<00:01:24.460> be<00:01:24.670> 3.5<00:01:25.090> wide<00:01:25.690> but<00:01:26.350> for

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
so for eating your be 3.5 wide but for

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.250 
so for eating your be 3.5 wide but for
this<00:01:27.369> one<00:01:27.550> is<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:27.820> four<00:01:28.180> hundred<00:01:28.479> meters<00:01:28.600> one

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
this one is a four hundred meters one

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.240 
this one is a four hundred meters one
one<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.520> imagine<00:01:31.060> this<00:01:31.240> this<00:01:31.720> is<00:01:31.930> our<00:01:32.250> this

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
one so imagine this this is our this

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.240 
one so imagine this this is our this
smaller<00:01:34.530> than<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.560> business<00:01:36.009> card<00:01:36.310> layout<00:01:38.250> if

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
smaller than a business card layout if

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.580 
smaller than a business card layout if
it's<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.180> it's<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.750> full<00:01:40.930> PC<00:01:41.410> platform<00:01:43.229> with<00:01:44.229> a<00:01:44.259> CX

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
it's a it's a full PC platform with a CX

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.680 
it's a it's a full PC platform with a CX
700<00:01:45.250> chipset<00:01:45.670> which<00:01:45.850> is<00:01:46.000> offering<00:01:46.360> new

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
700 chipset which is offering new

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.420 
700 chipset which is offering new
hardware<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.350> pictu<00:01:47.800> and<00:01:47.979> ambach<00:01:48.220> for

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
hardware and pictu and ambach for

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.960 
hardware and pictu and ambach for
acceleration<00:01:49.050> right<00:01:50.050> and<00:01:50.440> I<00:01:51.160> guess<00:01:51.490> even<00:01:51.640> a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
acceleration right and I guess even a

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.410 
acceleration right and I guess even a
Windows<00:01:52.330> Media<00:01:52.450> File<00:01:53.040> yeah<00:01:54.070> they<00:01:54.550> mean<00:01:55.200> so

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
Windows Media File yeah they mean so

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.840 
Windows Media File yeah they mean so
this<00:01:58.420> is<00:01:58.630> definitely<00:01:58.899> the<00:01:59.590> future<00:01:59.850> smartphone

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
this is definitely the future smartphone

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.440 
this is definitely the future smartphone
that<00:02:01.300> I'm<00:02:01.450> holding<00:02:01.660> in<00:02:01.960> my<00:02:01.990> hand<00:02:02.350> over<00:02:02.710> here

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
that I'm holding in my hand over here

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.720 
that I'm holding in my hand over here
very<00:02:04.450> nice
