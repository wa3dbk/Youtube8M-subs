Hi Cruisers.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.110
Today we've got a simple slideshow of food
from the Carnival Imagination, and to shake

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.190
things up a little, I’ve got my husband
to help out with some of the narration.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.090
We’ll start with (let’s do this thing!)
… a look at the American Table dinner in

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.090
the main dining room.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.370
There’s a bottle of wine.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:28.450
Thank you honey, From delicious appetizers,
(ah, got some hash browns here) like crab

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:35.890
cakes (those are crab cakes), (onion rings
… nice) calamari with dipping sauce, and

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.190
our nightly favorite, shrimp cocktail, there’s
lots to choose from with starters like (fancy

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.030
taco) … like a quesadilla, pear flatbread,
(wait, what is that?

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.320
Pudding?) chilled and hot soups, and (don’t
know what that is) salads that rotate nightly.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.059
Ya, know what, I’ve got this honey.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.400
Are you sure?

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.970
Yes, I’ve got it.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.170
Thank you honey.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.390
Moving on, how about a grilled romaine salad
with a parmesan crisp.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.500
And now for the entrees, like grilled salmon
on the everyday favorites menu, seafood pasta,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:25.330
miso salmon served with a rice cake, chateaubriand,
and my favorite, lobster tail and grilled

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.860
shrimp.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:36.560
How about cheesy lasagna, another cut of salmon,
and an Asian inspired soup.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.549
Of course, you’ll find a great selection
of food for kids like chicken nuggets and

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.659
mac and cheese.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:55.759
Now for the good stuff…dessert….how about
carrot cake with cinnamon ice cream, or a

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.049
warm date and fig pudding with passion fruit
custard poured over the top.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:18.360
And some of carnival’s classics- warm chocolate
melting cake, fruit salad, apple pie, crème

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.450
brulee and cheesecake.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.690
Seaday brunch on Imagination is served during
the breakfast and lunch hours and offers tons

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.260
of comfort food from a warm basket of breads
and pastries, fluffy pancakes and a bacon

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.750
topped ceasar salad.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:51.800
We always order the huevos rancheros and you
won’t want to miss the dessert here.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.380
If you prefer to have breakfast on the pool
deck, the omelets bar is amazing.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.550
Chefs load your omelets with fresh veggies,
meats and cheeses and will even make one with

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.150
egg whites or egg beaters on request.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.400
Also on the Lido Deck, the Horizon buffet
area offers typical salad bar, hot food and

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.900
deli options.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:31.959
The menu changes daily, and so does the theme.

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:46.849
Italian, Caribbean and American cuisine is
common.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:56.819
You’ll find lots of variety and daily vegetarian
and heart-healthy options to choose from.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:04.739
If you’ve saved room for dessert, the Horizon
buffet has a great array of indulgences from

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:17.299
pastries to cheesecake, cookies, panna cotta
and fancy cakes.

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.780
That's it for this episode!

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.770
Until next time, we'll see you on the high
seas!

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.669

Oh man, those onion rings look good.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.159
Honey, those aren’t…you know what, you’re
right, they do look good.
