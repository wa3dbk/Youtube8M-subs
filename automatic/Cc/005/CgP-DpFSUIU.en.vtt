00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.269
 Tell me guys, what's up? 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.080
 For you one more tip this time I'm going 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.850
 teach you how to save battery 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.090
 and one day I think it helps a lot 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.980
 in the sound reproduction good guys are 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.119
 a simple thing many already know 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.689
 few use and many know how to use more 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.149
 not in a way that could improve 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.700
 Let's go through the battery life, and I 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.590
 I'm using this method - report a 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.690
 excellent battery everything for college 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.920
 after work comes home yet 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 with 30 40 percent quiet battery 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.410
 It should also be remembered that this type of 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.809
 method does not work for everyone 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.170
 works for those who are exactly good at 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.289
 true it works so if you like 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.480
 just stare at the chalk pi and 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.559
 play and do other things 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.030
 excellent but if you are very vibrated 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.010
 facebook likes to know all 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.250
 facebook notifications in real time eu 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.850
 I do not think it's an advantage for you. 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.900
 but I will explain why this method is 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.439
 very simple 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.409
 you will see in all configurations 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.409
 will go down here until battery saving 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:35.340
 peraÃ­ that is a little swayed here 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:38.729
 battery saving and you will so goes 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.650
 put here always only that you come that 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.649
 you'll probably be disabled 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.210
 when the battery is below 20% 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.810
 you will make you go putting 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.040
 always because this is good for a long time in 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.380
 windows phone I noticed that when 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.960
 reached 20% the battery had lingered too long 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.460
 more to download just because 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.219
 it entered this economy mode. 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.950
 battery and then he let receive 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.840
 notifications and such 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.640
 only that I searched there wanted the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.469
 battery for a little longer and such 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.539
 because I arrive late from college and 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.810
 usually at the end of class is already 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.540
 Dying I need the cell phone, right? 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.129
 Only I can not use this economy. 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.260
 all day because if not I 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.480
 I do not receive notifications of detachment 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.849
 facebook instagram or nothing 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.190
 so I checked it out here you 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.470
 drag on one side here in use 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.069
 you come here click here in the first 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.150
 line 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.010
 it wants to show all apps 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.370
 which can be run in seconds 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.099
 So far plan whatsapp internet 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.440
 facebook music instagram my smartphone 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:45.810
 maito be cortana among others 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.569
 so what I need is 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.610
 only zap facebook notifications 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.069
 of instagram the eye when I enter 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.930
 so not much with not much 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.000
 so what are you going to do? 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.670
 here in my case the probable team of 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.150
 you also come here the detachment and 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.310
 you will mark this option here where 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.190
 enable this application 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.840
 to run in the background even 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.870
 when battery power is low. 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.690
 on or whatsapp will work 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.209
 will receive independent notification if 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.920
 is battery-saving or not 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.260
 which for me was excellent because besides 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.790
 to save battery all day I 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.920
 could receive all notifications 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.989
 of the real-time challenge did not arrive 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.909
 with delays you get to fine and not 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.200
 I have to complain 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.840
 for me whatsapp only went 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.360
 sufficient to meet the needs of 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.849
 but if you want another application 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.590
 you will look for it here for example the 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.640
 facebook you want to receive notifications 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.330
 facebook you come here brand 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.090
 but facebook it consumes a battery 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.100
 We have to remember this so I 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.150
 particularly since the deactivation of the 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.760
 Facebook 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.860
 I do not like it that much , but if you want 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.870
 seeing notifications costs nothing 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.360
 to score there will spend a little more 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.950
 battery but not as much as if all the 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.800
 apps were running second in 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.300
 second plan 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.100
 also remember that the brightness of the screen 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.950
 it gets a little weaker 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.270
 only if you leave automatic if you have 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.370
 not clear he 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.930
 it increases the brightness of the screen even 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.840
 fashionable battery saving battery because stay 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:25.100
 clear if it stayed until the neck did not 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:28.130
 arrives nothing obvious type also have to 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.200
 other right TV applications that will enable 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.600
 the notification in my case I just want the 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.620
 and then you choose what you 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.450
 I want to have many apps sometimes 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.230
 games that runs in the background when the 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.120
 cell phone is working normal what poxa 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.440
 with your battery even challenged you 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.790
 closing application sometimes it 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.460
 still receiving the notification is 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.900
 because it is running in the background 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.720
 so I think this economy method 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.760
 enough battery I liked I I 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.169
 I discovered this method so I already 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.220
 I knew my battery but I did not 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:04.160
 used it that way but it was in the week 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.660
 with 30% of potatoes 35 without 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.340
 battery at work had to go to the 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.900
 college still needed urgent 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.360
 then I put it in the 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.770
 battery saving and then all the time 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.540
 I was looking to use it to see if it arrived. 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.100
 any news whatsoever such a message 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.110
 so I found out I left work 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.300
 I arrived in college this took more or 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.060
 less a couple of hours 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.010
 it's not an hour and a half to get out 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.560
 I'm going to college to go to college using 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.020
 Matzah for 3g on the bus arrived in 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.850
 college that night God zap use 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.930
 some application tools that use 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:42.860
 in the faculty of calculations and I got 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.440
 to get home with 27% battery or 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.520
 Either I left work around 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.340
 half past five 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.210
 I got to college seven hours, I left 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.700
 96 college comes home from hours with 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.320
 27% of battery life I spent less than 10% of 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.450
 all the time. 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.450
 because of the battery saving mode 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.520
 For me it was excellent 5 but it is worth it 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.320
 also emphasize that on that day it was not 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.590
 using zap art allowed in second 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.330
 plan that saves more battery life yet 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.550
 only I think even using in 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.170
 the background remains so save 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.090
 pretty battery 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.310
 Good, I already showed you that I had 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.990
 what to show to save battery 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.690
 I will also show you a tip that 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.150
 greatly improves the quality of audio people 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.870
 I did not know that and I found 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.540
 excellent is the way the digital I 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.070
 I looked at the sites there in the settings 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.990
 technical data of the device via which you 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.550
 had digital but had never 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.420
 perceived nothing much 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.250
 I spent a week using a sonic psgq 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.260
 and its audio quality is excellent 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:48.140
 when I came back through my feels one 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.390
 deficit if a little less than quality in the 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.400
 audio so I went to search about 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.880
 digital city and I discovered it here in 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.830
 mute audio on an equalizer if 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:02.060
 you want to increase the equalizer 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:06.080
 normal, he looks like this if you want 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.580
 increase you personalized boot and under 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.100
 all the bars I did here that 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.710
 it increases a little more volume without 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.960
 lose a lot of quality but the secret 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.150
 even here you really a little phone 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.410
 if you want the speaker but also 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.700
 The secret is right here on the side and 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.040
 improvements 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.620
 Wow that dolby audio leveling 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.960
 and is improved and enhanced dialogue 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:30.140
 dalby caramba the people the sound stay in 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.330
 excellent these two options was him 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.950
 comes standard unchecked 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.390
 I caught select both and I was listening 

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.240
 my headphone 

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.460
 our people got excellent quality 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.980
 Old instruments are old 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:47.660
 shiver that your song was full hd 

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:49.700
 it's also very good people say that 

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.160
 I have it for you, I hope it helps. 

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:56.380
 I hope you like it and that's it 

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.380
 liked the one until the next
