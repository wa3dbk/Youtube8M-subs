conditioning<00:01:44.689> and<00:01:44.869> tactical<00:01:45.409> mask<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:45.920> that

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
conditioning and tactical mask so that

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.429 
conditioning and tactical mask so that
of<00:01:46.159> course<00:01:46.310> is<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.640> perk<00:01:46.850> 3<00:01:47.180> greed<00:01:47.509> wildcard

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
of course is the perk 3 greed wildcard

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.060 
of course is the perk 3 greed wildcard
and<00:01:49.100> that<00:01:49.250> lethal<00:01:49.670> as<00:01:49.909> a<00:01:50.030> c4<00:01:50.689> we<00:01:51.140> also<00:01:51.289> have<00:01:51.469> the

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
and that lethal as a c4 we also have the

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.219 
and that lethal as a c4 we also have the
secretary<00:01:52.490> gunfighter<00:01:52.880> wildcard<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:54.020> allow

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
secretary gunfighter wildcard to allow

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.410 
secretary gunfighter wildcard to allow
us<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.409> have<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:55.009> two<00:01:55.549> attachments<00:01:56.119> which<00:01:56.240> is

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
us to have the two attachments which is

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.719 
us to have the two attachments which is
necessary<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:57.200> on<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.680> executioner<00:01:58.369> for

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
necessary that on the executioner for

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.219 
necessary that on the executioner for
the<00:01:58.789> executioner<00:01:59.359> basically<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.020> on<00:02:00.140> the

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
the executioner basically so on the

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.289 
the executioner basically so on the
execution<00:02:00.770> of<00:02:00.859> course<00:02:01.369> got<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.789> long<00:02:02.000> barrel

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
execution of course got the long barrel

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.690 
execution of course got the long barrel
attachment<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:03.079> the<00:02:03.289> fast<00:02:03.590> mags<00:02:03.859> attachment

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
attachment and the fast mags attachment

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.090 
attachment and the fast mags attachment
now<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.719> reason<00:02:05.869> behind<00:02:06.079> user<00:02:06.439> long<00:02:06.770> barrel

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
now the reason behind user long barrel

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.160 
now the reason behind user long barrel
was<00:02:07.250> because<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.909> is<00:02:08.210> pretty<00:02:08.450> much<00:02:08.630> a<00:02:08.690> magnum

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
was because it is pretty much a magnum

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.960 
was because it is pretty much a magnum
it<00:02:09.289> fires<00:02:09.560> shotgun<00:02:10.130> shells<00:02:10.369> or<00:02:10.610> shotgun

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
it fires shotgun shells or shotgun

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.630 
it fires shotgun shells or shotgun
pellets<00:02:11.330> i<00:02:11.450> believe<00:02:11.720> so<00:02:12.710> they<00:02:12.860> don't<00:02:13.370> shoot

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
pellets i believe so they don't shoot

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.150 
pellets i believe so they don't shoot
very<00:02:13.880> far<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.480> if<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.350> do<00:02:15.470> kind<00:02:15.710> of<00:02:15.740> Miss<00:02:15.800> one

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
very far and if you do kind of Miss one

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.580 
very far and if you do kind of Miss one
or<00:02:16.280> two<00:02:16.400> shots<00:02:16.760> from<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.630> long<00:02:17.780> distance<00:02:17.990> you're

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
or two shots from a long distance you're

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.750 
or two shots from a long distance you're
probably<00:02:18.800> going<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.070> lose<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.370> gun<00:02:19.520> fight

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
probably going to lose the gun fight

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.430 
probably going to lose the gun fight
because<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.210> takes<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.480> while<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.870> reload<00:02:21.200> like

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
because it takes a while to reload like

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.680 
because it takes a while to reload like
two<00:02:21.620> seconds<00:02:22.010> or<00:02:22.130> so<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:23.210> long<00:02:23.390> barrel

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
two seconds or so and the long barrel

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.030 
two seconds or so and the long barrel
definitely<00:02:24.110> did<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.350> job<00:02:24.650> at<00:02:24.770> how

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
definitely did this job at how

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.490 
definitely did this job at how
meow<00:02:25.159> an<00:02:25.370> absolute<00:02:25.879> term<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:26.989> long<00:02:27.140> barrel<00:02:27.409> is

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
meow an absolute term so long barrel is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.899 
meow an absolute term so long barrel is
definitely<00:02:27.829> attachment<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.370> have<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.670> use

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
definitely attachment you have to use

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.119 
definitely attachment you have to use
and<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.659> course<00:02:29.870> fast<00:02:30.230> mags<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.769> wasn't

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
and of course fast mags I wasn't

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.679 
and of course fast mags I wasn't
actually<00:02:31.189> using<00:02:31.670> in<00:02:31.790> yesterday's<00:02:32.239> black<00:02:32.510> ops

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
actually using in yesterday's black ops

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.199 
actually using in yesterday's black ops
2<00:02:32.840> live<00:02:33.079> episode<00:02:33.620> however<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.489> really<00:02:34.939> really

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
2 live episode however I really really

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.940 
2 live episode however I really really
wish<00:02:35.359> i<00:02:35.510> was<00:02:35.780> i<00:02:35.810> don't<00:02:36.230> think<00:02:36.439> i<00:02:36.530> had<00:02:36.620> actually

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
wish i was i don't think i had actually

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.530 
wish i was i don't think i had actually
unlocked<00:02:37.819> at<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.090> time<00:02:38.299> that<00:02:38.420> i<00:02:38.510> was

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
unlocked at the time that i was

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.839 
unlocked at the time that i was
recording<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.260> but<00:02:39.530> directly<00:02:40.340> after<00:02:40.730> that

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
recording that but directly after that

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.940 
recording that but directly after that
game<00:02:41.090> i<00:02:41.120> think<00:02:41.269> i<00:02:41.720> actually<00:02:41.989> unlocked<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.739> so

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
game i think i actually unlocked it so

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.830 
game i think i actually unlocked it so
that's<00:02:43.129> pretty<00:02:43.280> useful<00:02:43.549> i<00:02:43.939> can<00:02:44.420> go<00:02:44.510> ahead<00:02:44.540> and

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
that's pretty useful i can go ahead and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.559 
that's pretty useful i can go ahead and
you<00:02:45.409> know<00:02:45.530> use<00:02:45.739> that<00:02:45.920> now<00:02:46.129> and<00:02:46.400> basically<00:02:47.239> the

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
you know use that now and basically the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.809 
you know use that now and basically the
time<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.900> took<00:02:48.079> to<00:02:48.140> take<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:49.099> reload<00:02:49.430> one

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
time it took to take to reload one

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.240 
time it took to take to reload one
shotgun<00:02:50.239> shell<00:02:50.629> it<00:02:50.840> now<00:02:51.230> reloads<00:02:51.680> all<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.099> them

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
shotgun shell it now reloads all of them

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.250 
shotgun shell it now reloads all of them
so<00:02:52.639> it's<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:52.939> much<00:02:53.120> quicker<00:02:53.329> at<00:02:53.540> least<00:02:53.659> pretty

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
so it's so much quicker at least pretty

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.990 
so it's so much quicker at least pretty
much<00:02:54.349> reloads<00:02:54.709> five<00:02:55.010> bullets<00:02:55.370> at<00:02:55.519> once<00:02:55.790> which

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
much reloads five bullets at once which

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.509 
much reloads five bullets at once which
is<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:56.840> useful<00:02:57.349> it's<00:02:57.799> insane<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.430> know

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
is so so useful it's insane you know

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.520 
is so so useful it's insane you know
especially<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:59.689> know<00:02:59.840> it's<00:02:59.989> not<00:03:00.049> quite<00:03:00.260> quick

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
especially you know it's not quite quick

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.250 
especially you know it's not quite quick
enough<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:01.040> fi<00:03:01.970> rule<00:03:02.180> 5<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.870> then<00:03:02.959> quickly

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
enough to fi rule 5 and then quickly

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.199 
enough to fi rule 5 and then quickly
reload<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.859> try<00:03:03.919> and<00:03:04.129> fire<00:03:04.340> another<00:03:04.549> five<00:03:05.000> if

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
reload and try and fire another five if

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.420 
reload and try and fire another five if
you<00:03:05.239> like<00:03:05.480> hit<00:03:05.900> Martha<00:03:06.260> someone<00:03:06.560> but<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.340> is

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
you like hit Martha someone but it is

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.159 
you like hit Martha someone but it is
useful<00:03:07.849> if<00:03:07.939> you<00:03:08.060> read<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:08.329> know<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:08.510> can<00:03:08.989> see

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.169 
useful if you read you know you can see

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:10.149 
useful if you read you know you can see
most<00:03:09.319> their<00:03:09.530> team<00:03:09.680> or<00:03:09.859> something<00:03:10.040> like<00:03:10.099> that

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
most their team or something like that

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.770 
most their team or something like that
if<00:03:10.400> you're<00:03:10.819> in<00:03:10.909> a<00:03:11.000> very<00:03:11.209> close<00:03:11.480> quarter

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
if you're in a very close quarter

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.210 
if you're in a very close quarter
situation<00:03:12.349> and<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:12.530> can<00:03:12.620> get<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:12.829> kind<00:03:13.069> of

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
situation and you can get that kind of

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.550 
situation and you can get that kind of
cover<00:03:14.209> which<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.569> very<00:03:14.750> very<00:03:14.870> useful<00:03:15.109> so

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
cover which is very very useful so

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.080 
cover which is very very useful so
that's<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.370> reasoning<00:03:16.730> behind<00:03:16.790> the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
that's the reasoning behind the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.089 
that's the reasoning behind the
attachment<00:03:17.659> now<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.049> perks<00:03:18.439> are<00:03:18.769> really

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
attachment now the perks are really

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.649 
attachment now the perks are really
where<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.310> kind<00:03:19.639> of<00:03:19.790> starts<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.269> get<00:03:20.389> a<00:03:20.450> bit

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
where it kind of starts to get a bit

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.929 
where it kind of starts to get a bit
more<00:03:20.840> interesting<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:21.829> of<00:03:21.919> course<00:03:22.129> for<00:03:22.340> perk<00:03:22.579> 1

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:22.939 
more interesting so of course for perk 1

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.119 
more interesting so of course for perk 1
we<00:03:23.450> have<00:03:23.480> lightweight<00:03:23.959> that's<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.859> fairly

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
we have lightweight that's a fairly

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.220 
we have lightweight that's a fairly
obvious<00:03:25.489> reason<00:03:26.000> because<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.840> know<00:03:26.959> if<00:03:27.109> you

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
obvious reason because you know if you

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.409 
obvious reason because you know if you
are<00:03:27.379> using<00:03:27.739> a<00:03:28.159> pistol<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.939> you<00:03:29.090> don't<00:03:29.239> have

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
are using a pistol and you don't have

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.869 
are using a pistol and you don't have
the<00:03:29.540> primary<00:03:30.079> gun<00:03:30.229> or<00:03:30.349> anything<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:31.010> decent

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
the primary gun or anything a decent

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.030 
the primary gun or anything a decent
across<00:03:32.180> map<00:03:32.419> or<00:03:32.629> long-range<00:03:32.840> gun<00:03:33.409> you<00:03:33.859> want<00:03:33.979> to

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
across map or long-range gun you want to

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.589 
across map or long-range gun you want to
be<00:03:34.099> able<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.370> get<00:03:34.489> out<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:34.790> enemy's<00:03:35.120> fire<00:03:35.389> and

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
be able to get out the enemy's fire and

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.149 
be able to get out the enemy's fire and
also<00:03:35.810> run<00:03:36.019> around<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.440> map<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.829> get<00:03:36.979> those

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
also run around the map to get those

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.339 
also run around the map to get those
close<00:03:37.400> range<00:03:37.669> kills<00:03:37.970> as<00:03:38.209> quickly<00:03:38.840> as<00:03:39.019> you<00:03:39.169> can

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
close range kills as quickly as you can

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:40.599 
close range kills as quickly as you can
so<00:03:39.620> that's<00:03:39.919> the<00:03:40.010> main<00:03:40.190> reason<00:03:40.220> behind

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
so that's the main reason behind

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.800 
so that's the main reason behind
lightweight<00:03:41.440> /<00:03:42.440> 2<00:03:42.889> was<00:03:43.159> scavenger<00:03:43.849> now<00:03:44.090> this

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
lightweight / 2 was scavenger now this

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.899 
lightweight / 2 was scavenger now this
is<00:03:45.019> definitely<00:03:45.620> needed<00:03:45.979> on<00:03:46.069> executioner<00:03:46.790> you

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
is definitely needed on executioner you

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.819 
is definitely needed on executioner you
literally<00:03:47.180> start<00:03:47.569> with<00:03:47.720> like<00:03:47.870> 20<00:03:48.199> bullets<00:03:48.590> I

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
literally start with like 20 bullets I

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.890 
literally start with like 20 bullets I
think<00:03:49.069> and<00:03:49.449> if<00:03:50.449> you<00:03:50.540> don't<00:03:50.750> obviously

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
think and if you don't obviously

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.030 
think and if you don't obviously
resupply<00:03:51.680> then<00:03:52.220> that's<00:03:52.489> pretty<00:03:52.760> much<00:03:53.000> like

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
resupply then that's pretty much like

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.259 
resupply then that's pretty much like
six<00:03:55.040> or<00:03:55.190> seven<00:03:55.370> kills<00:03:55.729> you<00:03:55.909> that's<00:03:56.060> not<00:03:56.120> only

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
six or seven kills you that's not only

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.030 
six or seven kills you that's not only
enough<00:03:56.629> to<00:03:56.810> get<00:03:56.989> any<00:03:57.109> decent<00:03:57.349> kind<00:03:57.739> of<00:03:57.799> kill

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
enough to get any decent kind of kill

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.890 
enough to get any decent kind of kill
streak<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.699> of<00:03:58.940> course<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.180> can<00:03:59.359> be<00:03:59.419> reloaded

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
streak and of course you can be reloaded

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.930 
streak and of course you can be reloaded
in<00:04:00.079> and<00:04:00.349> you<00:04:01.159> won't<00:04:01.340> go<00:04:01.400> out<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.579> use<00:04:01.699> your

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
in and you won't go out to use your

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.550 
in and you won't go out to use your
concussion<00:04:02.629> grenades<00:04:03.109> or<00:04:03.229> your<00:04:03.379> lethal

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
concussion grenades or your lethal

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.379 
concussion grenades or your lethal
grenades<00:04:03.859> and<00:04:04.280> resupply<00:04:04.699> those<00:04:04.970> because

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
grenades and resupply those because

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.599 
grenades and resupply those because
those<00:04:05.479> are<00:04:05.690> definitely<00:04:05.989> necessary<00:04:06.489> when<00:04:07.489> you

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
those are definitely necessary when you

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.670 
those are definitely necessary when you
are<00:04:07.790> obviously<00:04:08.419> using<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:09.049> pistol<00:04:09.290> or<00:04:09.560> the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
are obviously using a pistol or the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.429 
are obviously using a pistol or the
executioner<00:04:10.310> yeah<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:11.449> that's<00:04:12.109> a<00:04:12.169> reason

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 
executioner yeah so that's a reason

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.280 
executioner yeah so that's a reason
behind<00:04:12.560> scavenger<00:04:13.340> now<00:04:13.879> /<00:04:14.150> 3<00:04:14.689> we<00:04:14.989> have<00:04:15.169> the

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
behind scavenger now / 3 we have the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.949 
behind scavenger now / 3 we have the
perk<00:04:15.560> 3<00:04:15.949> greed<00:04:16.280> or<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.849> perp<00:04:17.060> free<00:04:17.329> wild<00:04:17.720> card

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
perk 3 greed or the perp free wild card

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.770 
perk 3 greed or the perp free wild card
which<00:04:18.769> is<00:04:18.889> good<00:04:19.039> periphery<00:04:19.370> greed<00:04:19.609> and<00:04:19.820> that

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
which is good periphery greed and that

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.810 
which is good periphery greed and that
was<00:04:20.930> very<00:04:20.989> useful<00:04:21.380> because<00:04:21.590> I<00:04:22.220> have<00:04:22.460> extreme

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
was very useful because I have extreme

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.670 
was very useful because I have extreme
conditioning<00:04:23.360> which<00:04:23.539> is<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.870> main<00:04:24.169> reason

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
conditioning which is the main reason

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.770 
conditioning which is the main reason
behind<00:04:25.430> lightweight<00:04:26.150> as<00:04:26.300> well<00:04:26.509> we<00:04:26.599> know<00:04:26.750> that

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
behind lightweight as well we know that

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.330 
behind lightweight as well we know that
they're<00:04:27.199> the<00:04:27.259> same<00:04:27.409> kind<00:04:27.680> of<00:04:27.740> thing<00:04:27.979> except

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
they're the same kind of thing except

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.129 
they're the same kind of thing except
from<00:04:28.430> you<00:04:28.550> can<00:04:28.669> run<00:04:28.849> a<00:04:28.880> bit<00:04:29.060> quicker<00:04:29.300> in<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:30.020> bit

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
from you can run a bit quicker in a bit

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.920 
from you can run a bit quicker in a bit
further<00:04:30.349> sorry<00:04:30.940> but<00:04:31.940> we<00:04:32.090> also<00:04:32.270> have<00:04:32.509> tactical

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
further sorry but we also have tactical

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.469 
further sorry but we also have tactical
mask<00:04:33.320> now<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:34.310> know<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:34.460> always<00:04:34.729> use<00:04:34.969> tactical

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
mask now you know I always use tactical

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:36.790 
mask now you know I always use tactical
mask<00:04:35.690> but<00:04:35.960> if<00:04:36.050> you're<00:04:36.200> not<00:04:36.289> wanting<00:04:36.560> to<00:04:36.590> use

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
mask but if you're not wanting to use

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.990 
mask but if you're not wanting to use
tactical<00:04:37.250> mask<00:04:37.430> because<00:04:37.610> you<00:04:37.760> don't

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
tactical mask because you don't

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.210 
tactical mask because you don't
it's<00:04:38.210> necessary<00:04:38.420> then<00:04:39.380> dexterity<00:04:40.070> is

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
it's necessary then dexterity is

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.090 
it's necessary then dexterity is
definitely<00:04:40.730> a<00:04:40.790> good<00:04:41.510> thing<00:04:41.810> to<00:04:42.620> use<00:04:42.650> because

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
definitely a good thing to use because

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.400 
definitely a good thing to use because
obviously<00:04:44.030> can<00:04:44.390> jump<00:04:44.660> up<00:04:44.810> stuff<00:04:45.050> quickly<00:04:45.260> you

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
obviously can jump up stuff quickly you

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.870 
obviously can jump up stuff quickly you
can<00:04:45.530> get<00:04:45.650> out<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.920> line<00:04:46.100> of<00:04:46.280> sight<00:04:46.550> and<00:04:46.760> out

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
can get out the line of sight and out

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.660 
can get out the line of sight and out
the<00:04:47.120> out<00:04:47.570> the<00:04:47.840> way<00:04:47.960> of<00:04:48.170> enemies<00:04:48.710> firing<00:04:49.220> and

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
the out the way of enemies firing and

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.490 
the out the way of enemies firing and
stuff<00:04:49.880> at<00:04:50.000> that<00:04:50.180> so<00:04:50.360> that's<00:04:50.480> definitely<00:04:50.750> a

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
stuff at that so that's definitely a

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.470 
stuff at that so that's definitely a
very<00:04:51.800> useful<00:04:52.190> thing<00:04:52.400> to<00:04:52.550> use<00:04:52.880> if<00:04:53.120> you<00:04:53.240> aren't

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
very useful thing to use if you aren't

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.080 
very useful thing to use if you aren't
wanting<00:04:53.780> to<00:04:53.900> use<00:04:54.020> tactical<00:04:54.440> mask<00:04:54.910> and<00:04:55.910> of

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
wanting to use tactical mask and of

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.540 
wanting to use tactical mask and of
course<00:04:56.300> for<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:56.600> lethal<00:04:56.990> grade<00:04:57.230> we<00:04:57.440> have<00:04:57.620> a<00:04:57.830> c4

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
course for the lethal grade we have a c4

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.580 
course for the lethal grade we have a c4
we<00:04:59.360> don't<00:04:59.510> have<00:04:59.600> any<00:04:59.720> concussion<00:05:00.080> grenades

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
we don't have any concussion grenades

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.920 
we don't have any concussion grenades
although<00:05:01.190> those<00:05:01.520> are<00:05:01.580> probably<00:05:02.180> very<00:05:02.240> useful

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
although those are probably very useful

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.140 
although those are probably very useful
so<00:05:03.080> if<00:05:03.140> you<00:05:03.260> are<00:05:03.380> wanting<00:05:03.560> to<00:05:03.770> maybe<00:05:04.040> take<00:05:04.940> off

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
so if you are wanting to maybe take off

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.940 
so if you are wanting to maybe take off
the<00:05:05.240> perp<00:05:05.450> three<00:05:05.750> wild<00:05:06.110> card<00:05:06.350> or<00:05:06.560> maybe<00:05:06.710> only

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
the perp three wild card or maybe only

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.890 
the perp three wild card or maybe only
have<00:05:07.160> one<00:05:07.340> attachment<00:05:07.700> and<00:05:08.360> then<00:05:08.630> definitely

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
have one attachment and then definitely

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.050 
have one attachment and then definitely
stick<00:05:09.230> on<00:05:09.380> a<00:05:09.410> few<00:05:09.770> concussion<00:05:10.610> grenades<00:05:10.910> or

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
stick on a few concussion grenades or

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.480 
stick on a few concussion grenades or
EMP<00:05:11.270> grenades<00:05:11.810> because<00:05:12.770> those<00:05:12.950> are<00:05:13.070> also<00:05:13.190> very

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
EMP grenades because those are also very

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.180 
EMP grenades because those are also very
useful<00:05:13.550> for<00:05:13.910> slowing<00:05:14.270> down<00:05:14.450> your<00:05:14.630> enemies<00:05:14.750> and

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
useful for slowing down your enemies and

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.140 
useful for slowing down your enemies and
basically<00:05:16.190> not<00:05:16.370> allowing<00:05:16.400> them<00:05:16.730> to<00:05:16.850> run<00:05:17.030> off

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
basically not allowing them to run off

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.090 
basically not allowing them to run off
quite<00:05:17.600> as<00:05:17.720> easy<00:05:18.020> so<00:05:18.260> it's<00:05:18.410> a<00:05:18.470> very<00:05:18.500> fun<00:05:18.890> class

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
quite as easy so it's a very fun class

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.420 
quite as easy so it's a very fun class
to<00:05:19.280> use<00:05:19.490> it<00:05:19.730> does<00:05:20.210> take<00:05:20.419> a<00:05:20.450> lot<00:05:20.720> of<00:05:20.780> I<00:05:21.290> I'd<00:05:22.070> like

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
to use it does take a lot of I I'd like

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.710 
to use it does take a lot of I I'd like
to<00:05:22.550> say<00:05:22.700> skill<00:05:23.030> but<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.300> takes<00:05:23.419> a<00:05:23.570> lot<00:05:23.690> of

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
to say skill but it takes a lot of

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.659 
to say skill but it takes a lot of
getting<00:05:23.930> used<00:05:24.020> two<00:05:24.440> of<00:05:24.650> you<00:05:25.070> know<00:05:25.160> how<00:05:25.340> the<00:05:25.400> gun

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
getting used two of you know how the gun

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.540 
getting used two of you know how the gun
works<00:05:25.700> how<00:05:26.270> far<00:05:26.840> away<00:05:26.990> it<00:05:27.890> takes<00:05:28.040> to<00:05:28.250> kill

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
works how far away it takes to kill

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.010 
works how far away it takes to kill
someone<00:05:28.790> a<00:05:28.880> hat<00:05:29.090> of<00:05:29.120> the<00:05:29.300> distance<00:05:29.810> of<00:05:29.900> each

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
someone a hat of the distance of each

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.870 
someone a hat of the distance of each
bullet<00:05:30.350> and<00:05:30.860> also<00:05:31.070> how<00:05:31.190> many<00:05:31.370> bullets<00:05:31.490> takes

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
bullet and also how many bullets takes

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.610 
bullet and also how many bullets takes
to<00:05:32.030> kill<00:05:32.180> out<00:05:32.360> kind<00:05:32.660> of<00:05:32.690> like<00:05:32.840> a<00:05:32.870> close-range<00:05:33.410> a

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
to kill out kind of like a close-range a

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.860 
to kill out kind of like a close-range a
long-range<00:05:33.980> things<00:05:34.400> like<00:05:34.550> that<00:05:34.730> so<00:05:35.450> it<00:05:35.600> does

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
long-range things like that so it does

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.659 
long-range things like that so it does
take<00:05:36.020> a<00:05:36.050> bit<00:05:36.169> of<00:05:36.230> getting<00:05:36.560> used<00:05:37.130> to<00:05:37.490> but

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
take a bit of getting used to but

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.520 
take a bit of getting used to but
obviously<00:05:37.790> if<00:05:38.150> you<00:05:38.630> stick<00:05:38.900> at<00:05:39.080> it<00:05:39.110> you'll<00:05:39.350> get

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
obviously if you stick at it you'll get

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.380 
obviously if you stick at it you'll get
used<00:05:39.740> to<00:05:39.860> it<00:05:39.919> literally<00:05:40.640> no<00:05:40.790> time<00:05:40.820> I<00:05:41.090> mean<00:05:41.300> I

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390
