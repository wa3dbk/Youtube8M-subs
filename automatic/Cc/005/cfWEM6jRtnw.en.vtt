00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
channel is going to be hard to build a

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.460 
channel is going to be hard to build a
hybrid<00:00:05.790> scoreboard<00:00:06.180> on<00:00:06.390> fifa<00:00:06.750> 14<00:00:06.960> so<00:00:07.319> if<00:00:07.410> you

can<00:00:07.589> smash<00:00:07.890> 35<00:00:08.429> like<00:00:08.700> sins<00:00:08.940> video<00:00:09.090> that<00:00:09.360> would

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
can smash 35 like sins video that would

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.089 
can smash 35 like sins video that would

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
feedback or comment let me know if this

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.839 
feedback or comment let me know if this
video<00:00:13.349> helped<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.980> add<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.519> scrub<00:00:14.730> board

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
video helped you to add a scrub board

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.730 
video helped you to add a scrub board
obviously<00:00:15.210> they've<00:00:15.330> added<00:00:15.599> those<00:00:16.080> new<00:00:16.350> links

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
obviously they've added those new links

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.470 
obviously they've added those new links
and<00:00:16.920> etc<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.580> hybrid<00:00:17.910> squad<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:18.449> a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
and etc in the hybrid squad so it's a

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.540 
and etc in the hybrid squad so it's a
lot<00:00:18.570> harder<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:19.050> build<00:00:19.170> them<00:00:19.410> now<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:20.160> first<00:00:20.430> of

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
lot harder to build them now so first of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.500 
lot harder to build them now so first of
all<00:00:20.609> I'm<00:00:20.730> going<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.970> show<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.240> how<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
all I'm going to show you how the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.390 
all I'm going to show you how the
chemistry<00:00:21.779> styles<00:00:22.439> work<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> first<00:00:23.220> one

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
chemistry styles work so the first one

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.609 
chemistry styles work so the first one
we<00:00:23.550> do<00:00:23.670> have<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.480> super<00:00:24.869> link<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.199> we've

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
we do have is the super link and we've

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.830 
we do have is the super link and we've
got<00:00:25.710> an<00:00:25.800> example<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.430> David<00:00:26.820> Luiz<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.090> Ramirez

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
got an example of David Luiz and Ramirez

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.990 
got an example of David Luiz and Ramirez
who<00:00:28.289> may<00:00:28.470> play<00:00:28.830> play<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> same<00:00:29.519> club<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
who may play play for the same club and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.640 
who may play play for the same club and
nationally<00:00:30.480> which<00:00:30.689> get<00:00:30.929> allows<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.500> two

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
nationally which get allows for two

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.920 
nationally which get allows for two
broken<00:00:31.980> links<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.270> know<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.660> get

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
broken links with you know so you get

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.110 
broken links with you know so you get
one<00:00:34.110> link<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.559> you're<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.700> link<00:00:35.940> you

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
one link and you're with that link you

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.810 
one link and you're with that link you
can<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.420> two<00:00:36.450> broken<00:00:36.899> links<00:00:37.610> now<00:00:38.610> they've

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
can have two broken links now they've

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.580 
can have two broken links now they've
toned<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.270> down<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> bit<00:00:39.719> used<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.110> help<00:00:40.290> tab

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
toned this down a bit used to help tab

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.950 
toned this down a bit used to help tab
in<00:00:40.770> 313<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.910> was<00:00:42.030> allowed<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.540> three

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
in 313 you was allowed to have three

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.779 
in 313 you was allowed to have three
broken<00:00:43.200> links<00:00:43.620> before<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:44.100> broke<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
broken links before it broke the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.760 
broken links before it broke the
chemistry<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.899> now<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.320> only<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.559> two

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
chemistry so now you can only have two

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.139 
chemistry so now you can only have two
so<00:00:46.950> they're<00:00:47.100> making<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> lot<00:00:47.520> more<00:00:47.550> difficult

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
so they're making a lot more difficult

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.850 
so they're making a lot more difficult
to<00:00:48.450> build<00:00:48.600> hardware<00:00:48.930> scrub<00:00:49.350> borders<00:00:49.680> and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
to build hardware scrub borders and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.160 
to build hardware scrub borders and
these<00:00:50.610> are<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> key

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
these are this is one this is the key

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.770 
these are this is one this is the key
one<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> most<00:00:53.129> key<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.879> know<00:00:54.000> links<00:00:54.510> in

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
will out to broken links now going on to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.740 
will out to broken links now going on to
the<00:01:37.590> league<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.009> national<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.759> link<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.150> nation

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the league and national a link on nation

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.899 
the league and national a link on nation
link<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.130> same<00:01:41.340> league<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:41.790> they

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
link and it's the same league but they

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.490 
link and it's the same league but they
play<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> different<00:01:42.689> team<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.320> is

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
play for a different team and this is

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.789 
play for a different team and this is
exactly<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.220> same<00:01:44.430> as<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:45.210> club<00:01:46.110> link<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.560> gives

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
exactly the same as a club link it gives

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.560 
exactly the same as a club link it gives
the<00:01:46.890> same<00:01:47.100> chemistry<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.360> two<00:01:48.540> of

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
the same chemistry so if you get two of

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.810 
the same chemistry so if you get two of
these<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.200> will<00:01:49.470> allow<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.979> two<00:01:50.130> at<00:01:50.340> broken

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
these it will allow for two at broken

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.020 
these it will allow for two at broken
through<00:01:51.420> broken<00:01:51.840> links<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.829> again<00:01:53.820> these<00:01:53.970> are

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
through broken links and again these are

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.219 
through broken links and again these are
ones<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.450> want<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.750> looking<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.200> when

the<00:02:29.910> thief<00:02:30.120> 13<00:02:30.570> but<00:02:30.720> now<00:02:30.870> they've<00:02:31.110> actually

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
the thief 13 but now they've actually

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.650 
the thief 13 but now they've actually
completely<00:02:31.950> destroyed<00:02:32.490> this<00:02:32.700> link<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.570> is

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
completely destroyed this link and it is

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.930 
completely destroyed this link and it is
not<00:02:33.930> useful<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.130> have<00:02:35.220> like<00:02:35.460> four<00:02:35.760> or

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
not useful you can have like four or

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.790 
not useful you can have like four or
five<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.330> these<00:02:36.450> links<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.960> think<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.350> for<00:02:37.590> and

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
five of these links I think it's for and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.860 
five of these links I think it's for and
you<00:02:37.920> still<00:02:38.280> get<00:02:38.520> you'll<00:02:39.120> still<00:02:39.390> get<00:02:39.570> no

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
you still get you'll still get no

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.170 
you still get you'll still get no
chemistry<00:02:40.290> from<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.550> is<00:02:41.730> not<00:02:41.880> really

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
chemistry from it so this is not really

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.150 
chemistry from it so this is not really
a<00:02:42.300> valid<00:02:42.750> link<00:02:43.320> anymore<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:43.920> wouldn't

advise you trying to use the nationality
ink<00:02:46.740> just<00:02:47.070> completely<00:02:47.370> scrap<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:47.970> stick

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
ink just completely scrap it and stick

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.840 
ink just completely scrap it and stick
with<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.570> super<00:02:48.900> link<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.230> also<00:02:50.130> nationality

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
with the super link and also nationality

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.510 
with the super link and also nationality
nationally<00:02:51.540> in<00:02:51.630> club<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.110> also<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.280> club

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
nationally in club and also the club

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.920 
nationally in club and also the club
link<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:53.940> now<00:02:54.060> we're<00:02:54.180> going<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.330> move<00:02:54.390> on<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.690> an

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
link so now we're going to move on to an

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.380 
link so now we're going to move on to an
example<00:02:55.530> for<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.740> guys<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.250> it's<00:02:57.120> going<00:02:57.270> to

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
example for you guys and it's going to

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.680 
example for you guys and it's going to
be<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.860> 4424<00:02:58.860> triple<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.550> formation<00:03:00.210> and<00:03:00.600> this

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
be a 4424 triple to formation and this

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.810 
be a 4424 triple to formation and this
is<00:03:00.780> one<00:03:00.960> of<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.170> easiest<00:03:01.320> formations<00:03:02.190> to

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
is one of the easiest formations to

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.730 
is one of the easiest formations to
build<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.120> hybrid<00:03:03.510> scrub<00:03:03.780> ordering<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.590> as<00:03:04.710> you

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
build a hybrid scrub ordering so as you

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.560 
build a hybrid scrub ordering so as you
can<00:03:04.890> see<00:03:05.040> we've<00:03:05.190> got<00:03:05.220> three<00:03:05.610> league<00:03:06.060> hybrid

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
can see we've got three league hybrid

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.110 
can see we've got three league hybrid
here<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.020> we've<00:03:07.680> got<00:03:07.830> a<00:03:07.860> leaguer<00:03:08.160> bva<00:03:08.640> we<00:03:08.940> also

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
here and we've got a leaguer bva we also

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.070 
here and we've got a leaguer bva we also
got<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.600> Bundesliga<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:12.000> Serie<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.510> now

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
got the Bundesliga and the Serie I now

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.540 
got the Bundesliga and the Serie I now
something<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.590> didn't<00:03:13.830> actually<00:03:13.920> talk<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.310> you

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
something I didn't actually talk to you

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.210 
something I didn't actually talk to you
about<00:03:14.640> in<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:16.590> know<00:03:16.680> showing<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.100> the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
about in the you know showing you the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.760 
about in the you know showing you the
links<00:03:17.940> was<00:03:18.120> actually<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.720> claw<00:03:18.900> closure<00:03:19.110> Joe

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
links was actually the claw closure Joe

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.950 
links was actually the claw closure Joe
just<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.280> league<00:03:20.850> link<00:03:21.150> which<00:03:21.330> is<00:03:21.360> useless

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
just the league link which is useless

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.210 
just the league link which is useless
and<00:03:21.990> you<00:03:22.170> don't<00:03:22.350> want<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.500> be<00:03:22.590> using<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:23.010> and

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
and you don't want to be using that and

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.090 
and you don't want to be using that and
also<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.780> know<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.230> didn't<00:03:25.650> talk<00:03:25.770> to<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.010> about

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
also you know I didn't talk to you about

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.730 
also you know I didn't talk to you about
the<00:03:26.340> player<00:03:26.550> loyalty<00:03:27.120> now<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:28.230> how<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.470> get

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
the player loyalty now the how you get

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.740 
the player loyalty now the how you get
this<00:03:28.890> is<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.370> play<00:03:29.550> 10<00:03:29.880> games<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:30.570> gives

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
this is you play 10 games and that gives

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.020 
this is you play 10 games and that gives
you<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.050> extra<00:03:31.140> one<00:03:31.500> chemistry<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.670> complete

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
you the extra one chemistry to complete

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.790 
you the extra one chemistry to complete
the<00:03:33.150> 10<00:03:33.360> chemistry<00:03:33.840> or<00:03:34.080> you<00:03:34.290> can<00:03:34.470> get<00:03:34.710> the

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
the 10 chemistry or you can get the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.800 
the 10 chemistry or you can get the
player<00:03:35.040> in<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.250> pack<00:03:35.430> as<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.730> can<00:03:35.820> see<00:03:36.060> in<00:03:36.360> da

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
player in a pack as you can see in da

player in a pack as you can see in da
girl<00:03:37.080> 0<00:03:37.200> lopes<00:03:37.800> I<00:03:38.040> did<00:03:38.220> actually<00:03:38.310> get<00:03:38.610> them<00:03:38.730> in

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
girl 0 lopes I did actually get them in

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.030 
girl 0 lopes I did actually get them in
a<00:03:38.850> pack<00:03:39.030> so<00:03:39.270> he<00:03:39.450> instantly<00:03:39.960> gets<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.830> 10

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
a pack so he instantly gets the 10

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.720 
a pack so he instantly gets the 10
chemistry<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:42.560> do<00:03:43.560> they<00:03:44.100> won't<00:03:44.220> actually<00:03:44.490> get

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
chemistry and do they won't actually get

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.600 
chemistry and do they won't actually get
full<00:03:45.030> Kim<00:03:45.300> unless<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:46.140> know<00:03:46.740> what<00:03:46.980> you're<00:03:47.550> not

going to get full Kim unless you play

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.020 
going to get full Kim unless you play
the<00:03:49.110> 10<00:03:49.290> games<00:03:49.560> or<00:03:49.830> you've<00:03:50.550> got<00:03:50.790> them<00:03:50.880> in<00:03:50.970> a

the 10 games or you've got them in a

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.640 
the 10 games or you've got them in a
pack<00:03:51.270> so<00:03:51.570> majority<00:03:51.870> of<00:03:52.050> plays<00:03:52.260> here<00:03:52.530> I've

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
pack so majority of plays here I've

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.870

pulled<00:03:52.890> an<00:03:53.010> impact<00:03:53.250> but<00:03:53.340> as<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.550> can<00:03:53.670> see

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
pulled an impact but as you can see

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.060 
pulled an impact but as you can see
Allah<00:03:54.120> chetstriker<00:03:54.570> is<00:03:55.110> online<00:03:55.290> chemistry

Allah chetstriker is online chemistry

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.880 
Allah chetstriker is online chemistry

and also Vucinic is online chemistry and
as<00:03:59.880> you<00:04:00.000> can<00:04:00.120> see<00:04:00.150> there<00:04:00.480> we've<00:04:00.660> put<00:04:00.900> people<00:04:01.320> in

so therefore he doesn't get the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.580 
so therefore he doesn't get the
chemistry<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.180> also<00:04:03.450> on<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.870> cat<00:04:04.380> player

can see on both my strikers they're not

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.230 
can see on both my strikers they're not
getting<00:04:13.920> 10<00:04:14.190> chemistry<00:04:14.700> because<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:14.970> haven't

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
getting 10 chemistry because I haven't

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.120 
getting 10 chemistry because I haven't
played<00:04:15.450> enough<00:04:15.570> games<00:04:15.840> of<00:04:16.260> them<00:04:16.380> yet<00:04:16.560> I've<00:04:16.770> not

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
played enough games of them yet I've not

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.620 
played enough games of them yet I've not
played<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.370> team<00:04:17.670> gaining<00:04:18.180> your<00:04:18.270> games<00:04:18.450> with

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
played a team gaining your games with

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.510 
played a team gaining your games with
these<00:04:18.750> teams<00:04:19.049> yet<00:04:19.290> it's<00:04:19.650> just<00:04:19.859> an<00:04:19.950> example<00:04:20.070> but

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
these teams yet it's just an example but

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.520 
these teams yet it's just an example but
tempers<00:04:21.000> I<00:04:21.120> did<00:04:21.330> buy<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:21.989> played<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.230> lot<00:04:22.410> of

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
tempers I did buy and I played a lot of

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.320 
tempers I did buy and I played a lot of
games<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.919> him<00:04:23.010> so<00:04:23.190> he<00:04:23.310> gets<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.580> 10<00:04:23.790> chemistry

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
games of him so he gets a 10 chemistry

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.240 
games of him so he gets a 10 chemistry
because<00:04:24.510> I've<00:04:25.140> played<00:04:25.410> more<00:04:25.620> than<00:04:25.650> 10<00:04:25.980> games

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
because I've played more than 10 games

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.900 
because I've played more than 10 games
of<00:04:26.430> him

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
of him

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.550 
of him
so<00:04:27.120> no<00:04:27.300> for<00:04:27.510> triple<00:04:27.840> to<00:04:27.960> one<00:04:28.140> of<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:28.290> easiest

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
so no for triple to one of the easiest

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.870 
so no for triple to one of the easiest
hybrids<00:04:28.980> grubbles<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.580> would<00:04:29.730> definitely

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
hybrids grubbles I would definitely

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.270 
hybrids grubbles I would definitely
nobody<00:04:30.840> bring<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.260> how<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.590> build<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:31.950> hybrid

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
nobody bring you how to build a hybrid

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.400 
nobody bring you how to build a hybrid
squad<00:04:32.460> builder<00:04:32.850> in<00:04:32.910> each<00:04:33.150> formation<00:04:33.900> that's

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
squad builder in each formation that's

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.080 
squad builder in each formation that's
in<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.710> game<00:04:34.920> so<00:04:35.160> if<00:04:35.220> you<00:04:35.400> look<00:04:35.640> forward<00:04:35.910> to

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
in the game so if you look forward to

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.390 
in the game so if you look forward to
