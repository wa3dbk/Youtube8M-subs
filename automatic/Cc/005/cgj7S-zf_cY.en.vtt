including the pilot we spoke to I was
naturally<00:03:32.769> very<00:03:33.040> alarmed<00:03:33.880> when<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:34.060> found<00:03:34.299> out

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
naturally very alarmed when I found out

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.210 
naturally very alarmed when I found out
the<00:03:34.540> results<00:03:34.660> I<00:03:35.140> thought<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.040> is

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
the results I thought this is

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.120 
the results I thought this is
unbelievable<00:03:37.030> everybody<00:03:37.660> had<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.140> same<00:03:38.170> he

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
unbelievable everybody had the same he

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.300 
unbelievable everybody had the same he
shocked<00:03:39.519> me<00:03:39.730> deeply<00:03:40.390> shocked<00:03:40.780> me<00:03:41.019> and<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:42.160> me

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
shocked me deeply shocked me and to me

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.680 
shocked me deeply shocked me and to me
that's<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.640> proof<00:03:42.940> of<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.239> thing<00:03:43.450> really

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
that's the proof of the thing really

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.509 
that's the proof of the thing really
because<00:03:44.320> you<00:03:44.410> can't<00:03:44.650> argue<00:03:44.890> with<00:03:45.070> figures

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
because you can't argue with figures

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.080 
because you can't argue with figures
really<00:03:46.380> so<00:03:47.380> how<00:03:47.530> does<00:03:47.590> oil<00:03:48.130> from<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.640> engines

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
really so how does oil from the engines

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.270 
really so how does oil from the engines
get<00:03:49.450> into<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.840> cockpit<00:03:50.019> while<00:03:50.980> every
