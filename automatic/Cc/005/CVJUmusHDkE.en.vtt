bootlegging<00:00:33.530> it's<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:34.770> here<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.130> map

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.740 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.320 

take<00:00:38.340> care<00:00:38.580> of<00:00:38.670> though<00:00:38.760> because<00:00:39.060> there<00:00:39.240> are

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
take care of though because there are

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.430 
take care of though because there are
some<00:00:39.450> castle<00:00:39.840> doors<00:00:39.990> in<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.230> area<00:00:42.290> once<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
some castle doors in this area once you

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.810 
some castle doors in this area once you
get<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:43.800> make<00:00:44.010> sure<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.280> save<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.670> game

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
get here make sure you save the game

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.940 
get here make sure you save the game
this<00:00:45.240> is<00:00:45.450> very<00:00:45.690> important<00:00:46.320> because<00:00:46.650> there's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
this is very important because there's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.370 
this is very important because there's

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
only a 50% chance the Gus rifle will be

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.110 
only a 50% chance the Gus rifle will be
