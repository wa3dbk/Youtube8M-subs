cylinder<00:00:15.160> I've<00:00:15.460> had<00:00:16.449> the<00:00:16.630> ECU<00:00:17.320> repaired<00:00:17.830> I'll

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
cylinder I've had the ECU repaired I'll

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.180 
cylinder I've had the ECU repaired I'll
put<00:00:18.520> a<00:00:18.550> new<00:00:18.789> coil<00:00:19.119> pack<00:00:19.480> on<00:00:20.010> number<00:00:21.010> four

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.190 
put a new coil pack on number four

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.250 
put a new coil pack on number four
cylinder<00:00:21.760> which<00:00:21.970> supplies<00:00:22.420> three<00:00:22.990> and<00:00:23.170> all

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
cylinder which supplies three and all

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.130 
cylinder which supplies three and all
I've<00:00:23.699> changed<00:00:24.699> all<00:00:24.939> the<00:00:25.210> injectors<00:00:25.840> I've

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
I've changed all the injectors I've

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.740 
I've changed all the injectors I've
moved<00:00:26.590> all<00:00:27.010> the<00:00:27.220> coil<00:00:27.490> packs<00:00:27.789> around<00:00:28.000> I've

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
moved all the coil packs around I've

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.609 
moved all the coil packs around I've
rewired<00:00:29.710> the<00:00:30.340> whole<00:00:30.760> engine<00:00:31.599> wiring<00:00:31.900> loom<00:00:32.349> up

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
rewired the whole engine wiring loom up

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.549 
rewired the whole engine wiring loom up
to<00:00:33.039> the<00:00:33.160> ECU<00:00:33.629> I'll<00:00:34.629> remove<00:00:35.050> the<00:00:35.229> crankshaft

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
to the ECU I'll remove the crankshaft

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.770 
to the ECU I'll remove the crankshaft
sensor<00:00:36.010> where<00:00:36.729> you<00:00:36.850> need<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.179> camshaft

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.670 

you<00:01:19.490> will<00:01:19.640> see<00:01:19.970> exactly<00:01:20.630> what<00:01:20.990> it<00:01:21.110> does

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
you will see exactly what it does
