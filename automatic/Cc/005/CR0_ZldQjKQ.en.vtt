00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:05.830
 the eyes are organs that transformed this moment I am impulsive nervous to 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.029
 the brain and so we can see those in the circuit 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.859
 a camera and similar to that of the stocking as the operation of the block 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:13.769
 in the street 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:14.699
 from the machine 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.900
 the images are recorded on the photographic film 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.349
 in the human organism the images are interpreted and stored in the brain 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.189
 can integrate the various senses 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.570
 the light stimuli before reaching the retina must pass through a 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.300
 series of structures and transparent means 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.950
 the first transparent layer the current flash string and the camera 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.500
 posterior aspect of the shoulder 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.840
 it also regulates the amount of light that passes through the pupil and 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.890
 consequently enters the leaf group 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.530
 the diaphragm of a camera has the same function 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.510
 a country may present prices that are different from very dark brown 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.370
 almost black 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.550
 passing medium brown hair and light of defeat Louveira to the blue well 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.260
 clear 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.240
 the lens of conversion and therefore with the leader consisting of 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.200
 - concentric cells punctured by ligaments called ciliares a 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.200
 second layer of ozone with a butt 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.830
 some muscles called the ciliary 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.700
 your shape 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.120
 to allow the focus of an image that investigates people 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.970
 the variations in the size of the lens and the pupil diameter area is what 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.500
 allows you to switch objects to different instances of the visual field 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.150
 in my opinion people have trouble seeing objects in the long run. 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.800
 distance because the focus of the image forms before the Argentine the long eye 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.109
 so they need to get closer to the object 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.109
 to make the image of the incident on the retina 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.670
 on the internet, the opposite occurs when people see well from afar but 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.970
 presented difficulties in focusing on images of objects at short distances 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.249
 suffocation of the image forms behind the retina 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:21.939
 so they need to move farther away to make the image the 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.829
 it affects people 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.299
 these defects can be corrected media of artificial milks which are 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.749
 placed in front of the crystalline biological lens and now as 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:34.579
 eyeglass and contact lenses 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.339
 thus allowing to correct defects of the image assembly 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:48.779
 the victim is made up of layers of cells that have nerve receptors 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:53.179
 receptors are two cuts stimulated preferably dengue 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.159
 and allow the color of images to be distinguished 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.059
 and black and white stimulated rods acting during the day and at night 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:04.059
 during the piracema 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:12.270
 the animals have the same number of poles and rods as the estimated 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.289
 such as the dog's plan 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:19.059
 mainly in black and white and distinguishing objects 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:21.009
 by shades of gray 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:25.699
 the stimulation of the cones and rods and translated into nerve impulses which 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.629
 are guided to the visuals of the region of this total brain where 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.029
 image is received in its original position interpreted as
