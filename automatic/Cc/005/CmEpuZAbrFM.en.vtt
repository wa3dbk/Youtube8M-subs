you to our new 64 pack multiframe unit
we<00:00:07.710> have<00:00:07.980> just<00:00:08.550> just<00:00:08.790> designed<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.630> right

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
we have just just designed this right

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.330 
we have just just designed this right
now<00:00:10.050> it's<00:00:10.230> June<00:00:10.550> 2012<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.500> we<00:00:13.500> have<00:00:13.710> put<00:00:14.190> quite

now it's June 2012 and we have put quite

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.099 
now it's June 2012 and we have put quite
a<00:00:14.400> few<00:00:14.610> features<00:00:15.000> into<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.360> new<00:00:15.570> pack<00:00:15.839> I

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
a few features into this new pack I

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.830 
a few features into this new pack I
wanted<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.590> explain<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.430> detail<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.449> features

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
wanted to explain in detail the features

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.230 
wanted to explain in detail the features
that<00:00:18.869> we've<00:00:19.199> added<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:19.740> pack<00:00:20.010> we<00:00:20.910> call<00:00:21.119> it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
that we've added to this pack we call it

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.570 
that we've added to this pack we call it
a<00:00:21.330> multi<00:00:21.660> frame<00:00:21.900> pack<00:00:22.199> because<00:00:22.560> what<00:00:23.430> we've

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
a multi frame pack because what we've

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.080 
a multi frame pack because what we've
done<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.939> designed<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.510> 64<00:00:25.140> packs<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.550> it

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
done is designed to 64 packs so that it

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.120 
done is designed to 64 packs so that it
can<00:00:27.330> actually<00:00:27.510> fit<00:00:27.930> five<00:00:28.289> different<00:00:28.830> frames

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
can actually fit five different frames

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.690 
can actually fit five different frames
which<00:00:29.789> I'm<00:00:29.970> going<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.150> show<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.330> shortly

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
which I'm going to show you shortly

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.560 
which I'm going to show you shortly
the<00:00:32.700> first<00:00:33.300> frame<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.780> we've<00:00:33.930> designed<00:00:34.350> it

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
the first frame that we've designed it

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.810 
the first frame that we've designed it
is<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.780> course<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.969> 64<00:00:40.579> frame<00:00:41.579> that

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
is of course the the the 64 frame that

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.430 
is of course the the the 64 frame that
the<00:00:41.910> Canadian<00:00:42.210> Forces<00:00:42.420> use<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.960> pretty<00:00:43.110> common

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the Canadian Forces use is pretty common

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.680 
the Canadian Forces use is pretty common
the<00:00:44.370> problem<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.820> frame<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.570> it's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the problem with this frame is that it's

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.959 
the problem with this frame is that it's
very<00:00:45.719> difficult<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.500> hold<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.850> if

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
very difficult to get a hold of but if

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.750 
very difficult to get a hold of but if
you<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.300> one<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:49.320> then<00:00:49.710> great<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.520> pack

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
you have one then then great this pack

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.180 
you have one then then great this pack
will<00:00:50.910> actually<00:00:51.239> fit<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:52.649> other<00:00:52.800> frame

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
will actually fit it the other frame

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.569 
will actually fit it the other frame
that<00:00:53.399> we've<00:00:53.550> made<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.940> work<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
that we've made it work with is the the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.299 
that we've made it work with is the the
82<00:00:57.030> frame<00:00:57.800> again<00:00:58.800> there's<00:00:59.010> lots<00:00:59.190> of

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
82 frame again there's lots of

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.040 
82 frame again there's lots of
attachment<00:00:59.910> points<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> lot<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.899> guys

attachment points on this a lot of guys

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.619 
attachment points on this a lot of guys
don't<00:01:01.289> use<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.940> pack<00:01:03.149> will<00:01:03.359> still

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
don't use this but the pack will still

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.969 
don't use this but the pack will still
fit<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.589> what<00:01:04.739> you're

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
comfortable with using the other frame

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960 
comfortable with using the other frame
that<00:01:09.960> we've<00:01:10.110> made<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.439> fit<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.640> u.s.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that we've made it fit is the the u.s.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.050 
that we've made it fit is the the u.s.
Alice<00:01:12.420> frame<00:01:13.159> again<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.580> quite<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> cheap

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
Alice frame again this is quite a cheap

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.990 
Alice frame again this is quite a cheap
frame<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.659> very<00:01:15.869> strong<00:01:16.200> frame<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:17.340> again

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.010 
one here is the 1606 Downeast frame it's
a<00:01:33.990> polymer<00:01:34.320> plastic<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.750> really<00:01:36.750> really

a polymer plastic and it's really really

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.960 
a polymer plastic and it's really really
strong<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.560> actually<00:01:37.950> excellent<00:01:38.430> frame<00:01:38.790> in

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
strong it's actually excellent frame in

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.090 
strong it's actually excellent frame in
fact<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.990> know<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> more<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> use<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.920> the

little bit

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.729 
little bit
we've<00:03:38.220> pleated<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.910> here<00:03:39.329> in<00:03:39.480> here<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.169> here

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
and here so that the flap actually is

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.550 
and here so that the flap actually is
not<00:03:42.449> flat<00:03:42.840> anymore

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
not flat anymore

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.159 
not flat anymore
it<00:03:43.889> actually<00:03:44.459> curves<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.389> little<00:03:45.510> bit<00:03:45.750> over<00:03:46.049> the

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
it actually curves a little bit over the

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.500 
it actually curves a little bit over the
top<00:03:46.199> of<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.620> pack<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:47.669> pack<00:03:47.699> right<00:03:48.180> now<00:03:48.359> is

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
top of the pack the pack right now is

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.979 
top of the pack the pack right now is
pretty<00:03:48.959> much<00:03:49.079> full<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.590> its<00:03:49.739> capacity<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.989> the

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
pretty much full to its capacity and the

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.819 
pretty much full to its capacity and the
flap<00:03:52.260> is<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:54.269> configuration<00:03:55.199> right<00:03:55.590> now<00:03:55.769> it

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
flap is the configuration right now it

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:56.930 
flap is the configuration right now it
gives<00:03:55.980> you<00:03:56.069> a<00:03:56.129> pretty<00:03:56.250> good<00:03:56.370> idea<00:03:56.549> of<00:03:56.760> how<00:03:56.909> it

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
gives you a pretty good idea of how it

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.030 
gives you a pretty good idea of how it
actually<00:03:57.090> lays<00:03:57.599> flat<00:03:57.989> over<00:03:58.379> top<00:03:58.590> of<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.829> pack

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
actually lays flat over top of the pack

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.729 
actually lays flat over top of the pack
also<00:04:00.000> in<00:04:00.359> addition<00:04:00.780> we've<00:04:00.930> molly'd<00:04:01.379> the<00:04:01.500> top

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
also in addition we've molly'd the top

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.369 
also in addition we've molly'd the top
so<00:04:02.040> again<00:04:02.579> you<00:04:02.699> got<00:04:02.819> more<00:04:03.000> capacity<00:04:03.629> to<00:04:03.750> put<00:04:03.959> as

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
so again you got more capacity to put as

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.830 
so again you got more capacity to put as
many<00:04:04.530> pouches<00:04:05.040> as<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:05.310> want<00:04:05.609> not<00:04:06.239> only<00:04:06.540> here

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
many pouches as you want not only here
