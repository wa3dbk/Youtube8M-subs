00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:21.040
 today we will talk about the bench press 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:22.900
 either tilted and tilted plate and 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.470
 how do you know this is one of the 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.419
 most popular exercises that exist in 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.520
 First, there are different forms of 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.590
 running the bench press is not that 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.469
 only one mind is correct and the 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.180
 other system what not so the execution in 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.510
 yes they depend on what you want 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.370
 get from that exercise is why 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.090
 that in this video I'm going to reveal a 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.040
 fundamental tip to develop mass 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.570
 muscle in the pectorals in minor 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.400
 weather 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.350
 using the bench press by 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.360
 example when they observe me perform that 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.030
 exercise it would seem that the only 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.780
 is happening is that I do strength of 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.329
 vertical way to raise and lower the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.340
 bar and that's just one of the 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.320
 main reasons why the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.590
 people do not feel that their pecs 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.810
 they are really being worked on not 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.659
 feel that fireman 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.049
 I'm actually doing something 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.860
 more than just making the move 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:26.470
 vertical well so you can work 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.590
 correctly the pectorals should 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.439
 look for the way to stretch the and 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.679
 contract them completely 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:39.750
 now because the bar does not 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:43.869
 allows to make that movement in a way 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.690
 optimal understand you can not stretch but 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.310
 you can not contract them completely 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.780
 For that, he must 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.750
 happen this ok but the bar the only thing 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.100
 that will allow us is to do the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.480
 vertical movement you realize 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:08.110
 you understand, it does not allow us to do this 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.440
 then what you should do apart from 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.820
 focus on moving the weight is to go 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.520
 making a force intentionally 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:22.720
 inwards and there you realize that 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.240
 you can contract your pectorals as much as possible 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.920
 ok look here 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.310
 and look here, you understand, you should feel 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.040
 how is the work test at home in 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.120
 those moments imagine you're done 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:44.260
 of the bar wants to raise like this and then 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.110
 that elevates it so ok you realize the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.350
 difference does this in each 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.020
 repetition is normal that you lift less 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.209
 weight than before but remember when 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.250
 are looking to develop the muscle mass 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.830
 less time is not about having someone 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.040
 lift more weight if it's not about giving 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.960
 maximum tension to the muscle you're looking for 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.480
 to work 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.490
 you apply it and the accounts that you will see 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.890
 who perform correctly you're going to 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.500
 feel an incredible pumping in their 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.370
 pectorals at the end of two routines now 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.860
 an extra tip to further improve the 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.620
 connection mind muscle with the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.960
 pectorals if the gym where you train 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.260
 has the machine presented for 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.530
 practical chest there what I just did 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.360
 advise today will be easier and 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.060
 I for example in exploring that 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.640
 machine so cool if it's not your case 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.200
 then practice the normal in front 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.760
 in this bank 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.460
 lives more we hope to have been of 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.140
 great help has been much more videos 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.090

 be part of this great family trainer 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.709
 there is one thing 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.540
 Monday July 2 next we will be 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.620

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.849
 Trailer 1 to 1 advisory service 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.849
