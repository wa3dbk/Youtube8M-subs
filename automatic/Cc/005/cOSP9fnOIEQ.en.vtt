would<00:02:22.540> climb<00:02:22.900> freehand<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.910> position

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
would climb freehand in that position

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.199 
would climb freehand in that position
most<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.560> time<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.950> then<00:02:27.400> afterwards<00:02:27.820> he

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
most of the time and then afterwards he

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.800 
most of the time and then afterwards he
came<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.170> battle<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:30.160> know<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:31.420> hey<00:02:31.570> also

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
came to the battle you know but hey also

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.460 
came to the battle you know but hey also

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
have a seat inside from that point so if

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.890 
have a seat inside from that point so if
he<00:02:35.560> comes<00:02:35.770> across<00:02:35.980> if<00:02:36.850> he<00:02:37.090> comes<00:02:37.360> across<00:02:37.540> the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
he comes across if he comes across the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.920 
he comes across if he comes across the
seminar<00:02:38.350> from<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.430> position<00:02:39.910> here<00:02:40.209> most<00:02:40.810> of

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
seminar from this position here most of

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.340 
seminar from this position here most of
the<00:02:40.989> time<00:02:41.080> he's<00:02:41.470> covered<00:02:41.860> up<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.840> his<00:02:43.840> weapons

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
the time he's covered up and his weapons

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.820 
the time he's covered up and his weapons
them<00:02:44.530> not<00:02:45.209> exposed<00:02:46.380> what's<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.500> time<00:02:47.709> the

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
them not exposed what's the time the

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.690 
them not exposed what's the time the
weapons<00:02:48.959> were<00:02:49.959> done<00:02:50.200> in<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.410> fashion<00:02:50.830> where<00:02:51.010> it

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
weapons were done in a fashion where it

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.130 
weapons were done in a fashion where it
was<00:02:51.880> hidden<00:02:53.340> right<00:02:54.340> onto<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.790> left<00:02:55.000> side<00:02:55.140> from

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
was hidden right onto the left side from

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.520 
was hidden right onto the left side from
here<00:02:56.320> so<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.250> position<00:02:58.180> from<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.080> left<00:02:59.290> side

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
here so this position from the left side

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.949 
here so this position from the left side
from<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.100> right<00:03:00.220> side<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:01.269> they<00:03:01.390> should<00:03:01.930> be

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
from the right side so they should be

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.020 
from the right side so they should be
most<00:03:02.290> right-handed<00:03:02.860> so<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.340> can<00:03:03.519> draw<00:03:03.730> rather

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
most right-handed so you can draw rather

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.780 
most right-handed so you can draw rather
than<00:03:04.330> drawing<00:03:04.540> across<00:03:05.400> like<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.549> samurai

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
than drawing across like the samurai

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.270 
than drawing across like the samurai
would<00:03:07.060> do<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.630> samurai<00:03:07.959> he's<00:03:08.350> open<00:03:08.950> he's<00:03:08.980> like

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
would do the samurai he's open he's like

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.390 
would do the samurai he's open he's like
they're<00:03:09.549> right<00:03:09.850> he's<00:03:10.390> drawing<00:03:10.690> across<00:03:11.400> from

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
they're right he's drawing across from

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.580 
they're right he's drawing across from
here<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:13.420> injured<00:03:13.810> when<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.019> draw<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.230> cross

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
here the injured when you draw a cross

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.170 
here the injured when you draw a cross
and<00:03:14.860> say<00:03:15.100> because<00:03:15.220> that's<00:03:15.459> not<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.820> nature<00:03:16.150> of

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
and say because that's not the nature of

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.690 
and say because that's not the nature of
the<00:03:16.299> soul<00:03:16.510> then<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:18.040> nature<00:03:18.340> of<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.459> sword

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
the soul then the nature of the sword

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.130 
the soul then the nature of the sword
it's<00:03:19.420> him

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
it's him

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.509 
it's him
most<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.709> time<00:03:20.890> drawing<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:24.100> would<00:03:24.340> be

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
most of the time drawing this would be

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.970 
most of the time drawing this would be
the<00:03:25.299> position<00:03:25.510> it<00:03:25.900> meant<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.290> him<00:03:26.640> in<00:03:27.640> hurt

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
the position it meant to him in hurt

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.770 
the position it meant to him in hurt
invert<00:03:29.980> rather<00:03:30.370> than

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.220
