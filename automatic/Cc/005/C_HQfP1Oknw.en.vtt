00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.670
 hello then we are going to 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.569
 present the following experiment 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:10.509
 made by gina paola andrade ortiz and 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.329
 mariset will change those of the institution 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:15.579
 This educational Rafael Uribe Uribe 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:19.390
 experiment is how to peel a 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:24.070
 raw egg the materials are a jar 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:27.070
 Large wide-mouthed vinegar top 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.890
 white and a raw egg 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.880
 and procedures fills the bottle with 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.880
 white vinegar 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.659
 being careful not to break it, place the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.659
 Raw egg inside the jar combine 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.410
 observe the egg in a couple of hours and 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.200
 then leaving several days a 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.200
 recommendation is not to shake the jar 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.980
 after three hours you can observe 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.890
 that on the surface again is 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.320
 bubble cover the shell of the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.220
 egg is made of a material called 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.220
 carbonate heat 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.670
 which to extract in contact with the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.610
 vinegar acid produce a gas when 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.310
 we look at the on the surface called 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.530
 carbon dioxide and this causes the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.190
 bubbles that we see are shaped by 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.590
 this gas 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.540
 after several days the binary 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.940
 continues to wear the shell of 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.370
 egg until it disappears by 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.250
 complete after the shell 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.370
 disappear completely the egg is going 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.220
 to start bloating 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.230
 the shell that protects the egg but 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.010
 lack of it in a row that can 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.980
 penetrate the nuclear window 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.860
 then when the shell has 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.750
 disappeared by completely may 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.750
 take out the egg completely 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.660
 let's water the vinegar 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.480
 and then we get out of this 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.039
 carefully and we put it in a 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.080
 cold water 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.380
 ah 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.320
 and you will notice that the membrane appears at 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.230
 Touch like a rubber ball too 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.410
 in this part we will be able to write down the yolks 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.410
 egg
