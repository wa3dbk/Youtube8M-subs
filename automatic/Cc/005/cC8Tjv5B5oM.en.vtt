00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.589
 hard training 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.810
 I want you a little bit today 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.080
 for example, introduce accessories here in 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.700
 nice htc watch 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.760
 this is our little keychain 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.000
 which ensures that he mobile again 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.830
 how does it all work? 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.640
 easy 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:38.239
 the htc touch is paired with bluetooth 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.260
 with your phone with your htc from 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.239
 Minimax and when I'm on it clique 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.230
 Can you see I can go here after that 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.010
 looking for a patch 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.880
 ie she has him on your example 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.899
 key then searched for the key 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:00.739
 peter vetsch reversed you stand in the 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.350
 early on your cell phone is looking exactly right 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:09.049
 Where it is , he briefly presses on the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.700
 head and then her cellphone rings and 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.700
 so you can either get a key 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.340
 search or search your cell phone with it but 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.020
 not enough 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.970
 the clou actually comes now 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.780
 both are very close together 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.290
 connected 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.200
 this connection should demolish this 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.450
 is the name of the two on distance and the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.159
 Bluetooth connection will tear off then 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.430
 Both offer and that is very convenient 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:38.150
 Imagine you are just up 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.000
 business trip and have this the htc 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.470
 Fatty on your briefcase where a laptop 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.810
 and your whole life is in it and the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.560
 is in the taxi and you get out and 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.549
 go to the hotel and have the moment 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.490
 your mobile phone in your pocket or 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.820
 Briefcase is still on the seat 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.360
 next to you in the taxi then found hangs 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.430

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.980
 and fitch are disconnected and so loses 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.870
 he never again 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.270
 it even works so far 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.580
 that you still get an email when 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.440
 the two are separated and also 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.600
 see where on google maps the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.400
 both separated that means he can on 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.030
 next morning even watching holes was 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:27.550
 you lost your phone so far from me 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.550
