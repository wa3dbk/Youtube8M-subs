interested<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.140> bushing<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.769> pretty<00:00:31.980> well

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
interested this bushing is pretty well

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.810 
interested this bushing is pretty well
lubricated

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
lubricated

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.930 
lubricated
I<00:00:33.210> didn't<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:34.020> relocate<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.250> this

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
I didn't just relocate it but this

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.280 
I didn't just relocate it but this
bushing<00:00:36.180> was<00:00:36.360> only<00:00:36.540> installed<00:00:36.899> maybe<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
bushing was only installed maybe a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.580 
bushing was only installed maybe a
couple<00:00:37.710> hundred<00:00:37.829> miles<00:00:38.129> ago<00:00:38.540> at<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.809> most<00:00:40.079> and

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
couple hundred miles ago at the most and

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.729 
couple hundred miles ago at the most and
it<00:00:40.680> still<00:00:40.920> has<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.520> least<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.059> relation<00:00:42.629> to

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
it still has at least in relation to

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.200 
it still has at least in relation to
energy<00:00:43.739> suspension<00:00:44.460> bushing<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.879> still<00:00:45.059> has

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
energy suspension bushing it still has

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.810 
energy suspension bushing it still has
pretty<00:00:45.390> good<00:00:45.480> play<00:00:46.129> and<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.489> still<00:00:47.700> see

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
pretty good play and you can still see

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.380 
pretty good play and you can still see
the<00:00:47.940> grease<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:50.969> guess

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the grease on it and all that so I guess

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.729 
the grease on it and all that so I guess
I'm<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.629> gonna<00:00:51.780> move<00:00:52.020> these<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.649> you

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
I'm just gonna move these here so you

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.889 
I'm just gonna move these here so you
can<00:00:52.860> kind<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> difference<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:54.719> gonna

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
can kind of see the difference I'm gonna

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.420 
can kind of see the difference I'm gonna
try<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.620> obviously<00:00:56.160> not<00:00:56.280> real

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
try it this is obviously not real

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.709 
try it this is obviously not real
scientific<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.149> I'm<00:00:57.239> gonna<00:00:57.360> try<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.660> use

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
scientific but I'm gonna try and use

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.170 
scientific but I'm gonna try and use
about<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> same<00:00:58.350> amount<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.649> pressure

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
about the same amount of pressure

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.910 
about the same amount of pressure
between<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.390> two<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.230> see<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
between the two so that you can see the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.179 
between the two so that you can see the
movement<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.300> here's<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.690> part<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.739> not

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
movement so here's the part or the not

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.310 
movement so here's the part or the not
the<00:01:05.309> hard<00:01:05.519> race<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.090> megohm<00:01:06.720> racing<00:01:07.049> same

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the hard race and megohm racing same

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.880 
the hard race and megohm racing same
thing<00:01:07.530> bushing<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:13.049> does<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.530> kind<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.799> a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
thing bushing and it does have kind of a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.640 
thing bushing and it does have kind of a
springiness<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.909> when<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.380> push<00:01:16.380> down

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
springiness to it so when you push down

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.170 
springiness to it so when you push down
on<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:17.990> it'll<00:01:18.990> come<00:01:19.110> back

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
on it it'll come back

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.999 
on it it'll come back
so<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.810> interesting<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> only

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
so it's interesting and then it only

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.679 
so it's interesting and then it only
resists<00:01:23.490> movement<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.119> way<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.509> has<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
resists movement in one way it has a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.320 
resists movement in one way it has a
neutral<00:01:25.049> state<00:01:25.619> but<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.759> always<00:01:27.030> trying<00:01:27.210> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
neutral state but it's always trying to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.230 
neutral state but it's always trying to
return<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.930> which<00:01:28.110> i<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.619> why<00:01:28.740> nissan

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
return to which i think is why nissan

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.609 
return to which i think is why nissan
says<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> factory<00:01:30.810> service<00:01:31.020> manual<00:01:31.170> that

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
says in the factory service manual that

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.020 
says in the factory service manual that
the<00:01:31.680> car<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.070> supposed<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.549> loaded<00:01:33.000> with

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the car is supposed to be loaded with

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.940 
the car is supposed to be loaded with
its<00:01:33.299> normal<00:01:33.659> weight<00:01:33.840> before<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.380> tighten<00:01:34.770> any

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
its normal weight before you tighten any

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.520 
its normal weight before you tighten any
of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.189> arms<00:01:35.610> because<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.689> cars<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.380> way

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
of the arms because the cars that way

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.069 
of the arms because the cars that way
it'll<00:01:37.710> it'll<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:39.150> suspension<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.810> always

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
it'll it'll the suspension is always

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.840 
it'll it'll the suspension is always
trying<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.409> return<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.829> its<00:01:40.950> neutral<00:01:41.130> state<00:01:41.579> so

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
trying to return to its neutral state so

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.359 
trying to return to its neutral state so
that<00:01:41.970> would<00:01:42.090> add<00:01:42.240> kind<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:43.409> my<00:01:44.130> mind

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
that would add kind of a in my mind

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.069 
that would add kind of a in my mind
anyway<00:01:44.700> would<00:01:44.909> add<00:01:45.060> sort<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.450> an<00:01:45.600> anti-sway

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
anyway would add sort of an anti-sway

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.969 
anyway would add sort of an anti-sway
bar<00:01:46.790> effect<00:01:47.790> or<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.170> added<00:01:49.619> spring

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
bar effect or a you know added spring

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.300 
bar effect or a you know added spring
rate<00:01:50.220> effect<00:01:51.649> which<00:01:52.649> i<00:01:52.770> think<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:53.100> kind<00:01:53.280> of

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
rate effect which i think is kind of

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.609 
rate effect which i think is kind of
interesting<00:01:54.229> now<00:01:55.229> here's<00:01:55.439> how<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
interesting now here's how the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.109 
interesting now here's how the
polyurethane<00:01:55.920> bushing<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.579> once<00:01:56.759> again<00:01:57.000> I'm

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
polyurethane bushing is once again I'm

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.700 
polyurethane bushing is once again I'm
going<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.270> try<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.540> move<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.619> know

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
going to try and move this you know

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.609 
going to try and move this you know
about<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.340> same<00:01:59.549> amount<00:01:59.700> here<00:02:01.969> and<00:02:03.259> that's<00:02:04.259> I

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
about the same amount here and that's I

about the same amount here and that's I
don't<00:02:04.920> know<00:02:05.040> if<00:02:05.159> it's<00:02:05.280> showing<00:02:05.579> up<00:02:05.700> on<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
camera but it doesn't move very much and

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.529 
camera but it doesn't move very much and
when<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.310> does<00:02:08.520> move<00:02:08.759> I'm<00:02:08.970> gonna<00:02:09.090> push<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.390> this

when it does move I'm gonna push on this

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.200 
when it does move I'm gonna push on this
real<00:02:09.720> hard

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.000 

it<00:02:13.210> just<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.780> just<00:02:13.960> stays<00:02:14.530> there's<00:02:14.920> no

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
it just it just stays there's no

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.860 
it just it just stays there's no
tendency<00:02:18.010> for<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.520> return<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.540> can<00:02:19.660> kind

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
tendency for it to return you can kind

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.480 
tendency for it to return you can kind
of<00:02:19.930> hear<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.140> suspension<00:02:20.710> squeaking<00:02:21.160> already

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
of hear the suspension squeaking already

of hear the suspension squeaking already
like<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:22.030> said<00:02:22.240> this<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:22.510> only<00:02:22.600> got<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:23.110> couple<00:02:23.830> of

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
like I said this is only got a couple of

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.360 
like I said this is only got a couple of
hundred<00:02:24.250> miles<00:02:24.430> on<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:26.070> I'm<00:02:27.070> just<00:02:27.280> gonna

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
hundred miles on it and I'm just gonna

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.460 
hundred miles on it and I'm just gonna
hear<00:02:28.090> now<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.300> it's<00:02:28.720> I'm<00:02:29.020> looking<00:02:29.290> at<00:02:29.380> the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
hear now that it's I'm looking at the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.800 
hear now that it's I'm looking at the
screen<00:02:29.770> here<00:02:29.800> it's<00:02:30.160> in<00:02:30.970> its<00:02:31.180> back<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.570> its<00:02:31.720> kind

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
screen here it's in its back to its kind

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:56.260 
screen here it's in its back to its kind
of<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:32.020> neutral<00:02:32.350> state<00:02:32.620> here

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.610 

so<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:58.140> far<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.590> think<00:02:58.830> the<00:03:00.170> Megan<00:03:01.170> Racing<00:03:01.530> is

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
so so far I think the Megan Racing is

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.460 
so so far I think the Megan Racing is
going<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.830> be<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.220> better<00:03:02.550> bushing<00:03:03.230> at<00:03:04.230> least

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
going to be a better bushing at least

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.850 
going to be a better bushing at least
four<00:03:05.600> lightly<00:03:06.600> sprung<00:03:06.900> cars<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.380> can<00:03:07.530> see<00:03:07.680> I'm

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
four lightly sprung cars you can see I'm

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.910 
four lightly sprung cars you can see I'm
run<00:03:08.010> enough<00:03:08.720> Nismo<00:03:09.720> s<00:03:10.290> tune<00:03:11.930> seda<00:03:12.930> s<00:03:13.140> tune<00:03:13.500> so

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
run enough Nismo s tune seda s tune so

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.110 
run enough Nismo s tune seda s tune so
we're<00:03:14.130> not<00:03:14.250> talking<00:03:14.430> any<00:03:14.760> kind<00:03:14.910> of<00:03:14.970> crazy

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
we're not talking any kind of crazy

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.300 
we're not talking any kind of crazy
spring<00:03:15.510> rates<00:03:15.690> here<00:03:15.930> I'm<00:03:16.860> starting<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.160> feel

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
spring rates here I'm starting to feel

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.530 
spring rates here I'm starting to feel
like<00:03:17.430> for<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.670> street<00:03:17.940> car<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.240> is<00:03:18.360> going<00:03:18.480> to

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
like for a street car this is going to

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.570 
like for a street car this is going to
be<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.630> whole<00:03:18.780> lot<00:03:18.930> better<00:03:20.570> bushing
