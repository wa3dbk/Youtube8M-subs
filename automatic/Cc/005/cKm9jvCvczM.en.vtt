00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.310
 since marco polo brought noodles from 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.649
 China 700 years ago the same pasta fought 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.420
 places she became such a world 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.490
 the popularity of pasta gained when in 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.250
 15th century they ranked first in 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.089
 Italian cuisine from spaggeti yes a 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.010
 linguini 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.350
 eyes not to feathers and and the list is possible 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.050
 continue to the pasta 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.150
 usually made from cereal clear water it 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.150
 the vault holds over 30 tons of semolina 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.689
 cereals and derived from durum wheat 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.689
 cereal amber color 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.879
 kruploka passes through 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.219
 high speed pre- mixer 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.210
 which she vigorously mixes with 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.920
 water for 5 to 10 seconds 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.469
 This unit can handle from 1 to 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.269
 2 tons of semolina per hour dough 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.460
 extracted from the pre-mixer 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.949
 and drops the first paddle mixer with 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.659
 free access of air then dough 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.059
 fits in this vacuum paddle 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.280
 Mixer can now skip the mix 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.309
 through the brass form here it does 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.210
 spaghetti and this morpho ice is very narrow 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.130
 I mess up these forms are used to 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.009
 making long star shells 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.740
 for soup also cross and digalo dough 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.899
 put a form of suppressing it 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.110
 rotating blade cut out 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.709
 about 12,000 spirals a minute that is 720 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.709
 thousand per hour 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.710
 spirals 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:40.600
 and it's like the dough is still fresh they will dry 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.909
 on this people and now go to 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.680
 lasagna dough passes through this 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.409
 the brass form is then completely fresh 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.750
 107 centimeters long dough is placed on 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.720
 these rods where the pasta dries at 65 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.130
 degrees celsius they dry 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.420
 vertical therefore retain 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.420
 wonderful flat shape 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.060
 after 15 hours, the drying of the strip is cut 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.060
 into four parts 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.460
 to minimize losses make 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.020
 process easier scissors cut pieces 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.530
 dough to the same length right on 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.410
 rods 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.410
 the long process of drying the lasagna begins 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:36.440
 after drying, the lasagna is finally cut 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.330
 Now it is ready for packaging when 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.980
 making other pasta mix you need 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.650
 handle differently to give it 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.210
 the required form of dough passes under this 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.810
 roller which roll it up 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:52.010
 the required thickness now butterflies are being prepared 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.070
 this shape cuts out seven and a half 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.250
 thousand butterflies per minute that is 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:00.200
 450000 hour width of sheets of dough 61 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.480
 centimeter they are made 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.480
 continuous send everything straight to the form 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.220
 butterflies fall on the conveyor to dry 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.010
 and then pass the following is 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.570
 production of some short pasta 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.480
 such as these butterflies and spirals 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.440
 need drying so they are placed in 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.440
 this dryer 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.370
 at the outlet of the drying apparatus pasta 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.800
 already hardened and ready to pack 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.030
 and here we see how it is produced by itself 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.220
 popular spaghetti 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:42.150
 like lasagna spaghetti and dried 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:44.520
 vertically now this machine puts 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.650
 spaghetti on the cutting table and attached 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.870
 im the right length of spaggeti ready for 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.540
 The exact quantity is determined by packing 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.860
 computer then spaggeti gently 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.860
 so descends the complaint 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.629
 under the union, the victory is transported and pours 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.159
 using this moving container 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:16.190
 spaghetti go down so the complaint is to 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:18.410
 facilitate packing in this minute 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.639
 the machine can pack 10 5 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:27.100
 kilogram packs but if necessary 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.100
 he is able to accelerate to 60 packs a minute 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.000
 This factory produces over 100 different 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:40.030
 varieties of pasta and every day 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.030
 recycles up to 360 there is gritty 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.030
 Pasta is the favorite dish of the whole world
