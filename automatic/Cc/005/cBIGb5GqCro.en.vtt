what I like exposition well most people
don't<00:00:33.329> Blair<00:00:33.950> but<00:00:34.950> that's<00:00:35.460> not<00:00:35.579> really<00:00:35.760> true<00:00:35.910> I

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
don't Blair but that's not really true I

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.170 
don't Blair but that's not really true I
mean<00:00:36.930> at<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> very<00:00:37.260> least<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:38.219> debatable

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
mean at the very least it's debatable

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.720 
mean at the very least it's debatable
yeah<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:40.890> when<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> supervillain

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
yeah it's like when a supervillain

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.610 
yeah it's like when a supervillain
captures<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.450> hero<00:00:42.719> right<00:00:42.930> there's<00:00:43.350> always

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
captures the hero right there's always

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.440 
captures the hero right there's always
that<00:00:43.710> exposition<00:00:44.309> seen<00:00:44.550> explain<00:00:44.910> why<00:00:45.149> he's

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
that exposition seen explain why he's

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.240 
that exposition seen explain why he's
doing<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:45.780> he's<00:00:45.989> doing<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.469> sometimes

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
doing what he's doing and sometimes

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.680 
doing what he's doing and sometimes
that's<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> best<00:00:47.610> part<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> movie<00:00:48.329> and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that's the best part of the movie and

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.720 
that's the best part of the movie and
the<00:00:49.020> exposition<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.710> really<00:00:49.920> save<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> movie<00:00:50.550> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the exposition can really save a movie I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.840 
the exposition can really save a movie I
mean<00:00:50.969> look<00:00:51.960> at<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.410> PT<00:00:53.129> Anderson's<00:00:53.640> last

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
something that really happened leaves us

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.960 
something that really happened leaves us
to<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> second<00:01:22.020> thing<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.350> know<00:01:22.520> we<00:01:23.520> can't

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
to the second thing we know we can't

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.859 
to the second thing we know we can't
kill<00:01:24.450> anything<00:01:27.080> question<00:01:29.210> what<00:01:30.210> about<00:01:30.299> things

that<00:01:30.960> are<00:01:31.140> already<00:01:31.500> dead<00:01:31.790> what<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.000> mean<00:01:33.090> like

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
that are already dead what you mean like

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.520 
that are already dead what you mean like
somebody<00:01:33.659> else<00:01:33.810> killed<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> before<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.380> got

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
somebody else killed it before we got

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.830 
somebody else killed it before we got
there<00:01:34.710> no<00:01:35.009> no<00:01:35.070> what<00:01:35.729> about<00:01:35.759> zombies<00:01:36.600> or

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
so I can't really kill them twice that's

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
so I can't really kill them twice that's
a<00:01:43.140> good<00:01:43.259> question<00:01:43.470> no<00:01:44.310> no<00:01:44.640> killing<00:01:45.090> anything

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390

that<00:01:53.880> would<00:01:54.060> imply<00:01:54.390> there<00:01:54.840> were<00:01:54.930> two<00:01:55.170> shots

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
that would imply there were two shots

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.039 
that would imply there were two shots
fired<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.250> as<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.520> all<00:01:56.549> know<00:01:56.670> han<00:01:57.659> was<00:01:57.930> the

fired and as we all know han was the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.649 
fired and as we all know han was the
only<00:01:58.200> one<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.439> fire<00:01:58.740> anything<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.659> continued
