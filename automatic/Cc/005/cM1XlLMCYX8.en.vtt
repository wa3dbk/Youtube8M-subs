the cool thing about a nice loan paint
is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
is

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.030 
is
you<00:01:24.480> can<00:01:24.690> go<00:01:24.810> back<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.230> do<00:01:25.350> something<00:01:25.620> later

you can go back and do something later

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.450 
you can go back and do something later
maybe<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:27.450> messed<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.960> spot<00:01:28.230> and<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:29.250> just

maybe you messed up a spot and it just

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.800 
maybe you messed up a spot and it just
blends<00:01:29.700> right<00:01:29.940> in<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.420> don't<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.690> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
blends right in so you don't have to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.800 
blends right in so you don't have to
worry<00:01:30.960> about<00:01:31.080> it<00:01:31.440> not<00:01:32.340> working<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.730> way<00:01:32.970> I'm

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.950 
worry about it not working that way I'm
not<00:01:33.960> sure<00:01:34.020> if<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.470> tell<00:01:34.650> but<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.640> left<00:01:36.300> some

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
not sure if you can tell but I left some

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.150 
not sure if you can tell but I left some
parts<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:38.840> where<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.870> painted<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> first<00:01:40.770> coat

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
parts of where I painted the first coat

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.610 
parts of where I painted the first coat
kind<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.300> thin<00:01:42.510> because<00:01:43.080> I'm<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> be

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
kind of thin because I'm going to be

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.770 
kind of thin because I'm going to be
distressing<00:01:44.160> this<00:01:44.310> piece<00:01:44.580> anyway<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.600> there's

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
distressing this piece anyway so there's

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.290 
distressing this piece anyway so there's
no<00:01:45.930> reason<00:01:46.260> to<00:01:46.290> waste<00:01:46.530> paint<00:01:47.030> by<00:01:48.030> just

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
no reason to waste paint by just

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.540 
no reason to waste paint by just
standing<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.780> off<00:01:48.900> later<00:01:49.230> and<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.250> kind<00:01:50.490> of

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
standing it off later and that kind of

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.970 
standing it off later and that kind of
adds<00:01:50.730> to<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:51.090> distressed<00:01:51.630> look<00:01:52.230> as<00:01:52.470> well<00:01:52.740> so

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
adds to your distressed look as well so

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.410
