00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.600 
the tip I think this would be a good
product<00:04:34.169> to<00:04:34.350> have<00:04:34.470> on<00:04:34.650> hand<00:04:34.680> if<00:04:35.100> you<00:04:35.190> like<00:04:35.400> to

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
do thick liner otherwise it might not be

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.990 
do thick liner otherwise it might not be
a<00:04:38.910> good<00:04:39.210> buy<00:04:39.479> because<00:04:40.440> it<00:04:40.979> really<00:04:41.370> really<00:04:41.759> does

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
a good buy because it really really does

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.300 
a good buy because it really really does
thick<00:04:42.330> lines<00:04:42.600> and<00:04:43.050> then<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.650> last<00:04:43.800> product<00:04:44.130> I

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
thick lines and then the last product I

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
thick lines and then the last product I
have<00:04:44.460> for<00:04:44.639> the<00:04:44.729> eyes<00:04:44.880> is<00:04:45.300> smolder<00:04:46.139> which<00:04:46.680> is

just a creamy black and this is not a
new<00:04:50.729> product<00:04:51.210> so<00:04:51.479> most<00:04:52.110> of<00:04:52.289> you<00:04:52.440> have<00:04:52.650> probably
