didn't sculpt it all the way which is
kind<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:52.600> lazy<00:03:53.080> thing<00:03:53.410> for<00:03:53.620> Hasbro<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.070> do

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
kind of a lazy thing for Hasbro to do

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.790 
kind of a lazy thing for Hasbro to do
his<00:03:55.900> arms<00:03:56.260> rotate<00:03:56.500> all<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.040> way<00:03:57.250> around<00:03:57.340> and

his arms rotate all the way around and

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.800 
his arms rotate all the way around and
people<00:03:59.800> keep<00:04:00.130> saying<00:04:00.370> as<00:04:00.580> biceps<00:04:01.150> or<00:04:01.390> a<00:04:01.420> little

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
people keep saying as biceps or a little

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.640 
people keep saying as biceps or a little
bit<00:04:01.989> too<00:04:02.920> I<00:04:03.519> guess<00:04:04.239> you<00:04:04.420> could<00:04:04.570> say<00:04:04.840> loose<00:04:05.290> or

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
bit too I guess you could say loose or

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.490 
bit too I guess you could say loose or
too<00:04:06.340> fragile<00:04:06.670> and<00:04:07.330> that<00:04:07.660> is<00:04:07.810> true<00:04:08.050> feels<00:04:08.350> like

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
too fragile and that is true feels like

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.229 
too fragile and that is true feels like
you<00:04:08.709> aren't<00:04:09.010> going<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.250> break<00:04:09.519> it<00:04:09.700> because

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
you aren't going to break it because

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.520 
you aren't going to break it because
it's<00:04:10.420> pretty<00:04:11.380> flimsy<00:04:11.920> right<00:04:12.340> now<00:04:12.580> and<00:04:13.320> also<00:04:14.320> if

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
it's pretty flimsy right now and also if

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.979 
it's pretty flimsy right now and also if
you<00:04:14.680> try<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:14.920> articulate<00:04:15.489> his<00:04:15.790> arm<00:04:16.090> the

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
you try to articulate his arm the

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.000 
you try to articulate his arm the
shoulder<00:04:17.590> or<00:04:17.890> arm<00:04:18.180> pit<00:04:19.180> joint<00:04:19.450> tends<00:04:20.140> to<00:04:20.590> move

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
shoulder or arm pit joint tends to move

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.620 
shoulder or arm pit joint tends to move
like<00:04:21.700> that<00:04:21.910> which<00:04:22.660> is<00:04:22.690> not<00:04:23.169> good

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
like that which is not good

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.710 
like that which is not good
so<00:04:24.960> I<00:04:25.500> think<00:04:25.980> I<00:04:26.070> said<00:04:26.220> biceps<00:04:26.880> well<00:04:27.120> double

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
so I think I said biceps well double

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.550 
so I think I said biceps well double

Marvel<00:05:28.590> Legends<00:05:29.060> figures<00:05:30.060> i<00:05:30.240> guess<00:05:30.450> and

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
Marvel Legends figures i guess and

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.740 
Marvel Legends figures i guess and
speaking<00:05:31.590> go<00:05:31.710> up<00:05:31.890> all<00:05:32.070> the<00:05:32.130> way<00:05:32.310> that<00:05:33.150> much<00:05:33.420> and

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
speaking go up all the way that much and

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.960 
speaking go up all the way that much and
down<00:05:33.960> oh<00:05:34.320> boy<00:05:34.830> back<00:05:35.670> to<00:05:36.000> his<00:05:36.600> ankle<00:05:37.760> alright<00:05:38.760> so

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
down oh boy back to his ankle alright so

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.810 
down oh boy back to his ankle alright so
let's<00:05:39.180> do<00:05:39.390> some<00:05:39.600> size<00:05:39.930> comparisons<00:05:40.710> ok<00:05:41.220> so<00:05:41.280> for

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
let's do some size comparisons ok so for

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.120 
let's do some size comparisons ok so for
size<00:05:42.060> comparison<00:05:42.090> is<00:05:43.020> you<00:05:43.170> can<00:05:43.320> see<00:05:43.500> here<00:05:43.950> he

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
size comparison is you can see here he

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.180 
size comparison is you can see here he
is<00:05:44.310> with<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:45.020> toy<00:05:46.020> biz<00:05:46.350> spider-man<00:05:46.950> one

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
is with the toy biz spider-man one

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.580 
is with the toy biz spider-man one
spider-man<00:05:47.910> here's<00:05:48.600> the<00:05:48.690> amazing<00:05:48.990> spider-man

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
spider-man here's the amazing spider-man

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.560 
spider-man here's the amazing spider-man
and<00:05:49.890> here's<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:50.190> iron<00:05:50.370> man<00:05:50.610> 3<00:05:50.880> Marvel<00:05:51.300> legend

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
and here's the iron man 3 Marvel legend

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.510 
and here's the iron man 3 Marvel legend
spider-man<00:05:52.140> as<00:05:52.410> you<00:05:52.800> can<00:05:52.950> see<00:05:53.100> he's<00:05:53.340> a<00:05:53.370> little

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
spider-man as you can see he's a little

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.840 
spider-man as you can see he's a little
bit<00:05:53.790> shorter<00:05:54.120> than<00:05:54.150> iron<00:05:54.600> man<00:05:54.900> but<00:05:55.730> for<00:05:56.730> the

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
bit shorter than iron man but for the

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.050 
bit shorter than iron man but for the
toy<00:05:57.150> biz<00:05:57.480> one<00:05:57.780> it's<00:05:58.530> a<00:05:58.770> little<00:05:58.950> bit<00:05:59.280> close<00:05:59.670> but

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
toy biz one it's a little bit close but

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.450 
toy biz one it's a little bit close but
I<00:06:00.090> think<00:06:00.450> the<00:06:00.600> tube<00:06:00.870> is<00:06:01.080> what<00:06:01.290> is<00:06:01.770> a<00:06:01.830> little<00:06:02.310> bit

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
I think the tube is what is a little bit

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.670 
I think the tube is what is a little bit
taller<00:06:02.490> and<00:06:03.180> as<00:06:03.690> you<00:06:03.750> can<00:06:03.900> see<00:06:03.930> back<00:06:04.260> here<00:06:04.500> we

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
taller and as you can see back here we

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.580 
taller and as you can see back here we
have<00:06:04.920> the<00:06:05.160> ultimate<00:06:05.600> 18<00:06:06.600> inch<00:06:06.870> spider-man

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
have the ultimate 18 inch spider-man

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.820 
have the ultimate 18 inch spider-man
which<00:06:07.800> is<00:06:08.580> super<00:06:09.030> small<00:06:09.480> but<00:06:10.050> just<00:06:10.230> to<00:06:10.380> give<00:06:10.800> a

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
which is super small but just to give a

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.550 
which is super small but just to give a
comparison<00:06:11.520> just<00:06:11.760> for<00:06:11.940> fun<00:06:12.180> and<00:06:12.510> yet<00:06:13.350> that's

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
comparison just for fun and yet that's

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.860 
comparison just for fun and yet that's
for<00:06:13.950> comparison<00:06:14.670> at<00:06:14.730> all<00:06:14.850> this<00:06:15.210> figure<00:06:15.660> is

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
for comparison at all this figure is

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.920 
for comparison at all this figure is
great<00:06:16.320> I<00:06:16.590> highly<00:06:17.340> recommend<00:06:17.490> it<00:06:18.090> even<00:06:18.840> though

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
great I highly recommend it even though

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.650 
great I highly recommend it even though
I<00:06:18.960> kind<00:06:19.200> of<00:06:19.320> missed<00:06:19.560> some<00:06:19.740> minor<00:06:20.390> details<00:06:21.390> like
