00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.330
 hi to all those and mkt today 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.730
 we find ourselves for a new video 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.809
 for a new glitch because I 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.460
 had already done on my channel but there we 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.289
 is found for a new bleach on 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.619
 advanced surf fender fashion 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.689
 so how to get out of this map 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.670
 so there you see on the gameplay the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.760
 second bar on the wall must aim 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.550
 its actually you're going to make a jump 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.950
 then a double jump and inspiring 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.660
 when you're at the fact that then I 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.610
 explain to them when you made your 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.230
 first jump when you're at the top of 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.090
 your jump to the highest we do then 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.340
 a second jump finally basically a 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.920
 second double jump and after that 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.030
 second double jump you will sprint 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.289
 in fact you're going to give a shot of 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.420
 inch forward what will you 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.910
 pass in a bath in the glitch 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.260
 in fact and in fact you're going either 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.090
 passed under the map 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.640
 you will completely go down in 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.260
 emptiness for example as the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.460
 video you're going down completely 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.500
 in the void either you are stuck at a 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.400
 place be you go if you manage 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.030
 well you 're going to be just right in 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.560
 outside the map 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.330
 but you will see the whole map then 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.490
 this glitch is achievable online 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.080
 I hope in my life with the video that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.840
 I do and not mine but 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.000
 others must surely have already 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.830
 been done I do not know but the video is going 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.210
 surely be blocks finally not the video 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.799
 is going to be blocked but I hope this 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.450
 group is going to be patched I think that very 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.590
 soon it will be and I hope 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.780
 sincerely because I see since 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.390
 some time since said that in 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.400
 a little bit more known than 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.650
 many people use it online and 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.210
 especially r &amp; d and I find it a little 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.670
 little bad and a little pity especially 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.710
 that it proves a little the weakness of the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.240
 nobody to do that online because that 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.650
 proves that he is a little bit nil and who 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.150
 forced him to slap a glitch to make 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.040
 Kill therefore there as I told you 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.660
 I'm stuck at a place I can not anymore 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.070
 move there so in fact what it takes 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.690
 make 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.310
 I respect you it is you make a 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.380
 jump when you're on top of your 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.570
 jump so at the highest you do a 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.810
 double jump with the exoskeleton and when 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.390
 so you are at most double jump 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.640
 you do a sprint ahead so with 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.980
 the exoskeleton is really 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.170
 how are you going forward and when 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.700
 you went back into glitch then 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.530
 you make a jump to avoid 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.830
 fall into the void and above the 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.350
 map 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.420
 so there a moment it will happen soon 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.680
 so you have to take the habit 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.310
 to do it so after if you want 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.380
 to do with friends 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.160
 this is funny you get out of the 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.660
 map you can go on the bridge so 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.459
 so it's pretty funny to do between 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.570
 friends but I really do not recommend 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.739
 to do it online because it's 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.350
 is enormously raging people who make 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.080
 this and I do and 7 I'm doing this video 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.070
 precisely to denounce this glitch and 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.700
 to prevent other people 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.709
 use it to the wrong way 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.140
 is going to say so here is a little bit 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.060
 galley to get into it we must 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.370
 handle the double jump especially go all 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.950
 right aim well the second pole in 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.480
 end of the second iron bar since 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.060
 this is where the 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.850
 glyph also do not rush 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.920
 so mostly targeted then you do a 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.959
 jump the double jump you go into it 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.630
 so here it is as I told you 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.560
 here we are we managed the beach we are 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.390
 above the map 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.860
 finally received just outside and in 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.910
 do we see we can shoot we can kill 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.769
 the enemies since I am I'm going 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.060
 kill many times by guys who are 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.739
 to d'ornano so here you can 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.930
 visit of the amap pay attention because 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.060
 that in some places you fall 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.380
 in the void as at the end of the video 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.170
 I will fall into the void so here we go 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.920
 there you can completely killed so if 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.280
 you do it online 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.959
 here you can kill abobo enemies 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.540
 since the enemies do not necessarily think 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.099
 not looked outside the map 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.260
 they think they already have sweet enough and 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.489
 look inside so they 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.620
 do not look outside so that's it 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.150
 it's really so in the water you 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.670
 die and then there are some to some 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.260
 places you are going to die that's where you 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.650
 are completely above it's 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.680
 really it's really a glitch that 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.409
 is awesome and a glitch that I hope is going 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.269
 soon be angry because otherwise 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.890
 it's going to do a lot of damage 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.599
 so here you go on the 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.909
 bridge just do not make the same mistake 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.680
 than me because I've gone all 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.060
 right and I should not have since since at the end 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.299
 of a moment you will fall into the 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.560
 empty 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.299
 we see you the difference in quality 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.739
 there you go right now you go 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.840
 fall into the void so 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.370
 so here we see in any case I hope 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.340
 that this video will please you I 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.110
 thanks winchester and scalp because 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.240
 it is thanks to them that I discovered this 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.099
 glyph we have them we have it has been tested in 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.810
 private and then he explained to me how the 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.370
 do and behind I wanted to do in 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.289
 video to show it to you too 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.000
 so we privately with friends 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.259
 but do not do it the weight in 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.699
 line please thank you 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.699
 go bye everyone to the next
