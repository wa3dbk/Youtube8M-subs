00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.670
 finale is afterwards inclusive of jazz and

 it was really him who was driving 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.750
 but that a person who was in his 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.299
 side 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.310
 I quickly pull the vehicle's steering 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.700
 he lost control and caused 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.070
 accident occurred he refused to do the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.110
 Breathalyzer test but even with this 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.420
 Negative clues that they were already 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.180
 enough to give a prison voice and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.400
 to make the arrest how was done paulo 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.049
 I did not want to record the interview, he was 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.700
 indicted in flagrant for driving 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.549
 intoxication and damage to property 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.460
 public is only one of the legs wins in 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.110
 thesis by the delegate by the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.720
 the police can not arbitrate the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.899
 bail and hand over our limit and only 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.310
 judicial seat that the judge may arbitrate 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.820
 the bail 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.740
 claimed that the accident was motivated by 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.729
 cause of a woman that the staff pulled 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.039
 the handbrake 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.959
 This version convinces you, then 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.940
 he claimed this was somewhat contradictory 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.470
 said that also 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.890
 would not have pulled the parking brake would have 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.200
 pulled the direction and he after all 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.230
 he did not say which of the two hypotheses is 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.390
 occurred neither named nor said the name of the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.070
 woman or where I picked her I think 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.490
 He is trying to get away from this. 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.490
