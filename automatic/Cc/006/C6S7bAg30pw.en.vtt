 gut in antutu benchmark 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:56.170
 This unit scored 14500 60 points 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:03.130
 it is good 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:05.040
 under the hood we get a video 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.190
 mali 400 accelerator 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:18.360
 quad 1 gigabyte operational 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:23.530
 memory processor turns rockchip rk 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.480
 3066 of our memory, by the way, yes 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.850
 box all at once here marked on 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:34.180
 the box says 60 gigabytes of built-in 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.940
 here are two cores with a clock frequency of 1600 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.900
 megahertz 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.330
 Well, everything seems to be a tablet equipped with two 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.000
 camera modules front camera on 0 3 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.630
 megapixel and back camera on 2 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.300
 megapixels 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.850
 Well these cameras without camera 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.910
 autofocus front is understandable only 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.980
 for this kind of talking well and 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.019
 back mostly too on her too 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.380
 beautiful photos can not make 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:07.110
 no autofocus is not well, that calves have 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:13.980
 not plays but by the way quite good tft 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:16.380
 It turns out the resolution is 1024 by 768 pixels 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.810
 8 inches 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.640
 viewing angles are lost but not so much 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.040
 especially here it is only lost from this 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.660
 flank if you look and so small screen 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.480
 good battery capacity of 5,000 mA 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.090
 stated on the site and did not do well 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:39.030
 I can tell you 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:47.350
 it turns out to be true because 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:48.850
 let's load full 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.710
 load included wi-fay but 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:55.390
 maximum brightness 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:58.750
 I lost the game 5:03 while doing that 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.190
 I have left many here have nothing to 6 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.070
 battery percent left 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:09.520
 video viewing mode on medium 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:11.350
 Brightness I looked here 5:28 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.440
 while I still have 50 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.480
 percent of brightness yes well there are movies 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.930
 at medium brightness you can watch 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:25.570
 approximately 9 10 hours and that is a great 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:29.890
 indicator but the display is not very 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.800
 bright medium colors too medium 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:38.020
 no such features are worth it 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:41.350
 wait from this tablet video pulls everything 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.710
 no problems full hd no problems normal 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.419
 video without problems well, of course, that to 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.080
 he will have to get used to it 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:53.500
 Due to the fact that we have the ratio of cranes 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:59.940
 four to three and understandable yes that movie 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:04.240
 will be terrible it corners everything goes fine 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.669
 on performance what you want 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.640
 to tell 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:13.050
 The tablet does not work smartly 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:17.979
 not smart little launcher so can 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:20.650
 slow down but it's sometimes about games 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:23.050
 I played played only two games on 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:27.220
 it is Engry Birds and the head is new 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:30.820
 Unfortunately podlyuchivaet on this 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:33.340
 tablet I do not know why now I tell you 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.760
 demonstrate it if you see 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.760
 of course 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.600
 here so the tablet very conveniently lies in 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:57.970
 a special hand like a very book 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:57.970
 convenient to take but look slows down 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:08.219
 so here but maybe it's because 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:10.619
 firmware i think on w3bsit3-dns.com you 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:12.869
 find a lot of firmware about which you can 

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:14.729
 flash this tablet because 

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:17.939
 performance such games should still 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:21.929
 quite enough but also i'm looking to have played 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:24.059
 a little bit on it the zombie second plans are 

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:26.189
 everything goes smoothly without complaints 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:29.099
 excellent on during tablet games 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:30.899
 heats it turns out on the right side 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:33.269
 here will bring here it turns out 

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:37.489
 the processor is right here but 

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:41.819
 so well heats up but because of this im 

00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:43.919
 there is no discomfort here 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:46.589
 what else to tell you think everything 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.839
 flash drive for fun inserted everything perfectly 

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:51.709
 reads all without question 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:55.709
 decided to find 

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:57.689
 well, everything seems to be okay, friends
