00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.900 

adapter<00:03:54.120> DC<00:03:54.750> DC<00:03:54.990> adapter<00:03:55.740> so<00:03:56.160> you<00:03:56.190> don't<00:03:56.640> have

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
adapter DC DC adapter so you don't have

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.380 
adapter DC DC adapter so you don't have
to<00:03:57.210> spend<00:03:57.570> more<00:03:58.380> money<00:03:58.440> on<00:03:58.920> bad<00:03:59.190> buttons<00:04:00.060> and

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
to spend more money on bad buttons and

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.280 
to spend more money on bad buttons and
this<00:04:01.260> is<00:04:01.410> supposed<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:02.070> last<00:04:02.970> for<00:04:03.330> 4000

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
this is supposed to last for 4000

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.480 
this is supposed to last for 4000
minutes<00:04:04.980> so<00:04:05.400> that's<00:04:05.610> a<00:04:05.970> lot<00:04:06.210> of<00:04:06.240> curing<00:04:06.870> time

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
minutes so that's a lot of curing time

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:15.050 
minutes so that's a lot of curing time
that's<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:09.050> LED<00:04:10.050> lamp<00:04:10.320> right<00:04:11.160> there<00:04:11.460> and<00:04:14.060> next
