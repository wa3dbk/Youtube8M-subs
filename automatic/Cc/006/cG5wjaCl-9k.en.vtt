00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello how about you guys how are you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.450
 salute johnny and in this opportunity 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.120
 I want to teach them how to install 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.090
 peaceful textures in minecraft but before 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.610
 I want to make some clarifications in the first 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.750
 instead, this type of installation is 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.720
 valid as of version 1.6 in 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.119
 further on that they will also be able to 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.240
 apply this installation method the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.779
 non-premium people and obviously the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.980
 premium so much eye with those 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.500
 clarifications 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.590
 having said that let's start with the tutorial 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.870
 first of all we have to locate a 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.329
 folder at our point minecraft already 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.440
 We obviously know how to enter the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:50.250
 route we press windows r we write 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.780
 percent app data again by 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.940
 hundred and then we give in accepting a 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.820
 Once we locate our point folder 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.370
 minecraft we will head to the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.880
 folder that says resource packs that 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.540
 we have here we enter and how can we 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.360
 watch 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.060
 the folder is empty another method of 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.090
 enter this folder much more 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.600
 direct is to address our 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.510
 minecraft to open it and good to hope that 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.790
 we are once inside to be able 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.700
 show them how we will be able to enter 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.820
 more directly once you are here 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.790
 let's go to what would be options and then to 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.490
 resource packs that says here here by 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.790
 course the text will show us the back 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.520
 by default that has minecraft and we 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.620
 we will go to the button that says open 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.290
 resort back folder we give a click 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.680
 and as we can see it takes us to the route 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.900
 that in the beginning we had entered this 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.470
 makes the power a little easier 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.070
 access this folder now for this 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.550
 tutorial 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.070
 I'm going to install this texture for 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.070
 access maybe you already know many that are 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.410
 swhat flame convert so so what 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.530
 let's do is direct us to our 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.200
 pac resurge folder and just a 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.730
 Once having our text of pax be 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.650
 whatever happens to this folder as 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.830
 we can see it 's there we're not going to 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.590
 unzip nothing we just had 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.780
 and we leave it there we can close this 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.060
 and what we are going to do now is 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.600
 direct us to our minecraft and how 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.390
 you can notice here is the texture already 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.660
 we select and it is automatically done 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.210
 the change we will give to ready then 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.980
 that we also place ready and as 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.870
 we can see in the initial part of 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.140
 our game has also been made a 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.380
 Significant change this goes hand in hand 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.090
 to the text that we just installed let's go 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.610
 now to a map that I have here 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.250
 prepared so they can see that the 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.510
 pacific texture does not have any kind of 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.430
 error so let's be able to see that here 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.850
 we have all the materials that 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.610
 we usually have in minecraft and that does not 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.430
 They present major drawback and that 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.970
 quality of the pack text maintains its 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.800
 been normal because I tell you this 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.860
 because it usually happens with some texts 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.590
 to be created is to say that no 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.310
 show as you should see the 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.280
 materials in minecraft hence there 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.000
 a program called ms to be that what 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.900
 what it does is to throw these extremes and 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.480
 they make everything go according to what 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.320
 normal this program is also 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.530
 characterizes to be able to give it more quality 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.930
 to what would be the pac texture in this 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.110
 case like I do not have any problem 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.620
 with the texture what you are going to do is 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.849
 give him 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.849
 and much more detail to the materials that 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.959
 we will be seeing in our 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.659
 game 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.810
 so let's go to the program once 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.549
 so I can explain a little more 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.760
 to leave first of our 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:18.760
 minecraft and now here on the desktop 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.150
 we can see the program that of course 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.820
 the download link next to the texture 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.979
 pack if you want to download it I'm going to 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.569
 be leaving here in the description of 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.339
 this video 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.279
 let's double click on it to be able 

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:35.649
 run the ms to be at its most 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:38.949
 recent version and as we can see here 

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:41.709
 is analyzing the yard point and has 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:44.469
 finished doing that here we are going to 

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:47.669
 leave all this as it is and what 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:50.909
 let's do is give it here apache 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:55.300
 we wait for it to finish patching 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:58.749
 this and it would simply stay then now 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:02.259
 close the program and again open 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:06.119
 our minecraft but now we're going to 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:09.939
 note that if we are going to go edit profile 

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:12.490
 in the versions we will see that it has 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:16.029
 deployed a new version that is the 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.869
 from the ms pitcher we are going to give you 6 x files and 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:18.869
 let's give the play 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.940
 we wait for our 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.940
 Minecraft 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.800
 and as you may notice there is a slight change 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:36.690
 in what is the letters it shows a little 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.840
 more detailed and not as previously 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.090
 we saw let's give a player 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.550
 we go back to our map that we were 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.380
 A while ago 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:51.110
 we simply wait for him to load 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.480
 as we can notice being here it shows 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.660
 a slight change in what is the detail 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.600
 of the clouds looks much better and has 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.210
 also increased just a little the 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.880
 detail in the materials that we 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.530
 we have here since you are going to see a lot 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.750
 best 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:11.300
 as I said earlier the mst for 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.440
 cher serves to give more quality to the 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.310
 peaceful texture 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:20.300
 as well as to be able to march 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:23.060
 pacific texture that is in poor condition and 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.360
 to be able to make it look much better 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.280
 well I hope this video was from 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.390

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:35.210
