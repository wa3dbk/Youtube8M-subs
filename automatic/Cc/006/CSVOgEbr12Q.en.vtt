00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
video the question is what is a spoon

video the question is what is a spoon
what<00:00:09.389> makes<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.110> spoon<00:00:11.360> how<00:00:12.360> far<00:00:12.630> can<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:12.840> take

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
what makes a spoon how far can you take

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.080 
what makes a spoon how far can you take
a<00:00:13.260> spoon<00:00:13.709> how<00:00:13.920> cuff<00:00:14.129> and<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.340> take<00:00:14.580> far<00:00:14.879> can

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
a spoon how cuff and you take far can

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.130 
a spoon how cuff and you take far can
you<00:00:15.180> take<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.480> design<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.530> spoons<00:00:17.869> when<00:00:18.869> does

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
you take the design of spoons when does

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.330 
you take the design of spoons when does
a<00:00:19.170> spoon<00:00:19.560> become<00:00:19.980> unfunctional<00:00:20.760> when<00:00:22.100> how<00:00:23.100> far

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
a spoon become unfunctional when how far

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.010 
a spoon become unfunctional when how far
should<00:00:23.460> one<00:00:23.670> go<00:00:23.910> with<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.120> spoon<00:00:24.480> what<00:00:24.690> can<00:00:24.960> you

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
should one go with a spoon what can you

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.850 
should one go with a spoon what can you
use<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.530> spoon<00:00:26.040> for<00:00:27.080> well<00:00:28.080> over<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.350> years<00:00:28.380> I've

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
use a spoon for well over the years I've

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.540 
use a spoon for well over the years I've
made<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.130> collection<00:00:29.910> which<00:00:30.980> are<00:00:31.980> mostly<00:00:32.309> my

made a collection which are mostly my
own<00:00:32.700> designs<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:34.190> with<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.520> tend<00:00:35.760> to

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:36.740 
own designs and with this I tend to

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.080 
own designs and with this I tend to
explore<00:00:37.740> some<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.070> those<00:00:38.160> questions<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.880> see

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
explore some of those questions and see

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.670 
explore some of those questions and see
how<00:00:39.210> far<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.630> actually<00:00:39.870> take<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.410> design

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
how far you can actually take the design

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.979 
how far you can actually take the design
of<00:00:40.860> spoons<00:00:41.270> there<00:00:42.270> are<00:00:42.360> also<00:00:44.750> quite<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.810> number

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
ordinary spoons which you can use and

it's not realistic back a bit that you

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.180 
it's not realistic back a bit that you
can<00:02:19.630> see<00:02:19.870> how<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:19.989> actually<00:02:20.640> looking<00:02:21.640> at<00:02:23.190> the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
can see how to actually looking at the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.650 
can see how to actually looking at the
fun<00:02:24.400> about<00:02:24.610> these<00:02:24.849> is<00:02:24.910> what<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.510> actually

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
fun about these is what you can actually

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.390 
fun about these is what you can actually
weave<00:02:26.140> into<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:26.980> design<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:30.010> looking<00:02:30.310> at

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
weave into the design just looking at

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.229 
weave into the design just looking at
one<00:02:30.580> side<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.150> get<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.360> very<00:02:31.599> flat<00:02:31.989> view<00:02:33.239> the

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
one side you get a very flat view the

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.559 
one side you get a very flat view the
minute<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.660> lift<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:34.989> up<00:02:36.060> I'm<00:02:37.060> going<00:02:37.269> to<00:02:37.360> see

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
minute you lift it up I'm going to see

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:50.890 
minute you lift it up I'm going to see
something<00:02:38.080> else

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:59.110 

through<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.769> end<00:02:57.040> now<00:02:58.040> how<00:02:58.250> is<00:02:58.430> this<00:02:58.670> related

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
through the end now how is this related

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.930 
through the end now how is this related
to<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:01.040> duck<00:03:02.409> that's<00:03:03.409> spoon<00:03:03.920> number<00:03:04.280> two<00:03:04.549> in<00:03:04.790> the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
to a duck that's spoon number two in the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.350 
to a duck that's spoon number two in the
same<00:03:06.790> basic<00:03:07.790> idea<00:03:08.180> if<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:08.780> look<00:03:09.019> carefully

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
same basic idea if you look carefully

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.819 
same basic idea if you look carefully
there<00:03:11.360> is<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.450> connection<00:03:11.870> perhaps<00:03:12.440> in<00:03:12.709> the

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
there is a connection perhaps in the

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:31.360 
there is a connection perhaps in the
shape<00:03:14.829> number<00:03:15.829> three<00:03:20.349> let's<00:03:21.349> turn<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:21.799> over

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:41.770 

and<00:03:32.370> here<00:03:33.080> is<00:03:34.080> our<00:03:34.290> flying<00:03:34.680> duck

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.960 

so<00:03:42.780> this<00:03:42.960> spoon<00:03:43.350> starts<00:03:44.190> offline<00:03:44.520> it<00:03:46.970> becomes

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
so this spoon starts offline it becomes

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.710 
so this spoon starts offline it becomes
this

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.350 

starts<00:03:52.680> growing<00:03:52.920> wings<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.640> finally<00:03:54.090> we<00:03:54.210> have

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
starts growing wings and finally we have

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.430 
starts growing wings and finally we have
a<00:03:54.390> full-fledged

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
a full-fledged

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.410 
a full-fledged
talk<00:03:57.020> now<00:03:58.020> this<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.860> using<00:03:59.370> cylinders<00:04:00.120> to

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
talk now this is using cylinders to

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:19.979 
talk now this is using cylinders to
explore<00:04:00.960> spoon<00:04:01.380> design

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:45.730 

again<00:04:20.709> that's<00:04:20.859> cut<00:04:21.220> from<00:04:21.430> a<00:04:21.549> cylinder

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.710 

explode<00:04:46.740> cylinders<00:04:47.280> why<00:04:47.550> not<00:04:47.850> explore<00:04:48.210> dishes

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
explode cylinders why not explore dishes

00:04:48.720 --> 00:05:00.160 
explode cylinders why not explore dishes
and<00:04:49.020> bowls<00:04:51.710> hmm

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:08.080 

another<00:05:01.170> Bowl<00:05:02.720> cut<00:05:03.720> out<00:05:03.870> to<00:05:04.080> make<00:05:04.230> a<00:05:04.260> spiral

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.910 

and<00:05:09.090> finally<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:09.990> more<00:05:10.140> practical<00:05:10.500> one

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
and finally the more practical one
