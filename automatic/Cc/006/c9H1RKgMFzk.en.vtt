just make the same exact thing and

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.620 
just make the same exact thing and

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.410 
basically have a billion xboxes out
there<00:02:09.479> calling<00:02:09.780> themselves<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.379> same<00:02:10.709> thing

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
there calling themselves the same thing

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.230 
there calling themselves the same thing
so

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
so

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.410 
so

differences<00:02:20.410> are<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:21.060> negligible<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.750> I

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
differences are so negligible that I

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.480 
differences are so negligible that I
would<00:02:24.340> say<00:02:24.580> probably<00:02:25.540> almost<00:02:26.290> every<00:02:27.130> person

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490

out<00:02:27.610> there<00:02:28.560> would<00:02:29.560> purchase<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.220> I'm<00:02:30.850> just

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
out there would purchase it I'm just

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.950 
out there would purchase it I'm just
saying<00:02:31.930> right<00:02:32.410> now<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:33.430> if<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:34.450> can<00:02:34.630> plug

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960

the<00:04:48.160> fact<00:04:48.190> that<00:04:48.490> Microsoft<00:04:49.180> doesn't<00:04:49.450> put<00:04:49.690> in

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
the fact that Microsoft doesn't put in

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.950 
the fact that Microsoft doesn't put in
on<00:04:49.930> computer<00:04:50.470> now<00:04:50.760> I<00:04:51.760> know<00:04:51.880> why<00:04:52.360> they<00:04:52.600> don't<00:04:52.750> do

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
on computer now I know why they don't do

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.650 
on computer now I know why they don't do
that<00:04:53.230> and<00:04:53.440> I<00:04:54.310> think<00:04:54.340> we<00:04:54.670> all<00:04:54.820> do<00:04:55.060> but<00:04:55.090> I'll<00:04:55.450> save

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
that and I think we all do but I'll save

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.170 
that and I think we all do but I'll save
that<00:04:55.690> for<00:04:55.900> another<00:04:56.080> day<00:04:56.380> in<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.640> end<00:04:57.790> isn't

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
that for another day in the end isn't

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.210 
that for another day in the end isn't
enough<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:59.530> keep<00:04:59.560> me<00:05:00.300> playing<00:05:01.300> xbox<00:05:01.810> alone<00:05:02.350> no

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
enough to keep me playing xbox alone no

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.000 
enough to keep me playing xbox alone no
the<00:05:03.820> only<00:05:04.000> reason<00:05:04.540> i<00:05:04.780> have<00:05:05.170> an<00:05:05.350> xbox<00:05:05.620> is

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
the only reason i have an xbox is

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.860 
the only reason i have an xbox is
because<00:05:06.340> it's<00:05:06.490> very<00:05:06.640> easy<00:05:06.910> to<00:05:07.060> record<00:05:07.480> for<00:05:07.780> me

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
because it's very easy to record for me

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.620 
because it's very easy to record for me
and<00:05:08.080> yes<00:05:09.040> it<00:05:09.250> does<00:05:09.430> have<00:05:09.640> halo<00:05:10.060> and<00:05:10.210> all<00:05:10.360> that

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
but it's just the system i got started

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.260 
but it's just the system i got started
on<00:05:13.870> if<00:05:14.140> i<00:05:14.620> started<00:05:15.010> out<00:05:15.160> with<00:05:15.280> ps3<00:05:15.640> and<00:05:16.060> had<00:05:16.240> a

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
on if i started out with ps3 and had a

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.500 
on if i started out with ps3 and had a
huge<00:05:16.780> library<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:17.640> recorded<00:05:18.640> the<00:05:18.730> ps3<00:05:19.240> real

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
huge library and recorded the ps3 real

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.680 
huge library and recorded the ps3 real
easily<00:05:20.070> i'd<00:05:21.070> be<00:05:21.310> on<00:05:21.460> that<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:22.180> same<00:05:22.450> thing

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
easily i'd be on that the same thing

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.050 
easily i'd be on that the same thing
with<00:05:22.840> ps3<00:05:23.170> it's<00:05:23.560> got<00:05:23.710> Killzone<00:05:24.310> god<00:05:24.640> of<00:05:24.850> war

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
with ps3 it's got Killzone god of war

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.480 
with ps3 it's got Killzone god of war
and<00:05:25.330> several<00:05:26.200> other<00:05:26.410> games<00:05:26.770> like<00:05:26.920> that<00:05:27.070> isn't

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
and several other games like that isn't

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.400 
and several other games like that isn't
enough<00:05:27.760> to<00:05:28.090> hold<00:05:28.240> people<00:05:28.450> I<00:05:28.750> really<00:05:29.290> don't

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
enough to hold people I really don't

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.470 
enough to hold people I really don't
think<00:05:29.560> so<00:05:29.800> if<00:05:29.980> steam<00:05:30.370> started<00:05:30.910> charging

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
think so if steam started charging

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.450 
think so if steam started charging
ridiculously<00:05:32.350> low<00:05:32.620> rates<00:05:32.890> for<00:05:33.130> games<00:05:33.340> like

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
ridiculously low rates for games like

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.630 
ridiculously low rates for games like

trophies draw me now the only thing that
may<00:06:02.910> stop<00:06:03.910> this<00:06:04.360> is<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:05.080> fact<00:06:05.290> that<00:06:05.410> Nintendo

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
may stop this is the fact that Nintendo

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.820 
may stop this is the fact that Nintendo
would<00:06:06.460> give<00:06:07.180> it<00:06:07.330> some<00:06:07.510> competition<00:06:08.230> but<00:06:08.710> in

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
would give it some competition but in

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.040 
would give it some competition but in
the<00:06:08.950> end<00:06:08.980> I'm<00:06:09.550> not<00:06:10.240> one<00:06:10.390> hundred<00:06:10.510> percent<00:06:10.690> sure

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
the end I'm not one hundred percent sure

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.440 
the end I'm not one hundred percent sure
if<00:06:11.350> Nintendo<00:06:11.830> could<00:06:12.010> kill<00:06:12.220> it<00:06:12.400> sure<00:06:12.880> Nintendo

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
if Nintendo could kill it sure Nintendo

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.960
