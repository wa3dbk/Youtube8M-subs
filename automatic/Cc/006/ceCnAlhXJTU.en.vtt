I've cut some traps today we've got
several<00:00:41.409> moles<00:00:41.739> here<00:00:41.979> that<00:00:42.159> we've<00:00:42.839> caught<00:00:43.839> in

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
several moles here that we've caught in

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.239 
several moles here that we've caught in
our<00:00:44.109> traps<00:00:44.409> I'm<00:00:44.979> going<00:00:45.219> to<00:00:45.339> I'll<00:00:46.300> go<00:00:46.479> ahead<00:00:46.659> and

our traps I'm going to I'll go ahead and
I'll<00:00:48.249> show<00:00:48.399> you<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.579> trap<00:00:48.819> I'll<00:00:49.059> show<00:00:49.179> you<00:00:49.269> how

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
I'll show you the trap I'll show you how

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.090 
I'll show you the trap I'll show you how
to<00:00:49.449> set<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.719> trap<00:00:49.929> and<00:00:50.199> then<00:00:50.319> I'll<00:00:50.409> cut<00:00:50.949> in

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
to set the trap and then I'll cut in

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.090 
to set the trap and then I'll cut in
some<00:00:51.339> video<00:00:51.819> of<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.989> setups<00:00:53.769> that<00:00:53.829> we<00:00:53.949> did<00:00:54.069> a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
some video of the setups that we did a

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.799 
some video of the setups that we did a
few<00:00:54.249> days<00:00:54.399> ago<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:55.089> then<00:00:55.179> I'll<00:00:55.269> also<00:00:55.449> put<00:00:55.690> in

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
few days ago and then I'll also put in

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.169 
few days ago and then I'll also put in
some<00:00:55.959> video<00:00:56.229> of<00:00:56.559> earlier<00:00:57.370> today<00:00:57.639> when<00:00:57.850> I

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
some video of earlier today when I

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.199 
some video of earlier today when I
pulled<00:00:58.449> these<00:00:58.600> moles<00:00:58.809> out<00:00:58.959> of<00:00:59.109> the<00:00:59.170> ground<00:01:00.209> all

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:01.209 
pulled these moles out of the ground all

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:03.270 
pulled these moles out of the ground all
right<00:01:01.269> there<00:01:01.539> so<00:01:01.719> here's<00:01:01.959> a<00:01:02.019> here's<00:01:02.979> a<00:01:03.100> run

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
right there so here's a here's a run

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.680 
right there so here's a here's a run
we're<00:01:03.399> going<00:01:03.519> to<00:01:03.579> set<00:01:03.819> on<00:01:03.969> right<00:01:04.210> it<00:01:04.479> comes

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
we're going to set on right it comes

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.810 
we're going to set on right it comes
again<00:01:05.650> it's<00:01:05.979> a<00:01:06.010> little<00:01:06.220> hard<00:01:06.369> to<00:01:06.490> see<00:01:06.670> because

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
again it's a little hard to see because

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.210 
again it's a little hard to see because
it's<00:01:07.090> been<00:01:07.240> raining<00:01:07.479> but<00:01:07.780> you<00:01:07.930> can<00:01:08.110> see<00:01:08.350> this

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
it's been raining but you can see this

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.530 
it's been raining but you can see this
is<00:01:09.400> a<00:01:09.430> mole<00:01:09.700> run<00:01:09.970> coming<00:01:10.270> through<00:01:10.570> here<00:01:11.050> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
is a mole run coming through here and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.210 
is a mole run coming through here and
this<00:01:13.540> is<00:01:13.750> this<00:01:13.960> is<00:01:14.020> mole<00:01:14.350> activity<00:01:14.980> through

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
this is this is mole activity through

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.540 
this is this is mole activity through
here<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:17.560> is<00:01:17.740> a<00:01:17.770> little<00:01:18.010> raised<00:01:18.250> bump

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
here and this is a little raised bump

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.040 
here and this is a little raised bump
from<00:01:18.730> the<00:01:18.910> moles<00:01:19.120> and<00:01:19.390> in<00:01:19.510> a<00:01:19.630> mole<00:01:19.810> that's<00:01:19.930> a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
from the moles and in a mole that's a

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.540 
from the moles and in a mole that's a
mole<00:01:20.230> run<00:01:20.410> that<00:01:20.560> comes<00:01:20.770> right<00:01:20.950> between<00:01:21.160> these

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
mole run that comes right between these

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.690 
mole run that comes right between these
two<00:01:22.440> paving<00:01:23.440> stones<00:01:23.740> these<00:01:24.160> landscape

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
two paving stones these landscape

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.760 
two paving stones these landscape
elements<00:01:24.880> here<00:01:25.510> and<00:01:25.690> this<00:01:26.470> is<00:01:26.590> not<00:01:26.740> a

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
elements here and this is not a

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.320 
elements here and this is not a
meandering<00:01:27.340> tunnel<00:01:27.670> it's<00:01:27.850> going<00:01:28.090> straight

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
meandering tunnel it's going straight

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.800 
meandering tunnel it's going straight
along<00:01:28.660> the<00:01:28.840> edges<00:01:29.080> of<00:01:29.110> these<00:01:29.320> barriers<00:01:29.740> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
along the edges of these barriers and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.150 
along the edges of these barriers and
probably<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:31.870> tunnel<00:01:32.710> that's<00:01:32.830> going<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.010> get

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
probably a tunnel that's going to get

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.980 
probably a tunnel that's going to get
reused<00:01:33.520> repeatedly<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.630> should<00:01:34.840> be<00:01:34.960> a

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
reused repeatedly and it should be a

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.620 
reused repeatedly and it should be a
good<00:01:35.200> place<00:01:35.470> to<00:01:35.740> set<00:01:36.220> up<00:01:36.250> here<00:01:36.670> let<00:01:37.360> me<00:01:37.390> get<00:01:37.510> my

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
good place to set up here let me get my

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.590 
good place to set up here let me get my
camera<00:01:38.020> set<00:01:38.230> up<00:01:38.380> here<00:01:38.650> and<00:01:39.630> alright<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:42.600> I'm

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
camera set up here and alright so I'm

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.110 
camera set up here and alright so I'm
just<00:01:43.660> going<00:01:43.960> to<00:01:44.050> go<00:01:44.230> here's<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.680> run<00:01:45.280> right<00:01:45.760> here

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
just going to go here's a run right here

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.870 
just going to go here's a run right here
and<00:01:46.630> I'm<00:01:47.290> going<00:01:47.470> to<00:01:47.530> go<00:01:47.680> ahead<00:01:47.800> and<00:01:48.040> just<00:01:48.159> dig

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
and I'm going to go ahead and just dig

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.149 
and I'm going to go ahead and just dig
in<00:01:49.060> here<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.420> see<00:01:49.600> what<00:01:49.780> this<00:01:49.960> see<00:01:50.860> what<00:01:51.010> these

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
in here and see what this see what these

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.120 
in here and see what this see what these
look<00:01:51.340> like<00:01:51.400> underground<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:53.560> this<00:01:53.710> case<00:01:53.920> it's

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
look like underground in this case it's

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.410 
look like underground in this case it's
a<00:01:54.190> little<00:01:54.430> bit<00:01:54.550> hard<00:01:54.760> to<00:01:54.790> tell<00:01:55.060> what's<00:01:55.270> the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
a little bit hard to tell what's the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.300 
a little bit hard to tell what's the
freshest<00:01:55.840> on<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.110> surface<00:01:56.500> because<00:01:56.860> it<00:01:57.159> has

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
freshest on the surface because it has

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.550 
freshest on the surface because it has
been<00:01:57.550> raining<00:01:57.790> but<00:01:58.570> once<00:01:58.780> we<00:01:58.960> open<00:01:59.380> these<00:01:59.500> up

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
been raining but once we open these up

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.950 
been raining but once we open these up
we<00:01:59.950> shouldn't<00:02:00.280> be<00:02:00.430> able<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.670> tell<00:02:00.909> by<00:02:01.180> how

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
we shouldn't be able to tell by how

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.920 
we shouldn't be able to tell by how
smooth<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.860> walls<00:02:03.220> of<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.520> tunnel<00:02:03.700> are<00:02:04.030> was

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
smooth the walls of the tunnel are was

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.899 
smooth the walls of the tunnel are was
these<00:02:05.170> tunnels<00:02:05.830> have<00:02:05.950> been<00:02:05.979> used<00:02:06.610> recently

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
these tunnels have been used recently

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.850 
these tunnels have been used recently
and

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.230 

yeah<00:02:10.640> here<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.060> it's<00:02:12.610> it's<00:02:13.610> back<00:02:13.910> under

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
yeah here it is it's it's back under

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.030 
yeah here it is it's it's back under
here<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.450> little<00:02:14.600> ways<00:02:17.380> but<00:02:18.380> here's<00:02:18.590> his<00:02:18.740> tunnel

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
here a little ways but here's his tunnel

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.330 
here a little ways but here's his tunnel
and<00:02:19.400> this<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:20.120> actually<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.450> very<00:02:20.630> good<00:02:20.690> tunnel

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
and this is actually a very good tunnel

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.720 
and this is actually a very good tunnel
let<00:02:22.340> me<00:02:22.430> grab<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.060> camera<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:24.070> show<00:02:25.070> this<00:02:25.490> to

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
let me grab the camera and show this to

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:37.390 
let me grab the camera and show this to
you<00:02:34.240> and<00:02:35.240> show<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.050> there's<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.980> ton<00:02:37.370> of

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
you and show it to you there's a ton of

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.700 
you and show it to you there's a ton of
there<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.090> these<00:02:38.690> Mole<00:02:39.020> tunnels<00:02:39.410> are<00:02:39.560> not

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
there and these Mole tunnels are not

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.530 
there and these Mole tunnels are not
very<00:02:39.950> big<00:02:40.220> they're<00:02:40.430> maybe<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.760> couple<00:02:41.270> inches

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
very big they're maybe a couple inches

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.110 
very big they're maybe a couple inches
in<00:02:41.810> diameter<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:42.530> again<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.550> may<00:02:43.700> be<00:02:43.730> hard<00:02:44.060> to

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
in diameter and again it may be hard to

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.940 
in diameter and again it may be hard to
see<00:02:44.210> down<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:44.990> that<00:02:45.050> dark<00:02:45.260> tunnel<00:02:45.530> but<00:02:45.830> the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
see down in that dark tunnel but the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.580 
see down in that dark tunnel but the
walls<00:02:46.280> of<00:02:47.030> these<00:02:47.360> tunnels<00:02:47.630> are<00:02:47.930> very<00:02:48.140> smooth

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
walls of these tunnels are very smooth

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.500 
walls of these tunnels are very smooth
which<00:02:49.340> indicates<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.910> mole<00:02:50.090> has<00:02:50.270> come

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
which indicates the mole has come

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.490 
which indicates the mole has come
through<00:02:50.690> this<00:02:50.930> come<00:02:51.200> through<00:02:51.230> there

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
through this come through there

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.130 
through this come through there
repeatedly<00:02:52.070> recently<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.930> one

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
repeatedly recently and that is one

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.590 
repeatedly recently and that is one
thing<00:02:54.320> I<00:02:54.410> look<00:02:54.590> for<00:02:54.650> in<00:02:55.100> determining<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.209> good

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
thing I look for in determining a good

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.320 
thing I look for in determining a good
place<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:56.780> set<00:02:57.050> traps<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.880> let<00:02:59.000> me<00:02:59.060> go<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.240> get

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
place to set traps so let me go and get

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.940 
place to set traps so let me go and get
the<00:02:59.450> camera<00:02:59.630> back<00:02:59.810> on<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.050> tripod<00:03:00.260> here<00:03:00.740> and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
the camera back on the tripod here and

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.270 
the camera back on the tripod here and
I'll<00:03:01.190> go<00:03:01.580> ahead<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.820> do<00:03:01.880> this<00:03:02.380> okay<00:03:03.380> here<00:03:04.130> we

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
I'll go ahead and do this okay here we

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.250 
I'll go ahead and do this okay here we
are<00:03:04.310> we've<00:03:04.850> got<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.060> tunnel<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.780> runs<00:03:05.840> right

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
are we've got a tunnel that runs right

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.340 
are we've got a tunnel that runs right
along<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.620> edge<00:03:06.770> of<00:03:07.100> this<00:03:07.880> cement<00:03:08.240> and<00:03:09.170> I'm

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
along the edge of this cement and I'm

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.800 
along the edge of this cement and I'm
going<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.560> go<00:03:09.620> ahead<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:09.890> set<00:03:10.100> a<00:03:10.820> trap<00:03:11.510> in<00:03:11.690> each

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
going to go ahead and set a trap in each

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.280 
going to go ahead and set a trap in each
direction<00:03:12.050> in<00:03:12.470> this<00:03:12.590> tunnel<00:03:13.989> go<00:03:14.989> ahead<00:03:15.170> and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
direction in this tunnel go ahead and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.500 
direction in this tunnel go ahead and
I've<00:03:15.650> got<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:15.980> separate<00:03:16.340> video<00:03:16.580> on<00:03:16.640> how<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.239> set

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
I've got a separate video on how to set

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.660 
I've got a separate video on how to set
the<00:03:17.630> trap<00:03:17.840> but<00:03:18.080> I'll<00:03:18.170> go<00:03:18.320> ahead<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.650> get<00:03:19.459> this

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
the trap but I'll go ahead and get this

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.810 
the trap but I'll go ahead and get this
set<00:03:19.970> up<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.920> set<00:03:22.370> up<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.640> ready<00:03:22.760> to

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
set up and that is set up and ready to

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.550 
set up and that is set up and ready to
go<00:03:23.000> now<00:03:23.180> when<00:03:23.330> I<00:03:23.360> place<00:03:23.660> these<00:03:23.840> in<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.080> tunnels

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
go now when I place these in the tunnels

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.280 
go now when I place these in the tunnels
I<00:03:24.680> hold<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.550> trap<00:03:25.820> with<00:03:26.209> my<00:03:26.420> fingers<00:03:26.840> by<00:03:27.230> this

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
I hold the trap with my fingers by this

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.270 
I hold the trap with my fingers by this
spring<00:03:28.540> winder<00:03:29.540> handle<00:03:30.050> and<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.739> also<00:03:30.890> put<00:03:31.130> my

spring winder handle and I also put my
money<00:03:31.790> finger<00:03:32.209> against<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.630> back<00:03:32.810> of<00:03:32.840> this

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
money finger against the back of this

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.020 
money finger against the back of this
trigger<00:03:33.380> pan<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:34.250> prevent<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.670> from<00:03:34.700> moving

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
trigger pan to prevent it from moving

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.910 
trigger pan to prevent it from moving
backwards<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.930> having<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.230> trap<00:03:36.440> spring<00:03:36.709> as

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
backwards and having the trap spring as

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.340 
backwards and having the trap spring as
I<00:03:37.040> push<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.250> trap<00:03:37.550> in<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.820> tunnel<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:39.170> these

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
I push the trap in the tunnel and these

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.670 
I push the trap in the tunnel and these
just<00:03:39.650> fit<00:03:39.890> in<00:03:40.040> there<00:03:40.220> you<00:03:40.400> have<00:03:40.550> to<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:42.560> have

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
just fit in there you have to you have

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.199 
just fit in there you have to you have
to<00:03:42.800> move<00:03:42.920> them<00:03:43.100> around<00:03:43.160> a<00:03:43.430> little<00:03:43.580> bit<00:03:43.820> and<00:03:44.060> get

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
to move them around a little bit and get

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.820 
to move them around a little bit and get
them<00:03:44.360> in<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.540> tunnel<00:03:44.750> but<00:03:45.200> if<00:03:45.380> you<00:03:45.470> keep<00:03:45.680> your

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
them in the tunnel but if you keep your

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.199 
them in the tunnel but if you keep your
hand<00:03:45.980> against<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.430> trigger<00:03:46.700> pan<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.090> can

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
hand against that trigger pan you can

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.360 
hand against that trigger pan you can
just<00:03:47.420> push<00:03:47.660> them<00:03:47.810> right<00:03:47.840> in<00:03:48.110> there<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:48.530> that's

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
just push them right in there and that's

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.140 
just push them right in there and that's
set<00:03:50.269> up<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:50.540> ready<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:50.750> go<00:03:51.850> I'll<00:03:52.850> get<00:03:53.000> this

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
set up and ready to go I'll get this

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.670 
set up and ready to go I'll get this
other<00:03:53.330> guy<00:03:53.540> going<00:03:53.870> in<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.080> other<00:03:54.200> direction

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
other guy going in the other direction

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:07.640 
other guy going in the other direction
here

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.039 

now<00:04:08.190> maybe<00:04:08.580> you<00:04:08.700> can<00:04:08.849> see<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.150> here<00:04:09.450> when<00:04:10.019> I

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
now maybe you can see this here when I

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.320 
now maybe you can see this here when I
at<00:04:10.560> once<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:11.010> placed<00:04:11.430> these<00:04:11.580> in<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.849> tunnel

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
at once I placed these in the tunnel

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.420 
at once I placed these in the tunnel
I<00:04:12.360> bet<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.080> trap<00:04:13.319> a<00:04:13.349> little<00:04:13.560> bit<00:04:13.799> by<00:04:13.950> pushing

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
I bet the trap a little bit by pushing

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.780 
I bet the trap a little bit by pushing
downwards<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.150> forwards<00:04:15.629> on<00:04:15.780> this<00:04:16.609> on<00:04:17.609> the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
downwards and forwards on this on the

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.490 
downwards and forwards on this on the
handle<00:04:18.180> of<00:04:18.329> the<00:04:18.389> spring<00:04:18.810> winder<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.380> that

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
handle of the spring winder and that

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.680 
handle of the spring winder and that
kind<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:19.769> drives<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.910> kind<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.209> rocks<00:04:21.419> the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
kind of drives that it kind of rocks the

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.750 
kind of drives that it kind of rocks the
trap<00:04:21.900> forward<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.440> drives<00:04:22.650> front<00:04:23.220> times<00:04:23.460> down

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
trap forward and drives front times down

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.219 
trap forward and drives front times down
into<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.120> soil<00:04:24.270> just<00:04:24.419> a<00:04:24.630> little<00:04:24.840> bit<00:04:25.020> which

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
into the soil just a little bit which

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.350 
into the soil just a little bit which
helps<00:04:25.500> stabilize<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:26.100> trap<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.610> make<00:04:27.180> it

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
helps stabilize the trap and make it

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.240 
helps stabilize the trap and make it
less<00:04:27.540> perceptible<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.380> mole<00:04:28.650> more<00:04:28.919> likely

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
less perceptible to the mole more likely

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.740 
less perceptible to the mole more likely
you'll<00:04:29.370> get<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.550> catch<00:04:29.820> on<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.120> mole<00:04:30.330> and

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
you'll get a catch on the mole and

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.159 
you'll get a catch on the mole and
that's<00:04:31.710> what<00:04:31.979> I'm<00:04:32.070> doing<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.490> air<00:04:32.990> those<00:04:33.990> are

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
that's what I'm doing the air those are

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.270 
that's what I'm doing the air those are
ready<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.440> go<00:04:34.620> I'll<00:04:35.370> put<00:04:35.430> a<00:04:35.669> a<00:04:36.949> couple<00:04:37.949> of<00:04:38.040> flags

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
ready to go I'll put a a couple of flags

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.189 
ready to go I'll put a a couple of flags
in<00:04:38.580> here<00:04:38.790> so<00:04:38.970> that<00:04:39.000> we<00:04:39.240> can<00:04:39.419> find<00:04:39.750> our<00:04:39.930> traps

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
in here so that we can find our traps

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.490 
in here so that we can find our traps
again<00:04:40.580> no<00:04:41.580> bait<00:04:41.850> on<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.150> mole<00:04:42.330> traps<00:04:42.660> just<00:04:43.020> go

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
again no bait on the mole traps just go

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.920 
again no bait on the mole traps just go
in<00:04:43.650> like<00:04:43.860> that<00:04:44.000> when<00:04:45.000> you<00:04:45.120> cover<00:04:45.479> these<00:04:45.690> back

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
in like that when you cover these back

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.379 
in like that when you cover these back
up<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.320> want<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.620> be<00:04:47.190> a<00:04:47.220> little<00:04:47.430> cautious<00:04:47.729> not

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
up you want to be a little cautious not

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.800 
up you want to be a little cautious not
to<00:04:48.690> move<00:04:49.139> the<00:04:49.560> traps<00:04:49.979> out<00:04:50.220> of<00:04:50.250> position<00:04:50.850> the

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
to move the traps out of position the

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.540 
to move the traps out of position the
tethers<00:04:52.199> I<00:04:52.320> use<00:04:52.530> are<00:04:52.710> very<00:04:52.740> short<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:53.430> lay

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
tethers I use are very short and lay

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.189 
tethers I use are very short and lay
right<00:04:53.789> on<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:54.060> grounds<00:04:54.510> that<00:04:54.539> does<00:04:54.810> not<00:04:55.020> to

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
right on the grounds that does not to

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.810 
right on the grounds that does not to
happen<00:04:55.500> but<00:04:55.620> if<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:55.830> have<00:04:55.979> a<00:04:56.010> longer<00:04:56.460> string

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
happen but if you have a longer string

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.460 
happen but if you have a longer string
and<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.120> put<00:04:57.360> dirt<00:04:57.539> on<00:04:57.690> top<00:04:57.840> of<00:04:58.050> that<00:04:58.139> string

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
and you put dirt on top of that string

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.460 
and you put dirt on top of that string
it<00:04:58.590> may<00:04:58.850> pull<00:04:59.850> the<00:04:59.970> trap<00:05:00.240> out<00:05:00.479> of<00:05:00.630> its<00:05:00.780> bedded

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
it may pull the trap out of its bedded

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.719 
it may pull the trap out of its bedded
position<00:05:01.979> and<00:05:02.100> you<00:05:02.160> don't<00:05:02.310> want<00:05:02.430> that<00:05:02.550> to

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
position and you don't want that to

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:03.080 
position and you don't want that to
happen

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
happen

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.810 
happen
so<00:05:03.990> be<00:05:04.139> a<00:05:04.169> little<00:05:04.199> careful<00:05:04.470> with<00:05:04.770> that<00:05:04.919> and

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
so be a little careful with that and

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.659 
so be a little careful with that and
I've<00:05:06.090> just<00:05:06.800> refill<00:05:07.800> this<00:05:07.949> right<00:05:08.220> back<00:05:08.430> over

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
I've just refill this right back over

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.100 
I've just refill this right back over
the<00:05:08.880> traps<00:05:09.500> like<00:05:10.500> that<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:11.870> filter<00:05:12.870> a<00:05:12.900> little

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
the traps like that and filter a little

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.230 
the traps like that and filter a little
dirt<00:05:13.289> over<00:05:13.590> there<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:14.010> that's<00:05:14.460> that<00:05:14.910> set<00:05:15.150> up

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
dirt over there and that's that set up

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.360 
dirt over there and that's that set up
and<00:05:15.389> ready<00:05:15.539> to<00:05:15.630> go<00:05:15.889> we'll<00:05:16.889> go<00:05:17.010> on<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.220> do<00:05:17.340> a

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
and ready to go we'll go on and do a

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.200 
and ready to go we'll go on and do a
couple<00:05:17.840> all<00:05:18.840> right<00:05:19.010> here<00:05:20.010> at<00:05:20.220> a<00:05:20.250> setup<00:05:20.880> that<00:05:21.000> we

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
couple all right here at a setup that we

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.790 
couple all right here at a setup that we
did<00:05:21.479> a<00:05:21.810> few<00:05:22.080> days<00:05:22.260> ago<00:05:23.900> it's<00:05:24.900> been<00:05:25.169> raining<00:05:25.470> and

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
did a few days ago it's been raining and

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.409 
did a few days ago it's been raining and
I<00:05:25.889> haven't<00:05:26.190> checked<00:05:26.490> these<00:05:26.700> for<00:05:26.940> several<00:05:27.270> days

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
I haven't checked these for several days

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.300 
I haven't checked these for several days
so<00:05:27.630> I'll<00:05:27.690> one<00:05:27.900> of<00:05:28.020> these<00:05:28.139> guys<00:05:28.380> if<00:05:29.010> there<00:05:29.160> are

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
so I'll one of these guys if there are

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.310 
so I'll one of these guys if there are
moles<00:05:29.520> in<00:05:29.669> here<00:05:29.849> they<00:05:30.479> may<00:05:30.690> be<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.870> little<00:05:31.080> past

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
moles in here they may be a little past

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.830 
moles in here they may be a little past
their<00:05:31.530> sell-by<00:05:31.740> dates<00:05:32.389> though<00:05:33.389> it's<00:05:33.599> it's

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
their sell-by dates though it's it's

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.469 
their sell-by dates though it's it's
winter<00:05:34.139> and<00:05:34.169> it's<00:05:34.349> cold<00:05:35.180> so<00:05:36.180> they<00:05:36.330> usually

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
winter and it's cold so they usually

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.379 
winter and it's cold so they usually
don't<00:05:36.750> decompose<00:05:37.050> too<00:05:37.440> badly<00:05:38.120> but<00:05:39.120> again<00:05:39.300> I've

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
don't decompose too badly but again I've

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:40.760 
don't decompose too badly but again I've
got<00:05:39.479> two<00:05:39.630> flags<00:05:39.900> here<00:05:40.080> I've<00:05:40.169> got<00:05:40.320> two<00:05:40.440> traps

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
got two flags here I've got two traps

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.040 
got two flags here I've got two traps
that<00:05:41.099> one<00:05:41.820> in<00:05:41.940> each<00:05:42.030> direction<00:05:42.060> in<00:05:42.660> these<00:05:42.810> two

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
that one in each direction in these two

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.290 
that one in each direction in these two
tunnels<00:05:43.320> and<00:05:44.039> I'm<00:05:44.550> just<00:05:44.669> going<00:05:44.789> to<00:05:44.880> dig<00:05:45.090> these

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
tunnels and I'm just going to dig these

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.850 
tunnels and I'm just going to dig these
out<00:05:46.190> and<00:05:47.190> see<00:05:47.250> what<00:05:47.729> we<00:05:47.880> got<00:05:48.090> here

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
out and see what we got here

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:56.550 
out and see what we got here
and

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.749 

that's<00:05:57.560> how<00:05:57.710> I<00:05:57.740> just<00:05:57.979> pull<00:05:58.220> these<00:05:58.340> out<00:05:58.490> by<00:05:58.699> the

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
that's how I just pull these out by the

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:03.029 
that's how I just pull these out by the
kale<00:05:59.000> app<00:05:59.150> there's<00:05:59.449> a<00:05:59.889> there<00:06:00.889> he<00:06:01.039> is

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
kale app there's a there he is

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.129 
kale app there's a there he is
so<00:06:04.039> that<00:06:04.280> is<00:06:04.490> the<00:06:05.000> broad<00:06:05.150> footed<00:06:05.630> mole<00:06:05.810> here

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
so that is the broad footed mole here

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.939 
so that is the broad footed mole here
and<00:06:08.050> occasionally<00:06:09.050> we'll<00:06:09.139> get<00:06:09.289> a<00:06:09.349> couple<00:06:09.860> of

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:09.949 
and occasionally we'll get a couple of

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.510 
and occasionally we'll get a couple of
them<00:06:10.069> in<00:06:10.250> here<00:06:10.669> and<00:06:11.860> we<00:06:12.860> do<00:06:13.009> in<00:06:13.130> this<00:06:13.280> case

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
them in here and we do in this case

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.020 
them in here and we do in this case
actually<00:06:14.979> so<00:06:15.979> in<00:06:16.310> February<00:06:16.520> I<00:06:16.759> don't<00:06:16.910> get<00:06:17.000> a

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
actually so in February I don't get a

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.180 
actually so in February I don't get a
lot<00:06:17.180> of<00:06:17.240> doubles<00:06:17.599> like<00:06:17.750> this<00:06:18.050> I<00:06:18.380> do<00:06:18.620> in<00:06:18.949> March

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
lot of doubles like this I do in March

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.070 
lot of doubles like this I do in March
April<00:06:19.430> May<00:06:19.639> June<00:06:19.759> when<00:06:20.360> they're<00:06:20.509> mole

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
April May June when they're mole

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.070 
April May June when they're mole
populations<00:06:21.710> are<00:06:21.830> really<00:06:22.069> high<00:06:22.750> but<00:06:23.750> we're

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
populations are really high but we're

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.600 
populations are really high but we're
getting<00:06:24.349> into<00:06:24.530> the<00:06:24.590> middle<00:06:24.740> of<00:06:24.889> February<00:06:25.340> and

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
getting into the middle of February and

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.040 
getting into the middle of February and
they're<00:06:25.789> they're<00:06:26.150> into<00:06:26.570> they're<00:06:26.720> probably

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
they're they're into they're probably

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.839 
they're they're into they're probably
into<00:06:27.289> their<00:06:27.380> breeding<00:06:27.620> season<00:06:28.130> and<00:06:28.310> they're

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 
into their breeding season and they're

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:30.370 
into their breeding season and they're
very<00:06:29.060> active<00:06:29.300> I<00:06:29.780> don't<00:06:30.080> think<00:06:30.229> they<00:06:30.289> have

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
very active I don't think they have

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.080 
very active I don't think they have
young<00:06:30.560> ones<00:06:30.740> yet<00:06:31.039> but<00:06:31.250> they<00:06:31.370> are<00:06:31.400> very<00:06:31.729> active

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
young ones yet but they are very active

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.110 
young ones yet but they are very active
in<00:06:32.150> the<00:06:32.210> winter<00:06:32.599> in<00:06:32.870> the<00:06:32.900> breeding<00:06:33.470> season<00:06:33.620> and

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
in the winter in the breeding season and

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.249 
in the winter in the breeding season and
they're<00:06:35.120> moving<00:06:35.419> through<00:06:35.539> these<00:06:35.690> tunnels<00:06:36.110> and

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:36.259 
they're moving through these tunnels and

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:38.710 
they're moving through these tunnels and
that's<00:06:36.740> the<00:06:36.889> results<00:06:37.340> so<00:06:38.120> I'm<00:06:38.360> not<00:06:38.509> going<00:06:38.660> to

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
that's the results so I'm not going to

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.510 
that's the results so I'm not going to
reset<00:06:38.990> on<00:06:39.080> this<00:06:39.229> particular<00:06:39.680> location<00:06:39.830> I'm

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
reset on this particular location I'm

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.499 
reset on this particular location I'm
going<00:06:40.580> to<00:06:40.729> look<00:06:40.849> around<00:06:40.940> see<00:06:41.270> if<00:06:41.300> there's

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:41.509 
going to look around see if there's

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:44.560 
going to look around see if there's
fresh<00:06:41.990> activity
