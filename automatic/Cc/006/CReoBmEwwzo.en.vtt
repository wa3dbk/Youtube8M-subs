00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
one but it's it's certainly up there at

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.080 
one but it's it's certainly up there at
the<00:02:31.150> top<00:02:31.360> it's<00:02:31.660> better<00:02:31.870> than<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.820> prefer<00:02:33.820> this

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
the top it's better than I prefer this

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.050 
the top it's better than I prefer this
over<00:02:34.150> things<00:02:34.690> like<00:02:34.810> from<00:02:35.460> Asylum<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:36.730> hot<00:02:36.940> in

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
over things like from Asylum and hot in

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.330 
over things like from Asylum and hot in
the<00:02:37.090> shade<00:02:37.530> crazy<00:02:38.530> nights<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:39.070> think<00:02:39.220> it's

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
the shade crazy nights I think it's

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.080 
the shade crazy nights I think it's
better<00:02:39.490> than<00:02:39.610> any<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.910> those<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.880> better

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
better than any of those is it better

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.420 
better than any of those is it better
than<00:02:43.150> sonic<00:02:43.630> boom<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:44.440> think<00:02:45.040> it's<00:02:45.160> at<00:02:45.250> least

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
than sonic boom I think it's at least

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.300 
than sonic boom I think it's at least
equal<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.790> sonic<00:02:46.180> boom<00:02:46.390> for<00:02:47.290> sure<00:02:47.470> maybe<00:02:48.190> a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
equal to sonic boom for sure maybe a

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.770 
equal to sonic boom for sure maybe a
little<00:02:48.490> better<00:02:48.670> musically<00:02:49.270> than<00:02:49.540> although

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
little better musically than although

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.370 
little better musically than although
it's<00:02:49.930> not<00:02:50.110> packaged<00:02:50.590> as<00:02:50.740> nicely<00:02:52.050> but<00:02:53.050> anyway

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
it's not packaged as nicely but anyway

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.040 
it's not packaged as nicely but anyway
