00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.030
 hi samantha of proméxico 1 and today they 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.129
 I want to talk a little about which 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.379
 spend and that does not consist in the 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.660
 possibility of buying all 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.150
 products of any brand as it is 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.670
 very nice but if you do not know what 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.110
 spend on that they can save a little 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.119
 Well, I hope this guide can help you 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.610
 serve and most of all I do not like to say 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.619
 as a brand in particular tell them if 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.960
 buy this brand do not buy from that 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.300
 because I think all brands have 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.920
 certain good products but the only thing 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.200
 that this must be fixed is in the 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.270
 ingredients that handle there are products 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.399
 for example that they have lots of 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.200
 lead is not that all the products 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.700
 Chinese have lead but many of the 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.140
 factories of it do not take care 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.329
 enough and good because you're 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.430
 little by little intoxicating some lipsticks 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.219
 also of very high duration that's why 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.360
 because they have a lot of lead 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.950
 then you have to be very careful what 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.489
 that we are applying there is also 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.070
 to see a little each time when the 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.740
 makeups for example the mascara that does not 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.960
 I would recommend both buying a mascara 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.670
 very expensive if every three months is what 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.140
 It is advisable to change a mascara since 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.120
 depression many bacteria 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.520
 It would be like throwing money every three months 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.430
 if you can issue the possibility then 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.060
 do it but you would save on that 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.950
 product me for example good my mom will 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.550
 they love the rhythms of their 20 pesos the 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.310
 rosita del mamey I do not like it that much 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.509
 I prefer one of l'oréal but good 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.880
 there depends on what you also 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.580
 they go accommodate in products that I do 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.780
 would invest would be for example the base that 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.090
 it is the first thing that is in contact with 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.070
 our skin then also our 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.110
 skin is absorbing everything 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.390
 we put it is very important that this one 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.130
 be of very good quality so that 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.930
 our skin so keep well the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.520
 style does not have to be a brand in 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.380
 specific or just check well 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.090
 what ingredients you have between products 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.979
 natural for example that creams and 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.289
 masks good as you know to me 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.050
 He loved everything natural in this new 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.610
 would invest in expensive creams and not 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.630
 I prefer to spread everything natural 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.820
 separate 70 oils this direct that 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.590
 they do not cover your skin and after maintaining 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.870
 perfectly hydrated is more and 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.030
 I would spend on brushes 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.010
 brushes and I recommend them to be very 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.260
 good quality because new a brush you 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.629
 they will last a lifetime, that is if 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.069
 you wash and take good care of them we're going to have 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.080
 no problem and instead when a 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.569
 brush that is so good they have with very 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.390
 little bitches stress you start we do 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.040
 the remove us serve also and then they go 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.110
 to have to buy another is in the long run 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.010
 Well it's going to be the same products in 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.790
 shadows like 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.680
 like theft of products for eyebrows 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.930
 neither can they be saved also what 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.640
 could make good from the same shadow or 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.829
 be an eye shadow and like them below 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.360
 of a little rose or something like that 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.819
 perfectly for blush is not that the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.829
 tumor have some different component 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.840
 make him blush because they can not use 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.840
 exactly the same for eyebrows like 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.430
 can use a shadow equally in both 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.230
 cream as powder and can be 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.780
 perfectly to do already after 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.549
 who applied the base and the following 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.769
 products I think they have started not to be 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.040
 in such direct contact with the skin does not 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.319
 matter so much I tell them the quality if by 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.260
 example can not buy a proofreader 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.730
 this very expensive very fine me for example 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.440
 that I have the law colors is 25 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.989
 weights and I'm really delighted is the 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.269
 that I have put the corrector state 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.069
 I have not had any problems with my skin 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.500
 and I also think that the coverage is very 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.720
 good, check your suc and check 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.000
 can buy and what not and also take 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.190
 in mind that there are companies that are the 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.290
 who own almost all brands 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.490
 so many times like the 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.130
 products are repeated 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.490
 for example style of this dream of 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.410
 clinic mac la mer bobby braun many 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.600
 the same products stand out 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.880
 23 things will change the package we 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.670
 you can search for example the mer that is 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.830
 a very expensive brand, because it looks 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.560
 some very similar products after 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.570
 to find clinical accord of avda 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.900
 then it is very important to notice 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.930
 also what company produces it and what 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.940
 what can you get and well I hope that 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.549
 It is good for small talk them 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.010
 serve a little and if you have any doubt 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.370
 about some product or something, 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.440
