00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.070 
can go anywhere if you just are brave
enough<00:01:47.900> to<00:01:48.200> do<00:01:48.440> it<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:49.270> so<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.750> question

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
enough to do it and so the question

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.890 
enough to do it and so the question
becomes<00:01:51.170> how<00:01:51.860> do<00:01:52.190> we<00:01:52.340> change<00:01:53.060> our<00:01:53.510> direction

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
becomes how do we change our direction

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.600 
becomes how do we change our direction
of<00:01:54.110> this<00:01:54.229> country<00:01:54.440> and<00:01:54.770> what<00:01:55.040> direction<00:01:55.340> do<00:01:55.520> we

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
of this country and what direction do we

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.910 
of this country and what direction do we
want<00:01:55.790> to<00:01:55.880> change<00:01:55.910> it<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.610> think<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:59.090> I

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
want to change it to and I think that I

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.770 
want to change it to and I think that I
decided<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.040> learn<00:02:01.220> an<00:02:01.400> experience<00:02:01.850> we're<00:02:02.660> now

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
decided to learn an experience we're now

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.500 
decided to learn an experience we're now
been<00:02:02.900> exposed<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:03.560> like<00:02:04.310> we<00:02:04.490> think<00:02:05.180> a<00:02:05.300> phrase

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
been exposed to like we think a phrase

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.000 
been exposed to like we think a phrase

we use before talking about this is a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.219 
we use before talking about this is a
terrible<00:02:07.400> beauty<00:02:07.610> is<00:02:07.790> born<00:02:08.140> there's<00:02:09.140> a

but there's a beauty in it you know it's
a<00:02:13.400> learning<00:02:13.520> experience<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.750> see

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
a learning experience so I see

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.479 
a learning experience so I see
everything<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.380> happens<00:02:15.650> as<00:02:15.770> necessary

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
everything that happens as necessary

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.310 
everything that happens as necessary
unfortunately<00:02:17.209> some<00:02:17.630> horrible<00:02:17.930> things<00:02:18.110> have

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
unfortunately some horrible things have

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.199 
unfortunately some horrible things have
to<00:02:18.440> happen<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:19.340> more<00:02:19.520> horrible<00:02:19.820> things<00:02:20.060> would

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
to happen and more horrible things would

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.729 
to happen and more horrible things would
happen<00:02:20.330> but<00:02:20.600> as<00:02:20.750> long<00:02:20.900> as<00:02:20.930> we<00:02:21.140> learn<00:02:21.320> from<00:02:21.530> them

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
happen but as long as we learn from them

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.640 
happen but as long as we learn from them
and<00:02:22.150> try<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.209> rebound<00:02:23.660> societally<00:02:24.530> and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
and try to rebound societally and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.510 
and try to rebound societally and
consciously<00:02:25.070> to<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.760> other<00:02:26.000> extreme<00:02:27.520> towards

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
consciously to the other extreme towards

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.010 
consciously to the other extreme towards
the<00:02:28.640> good<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:29.120> think<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.780> we<00:02:29.870> have<00:02:29.989> a

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
the good I think that we have a

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.990 
the good I think that we have a
possibility<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.590> turn<00:02:30.800> different<00:02:31.000> recession

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
possibility to turn different recession

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.090 
possibility to turn different recession
into<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.239> Renaissance<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.739> think<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.040> the

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
into a Renaissance and I think that the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.170 
into a Renaissance and I think that the
way<00:02:34.160> we<00:02:34.280> do<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.550> is<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.850> play<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.060> our

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
way we do that is to play to our

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.870 
way we do that is to play to our
strengths<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:36.290> Irish<00:02:36.560> are<00:02:36.770> very<00:02:37.430> creative

what we can create so I wouldn't put a

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.619 
what we can create so I wouldn't put a
limit<00:07:22.039> and<00:07:22.189> say<00:07:22.340> in<00:07:22.610> 20<00:07:22.969> years<00:07:23.030> time<00:07:23.270> we'll<00:07:23.509> be

limit and say in 20 years time we'll be

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:25.209 
limit and say in 20 years time we'll be
in<00:07:23.719> this<00:07:23.810> place<00:07:24.080> or<00:07:24.319> that<00:07:24.349> place<00:07:24.469> because<00:07:25.129> I

00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:25.219 
in this place or that place because I

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:27.670 
in this place or that place because I
don't<00:07:25.460> know<00:07:25.669> I<00:07:25.969> think<00:07:26.389> I<00:07:26.810> have<00:07:27.349> certain<00:07:27.620> ideas

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 
don't know I think I have certain ideas

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.670 
don't know I think I have certain ideas
of<00:07:28.039> where<00:07:28.159> we<00:07:28.310> can<00:07:28.520> be<00:07:29.050> but<00:07:30.050> I<00:07:30.080> know<00:07:30.199> as<00:07:30.500> well

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680 
of where we can be but I know as well

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.499 
of where we can be but I know as well
that<00:07:30.919> the<00:07:31.039> generations<00:07:31.789> the<00:07:31.909> kids<00:07:32.120> coming<00:07:32.419> up

00:07:32.499 --> 00:07:32.509 
that the generations the kids coming up

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:36.430 
that the generations the kids coming up
behind<00:07:32.629> have<00:07:33.379> more<00:07:33.620> ideas<00:07:34.009> and<00:07:34.930> you<00:07:35.930> know<00:07:36.080> each

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440 
behind have more ideas and you know each

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.930 
behind have more ideas and you know each
generation<00:07:37.219> that<00:07:37.430> comes<00:07:37.580> up<00:07:37.789> is

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:37.940 
generation that comes up is

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.740 
generation that comes up is
exponentially<00:07:38.659> more<00:07:38.840> creative<00:07:39.469> and<00:07:40.479> so<00:07:41.479> we

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:41.750 
exponentially more creative and so we

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.089 
exponentially more creative and so we
can<00:07:41.870> go<00:07:41.990> anywhere<00:07:42.229> really<00:07:42.650> it's<00:07:42.889> up<00:07:42.979> to

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:43.099 
can go anywhere really it's up to

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:46.749 
can go anywhere really it's up to
everybody<00:07:43.280> to<00:07:43.580> dispel<00:07:44.180> the<00:07:44.330> apathy<00:07:44.599> and<00:07:45.759> you

00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:46.759 
everybody to dispel the apathy and you

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:50.860 
everybody to dispel the apathy and you
know<00:07:48.099> close<00:07:49.099> a<00:07:49.370> form<00:07:49.969> closer<00:07:50.240> ties<00:07:50.539> with<00:07:50.569> our

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:50.870 
know close a form closer ties with our

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.890 
know close a form closer ties with our
communities<00:07:51.319> and<00:07:51.789> because<00:07:52.789> that's<00:07:53.689> that's

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:53.900 
communities and because that's that's

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.529 
communities and because that's that's
the<00:07:54.080> way<00:07:54.169> to<00:07:54.229> do
