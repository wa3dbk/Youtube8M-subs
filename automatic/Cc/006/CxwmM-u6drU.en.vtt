one thing we have lacked on this tour at

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.129 
one thing we have lacked on this tour at
all<00:05:51.020> from<00:05:51.410> dinner<00:05:51.590> needs<00:05:51.710> of<00:05:51.889> them<00:05:52.040> I<00:05:53.139> don't

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
all from dinner needs of them I don't

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.330 
all from dinner needs of them I don't
think<00:05:54.290> it<00:05:54.500> makes<00:05:55.070> that<00:05:55.370> is<00:05:55.490> real

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
think it makes that is real

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.860 
think it makes that is real
effing<00:05:58.340> matches<00:05:59.210> he<00:05:59.300> likes<00:05:59.630> to<00:05:59.750> produce

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
effing matches he likes to produce

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.450 
effing matches he likes to produce
electrical<00:06:00.440> a<00:06:00.590> goal<00:06:00.830> Tommy<00:06:01.100> doesn't<00:06:01.280> really

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
electrical a goal Tommy doesn't really

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.450 
electrical a goal Tommy doesn't really
yeah<00:06:01.759> it<00:06:02.120> seemed<00:06:02.630> to<00:06:02.900> want<00:06:03.199> to<00:06:03.289> score<00:06:03.650> as<00:06:04.250> many

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460

golden<00:06:04.910> should<00:06:05.150> do<00:06:05.300> a<00:06:05.330> little<00:06:05.479> bit<00:06:05.690> more<00:06:05.720> I

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
golden should do a little bit more I

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:07.689 
golden should do a little bit more I
think<00:06:06.470> he<00:06:06.620> might<00:06:06.770> have<00:06:06.919> a<00:06:06.949> little<00:06:07.220> play<00:06:07.490> for<00:06:07.669> a

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 
think he might have a little play for a

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.490 
think he might have a little play for a
penalty<00:06:07.970> yeah<00:06:08.300> the<00:06:08.570> feel<00:06:08.750> of<00:06:08.780> handball<00:06:09.229> from<00:06:09.440> a

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500
