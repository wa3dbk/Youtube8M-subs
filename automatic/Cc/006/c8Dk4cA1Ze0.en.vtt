samurai<00:00:04.840> siege<00:00:05.230> mission<00:00:05.770> this<00:00:06.430> is<00:00:06.730> number<00:00:06.970> 39

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660

samurai siege mission this is number 39
caged<00:00:08.290> heat

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.360 

and<00:00:19.790> this<00:00:20.090> is<00:00:20.270> the<00:00:20.690> first<00:00:20.720> time<00:00:21.230> you<00:00:21.410> see<00:00:21.620> cages

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.370 
and this is the first time you see cages

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:29.290 
and this is the first time you see cages
that<00:00:23.530> the<00:00:25.450> troops<00:00:26.450> inside<00:00:26.930> help<00:00:27.470> you<00:00:27.710> I<00:00:28.300> think

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
that the troops inside help you I think

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.450 
that the troops inside help you I think
there's<00:00:29.570> typically<00:00:30.470> I<00:00:30.619> think<00:00:30.920> four<00:00:31.100> or<00:00:31.130> five

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
there's typically I think four or five

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.100 
there's typically I think four or five
troops<00:00:31.910> in<00:00:32.119> each<00:00:32.330> cage<00:00:34.420> we<00:00:35.420> don't<00:00:35.600> really<00:00:35.780> need

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
troops in each cage we don't really need

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.490 
troops in each cage we don't really need
to<00:00:36.910> activate<00:00:37.910> those<00:00:38.150> but<00:00:38.480> we<00:00:38.630> do<00:00:38.840> hit<00:00:39.170> one<00:00:39.380> of

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
to activate those but we do hit one of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.130 
to activate those but we do hit one of
them<00:00:41.410> now<00:00:42.410> I'm<00:00:42.620> trying<00:00:43.010> to<00:00:43.190> find<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.610> path<00:00:44.140> that

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
them now I'm trying to find a path that

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.710 
them now I'm trying to find a path that
will<00:00:45.530> be<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.280> shortest<00:00:46.670> for<00:00:46.879> my<00:00:47.000> trips<00:00:47.330> to<00:00:47.540> get

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
will be the shortest for my trips to get

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.440 
will be the shortest for my trips to get
to<00:00:47.900> the<00:00:47.989> castle<00:00:48.730> so<00:00:49.730> I'm<00:00:49.850> going<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:50.240> break

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450

through<00:00:50.840> two<00:00:51.290> walls

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.660 

and<00:00:56.059> destroy<00:00:56.809> all<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.170> towers<00:00:57.520> which<00:00:58.520> is

and destroy all the towers which is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.920 
and destroy all the towers which is
closer<00:00:59.000> than<00:00:59.360> make<00:00:59.720> my<00:01:00.320> castle

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.960 

first<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.830> need<00:01:04.980> to<00:01:05.040> bring<00:01:05.280> out<00:01:05.430> these<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.820> eat

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970

first we need to bring out these on eat
rolls<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:07.500> get<00:01:08.250> them<00:01:08.400> out<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.550> the<00:01:08.760> way

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.490 

distracting<00:01:14.990> them<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.200> bit<00:01:15.410> with<00:01:17.500> commander

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
distracting them a bit with commander

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.170 
distracting them a bit with commander
however<00:01:19.220> doesn't<00:01:20.210> last<00:01:20.540> that<00:01:20.720> long<00:01:22.120> now<00:01:23.120> you

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
however doesn't last that long now you

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.800 
however doesn't last that long now you
need<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:23.630> take<00:01:23.900> out<00:01:24.080> this<00:01:24.229> cannon<00:01:25.479> try<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.690> get

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
need to take out this cannon try and get

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.740 
need to take out this cannon try and get
a<00:01:26.840> trip<00:01:27.140> close<00:01:27.440> to<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:27.770> wall<00:01:28.660> it's<00:01:29.660> really

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
a trip close to the wall it's really

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.340 
a trip close to the wall it's really
hard<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.350> do

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.859 

see<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.520> one's<00:01:35.700> close<00:01:36.060> enough<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
see that one's close enough it's in the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:49.660 
see that one's close enough it's in the
blind<00:01:37.200> spot

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.770 

so<00:01:50.390> I<00:01:50.420> have<00:01:50.689> three<00:01:50.990> more<00:01:51.140> towers<00:01:51.439> in<00:01:51.799> my<00:01:51.950> way

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
so I have three more towers in my way

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:07.560 
so I have three more towers in my way
the<00:01:53.780> cannon<00:01:54.200> is<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.380> troublesome<00:01:55.159> one

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.930 

keep<00:02:08.200> your<00:02:08.380> trip<00:02:08.649> spread<00:02:09.039> out<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.550> cannon

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
keep your trip spread out so the cannon

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.730 
keep your trip spread out so the cannon
doesn't<00:02:10.300> splash<00:02:10.660> damage<00:02:10.960> them<00:02:11.320> all<00:02:11.470> in<00:02:11.650> one<00:02:11.680> go

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
doesn't splash damage them all in one go

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.600 
doesn't splash damage them all in one go
just<00:02:14.740> like<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.160> eye<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.640> needle<00:02:15.850> mission<00:02:16.600> you

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
just like in eye of a needle mission you

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
just like in eye of a needle mission you
throw<00:02:18.610> extra<00:02:18.970> ramps<00:02:19.660> through<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.140> hole<00:02:21.630> now

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
throw extra ramps through the hole now

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.900 
throw extra ramps through the hole now
have<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.900> clear<00:02:23.320> path<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.010> castle<00:02:24.580> but<00:02:24.880> I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910

easy I did use a hundred and what is it
125<00:03:43.150> troops<00:03:45.480> but<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.630> can<00:03:46.810> do<00:03:46.959> with<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.230> lot

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530
