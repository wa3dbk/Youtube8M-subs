00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.180
 this is something that you can practice in 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.890
 simple way and the experience of 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.610
 sure it will make you return 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.910
 Max tells us what it is about 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.380
 ok to navigate a river in and breathe 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.060
 needs to be united that is the table 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.040
 after that you need 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.610
 practically his tantrums because 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.020
 tantrums are those who give you the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.910
 movement and the moment in truth but 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.760
 I also use them to generate 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.890
 address that's from bottom to top and 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.330
 later to protect your body you use a 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.340
 Neoprene suit depending on the 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.290
 distance that has a temperature that 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.540
 you make the minimum suit or if it's thefts or 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.850
 whatever it is and protection is that every 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.590
 who adds is used on the other hand 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.560
 it is indispensable to have a vest 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.900
 lifeguard that has rescue line and 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.240
 we use rescue rope to be able 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.070
 we present to any person or 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.720
 reputation the same inside our 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.360
 select is always mandatory to have a 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.100
 whistle to the downside and on the other hand the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.590
 true helmet that is mandatory for 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.899
 to be able to protect your face more than this is 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.380
 a sport called face the buzzword 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.300
 which means that you will avenge 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.580
 literally when more discovered that the 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.530
 corner was the perfect setting for 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.130
 practice the speed leader and a 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.680
 great idea 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.030
 Since then, the Guatemalan 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.819
 take the development 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.630
 You are away with this sport 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.640
 teaching tenants to 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.440
 practice it and that they can offer them the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.480
 service to tourists with the objective 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.700
 that they benefit from nature and 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.590
