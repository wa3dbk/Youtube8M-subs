00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello to all this initiation 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.569
 find today for an episode 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.930
 special of season 2 form a 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.269
 gland 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.800
 so as you will have noticed I am 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.110
 all alone on the server because in 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.360
 did I have some minor problems 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.850
 with the recording of episodes 5 and 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.680
 We had shot in the 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.090
 adhere firstly I want to apologize 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.090
 because it's a bug that has not been 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.670
 voluntary and that suddenly you can 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.560
 not watch these episodes so what I 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.000
 I'm going to do is that there's actually the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.900
 season is over so what I have 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.250
 is that I had made a 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.950
 save the map after 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.270
 episode 6 and has it as a bollorÃ© 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.730
 fed up that I'm a little hasty and I 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.030
 will show you what we did in 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.170
 done during these episodes so so if 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.360
 I remember well then there actually 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.559
 this is the end of episode 6 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.270
 I saved the map at the end of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.010
 episode 6 and i'm going to show you this 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.870
 we did during episodes 5 and 6 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.760
 so there as you can see there is 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.870
 a beautiful champion you could have neither 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.920
 what we did we grew the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.109
 shipyards but that was at the end of 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.879
 episode 6 actually we had planned 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.760
 to eliminate do a minaj session with 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.260
 max or so at first he prepares and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.630
 will be decked out and then all that me 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.460
 I was gone here I picked up 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.310
 brown champions deschamps worse 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.439
 red about a dozen castles 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.210
 in any case we had made 5 soup 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.479
 everyone in any case it's in his strings 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.159
 there and thanks to its 5 sub pockets each one 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.350
 had become thicker pickaxe we are 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.640
 come down mines and so I'll go 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.150
 show this I'll try to trace 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.490
 more or less than an hour we took 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:37.170
 so I will not hide it from you 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.710
 change a little bit of two tours 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.409
 will be serene on the map that dates from 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.930
 episode 6 because while he is there 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.430
 I'm not going I started to 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.070
 mount the first episodes for everything 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.729
 to tell you that there is the episode 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.149
 2 episodes 1 and 2 are and I soon 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.369
 the 10 finishes so the map has a lot 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.670
 changed that I can you so 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.170
 so I remember we were gone 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.270
 by the cud before realizing that if 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.179
 it's a cul-de-sac here is picking it up 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.739
 all do it coal we saw the 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.190
 max of diamond the red stone 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:19.150
 so we left early left 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.230
 here is here collector game charm what I 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.120
 know that we've gone back into the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.349
 episodes after finally I can not everything 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.120
 tell you it would be you this flight but 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:30.310
 here is how we can see 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.459
 give in to pick up a maximum what one 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.500
 could not find out if that was it 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.700
 you can see we left everything except 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.950
 do it every time do it on 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.040
 picking up for that you see holes 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.470
 on the ground we had stumbled a max of my you 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.360
 can watch the counter 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.310
 counters of who on the right we were well 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.230
 ascended level less true than he is 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.680
 really done we put for two 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.180
 nonstop episodes we had to crowd to the 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.709
 station that is because I actualizes 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.799
 Czechs in fact we can see it the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.280
 straw was updating had not dragged by 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.090
 the 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.530
 here we go I was here like 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.660
 usually we do not pick up a max to do 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.980
 one is accustomed and the most creeper 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.989
 possible, moreover, there are still some 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.780
 and we are silent here is exactly 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.010
 here I remember perfectly it was 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.389
 here canton is exceptional and 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.400
 chained to the rest of the episode 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:22.510
 so I remember exactly by 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:28.659
 we had gone there by that by providing 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.370
 in any case I hope that this episode we 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.180
 will think to the maximum of both that I have not 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.010
 could actually film the real bug is that 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.319
 in fact range stasia my software 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.390
 registration had registered 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.959
 the image so already left for very 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.250
 good quality 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.200
 unusually I did not understand 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.079
 why and in addition if he had 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.549
 registered no are so be it 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.190
 my microphone when I speak or that it is 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.609
 also the sound of skype so with max 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.230
 or where then the knee lessons that 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.569
 had not recorded anything at all at all 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.810
 what I 'm not all inclusive 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.940
 the cause to that so here I hope that 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.010
 this episode it will compensate a maximum that 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.349
 I know I would have you well 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.420
 explain what we did was put a 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.319
 maximum so I gossip we turn on especially 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.389
 to go there in fact we do not have much 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.370
 Advanced Pre but was actually it was 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.060
 a lot lingering on doing it and you 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.310
 see when I want to face 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.049
 adversity 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.449
 Forgiveness I'll show you what we 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.240
 could pick up anyway we had we had 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.800
 killed a max of creeper that I'm sure 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.680
 let's educate our pu pick up a lot of 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.570
 powder I'm not going to tell you I 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.820
 do not tell you what we did 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.440
 following I hope I do not confuse 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.389
 all because there while he has 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.389
 is over as I already said 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:47.160
 it's here for noticeable only thing 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.390
 that I can tell you is that a 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.320
 team is eliminated eliminated first 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.600
 no but I can not tell you is this 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.070
 that I fear to tell you something 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.710
 could hope the end of the season 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.320
 I'm not talking too much about that so 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.810
 we went back up we actually found 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.130
 cave champions and no we have 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.870
 especially in fact whack a lot of 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.820
 skeletons and with the season we 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.890
 recovers and we made the powder we 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.480
 grow giant mushrooms we 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.050
 have made it possible to have a sufficient stock of 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.510
 mushrooms and then chest level so 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.310
 here you can see it in a little gold 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.110
 it's mostly the other chest we made 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.090
 suddenly because I'm been full and 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.400
 that's how you can see a lot 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.680
 a lot of doing almost 4 tech3 stack 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.870
 and one in any case the chalk powder 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.910
 apart I thought we had more the 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.430
 powder to the coin a diamond that mine of 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:39.020
 nothing has been badly worn a lot of red 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.400
 stone also coal big quantity 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.240
 then the waters of what's left of it 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.660
 think there will be some in our 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.860
 disagreement no so here we had 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.570
 maybe a little bit before 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.100
 fields I do not know if we had attacked 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.290
 to the wall and where he had advanced in 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.640
 Anyway I do not think so 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.020
 here we are then we had left 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.150
 moors had developed two episodes 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.700
 we were mainly focused on 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.490
 to make stuff so here I hope that 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.220
 it was this little episode that will make up for 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.630
 two even if it's impossible not that this 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.350
 the same thing but she in any case 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.670
 I hope that it will replace well so 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.770
 know that it's really not my 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.790
 fault that it was not voluntary a 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.010
 again it's that that annoys me 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.240
 since something other than its source 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.370
 the recording does not work 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.900
 correctly 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.240
 so here is subscribe to the channel for 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.250
 do not miss the end of the season and 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.810
 others so as I say while he is 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.790
 we have finished season 2 and then we have 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.650
 already quite a lot of projects for season 3 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.260
 I'll tell you anything but sign up 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.150
 to not miss anything that will have 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.130
 concepts are pretty cool like this 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:42.470
 where we had the idea to include the 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.470
 barbarian tried to all
