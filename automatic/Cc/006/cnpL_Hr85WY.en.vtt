there's<00:00:17.910> nothing<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:19.080> relates<00:00:19.470> between

each boots Superfly is completely
different<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:21.960> was<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.170> elite<00:00:22.410> range<00:00:22.650> and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
different it was the elite range and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.830 
different it was the elite range and
it's<00:00:22.980> disappeared<00:00:23.519> we're<00:00:23.970> comparing<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.660> to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
it's disappeared we're comparing it to

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.279 
it's disappeared we're comparing it to
that<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.320> give<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.590> 47<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> question<00:00:27.960> we're

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
that I give a 47 so the question we're

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.140 
that I give a 47 so the question we're
looking<00:00:28.529> at<00:00:28.619> then<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.800> how<00:00:29.340> does<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> vapor<00:00:29.849> 8

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
looking at then is how does the vapor 8

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.420 
looking at then is how does the vapor 8
and<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.840> vapor<00:00:31.080> 7<00:00:31.439> compare<00:00:31.830> against<00:00:32.309> each

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and the vapor 7 compare against each

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.660 
and the vapor 7 compare against each
other<00:00:32.730> let's<00:00:33.450> start<00:00:33.660> off<00:00:33.809> with<00:00:33.840> weight<00:00:34.670> the

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
also has a more anatomical design that's

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.190 
also has a more anatomical design that's
that<00:02:00.039> Medicaid<00:02:00.729> natural<00:02:01.270> feel<00:02:01.569> as<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:01.810> turn

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
that Medicaid natural feel as you turn

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.980 
that Medicaid natural feel as you turn
and<00:02:02.350> twist<00:02:02.500> on<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:02.890> surface<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.750> nike

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
and twist on the surface on the nike

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.870 
and twist on the surface on the nike
vapor<00:02:05.109> 8<00:02:05.380> you'll<00:02:05.649> notice<00:02:06.039> that<00:02:06.069> the<00:02:06.459> blades

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
vapor 8 you'll notice that the blades

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.660 
vapor 8 you'll notice that the blades
are<00:02:07.119> thinner<00:02:07.689> a<00:02:07.990> little<00:02:08.049> bit<00:02:08.530> sharper<00:02:09.069> the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
are thinner a little bit sharper the

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.970 
are thinner a little bit sharper the
concept<00:02:10.420> here<00:02:10.630> is<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.989> as<00:02:11.200> they<00:02:11.500> penetrate

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
concept here is that as they penetrate

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.160 
concept here is that as they penetrate
the<00:02:12.099> surface<00:02:12.310> they<00:02:12.640> release<00:02:12.970> easier<00:02:13.510> meaning

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
the surface they release easier meaning

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.949 
the surface they release easier meaning
you<00:02:14.290> accelerate<00:02:14.890> away<00:02:15.040> quicker<00:02:15.549> an<00:02:16.000> important

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
you accelerate away quicker an important

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.289 
you accelerate away quicker an important
question<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.560> how<00:02:18.010> does<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.400> nike<00:02:18.880> vapor<00:02:18.970> 8

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
question is how does the nike vapor 8

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.110 
question is how does the nike vapor 8
fit<00:02:20.069> basically<00:02:21.069> because<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.880> thin

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
fit basically because of the thin

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.600 
fit basically because of the thin
microfiber<00:02:22.629> upper<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.620> get<00:02:23.799> more<00:02:24.010> room<00:02:24.400> in

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
microfiber upper you get more room in

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.039 
microfiber upper you get more room in
there<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.849> get<00:02:25.000> like<00:02:25.180> more<00:02:25.390> space<00:02:25.720> for<00:02:25.750> your

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
there you get like more space for your

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.559 
there you get like more space for your
foot<00:02:26.379> it<00:02:26.829> gives<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.069> more<00:02:27.190> natural<00:02:27.730> feel<00:02:28.000> but<00:02:28.420> up

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
foot it gives a more natural feel but up

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.360 
foot it gives a more natural feel but up
top<00:02:28.840> there<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.049> definitely<00:02:29.500> some<00:02:29.680> extra<00:02:30.099> space

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
top there is definitely some extra space

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.270 
top there is definitely some extra space
when<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.360> was<00:02:31.510> testing<00:02:31.959> them<00:02:32.110> or<00:02:32.290> as<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.890> as<00:02:33.099> I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
when I was testing them or as I as I

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.210 
when I was testing them or as I as I
test<00:02:33.640> them<00:02:33.760> right<00:02:33.940> now<00:02:34.090> I've<00:02:34.390> noticed<00:02:34.870> that

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
test them right now I've noticed that

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.680 
test them right now I've noticed that
the<00:02:36.220> natural<00:02:36.640> fit<00:02:36.849> across<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.150> front<00:02:37.450> of<00:02:37.540> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
the natural fit across the front of the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.589 
the natural fit across the front of the
boot<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.069> pretty<00:02:39.069> snug<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:40.239> means<00:02:40.390> that

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
boot is pretty snug and it means that

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.729 
boot is pretty snug and it means that
you<00:02:40.690> need<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:40.989> little<00:02:41.049> bit<00:02:41.319> of<00:02:41.410> extra<00:02:41.500> space

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
you need that little bit of extra space

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.670 
you need that little bit of extra space
on<00:02:42.069> top<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:43.209> something<00:02:43.720> consider<00:02:44.049> I<00:02:44.319> would

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
on top is something consider I would

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.199 
on top is something consider I would
recommend<00:02:45.040> trying<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.549> check<00:02:45.760> out<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.940> half

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
recommend trying to check out a half

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.120 
recommend trying to check out a half
size<00:02:46.420> down<00:02:46.870> because<00:02:47.290> maybe<00:02:47.470> you'll<00:02:47.709> need<00:02:47.920> that

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
size down because maybe you'll need that

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.120 
size down because maybe you'll need that
but<00:02:48.819> for<00:02:49.030> me<00:02:49.150> personally<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.989> found<00:02:50.530> that<00:02:50.769> the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
but for me personally I found that the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.309 
but for me personally I found that the
little<00:02:51.459> extra<00:02:51.700> space<00:02:51.880> up<00:02:52.090> top<00:02:52.269> was<00:02:52.660> needed<00:02:53.139> and

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
little extra space up top was needed and

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.979 
little extra space up top was needed and
it<00:02:53.680> actually<00:02:53.889> helps<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.959> create<00:02:55.959> more

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
it actually helps and create more

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.349 
it actually helps and create more
comfortable<00:02:56.620> boot<00:02:57.120> can't<00:02:58.120> answer<00:02:58.209> the

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
comfortable boot can't answer the

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.170 
comfortable boot can't answer the
question<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.870> which<00:02:59.200> one<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.560> prefer<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:00.370> I<00:03:00.400> much

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
question of which one I prefer I I much

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.849 
question of which one I prefer I I much
rather<00:03:01.420> than<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.870> vapor<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.290> primarily

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
rather than the vapor a primarily

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.620 
rather than the vapor a primarily
because<00:03:03.069> of<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.430> thin<00:03:03.700> upper<00:03:04.120> it's<00:03:04.389> a<00:03:04.510> lot

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
because of the thin upper it's a lot

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.629 
because of the thin upper it's a lot
more<00:03:04.750> flexible<00:03:05.290> it's<00:03:05.560> got<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.739> more<00:03:06.069> natural

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
more flexible it's got a more natural

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.289 
more flexible it's got a more natural
fit<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.120> shape<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.599> your<00:03:07.660> foot<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:09.269> yeah<00:03:10.269> I

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
fit and shape to your foot and yeah I

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.240 
fit and shape to your foot and yeah I
find<00:03:10.630> it<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.750> be<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.840> much<00:03:11.109> more<00:03:11.650> comfortable

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
find it to be a much more comfortable

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.000 
find it to be a much more comfortable
