00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.660
 the Spartans descend from the very same 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.300
 trees taught us not to remove them not 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.680
 surrender never taught us to die in 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.119
 the battlefield is the greatest glory 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.119
 that can be achieved in life 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.360
 the best warriors the world has 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.360
 known 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.880
 sparta will be reduced to ashes 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.530
 nations of the Persian empire fall on 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.780
 we 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.440
 threats in my village with slavery 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.440
 and death 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:08.940
 a needle that is three doors 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.940
 we will stay and fight 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.500
 a new era begins 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.110
 of freedom 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.439
 and the whole world will know that 300 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.439
 Spartans 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.490
 last breath to preserve it 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:38.000
 Spartans 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.000
 tonight we will have dinner in hell 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.060
 an intense night awaits us
