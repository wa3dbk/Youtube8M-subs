out<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.120> from<00:00:45.329> what<00:00:45.480> I've<00:00:45.600> seen<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.930> lot<00:00:46.170> of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
out but from what I've seen a lot of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200 
out but from what I've seen a lot of
people<00:00:46.440> don't<00:00:46.590> take<00:00:46.800> advantage<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
people don't take advantage of the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.940 
people don't take advantage of the
challenges<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.350> guys<00:00:49.500> don't<00:00:49.860> know

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
challenges so if you guys don't know

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.080 
challenges so if you guys don't know
what<00:00:50.010> they<00:00:50.129> are<00:00:50.219> basically<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.789> hit<00:00:50.940> your

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
what they are basically you hit your

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.430 
what they are basically you hit your
select<00:00:51.449> button<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.870> open<00:00:51.899> up<00:00:52.289> your

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
select button you open up your

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.139 
select button you open up your
interaction<00:00:53.190> menu<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.520> think<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149

all<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> time<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.229> that's<00:01:25.799> pretty<00:01:26.130> easy<00:01:26.189> now

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
all the time so that's pretty easy now

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.980 
all the time so that's pretty easy now
the<00:01:26.549> impromptu<00:01:27.119> race<00:01:27.240> was<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> little<00:01:27.780> bit<00:01:27.869> more

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the impromptu race was a little bit more

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.200 
the impromptu race was a little bit more
tricky<00:01:28.200> because<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.579> need<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> friend

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
tricky because you do need a friend

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.670 
tricky because you do need a friend
obviously<00:01:30.479> or<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.110> need<00:01:31.290> somebody<00:01:31.500> in

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
obviously or you just need somebody in

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.499 
obviously or you just need somebody in
your<00:01:31.770> lobby<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.310> actually<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.119> with<00:01:33.299> you

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
your lobby to actually do it with you

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.390 
your lobby to actually do it with you
and<00:01:33.720> then<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> capture<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> same<00:01:35.070> as<00:01:35.250> well

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and then the capture the same as well

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.980 
and then the capture the same as well
you<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.729> gonna<00:01:35.880> need<00:01:36.060> somebody<00:01:36.450> else<00:01:36.659> but

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
you are gonna need somebody else but

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.600 
you are gonna need somebody else but
what's<00:01:37.560> pretty<00:01:37.740> cool<00:01:37.950> about<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.100> capture

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
what's pretty cool about that capture

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.499 
what's pretty cool about that capture
these<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.880> don't<00:01:39.000> need<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.180> play<00:01:39.270> through<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
these you don't need to play through the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.179 
these you don't need to play through the
entire<00:01:39.630> capture<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.530> load<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:40.890> have

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
entire capture you just load it up have

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.130 
entire capture you just load it up have
the<00:01:41.400> other<00:01:41.549> person<00:01:41.759> leave<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.509> then<00:01:42.990> it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the other person leave and then it

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.690 
the other person leave and then it
counts<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.649> you'll<00:01:43.829> probably<00:01:44.009> see<00:01:44.310> at<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> end

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
counts as you'll probably see at the end

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.210 
counts as you'll probably see at the end
but<00:01:45.540> once<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.799> all<00:01:47.040> three<00:01:47.430> done<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.329> get

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
but once you get all three done you get

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.359 
but once you get all three done you get
25,000<00:01:50.220> dollars<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.790> 3,000<00:01:51.630> RP<00:01:52.049> that's<00:01:52.890> more

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
25,000 dollars and 3,000 RP that's more

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.280 
25,000 dollars and 3,000 RP that's more
than<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.640> get<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:53.909> most<00:01:54.390> missions<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.259> for

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
than you get in most missions and for

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.130 
than you get in most missions and for
doing<00:01:56.130> these<00:01:56.640> three<00:01:57.060> simple<00:01:57.299> tasks<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.020> know

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
doing these three simple tasks you know

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.539 
doing these three simple tasks you know
that's<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.469> good<00:01:58.680> amount<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.070> money<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.490> it

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
that's a good amount of money but it

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.190 
that's a good amount of money but it
gets<00:01:59.729> even<00:02:00.030> better<00:02:00.060> if<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.689> do<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.049> daily

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
gets even better if you do the daily

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.080 
gets even better if you do the daily
challenges<00:02:01.829> for<00:02:01.979> seven<00:02:02.340> days<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.729> row<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:02.909> if

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
challenges for seven days in a row so if

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.940 
challenges for seven days in a row so if
you<00:02:03.149> do<00:02:03.329> all<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.869> daily<00:02:04.110> challenges<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you do all the daily challenges for a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.920 
you do all the daily challenges for a
week<00:02:05.159> straight<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.820> get<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> hundred<00:02:06.479> thousand

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
week straight you get a hundred thousand

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.820 
week straight you get a hundred thousand
dollars<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:08.039> get<00:02:08.420> 25k<00:02:09.420> RP<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.500> that's<00:02:10.649> on

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
dollars and you get 25k RP and that's on

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.920 
dollars and you get 25k RP and that's on
top<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.400> daily<00:02:11.879> challenge<00:02:12.270> amount<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:12.840> if

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
top of the daily challenge amount so if

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.650 
top of the daily challenge amount so if
you're<00:02:13.050> kind<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.290> confused

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
you're kind of confused

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.800 
you're kind of confused
you<00:02:14.410> basically<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:14.980> get<00:02:15.330> $25,000<00:02:16.330> each<00:02:16.360> day

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
you basically you get $25,000 each day

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.780 
you basically you get $25,000 each day
so<00:02:17.340> 25,000<00:02:18.340> times<00:02:18.490> seven<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:20.370> $175,000<00:02:21.370> plus

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
so 25,000 times seven is $175,000 plus

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.270 
so 25,000 times seven is $175,000 plus
on<00:02:22.000> top<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.540> you'll<00:02:22.900> get<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.280> $100,000

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
on top of that you'll get the $100,000

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.220 
on top of that you'll get the $100,000
for<00:02:24.550> completing<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.090> weekly<00:02:25.480> bonus<00:02:25.660> now

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
for completing the weekly bonus now

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.830 
for completing the weekly bonus now
there's<00:02:26.770> also<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.220> another<00:02:27.880> step<00:02:28.300> if<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.630> do

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
there's also a another step if you do

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.210 
there's also a another step if you do
this<00:02:28.990> for<00:02:29.200> an<00:02:29.290> entire<00:02:29.650> month<00:02:29.680> straight<00:02:30.190> I

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
this for an entire month straight I

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.060 
this for an entire month straight I
think<00:02:30.310> it's<00:02:30.610> for<00:02:30.760> 28<00:02:31.270> days<00:02:31.300> or<00:02:31.870> either<00:02:32.710> third

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
think it's for 28 days or either third

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.620 
think it's for 28 days or either third
it's<00:02:33.220> either<00:02:33.400> 28<00:02:33.820> or<00:02:33.880> 31<00:02:34.210> I<00:02:34.240> don't<00:02:34.420> think

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
it's either 28 or 31 I don't think

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.210 
it's either 28 or 31 I don't think
anybody<00:02:35.140> knows<00:02:35.200> just<00:02:35.680> yet<00:02:35.830> because<00:02:36.070> obviously

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
anybody knows just yet because obviously

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.680 
anybody knows just yet because obviously
hi<00:02:36.670> seven<00:02:36.970> went<00:02:37.090> out<00:02:37.150> for<00:02:37.300> an<00:02:37.390> entire<00:02:37.480> month

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
hi seven went out for an entire month

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.320 
hi seven went out for an entire month
yet<00:02:38.140> but<00:02:38.680> Rockstar<00:02:39.130> did<00:02:39.280> say<00:02:39.490> that<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.120> will

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
yet but Rockstar did say that you will

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.440 
yet but Rockstar did say that you will
get<00:02:40.480> something<00:02:40.810> special<00:02:41.290> if<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.860> do<00:02:42.100> them<00:02:42.450> 28

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
get something special if you do them 28

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.630 
get something special if you do them 28
days<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.930> row<00:02:44.050> or<00:02:44.260> 31<00:02:45.070> days<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.460> don't<00:02:45.520> know

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
days in a row or 31 days I don't know

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.680 
days in a row or 31 days I don't know
it's<00:02:45.790> one<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:46.030> those<00:02:46.150> two<00:02:46.330> numbers

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
it's one of those two numbers

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.240 
it's one of those two numbers
and<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:47.230> lot<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.440> people<00:02:47.710> are<00:02:47.800> saying<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.220> could

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
and a lot of people are saying it could

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.130 
and a lot of people are saying it could
be<00:02:48.520> like<00:02:48.820> a<00:02:48.850> million<00:02:49.210> dollars<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.750> think<00:02:50.020> it's

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
be like a million dollars I think it's

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.530 
be like a million dollars I think it's
probably<00:02:50.350> gonna<00:02:50.560> be<00:02:50.710> like<00:02:50.800> only<00:02:51.330> $500,000<00:02:52.330> but

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
probably gonna be like only $500,000 but

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.180 
probably gonna be like only $500,000 but
I<00:02:52.720> mean<00:02:53.200> considering<00:02:53.680> these<00:02:53.890> daily

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
I mean considering these daily

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.830 
I mean considering these daily
challenges<00:02:54.220> are<00:02:54.820> really<00:02:55.210> easy<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.510> do<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.810> can

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
challenges are really easy to do you can

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.990 
challenges are really easy to do you can
