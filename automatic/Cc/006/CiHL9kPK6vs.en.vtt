00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.830
 it had been a success from the beginning on the dutch sesame street 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.620
 Blowing from America for the TV series was set up to take the poor children out 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.620
 pakistans give way language and arithmetic 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.900
 The Dutch don't need children just went to kindergarten 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.970
 the initial period but in that case we mainly focus on socially emotional 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.509
 development and that means about it 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.609
 points fears fights that kind of thing but in the netherlands again for more of it 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.510
 interest 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.740
 and there for thirty years the same setup has been made in the Netherlands part with pino 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.400
 tommie and the rest and a purchased american filmmaker known among other things 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.370
 if there is of course kermit 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.630
 i have 8 more benefits amber also keeps the pkn 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.110
 work there 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.040
 sesame street as a reflection of the normal street 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.990
 all the characters are just clever until the blast turned into moors and van 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.550
 young to old and that is about toddler themes in the past it was fiery colors 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.770
 she is certainly as a philip has been a reflection of society 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.940
 that is partly because the intuition of the makers is naturally in the time in which 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.210
 program is broadcast 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.990
 On the other hand, there has also been a time when the much needed statement 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.590
 had to make enzymes in jeans and tongs had to walk and saw and 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.159
 carpentry and things like that and of course we had to adjust cups, we don't do that 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:17.700
 more 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.540
 target 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.270
 The anniversary is celebrated with a new record starting from Saturday for the first time 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.230
 can be seen 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.300
 but it is not just party recess to street the program is on recently 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.420
 an early time broadcast so many viewers have dropped out and the nps 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.040
 is going to disappear who was later broadcasting sesame street is unclear but that the 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.140
 strong every word goes out the creators don't believe on the dolls they either 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.890
 dig a unique press conference this afternoon it will be fine but I have 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.380
 heard 13 39 years 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.480
 he will kick out 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.850
 And there the NPCF continues to exist and it remains a fact that it exists 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.850
 we have to go there 8 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.829
 but today, of course, it was mainly about the birthday of sesame street vague 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.610
