22 inch 220 and the ombre color came out

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.670 
22 inch 220 and the ombre color came out
a<00:03:29.780> little<00:03:30.019> bit<00:03:30.640> darker<00:03:31.640> for<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.239> 20<00:03:32.750> inches

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
a little bit darker for the 20 inches

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.500 
a little bit darker for the 20 inches
both<00:03:33.950> for<00:03:34.099> the<00:03:34.189> 20<00:03:34.459> inches<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.150> came<00:03:35.299> out

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
both for the 20 inches and it came out

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.979 
both for the 20 inches and it came out
lighter<00:03:35.810> for<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.200> 22<00:03:37.060> inches<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:38.810> I'm

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
lighter for the 22 inches so I'm

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.860 
lighter for the 22 inches so I'm
guessing<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:40.400> to<00:03:40.640> 20<00:03:41.030> inches<00:03:41.329> was<00:03:41.569> a<00:03:41.599> lot

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
guessing the to 20 inches was a lot

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.240 
guessing the to 20 inches was a lot
darker<00:03:42.200> than<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:43.370> 22<00:03:43.849> then<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.389> 22<00:03:44.840> inches<00:03:45.250> so

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
darker than the 22 then the 22 inches so

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.110 
darker than the 22 then the 22 inches so
I<00:03:46.579> might<00:03:47.120> go<00:03:47.299> back<00:03:47.329> over<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:48.019> again<00:03:48.700> but<00:03:49.700> I<00:03:49.730> have

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
I might go back over it again but I have

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.879 
I might go back over it again but I have

up

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:07.129 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:10.299 

but<00:05:07.939> it<00:05:08.089> straightens<00:05:08.659> very<00:05:09.080> nicely<00:05:09.499> I<00:05:09.800> didn't

00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:10.309 
but it straightens very nicely I didn't

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:13.779 
but it straightens very nicely I didn't
really<00:05:10.699> straighten<00:05:11.209> it<00:05:11.300> too<00:05:12.080> much<00:05:12.520> but<00:05:13.520> this

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
really straighten it too much but this

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.739 
really straighten it too much but this
was<00:05:13.999> only<00:05:14.539> at<00:05:14.659> 400<00:05:15.289> degrees<00:05:15.649> and<00:05:16.419> this<00:05:17.419> is<00:05:17.599> how

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:17.749 
was only at 400 degrees and this is how

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:20.290 
was only at 400 degrees and this is how
a<00:05:17.779> straightens<00:05:18.349> is<00:05:18.529> very<00:05:18.800> soft<00:05:19.249> for<00:05:19.580> Strings

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
a straightens is very soft for Strings

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:34.509 
a straightens is very soft for Strings
and<00:05:20.509> now<00:05:21.379> I<00:05:21.409> want<00:05:21.919> to<00:05:22.039> wet<00:05:22.519> it<00:05:33.009> so<00:05:34.009> the<00:05:34.249> hair

and now I want to wet it so the hair

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:37.149 
and now I want to wet it so the hair
does<00:05:34.999> curl<00:05:35.719> back<00:05:36.019> up<00:05:36.229> so<00:05:36.709> that's<00:05:36.860> what's

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
does curl back up so that's what's

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.019 
does curl back up so that's what's
really<00:05:37.249> good<00:05:37.729> about<00:05:37.939> that<00:05:37.999> hair<00:05:38.479> and<00:05:40.029> this

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:41.029 
really good about that hair and this

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:46.359 
really good about that hair and this
hair<00:05:42.219> does<00:05:43.219> not<00:05:43.399> have<00:05:43.669> mega<00:05:44.769> beards<00:05:45.769> on<00:05:45.919> it<00:05:46.129> and

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:49.899 
hair does not have mega beards on it and
if<00:05:47.029> you<00:05:47.539> want<00:05:47.869> to<00:05:48.080> slip<00:05:49.009> the<00:05:49.219> weft<00:05:49.429> you<00:05:49.610> can

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:49.909 
if you want to slip the weft you can

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:52.389 
if you want to slip the weft you can
split<00:05:50.330> it<00:05:50.389> but<00:05:51.289> that<00:05:51.529> would<00:05:51.709> just<00:05:51.979> creates

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:52.399 
split it but that would just creates

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:56.919 
split it but that would just creates
more<00:05:53.050> shedding<00:05:54.099> but<00:05:55.240> this<00:05:56.240> hair<00:05:56.479> is<00:05:56.629> very
