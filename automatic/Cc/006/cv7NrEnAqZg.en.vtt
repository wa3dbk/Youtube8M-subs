00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
fashion not it's just certain wall so

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.700 
fashion not it's just certain wall so
that<00:00:42.000> means<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.450> could<00:00:42.629> hit<00:00:42.780> everything<00:00:43.170> which

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
is pretty cool I just hope it's not like

is pretty cool I just hope it's not like
really<00:00:46.379> chip<00:00:46.649> damage<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> way<00:00:47.550> they<00:00:47.700> did

anything<00:01:02.969> go<00:01:03.329> through<00:01:03.539> walls<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.229> I'm<00:01:04.320> hoping

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
anything go through walls so I'm hoping

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.590 
anything go through walls so I'm hoping
you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.979> something<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.549> use<00:01:06.060> el<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
you can be something like that use el to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.230 
you can be something like that use el to
make<00:01:06.960> lie<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.350> use<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.040> line<00:01:08.250> launcher<00:01:08.729> huh

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
make lie to use the line launcher huh

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.120 
make lie to use the line launcher huh
alright<00:01:09.900> well<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.380> makes<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.710> everything

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
alright well that makes it everything

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.370 
alright well that makes it everything
more<00:01:11.280> easier<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.180> use<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.510> gadgets<00:01:13.170> while

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
more easier the use of gadgets while

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.219 
more easier the use of gadgets while
gliding<00:01:13.830> produces<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.760> slow-mo<00:01:15.330> synced<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.200> i

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
gliding produces a slow-mo synced so i

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.140 
gliding produces a slow-mo synced so i
guess<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.590> whenever<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.430> use<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.850> say

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
guess like whenever we use like say

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.749 
guess like whenever we use like say
we're<00:01:18.570> gliding<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> air<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.250> could

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
we're gliding up in the air I could

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.609 
we're gliding up in the air I could
throw<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.509> battering<00:01:21.840> at<00:01:22.080> somebody<00:01:22.409> which

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
throw like a battering at somebody which

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.840 
throw like a battering at somebody which
is<00:01:22.740> pretty<00:01:22.890> cool<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.729> only

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
is pretty cool because I think the only

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.980 
is pretty cool because I think the only
thing<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.090> could<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.270> done<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.509> was<00:01:24.720> just

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
thing you could have done it was just

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.260 
thing you could have done it was just
glide<00:01:25.409> kick<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.979> now<00:01:26.340> we're<00:01:26.729> able<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.030> do

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
glide kick and now we're able to do

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.450 
glide kick and now we're able to do
other<00:01:27.780> stuff<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.590> glide<00:01:28.920> kick<00:01:29.220> so

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
other stuff and just glide kick so

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.370 
other stuff and just glide kick so
that's<00:01:29.670> another<00:01:29.909> cool<00:01:30.180> thing<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.810> Batmobile

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
that's another cool thing the Batmobile

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.249 
that's another cool thing the Batmobile
has<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> boost<00:01:32.100> function<00:01:32.970> well<00:01:33.570> that's<00:01:34.049> pretty

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
has a boost function well that's pretty

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.899 
has a boost function well that's pretty
cool<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:35.070> probably<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> same

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
cool it's probably going to be the same

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.700 
cool it's probably going to be the same
thing<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> way<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.170> did<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.439> Gears<00:01:37.650> of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
thing like the way you did in Gears of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.170 
thing like the way you did in Gears of
War<00:01:37.799> whenever<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.400> drive<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> jarring<00:01:39.119> thing

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
War whenever you drive the jarring thing

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.359 
War whenever you drive the jarring thing
and<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.140> boosted<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.920> only<00:01:41.040> lasted

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
and then you boosted and it only lasted

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.069 
and then you boosted and it only lasted
for<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.640> while<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.420> one<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.780> next<00:01:42.990> one

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
for a while but in this one the next one

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.109 
for a while but in this one the next one
is<00:01:43.229> pretty<00:01:43.409> good<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.920> boost<00:01:44.189> function<00:01:44.640> refuse

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
is pretty good the boost function refuse

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.940 
is pretty good the boost function refuse
when<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.540> dripped<00:01:45.899> around<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.380> corners<00:01:46.770> I

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
when you dripped around the corners I

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.740 
when you dripped around the corners I
think<00:01:47.250> there<00:01:47.460> was<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.579> game<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:47.939> did

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
think there was a game that did

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.870 
think there was a game that did
something<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.770> can't<00:01:50.040> remember<00:01:50.369> i'm
