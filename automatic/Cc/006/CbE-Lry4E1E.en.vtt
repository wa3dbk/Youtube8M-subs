00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.910
 Virgilio Vidor is an Italian who arrived 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.430
 more than 40 years ago to our country in 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.800
 1972 his fondness for growing grapes 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.710
 they took him to have his own vineyard in his 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.980
 home your ancestors grow grapes from 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.839
 the 18th century in rome italy and this 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.300
 custom marks your lifestyle 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:30.810
 obviously an Italian without a grape can not 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.360
 to run out of wine then we started the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.240
 experimentation with the first bushes 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.530
 what do we import 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.660
 and administer and agriculture 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.530
 from italy 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.600
 very well then it started very and there 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.840
 just with the government of costa rica 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.190
 we started having relationships in terms of 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.040
 the possibility of developing the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.129
 grape research is also 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.650
 pointed out luzaide financing in 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.260
 the idea of ​​usa that a project was made 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.900
 of grape research on the farm not 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.360
 is that it became in fact a 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.040
 experimental center is not an agronomist of 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.290
 profession but develops its 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.490
 research sowing the varieties 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.530
 existing new and some hybrids 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.110
 Virgilio is considered self-taught 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.570
 These investigations are carried out by 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.940
 from open pollination or 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.640
 Controlled pollination with fertilization 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.710
 artificial crossed is to say crossing 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.649
 flowers its seeds of species like the 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.170
 European vitis vinifera or vitis la 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.420
 abrupt or vitis tilly foliar 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.060
 in this process the plant takes five 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.409
 years to bear fruit and appreciate the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.649
 result 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.319
 in 41 years he has created two types that 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.810
 has called the nona giovanni vidor in 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:54.200
 honor to his grandfather and the queen in his life 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.539
 in honor of his mother sweet grapes and with 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.939
 a texture different from the one you 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.579
 find in supermarkets what 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:05.840
 we have we are two selections of 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:08.119
 that hybrid that one produces a little 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.209
 less but water sweeter and faster 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.160
 in maturing and another produces a lot of 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.319
 grape and it's sweet equally although a 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.230
 little less then the other doubt that 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.850
 you gave very large clusters is a 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.820
 hybrid 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.810
 90% it is difficult to say the percentages 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.120
 in this case of vinifera and some of my 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.770
 textile and folk since the wildlife 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.770
 from the forest of here true 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.680
 what is a very good grape until I can 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.989
 try is good too it 's like this very 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.840
 big looks a lot like water they look at 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.440
 the super this fruit which is made 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.720
 the wine vinegar a grass and the monster is 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.900
 originally grown in the hemisphere 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.840
 north the first crops of vitis la 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.930
 plant date from classical Greece in 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.880
 the 7th century before Christ according to the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.860
 statistics on the organization of 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.489
 united nations for food and 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.500
 Fao agriculture by its acronym in English 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.140
 Currently Spain is the country where most 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.019
 Grape crops exist followed by 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.780
 France Italy and Turkey in America 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.940
 latina argentina and chile lead this 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.239
 list countries with the wine culture 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.010
 installed for centuries the climate 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.829
 tropical of costa rica was not 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.299
 impediment so that don virgilio 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.540
 bring your seeds and plant them here 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.130
 at home in curridabat and pretend 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.300
 implement this practice in the 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.050
 Costa Rican agriculture 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.050
 the future 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.550
 in urban agriculture 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.040
 already that is being seen with the 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.980
 with all its hydroponic cultivation that 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.110
 do the houses and so on now the idea 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.210
 I hope that it is done in the most 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.810
 possible natural me in my job 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.990
 I insist unworthiness with Creole grape for 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.750
 make the creole water practice that also 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.260
 the grape becomes active and you do not think 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.270
 only in the grape as something from outside 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.610
 his passion has taken him not only to 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.400
 grow grapes but also pears 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.859
 peaches and gigantic sweet lemon 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.320
 always looking to improve the 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.590
 farming practices without using products 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.100
 agrochemicals he sells the plants for 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.630
 that you can harvest them at home 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.090
 thus developing urban agriculture 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.590
 and you can get them by contacting the 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:41.520
 telephone number 22 72 27 89 or the 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.520
 cellular 70 54 87 42
