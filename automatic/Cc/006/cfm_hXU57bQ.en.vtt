00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.090 
volume so I tried this because Shoppers
Drug<00:00:20.910> Mart<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.330> having<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.840> sale<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.680> their

Drug Mart was having a sale on their

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.590 
Drug Mart was having a sale on their
Maybelline<00:00:23.490> mascaras<00:00:24.000> usually<00:00:24.420> they're

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
Maybelline mascaras usually they're

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.929 
Maybelline mascaras usually they're
around<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:25.260> eight<00:00:25.500> or<00:00:25.560> nine<00:00:25.740> dollars<00:00:26.070> but

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
around like eight or nine dollars but

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.050 
around like eight or nine dollars but
they<00:00:27.240> were<00:00:27.300> 50%<00:00:28.230> off<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.650> got<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.250> 399

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
they were 50% off so I got it for 399

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.609 
they were 50% off so I got it for 399
which<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.750> thought<00:00:30.869> was<00:00:30.960> really<00:00:31.019> great<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
which I thought was really great and

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.709 
which I thought was really great and
this<00:00:31.769> isn't<00:00:31.949> usually<00:00:32.550> my<00:00:34.700> preferred<00:00:35.719> mascara

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
this isn't usually my preferred mascara

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.959 
this isn't usually my preferred mascara
i<00:00:36.899> usually<00:00:37.290> use<00:00:37.320> also<00:00:37.739> maybelline<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.550> but

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
i usually use also maybelline one but

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.119 
i usually use also maybelline one but
just<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:40.050> volume<00:00:40.350> express<00:00:40.649> its<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
just the volume express its in like a

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.430 
just the volume express its in like a
dark<00:00:41.399> blue<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.270> i<00:00:42.329> got<00:00:42.570> an<00:00:42.809> extra<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.320> that

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
dark blue so i got an extra one of that

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.840 
dark blue so i got an extra one of that
but<00:00:43.710> then<00:00:43.800> i<00:00:43.890> figured<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.460> price<00:00:44.670> i

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
but then i figured for that price i

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.040 
but then i figured for that price i
might<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.120> well<00:00:45.149> try<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> different<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:45.809> and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
might as well try a different one and

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.229 
might as well try a different one and
seven<00:00:46.770> times<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.129> volume<00:00:47.550> that's<00:00:47.760> pretty

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
seven times this volume that's pretty

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.619 
seven times this volume that's pretty
good<00:00:48.480> umm<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.980> pretty<00:00:50.610> long<00:00:51.059> lashes

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
good umm I have pretty long lashes

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.319 
good umm I have pretty long lashes
naturally<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> don't<00:00:53.489> usually<00:00:53.699> go<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
naturally so I don't usually go for the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.310 
naturally so I don't usually go for the
super<00:00:55.190> lengthening<00:00:56.190> ones<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:56.850> volume<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:58.020> my

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
super lengthening ones but volume so my

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.380 
super lengthening ones but volume so my
thoughts<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.120> actually

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
thoughts on this is that it actually

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.450 
thoughts on this is that it actually
does<00:01:00.870> build<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.800> volume<00:01:02.190> quite<00:01:02.820> well<00:01:03.300> um<00:01:04.460> for

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
does build the volume quite well um for

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.780 
does build the volume quite well um for
the<00:01:05.519> most<00:01:05.700> part<00:01:06.000> doesn't<00:01:06.330> clump<00:01:06.540> um<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.500> do

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
the most part doesn't clump um I do

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.670 
the most part doesn't clump um I do
notice<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.939> get<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> few<00:01:09.960> clumps<00:01:10.320> kind<00:01:10.619> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
notice I get like a few clumps kind of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.230 
notice I get like a few clumps kind of
on<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> tips<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.369> then<00:01:11.549> if<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.760> give<00:01:11.970> another

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
on the tips but then if you give another

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.710 
on the tips but then if you give another
swipe<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.229> two<00:01:13.380> then<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.770> goes<00:01:13.979> away<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:15.360> again

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
swipe or two then it goes away and again

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
swipe or two then it goes away and again
that's<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:15.990> kind<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.320> clump<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
that's just kind of a clump of the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.980 
that's just kind of a clump of the
product<00:01:17.159> don't<00:01:17.729> notice<00:01:18.330> kind<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.840> your

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
product don't notice kind of your

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660 
product don't notice kind of your
eyelashes<00:01:19.619> coming<00:01:19.950> together<00:01:20.070> where<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.460> have

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
eyelashes coming together where you have

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.210 
eyelashes coming together where you have
like<00:01:20.850> five<00:01:21.180> or<00:01:22.049> probably<00:01:22.380> more<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:22.979> kind<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
like five or probably more just kind of

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.859 
like five or probably more just kind of
in<00:01:23.369> one<00:01:23.610> big<00:01:25.340> eyelash<00:01:26.340> Club<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:27.119> like<00:01:27.299> super

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
in one big eyelash Club or like super

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.230 
in one big eyelash Club or like super
last<00:01:28.049> row<00:01:28.229> something<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.490> way<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.970> kind

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
last row something and the way it kind

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.870 
last row something and the way it kind
of<00:01:30.360> works<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.869> guess<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.680> coats<00:01:32.189> every

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
of works I guess is that it coats every

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.800 
of works I guess is that it coats every
single<00:01:33.509> lash<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:34.170> lot<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.159> because<00:01:35.810> but

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
single lash a lot of that is because but

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.510 
single lash a lot of that is because but
then<00:01:36.960> also<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.409> know<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.799> formula<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
then also you know the formula of the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.760 
then also you know the formula of the
mascara<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.390> coats<00:01:39.630> every<00:01:39.960> single<00:01:40.290> lash<00:01:40.409> even

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
mascara it coats every single lash even

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.350 
mascara it coats every single lash even
though<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.009> like<00:01:41.100> tiny<00:01:41.579> little<00:01:41.759> ones<00:01:42.150> that

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
though it's like tiny little ones that

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.929 
though it's like tiny little ones that
are<00:01:42.509> short<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.710> they're<00:01:43.890> further<00:01:44.310> down<00:01:44.460> but

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
are short but they're further down but

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.370 
are short but they're further down but
it<00:01:45.299> coats<00:01:45.509> those<00:01:45.720> too<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.229> definitely

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
it coats those too so it definitely

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.580 
it coats those too so it definitely
makes<00:01:46.770> them<00:01:47.509> more<00:01:48.509> noticeable<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.470> it

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
makes them more noticeable so then it

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.160 
makes them more noticeable so then it
looks<00:01:49.770> fuller<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:51.299> not<00:01:51.540> like<00:01:51.810> some<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
looks fuller so it's not like some of

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.749 
looks fuller so it's not like some of
the<00:01:52.229> other<00:01:52.380> ones<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.640> really

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
the other ones that is just a really

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.510 
the other ones that is just a really
thick<00:01:54.240> formula<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.140> coats<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.189> make<00:01:56.340> it

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
thick formula and it coats it to make it

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.940 
thick formula and it coats it to make it
fuller<00:01:57.170> those<00:01:58.170> things<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.469> don't<00:01:58.560> really<00:01:58.680> like

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
fuller those things I don't really like

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.050 
fuller those things I don't really like
too<00:01:59.100> much<00:01:59.189> just<00:01:59.399> because<00:01:59.490> then<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.850> takes

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
too much just because then it takes

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.999 
too much just because then it takes
forever<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.390> get<00:02:00.540> off<00:02:00.689> but<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.530> kind<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.799> keeps

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
forever to get off but it kind of keeps

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.410 
forever to get off but it kind of keeps
them<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.610> way<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.790> makes<00:02:02.969> 50

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
them on that's the way it makes 50

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.450 
them on that's the way it makes 50
appear<00:02:03.780> fuller<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.530> one<00:02:04.740> doesn't<00:02:05.399> work

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
appear fuller so this one doesn't work

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.870 
appear fuller so this one doesn't work
like<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
like that

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.540 
like that
it<00:02:06.149> doesn't<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.630> add<00:02:06.869> bulk<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:08.069> top<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
it doesn't just add bulk on top of the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.360 
it doesn't just add bulk on top of the
lashes<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:10.020> coats<00:02:10.470> every<00:02:10.830> single<00:02:11.160> little

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
lashes it just coats every single little

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.530 
lashes it just coats every single little
lash<00:02:11.550> so

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
lash so

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.140 
lash so
this<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.930> what<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.260> wand<00:02:13.590> looks<00:02:14.129> like<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:16.680> is

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
this is what the wand looks like it is

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.979 
this is what the wand looks like it is
it<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.299> a<00:02:18.329> little<00:02:18.629> bit<00:02:18.780> wider<00:02:19.290> um<00:02:19.969> then<00:02:20.969> I<00:02:21.329> guess

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
it is a little bit wider um then I guess

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.020 
it is a little bit wider um then I guess
some<00:02:22.200> typical<00:02:22.590> ones<00:02:22.799> and<00:02:23.219> it's<00:02:23.519> quite<00:02:23.819> long

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
some typical ones and it's quite long

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.000 
some typical ones and it's quite long
and<00:02:24.480> yeah<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.019> just<00:02:25.079> push<00:02:25.379> here<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.560> it's<00:02:25.859> a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
and yeah it's just push here and it's a

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.190 
and yeah it's just push here and it's a
straight<00:02:26.519> one<00:02:26.640> no<00:02:26.879> curve<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.450> which<00:02:27.719> I<00:02:27.989> like

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
straight one no curve to it which I like

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.270 
straight one no curve to it which I like
because<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.469> don't<00:02:28.500> really<00:02:28.739> like<00:02:28.859> the<00:02:29.010> curves

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
because I don't really like the curves

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.520 
because I don't really like the curves
and<00:02:29.730> like<00:02:30.269> I<00:02:30.299> said<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.599> got<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.019> waterproof<00:02:31.500> one

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
and like I said I got the waterproof one

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.220 
and like I said I got the waterproof one
basically<00:02:32.220> if<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:32.790> do<00:02:33.480> get<00:02:33.629> lucky<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:33.989> get<00:02:34.079> to

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
basically if I do get lucky and get to

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.809 
basically if I do get lucky and get to
have<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.349> nap<00:02:34.590> or<00:02:34.980> something

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
have a nap or something

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.819 
have a nap or something
or<00:02:36.269> then<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.569> lot<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:37.019> times<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.319> rub<00:02:37.680> my

off<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:35.729> it<00:03:36.269> does<00:03:36.479> take<00:03:36.750> quite<00:03:36.989> some<00:03:37.290> time<00:03:37.560> to

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
off so it does take quite some time to

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.729 
off so it does take quite some time to
get<00:03:37.889> off<00:03:38.040> but<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:39.569> results<00:03:40.079> are<00:03:40.260> pretty<00:03:40.500> good

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
get off but the results are pretty good

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.890 
get off but the results are pretty good
so<00:03:41.069> this<00:03:41.549> is<00:03:41.699> what<00:03:41.849> my<00:03:41.970> eyes<00:03:42.150> look<00:03:42.449> like<00:03:42.599> now

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
so this is what my eyes look like now

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.089 
so this is what my eyes look like now
that<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.319> have<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.709> on<00:03:43.799> both<00:03:44.099> of<00:03:44.159> them<00:03:45.590> so<00:03:46.590> as<00:03:46.919> you

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
that I have it on both of them so as you

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:53.479 
that I have it on both of them so as you
can<00:03:47.220> see<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:49.579> is<00:03:50.579> all<00:03:50.940> over<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:52.560> definitely

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
can see it is all over and definitely

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.550 
can see it is all over and definitely
makes<00:03:53.760> them<00:03:54.030> appear<00:03:54.269> nice<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.109> long<00:03:55.229> and<00:03:55.439> I'll

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
makes them appear nice and long and I'll

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.490 
makes them appear nice and long and I'll
just<00:03:55.799> insert<00:03:56.189> a<00:03:56.340> little<00:03:56.609> clip<00:03:56.970> of<00:03:57.120> me<00:03:57.629> applying

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
just insert a little clip of me applying

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.439 
just insert a little clip of me applying
it<00:03:58.799> so<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.099> can<00:03:59.250> kind<00:03:59.459> of<00:03:59.549> see<00:03:59.970> what<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.239> looks

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
it so you can kind of see what it looks

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.089 
it so you can kind of see what it looks
like<00:04:00.569> going<00:04:00.989> on<00:04:01.109> and<00:04:01.290> there<00:04:01.439> are<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.620> few<00:04:01.859> clumps

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
like going on and there are a few clumps

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:15.100 
like going on and there are a few clumps
but<00:04:02.639> then<00:04:02.819> I<00:04:03.030> get<00:04:03.209> rid<00:04:03.359> of<00:04:03.419> them<00:04:03.540> as<00:04:03.689> well

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.420 

so<00:04:15.890> that<00:04:16.220> is<00:04:16.459> my<00:04:16.760> review<00:04:17.330> overall<00:04:18.170> I<00:04:18.440> I

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
one I haven't tried that one just like I

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.640 
one I haven't tried that one just like I
said<00:04:25.670> I<00:04:25.820> like<00:04:26.420> my<00:04:26.660> waterproof<00:04:27.110> mascara

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
said I like my waterproof mascara

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.300 
said I like my waterproof mascara
um<00:04:28.570> but<00:04:29.570> yeah<00:04:29.720> it<00:04:30.080> doesn't<00:04:30.320> help<00:04:30.650> with<00:04:30.950> the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
um but yeah it doesn't help with the

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.090 
um but yeah it doesn't help with the
length<00:04:31.970> but<00:04:32.540> it's<00:04:32.750> not<00:04:32.930> trying<00:04:33.230> to<00:04:33.380> either<00:04:33.500> so

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
length but it's not trying to either so

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.870 
length but it's not trying to either so
I<00:04:34.370> say<00:04:34.790> it<00:04:34.940> does<00:04:35.470> work<00:04:36.470> very<00:04:36.890> well<00:04:36.980> in<00:04:37.430> adding

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.490 
I say it does work very well in adding
volume<00:04:38.060> without<00:04:38.390> just<00:04:38.750> like<00:04:38.870> taking<00:04:39.350> on<00:04:39.440> a
