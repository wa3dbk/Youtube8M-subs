00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.050
 also sophisticated and simple that reflect a sense of movement and 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.960
 keeps in harmony with the landscape 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.949
 this is the way in which Carlos Molina works before he has positioned himself as 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.419
 one of the best country house designers in colombia 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.489
 the culture I propose that integrates the country in the place with a good 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.500
 Indoor performance have to do with the materials according to the art 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.170
 For example, this rest home located in a cold area near 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.990
 medellin 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.640
 It is built in stone and metal and designed from an old house of 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.140
 that their owners wanted to be more 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.710
 for this we take it 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.370
 the idea is to have a patio as a garden 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.350
 interior that communicates with the house regarding the default 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.900
 this fusion between past and present I launched through this sabÃ³n and 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.490
 wood and glass stone 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.840
 that allows greater illumination 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.760
 its two levels are connected by a bacillus the characteristic space in its 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.770
 works 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.750
 the materials that are visible both inside and in their 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.630
 terraces 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.240
 in this case of a structure 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.110
 of iron 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.070
 you want 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.790
 never look and the management of the foundation is done 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.750
 fronts colors 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.000
 for a community 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.440
 much more in line with attitude 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.060
 the sophistication and the link of its structures with the landscape are also 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.910
 remarkable in room house like this 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.649
 with the position a lopez shape 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.680
 it did not generate a great fight 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.270
 that explodes between the space we reach a gate and invites us to the space of 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.890
 height 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.260
 in the interior space 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.180
 we communicate the second private level to the room of this stair april 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.640
 and we pass here to this room that this integral dining room a kitchen with 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.340
 products 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.920
 in the second level we have what is the being that communicates through this 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.980
 empty integrates nature through this program 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.160
 here we have the p 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.450
 in wood that is completely connected with it the country forward 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.820
 that makes a house different to live in a house of rest in their designs 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.870
 the singer showed a much more compact rate each one 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.399
 with the smallest spaces in this one 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:19.489
 the flexibility and interior space so after much more comfortable 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.489
 'for much more comfort 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.370
 in warm regions mourinho gives prominence to color communist house 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.639
 rest completely white the first idea was in the middle of mountains 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.489
 with the green 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.549
 general a white girl 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.359
 I'm very quiet companies 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:39.220
 stop him 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.640
 what a feeling the feeling of freshness 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.010
 the sense of spaciousness 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.039
 and because of the weather is an invention it worked much better 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:50.839
 for the temperature the geometric perforations of its main access and its 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:55.509
 horizontal shape allow a permanent visual relationship between the house and the 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.119
 landscape 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:01.540
 The simplicity of this design not only makes it dynamic and contemporary 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.169
 also less expensive the economy the house is earthly 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:06.089
 the materials 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:10.419
 how are we going on the staircase that cantilever and embed wall does not need 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.429
 no other structural element so it generates greater autonomy 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.879
 equally in the structure 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.780
 it's light metal ideas a lot more specialty what it means 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.099
 in the structural part so that we do not have to lay the foundations 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.069
 no type of cost 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.179
 which the sensual for 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:30.250
 this house was chosen in 2007 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.940
 It was one of the first ten architectural projects of Colombia 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:40.550
 in areas of low temperature, molina also used a trellis and a clay tile 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.440
 and insist on the terraces 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.030
 interior tricks 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.430
 large windows 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.430
 and the double-space vacuum in the dirty area 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.279
 came darker colors the matter are plotted a character of the royal 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:56.449
 rangel and the black stones will do 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:00.339
 when one lies much calmer the combined with the brick against the 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:02.089
 wood in darker tones 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:04.949
 it was not a much more intimate interior note 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.860
 his contemporary style also reaches the city 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.049
 in this house that remodeled the Medellin 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.509
 in the first level intact lounge 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:15.169
 dining room and kitchen 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:16.340
 indicated environment 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.340
 in the end I think 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:21.449
 a day 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.400
 the cutting intent tehran denies 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.400
 aspect of a minister among whom was 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.319
 On the other hand, the office 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.469
 which is like saying that nothing interests you 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:38.930
 the staircase and near the wall and the metal bridge 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.160
 induce the private zone in the second level and integrates the first through 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
 from another social area 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.150
 this five houses are an example of the work of an architect who responds to the 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.840
 trend called new plant 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.120
 own interpretation of spaces without divisions 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.699
 of simple lines and with a permanent contact with nature 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.309
 to keep doing what I was doing 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:06.620
 medellin 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.090
 at the same time
