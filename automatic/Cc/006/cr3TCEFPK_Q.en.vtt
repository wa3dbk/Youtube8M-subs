00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370 

I<00:00:00.329> think<00:00:00.719> it's<00:00:00.870> just<00:00:01.199> the<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:02.010> immense<00:00:03.049> joy<00:00:04.049> of

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
I think it's just the the immense joy of

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.980 
I think it's just the the immense joy of
being<00:00:04.680> surrounded<00:00:05.370> by<00:00:05.700> that<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.240> mean<00:00:06.870> the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
being surrounded by that I mean the

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.049 
being surrounded by that I mean the
closeness<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:08.040> get<00:00:08.340> from<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.700> animal

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
closeness that you get from the animal

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.259 
closeness that you get from the animal
and<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.240> think<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> new<00:00:10.440> perception<00:00:11.269> towards

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
and I think is a new perception towards

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.940 
and I think is a new perception towards
the<00:00:12.450> animals<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.110> all<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.530> sudden<00:00:13.710> you

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
the animals and all the sudden you

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.680 
the animals and all the sudden you
realize<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.370> actually<00:00:14.730> they<00:00:15.030> do<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.269> in

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
realize that actually they do have in

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.590 
realize that actually they do have in
fact<00:00:16.340> personalities<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> way<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.210> approach

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
fact personalities and a way to approach

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.260 
fact personalities and a way to approach
you<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:19.020> fear<00:00:19.230> one<00:00:19.439> shark<00:00:19.830> from<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.160> other<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
you to fear one shark from the other the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.120 
you to fear one shark from the other the
the<00:00:21.449> tonic<00:00:21.900> immobility<00:00:22.050> as<00:00:22.560> has<00:00:22.710> been<00:00:22.890> defined

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the tonic immobility as has been defined

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.929 
the tonic immobility as has been defined
is<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.840> scientific<00:00:24.840> proved<00:00:25.430> natural<00:00:26.430> behavior

is a scientific proved natural behavior
of<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.210> animal<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.109> usually<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.680> reaction

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
of the animal and is usually a reaction

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.530 
of the animal and is usually a reaction
of<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.699> sharks<00:00:30.599> under<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.380> stress<00:00:31.859> or<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.610> threat

or in the typical what I call the upside
down<00:00:37.110> body<00:00:37.469> position<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.460> grab<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
down body position so you can grab the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.299 
down body position so you can grab the
tail<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.899> little<00:00:40.110> silkies<00:00:40.590> twister<00:00:41.129> tail

are<00:00:57.510> my<00:00:57.629> witness<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.620> into<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> sharks

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
are my witness to that into the sharks

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.880 
are my witness to that into the sharks
like<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> shirt<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.780> kept<00:01:01.170> following<00:01:01.379> me<00:01:01.710> to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
like the shirt that kept following me to

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.590 
like the shirt that kept following me to
keep<00:01:02.070> getting<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> pack<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.059> mean<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.390> would

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
keep getting the pack I mean I would

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.690 
keep getting the pack I mean I would
just<00:01:03.750> leave<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.140> my<00:01:04.260> hand<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.589> say<00:01:04.739> stay<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
just leave in my hand and say stay and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.280 
just leave in my hand and say stay and
she<00:01:05.850> kept<00:01:06.090> coming<00:01:06.799> so<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.340> think

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
she kept coming so this I think

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.810 
she kept coming so this I think
meaning<00:01:11.290> they<00:01:11.500> do<00:01:11.560> that<00:01:12.010> in<00:01:12.220> nature<00:01:12.370> otherwise

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
meaning they do that in nature otherwise

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.399 
meaning they do that in nature otherwise
is<00:01:13.090> not<00:01:13.120> that<00:01:13.420> they<00:01:13.510> could<00:01:13.720> do<00:01:13.840> something<00:01:14.290> that

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
is not that they could do something that

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.910 
is not that they could do something that
doesn't<00:01:14.770> exist<00:01:14.890> in<00:01:15.250> their<00:01:15.460> nature

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
doesn't exist in their nature

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.130 
doesn't exist in their nature
what<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:17.950> just<00:01:18.340> do<00:01:18.580> I<00:01:18.610> think<00:01:18.790> I<00:01:19.300> stimulated

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
what I just do I think I stimulated

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.280 
what I just do I think I stimulated
through<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:21.220> high<00:01:21.550> sensory<00:01:22.180> area<00:01:22.570> of<00:01:22.780> me<00:01:23.050> of

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
through the high sensory area of me of

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.320 
through the high sensory area of me of
their<00:01:23.500> face<00:01:23.830> where<00:01:24.070> biancalana<00:01:24.550> before

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
their face where biancalana before

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.560 
their face where biancalana before
encinia<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:27.310> it's<00:01:27.729> taught<00:01:28.060> it<00:01:28.270> but<00:01:28.510> it's<00:01:28.720> not

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
encinia so it's taught it but it's not

00:01:30.570 --> 00:02:06.240 
encinia so it's taught it but it's not
my<00:01:31.580> stress-induced<00:01:32.580> on

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.850 

some<00:02:06.910> shirts<00:02:07.270> have<00:02:07.510> evolved<00:02:08.110> before<00:02:08.290> to

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
some shirts have evolved before to

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.390 
some shirts have evolved before to
facilitate<00:02:09.550> mania<00:02:10.030> for<00:02:10.300> example<00:02:10.750> but<00:02:10.900> when<00:02:11.400> if

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
facilitate mania for example but when if

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.850 
facilitate mania for example but when if
you<00:02:12.610> look<00:02:12.640> at<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.240> meaning<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.720> shirts<00:02:14.140> for<00:02:14.830> a

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
you look at the meaning of shirts for a

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.530 
you look at the meaning of shirts for a
human<00:02:15.580> perception<00:02:16.150> because<00:02:16.300> that's<00:02:16.450> our

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
human perception because that's our

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
mistake we always put kind of like an

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.850

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
entire situation so I think once that

entire situation so I think once that
happens<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.500> Tony<00:02:57.800> facilitates<00:02:58.790> me<00:02:59.000> in<00:02:59.210> the

it's<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.540> overwhelming<00:03:09.319> because<00:03:09.530> you

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
it's the overwhelming because you

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.430 
it's the overwhelming because you
constantly<00:03:10.520> have<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.790> be<00:03:11.060> switched<00:03:11.510> on<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.140> is

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
constantly have to be switched on and is

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.089 
constantly have to be switched on and is
also<00:03:13.390> physically<00:03:14.390> with<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.770> top<00:03:15.770> is<00:03:15.950> the

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
also physically with the top is the

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.190 
also physically with the top is the
adrenaline<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.060> then<00:03:17.390> when<00:03:17.720> it<00:03:17.870> starts

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
adrenaline and then when it starts

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.550 
adrenaline and then when it starts
finally<00:03:19.270> going<00:03:20.270> down<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:20.959> think<00:03:21.230> there's<00:03:21.410> also

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
finally going down I think there's also

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.309 
finally going down I think there's also
the<00:03:21.770> organization<00:03:22.160> that's<00:03:22.580> like<00:03:22.810> wow<00:03:23.810> did<00:03:24.170> I

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
the organization that's like wow did I

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.330 
the organization that's like wow did I
just<00:03:24.349> do<00:03:24.860> that<00:03:25.599> was<00:03:26.599> that<00:03:26.810> just<00:03:27.170> that<00:03:27.530> able<00:03:28.099> to

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
just do that was that just that able to

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.470 
just do that was that just that able to
pat<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.330> feel<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:30.349> be<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:31.269> be<00:03:32.269> surrounded

pat and feel and be and be surrounded
with<00:03:32.780> sharks<00:03:33.319> I<00:03:33.470> think<00:03:33.680> it's<00:03:33.830> just<00:03:34.010> both<00:03:34.400> you

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
with sharks I think it's just both you

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.220 
with sharks I think it's just both you
know<00:03:34.700> like<00:03:34.849> you're<00:03:35.000> going<00:03:35.269> up<00:03:35.450> in<00:03:35.720> that<00:03:35.750> and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
know like you're going up in that and

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.990 
know like you're going up in that and
then<00:03:36.440> you're<00:03:36.709> coming<00:03:37.190> down<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.550> finally<00:03:37.910> it

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
then you're coming down and finally it

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.330 
then you're coming down and finally it
hits<00:03:38.180> home<00:03:38.510> which<00:03:38.810> is<00:03:38.840> just<00:03:39.019> being<00:03:39.349> privileged

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
hits home which is just being privileged

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.860 
hits home which is just being privileged
enough<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.760> experience<00:03:41.420> because<00:03:41.569> it's<00:03:41.780> a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
enough to experience because it's a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:50.380 
enough to experience because it's a
privilege
