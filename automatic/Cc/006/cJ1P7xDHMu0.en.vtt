00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.599

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.880
 of our packaging as you can see well 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.400
 in the manufacturer's brand the type of 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.990
 found in this case a fleet cover and for 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.780

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.460
 in the back we find the 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.470
 different types of colors in which 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.880

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.280
 Mexican pesos an equivalent to 7 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:55.519
 dollars but walking on average at 350 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.519
 pesos or 12 dollars we are going to uncover what 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.439

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.960
 from the inside 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.930
 a sponge and they are of these type 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.970
 The truth is that it makes me very 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.310
 smart how do you look with this kind of 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.040
 covers 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.659
 ahead we find a skin type 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.079
 and inside type of velvet 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.450
 on the back is plastic this 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.420
 will replace the stage of our 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.719
 cell phone we're going to put it on to see how 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.719
 they look 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.590
 ready there in bonus 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.290
 how can you see that you have discovered 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.300
 completely from the sides we are going to 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.340
 to have access without any 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.220
 problem to the hearing aid input 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.910
 without any problem and at the entrance of 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.790
 micro usb 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.250
 the truth looks very good 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.459
 as you can see it will be perfectly 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.250
 lid itself gets up very little because 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.120
 I've seen that the samsung gets up 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.239
 too much as you can see it looks very 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.239

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.400

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.400
 excellent day
