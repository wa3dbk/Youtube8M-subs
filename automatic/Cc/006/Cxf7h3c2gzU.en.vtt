third of this of the clay cutter you're
going<00:00:23.090> to<00:00:23.149> go<00:00:23.329> down<00:00:23.540> about<00:00:23.960> it<00:00:24.020> an<00:00:24.320> inch<00:00:24.710> or<00:00:24.919> so

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
going to go down about it an inch or so

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.440 
going to go down about it an inch or so
you're<00:00:26.300> going<00:00:26.360> to<00:00:26.480> hold<00:00:26.689> it<00:00:26.960> taut<00:00:27.380> on<00:00:27.649> this<00:00:27.950> end

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
you're going to hold it taut on this end

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.030 
you're going to hold it taut on this end
you're<00:00:29.450> going<00:00:29.599> to<00:00:29.720> line<00:00:29.899> it<00:00:29.930> up<00:00:30.169> parallel<00:00:30.800> at

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
you're going to line it up parallel at

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.440 
you're going to line it up parallel at
this<00:00:31.399> side<00:00:31.640> and<00:00:31.880> you're<00:00:32.029> going<00:00:32.149> to<00:00:32.210> come

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
this side and you're going to come

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.270 
this side and you're going to come
across<00:00:32.570> your<00:00:33.880> chest<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:36.470> when<00:00:36.650> you<00:00:36.770> do<00:00:36.980> that

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
across your chest and when you do that

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.970 
across your chest and when you do that
you<00:00:37.970> get<00:00:38.150> it<00:00:38.300> pretty<00:00:38.690> much<00:00:38.870> an<00:00:39.080> even<00:00:39.290> slab<00:00:39.740> of

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
you get it pretty much an even slab of

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.900 
you get it pretty much an even slab of
clay<00:00:40.900> and<00:00:42.010> hopefully<00:00:45.010> that<00:00:46.010> makes<00:00:46.250> it<00:00:46.430> easier

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
clay and hopefully that makes it easier

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.410 
clay and hopefully that makes it easier
to<00:00:46.970> roll<00:00:47.420> when<00:00:48.350> you're<00:00:48.530> rolling<00:00:48.770> clay<00:00:49.420> you're

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
to roll when you're rolling clay you're

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.750 
to roll when you're rolling clay you're
going<00:00:50.600> to<00:00:50.720> want<00:00:50.990> to<00:00:51.170> roll<00:00:52.160> back<00:00:52.490> and<00:00:52.700> forth

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
going to want to roll back and forth

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.910 
going to want to roll back and forth
that's<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.420> worst<00:00:53.600> thing<00:00:53.870> to<00:00:54.020> do<00:00:54.200> what<00:00:54.800> you

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
that's the worst thing to do what you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.890 
that's the worst thing to do what you
want<00:00:55.100> to<00:00:55.220> do<00:00:55.370> is<00:00:55.670> what<00:00:55.970> I<00:00:56.000> call<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.600> British

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
want to do is what I call the British

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.460 
want to do is what I call the British
flag<00:00:57.170> or<00:00:58.720> for<00:00:59.720> every<00:00:59.900> action<00:01:00.079> there's<00:01:00.410> an

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
flag or for every action there's an

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.110 
flag or for every action there's an
equal<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:00.829> opposite<00:01:01.220> reaction<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.090> that

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
equal and opposite reaction so that

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.370 
equal and opposite reaction so that
means<00:01:02.450> you<00:01:02.600> put<00:01:02.810> the<00:01:02.960> rolling<00:01:03.200> pins

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
means you put the rolling pins

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.670 
means you put the rolling pins
immedlately<00:01:03.649> go<00:01:03.860> up<00:01:04.100> down<00:01:04.990> diagonal<00:01:05.990> diagonal

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
immedlately go up down diagonal diagonal

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.640 
immedlately go up down diagonal diagonal

side<00:01:13.220> then<00:01:14.120> after<00:01:14.540> a<00:01:14.570> couple<00:01:14.750> of<00:01:14.930> rolls<00:01:15.140> you

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
side then after a couple of rolls you

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.020 
side then after a couple of rolls you
want<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.620> turn<00:01:15.830> it<00:01:15.950> over<00:01:16.070> because<00:01:16.610> if<00:01:16.760> you<00:01:16.850> get

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
want to turn it over because if you get

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.350 
want to turn it over because if you get
any<00:01:17.270> kind<00:01:17.540> of<00:01:17.780> fold<00:01:18.409> in<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.770> canvas<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.610> you

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
any kind of fold in the canvas and you

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.510 
any kind of fold in the canvas and you
roll<00:01:20.540> it<00:01:20.570> onto<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:20.990> clay<00:01:21.380> you'll<00:01:22.010> get<00:01:22.190> a<00:01:22.220> line

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
roll it onto the clay you'll get a line

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.070 
roll it onto the clay you'll get a line
like<00:01:22.760> that<00:01:22.790> which<00:01:23.150> will<00:01:23.299> develop<00:01:23.690> into<00:01:24.049> a

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
like that which will develop into a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.180 
like that which will develop into a
crack<00:01:24.440> so<00:01:25.280> get<00:01:25.520> up<00:01:25.760> down<00:01:26.440> diagonal<00:01:27.440> diagonal

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
crack so get up down diagonal diagonal

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.149 
crack so get up down diagonal diagonal
side<00:01:28.909> side<00:01:29.890> top<00:01:30.890> down<00:01:31.299> diagonal<00:01:32.299> diagonal<00:01:33.170> by

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
side side top down diagonal diagonal by

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.820 
side side top down diagonal diagonal by
side<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:35.659> reason<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.080> want<00:01:36.260> to<00:01:36.350> roll<00:01:36.560> that

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
side the reason you want to roll that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.250 
side the reason you want to roll that
way<00:01:36.979> for<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.310> flat<00:01:37.580> slab<00:01:37.970> is<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:38.990> notice

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
way for a flat slab is that you notice

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.440 
way for a flat slab is that you notice
that<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:39.500> keeps<00:01:39.740> this<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.610> surface<00:01:41.030> totally

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
that it keeps this the surface totally

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.230 
that it keeps this the surface totally
flat<00:01:41.780> if<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:42.950> start<00:01:43.220> rolling<00:01:43.430> really<00:01:43.790> fast

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
flat if you start rolling really fast

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.780 
flat if you start rolling really fast
you'll<00:01:44.869> notice<00:01:45.260> that<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.530> get<00:01:45.680> ripples<00:01:45.950> and

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
you'll notice that you get ripples and

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.960 
you'll notice that you get ripples and
also<00:01:47.330> you'll<00:01:48.159> sometimes<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.340> side<00:01:49.610> of<00:01:49.820> your

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
also you'll sometimes the side of your

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.340 
also you'll sometimes the side of your
pieces<00:01:50.210> will<00:01:50.540> get<00:01:51.040> much<00:01:52.299> thinner<00:01:53.299> so<00:01:54.110> when<00:01:54.229> you

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
pieces will get much thinner so when you

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.950 
pieces will get much thinner so when you
do<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.619> this<00:01:54.799> way<00:01:56.409> you<00:01:57.409> get<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.680> very<00:01:57.950> even<00:01:58.750> slab

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.050 

before<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.080> get<00:02:04.260> too<00:02:04.500> thin<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.640> want<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.940> get

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
before you get too thin you want to get

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.910 
before you get too thin you want to get
in<00:02:06.150> a<00:02:06.180> habit<00:02:06.330> of<00:02:06.570> cutting<00:02:06.810> off<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.260> edge<00:02:08.300> and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
in a habit of cutting off the edge and

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.370 
in a habit of cutting off the edge and
you<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:11.340> for<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.640> couple<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.970> reasons<00:02:12.380> one

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
you do this for a couple of reasons one

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.040 
you do this for a couple of reasons one
is<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.770> gives<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> visual<00:02:14.910> idea<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.600> how

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
is it gives you a visual idea of how

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.370 
is it gives you a visual idea of how
thick<00:02:16.350> your<00:02:16.470> piece<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.710> clay<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:18.230> because<00:02:19.230> you

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
thick your piece of clay is because you

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.030 
thick your piece of clay is because you
can<00:02:19.560> either<00:02:19.860> put<00:02:20.820> these<00:02:21.060> four<00:02:22.040> pieces

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
can either put these four pieces

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.000 
can either put these four pieces
together<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:24.230> take<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> look<00:02:25.530> at<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.770> cut

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
together and take a look at the cut

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.680 
together and take a look at the cut
edges<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:27.110> see<00:02:28.110> how<00:02:28.320> thick<00:02:28.680> they<00:02:28.890> are<00:02:29.240> or<00:02:30.240> you

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
edges and see how thick they are or you

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.830 
edges and see how thick they are or you
can<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:31.050> visually<00:02:31.620> look<00:02:32.580> at<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:33.690> is

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
can just visually look at it so this is

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.350 
can just visually look at it so this is
quite<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.080> bit<00:02:34.290> thicker<00:02:34.470> than<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.890> one<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.270> I'm

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
quite a bit thicker than I one so I'm

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.930 
quite a bit thicker than I one so I'm
going<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.660> continue<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.320> roll<00:02:39.050> up<00:02:40.050> down<00:02:40.490> dad<00:02:41.490> no

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
going to continue to roll up down dad no

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.930 
going to continue to roll up down dad no
dad<00:02:42.450> no<00:02:42.840> sign<00:02:43.500> side<00:02:44.510> flip<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.660> over<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.880> can

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
dad no sign side flip it over you can

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.610 
dad no sign side flip it over you can
see<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.240> it's<00:02:48.510> picking<00:02:48.900> up<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:49.050> little<00:02:49.260> bit<00:02:49.500> of

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
see that it's picking up a little bit of

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.000 
see that it's picking up a little bit of
the<00:02:49.970> design<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.209> use<00:02:51.690> my<00:02:51.870> canvas<00:02:52.470> all<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.770> time

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
the design I use my canvas all the time

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.790 
the design I use my canvas all the time
to<00:02:53.250> try<00:02:53.459> out<00:02:53.610> ideas<00:02:53.880> for<00:02:54.360> students<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:55.620> don't

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
to try out ideas for students you don't

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.260 
to try out ideas for students you don't
really<00:02:55.920> have<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.370> worry<00:02:56.580> because<00:02:56.820> when<00:02:57.180> it

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
really have to worry because when it

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.820 
really have to worry because when it
gets<00:02:58.050> fire

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
gets fire

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.980 
gets fire
none<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.550> that<00:02:59.670> would<00:02:59.940> actually<00:03:00.330> show<00:03:00.570> burns

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
none of that would actually show burns

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.040 
none of that would actually show burns
out<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.880> film<00:03:03.380> so<00:03:05.810> that's<00:03:06.810> starting

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
out of this in film so that's starting

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.850 
out of this in film so that's starting
to<00:03:07.200> be<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.440> better<00:03:08.360> better<00:03:09.360> size<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.260> again<00:03:10.320> a

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
to be a better better size and again a

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.900 
to be a better better size and again a
better<00:03:11.489> thickness

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.700 

so<00:03:17.420> that's<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:17.720> better<00:03:17.900> thickness<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.560> it's

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
so that's a better thickness and it's

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.200 
so that's a better thickness and it's
really<00:03:19.010> even<00:03:19.210> all<00:03:20.210> the<00:03:20.390> way<00:03:20.540> through<00:03:22.210> same

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
really even all the way through same

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:32.080 
really even all the way through same
thing<00:03:23.450> here<00:03:23.750> looks<00:03:24.020> a<00:03:24.110> little<00:03:24.200> thicker<00:03:24.590> on<00:03:24.800> top

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.520 

check<00:03:33.090> they're<00:03:33.390> not<00:03:33.810> too<00:03:34.049> bad

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
check they're not too bad

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.009 
check they're not too bad
okay<00:03:35.599> you<00:03:36.599> can<00:03:36.810> use<00:03:37.969> these<00:03:38.969> tiles<00:03:39.299> are<00:03:39.569> for

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
okay you can use these tiles are for

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.220 
okay you can use these tiles are for
four<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.739> quarter<00:03:40.920> by<00:03:41.069> four<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.579> quarter

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
four and a quarter by four and a quarter

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
four and a quarter by four and a quarter
you<00:03:43.230> can<00:03:43.409> line<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.620> up<00:03:43.859> at<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.159> edge<00:03:46.010> you<00:03:47.010> can

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
you can line it up at the edge you can

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.020 
you can line it up at the edge you can
cut<00:03:48.109> and<00:03:49.109> if<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:49.769> do<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.549> want<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.849> keep

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
cut and if you do that you want to keep

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.970 
cut and if you do that you want to keep
the<00:03:51.239> extra<00:03:51.780> pieces<00:03:52.079> almost<00:03:53.069> like<00:03:53.609> a<00:03:54.950> piece<00:03:55.950> of

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
the extra pieces almost like a piece of

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.740 
the extra pieces almost like a piece of
scrap<00:03:56.370> paper<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:56.909> you<00:03:57.000> could<00:03:57.180> work<00:03:57.359> out<00:03:57.569> your

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
scrap paper so you could work out your

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.900 
scrap paper so you could work out your
ideas

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.120 

this<00:04:01.480> is<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.840> tile<00:04:02.080> that's<00:04:02.380> called<00:04:02.650> scruffy

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
this is the tile that's called scruffy

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.150 
this is the tile that's called scruffy
toe<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.640> has<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.910> same<00:04:04.180> name<00:04:04.870> base<00:04:05.650> name<00:04:05.980> as

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
toe and has the same name base name as

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.920 
toe and has the same name base name as
graffiti<00:04:06.520> and<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:06.880> means<00:04:07.030> scratching<00:04:07.630> through

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
graffiti and it means scratching through

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.520 
graffiti and it means scratching through
so<00:04:08.740> you're<00:04:08.860> going<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:09.070> take<00:04:09.280> your<00:04:09.460> tile<00:04:09.790> and

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
so you're going to take your tile and

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.990 
so you're going to take your tile and
you're<00:04:11.530> going<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:11.740> cover<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.160> with<00:04:12.220> glaze<00:04:12.700> or

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
you're going to cover it with glaze or

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:46.930 
you're going to cover it with glaze or
under<00:04:13.270> glaze<00:04:18.959> not<00:04:19.959> too<00:04:20.200> thick<00:04:22.260> we<00:04:23.260> thin<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.650> out

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.600 

okay<00:04:47.540> and<00:04:47.750> then<00:04:50.710> using<00:04:51.710> your<00:04:51.740> fettling<00:04:52.340> knife

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
okay and then using your fettling knife

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.150 
okay and then using your fettling knife
you're<00:04:53.540> not<00:04:54.050> going<00:04:54.230> to<00:04:54.290> be<00:04:54.380> using<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.860> sharp

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
you're not going to be using the sharp

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.380 
you're not going to be using the sharp
edge<00:04:55.370> of<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.610> felling<00:04:55.910> knife<00:04:56.060> you're<00:04:56.270> going

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
edge of the felling knife you're going

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.510 
edge of the felling knife you're going
to<00:04:56.450> be<00:04:56.540> turning<00:04:56.870> it<00:04:56.960> over<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:58.040> right<00:04:58.220> side

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
to be turning it over to the right side

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.090 
to be turning it over to the right side
and<00:04:58.850> essentially<00:04:59.840> you're<00:05:00.470> going<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:00.920> be

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
and essentially you're going to be

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.250 
and essentially you're going to be
scraping<00:05:01.550> through<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:02.060> paint<00:05:02.390> you're

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
scraping through the paint you're

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:12.040 
scraping through the paint you're
essentially<00:05:03.860> drawing<00:05:06.340> with<00:05:07.340> your<00:05:08.000> knife<00:05:11.050> your

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
essentially drawing with your knife your

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.290 
essentially drawing with your knife your
clay<00:05:12.260> itself<00:05:12.620> is<00:05:12.830> gray<00:05:13.100> now<00:05:13.370> but<00:05:13.670> as<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:14.030> dries

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
clay itself is gray now but as it dries

00:05:14.300 --> 00:06:19.730 
clay itself is gray now but as it dries
it'll<00:05:14.630> turn<00:05:14.870> white

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:07:34.210 

the<00:06:20.250> liquidus<00:06:20.660> cityscape

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.220 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.909 

okay<00:07:35.220> so<00:07:35.490> that's<00:07:35.849> all<00:07:36.240> you<00:07:36.360> have<00:07:36.569> to<00:07:36.750> do<00:07:36.960> with

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 
okay so that's all you have to do with

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:44.749 
okay so that's all you have to do with
the<00:07:39.110> the<00:07:40.110> tile<00:07:41.150> and<00:07:42.349> it<00:07:43.349> is<00:07:43.470> ass<00:07:43.620> graffito<00:07:44.069> so

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 
the the tile and it is ass graffito so

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:46.430 
the the tile and it is ass graffito so
it's<00:07:44.909> automatically<00:07:45.569> whatever<00:07:46.080> color<00:07:46.349> you

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 
it's automatically whatever color you

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.749 
it's automatically whatever color you
put<00:07:46.560> on<00:07:46.680> top<00:07:46.889> in<00:07:47.039> this<00:07:47.099> case<00:07:47.370> it's<00:07:47.550> going<00:07:47.639> to<00:07:47.699> be
