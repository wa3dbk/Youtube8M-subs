but we weren't on the commons in Latin
what<00:01:47.190> how<00:01:48.190> exactly<00:01:48.580> like<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.060> process<00:01:49.570> of

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
what how exactly like the process of

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.600 
what how exactly like the process of
that<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.049> how<00:01:50.260> people<00:01:50.590> how<00:01:51.040> it<00:01:51.190> worked<00:01:51.430> the

that and how people how it worked the
site<00:01:51.850> halls<00:01:52.150> and<00:01:52.510> I<00:01:52.900> thought<00:01:53.470> we<00:01:53.650> did<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:54.250> work

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
site halls and I thought we did the work

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.890 
site halls and I thought we did the work
unlike<00:01:54.909> just<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.240> physical<00:01:55.420> but

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
unlike just the physical but

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.859 
unlike just the physical but
restructuring<00:01:56.890> of<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.040> school<00:01:57.750> then<00:01:58.750> in

terms of the common rooms I think we

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:09.240 
terms of the common rooms I think we
didn't<00:02:02.050> do<00:02:02.470> such<00:02:02.680> good<00:02:02.860> work
