00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:18.100
Today we´re going to show you how we warm up Tage before we start jumping.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.100
What is the very first thing we start with, Anna?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:40.720
We walk with the horses from the ground. Then both horse and rider will be warmed up, and it´s a good way to tighten the girth in rounds.

00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:48.176
Here Anna is walking. As you can see she is really warming up her butt too ;)

00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:00.980
When we warm up before jumping, the main focus is about gas, break and turning.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.120
We don´t really care about if the horse is a little bit above the bit, as long as it listens to the riders aids.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.980
Here Anna did a halt, but Tage didn´t really want to stand still. Then Anna did a new, better halt.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.080
And when the horses does right, we always laud them.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.620
For a suppling exercise, we like to do some lateral works.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.980
Now Tage didn´t want to rein back.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.760
This time it went much better!

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.020
Now Anna and Tage have begun to trot.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:17.860
Since Tage is a lazy horse we make sure to change the pace often, so he´ll listen to the active leg.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.240
We also move forward to walk/trot quite often.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.600
Now Anna does some leg-yielding with Tage.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:24.020
Tage´s steps are a bit too short now, but this is common for him in the beginning of the warm up.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.160
Some more leg-yielding!

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:01.120
We like to trot over poles with Tage before we start to canter.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.860
Nice! :)

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:52.480
Now Anna has started to canter Tage. He has some difficulties with his canter, and therefore Anna stands up in the stirrups in the beginning.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.220
In the canter, she also makes sure to change the pace.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.040
Same job in left canter!

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:12.900
Now Anna is sitting down in the saddle, which she can do when Tage is warmed up.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:25.400
And when she wants Tage to increase speed, she stands up in the stirrups.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:48.400
It´s very different from horse to horse how to warm up in a perfect way, but this works for Tage.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:04.400
I don´t care if Tage is over the bit sometimes. I just want him to listen to my aids. Especially my active leg.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:50.240
