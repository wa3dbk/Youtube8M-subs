00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.250 
here in this corner yet to show you a
sample<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.110> obviously<00:01:25.619> you

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
sample but obviously you

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.380 
sample but obviously you
angle<00:01:26.890> all<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.190> way<00:01:27.280> down<00:01:27.550> this<00:01:27.880> angle<00:01:28.240> all

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
angle all the way down this angle all

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:39.410 
angle all the way down this angle all
the<00:01:28.480> way<00:01:28.570> across<00:01:28.780> so<00:01:29.740> on<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.040> so<00:01:30.160> forth<00:01:30.460> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.200 

call<00:01:40.420> your<00:01:40.660> mother<00:01:40.930> fly<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.440> in<00:01:41.620> the<00:01:41.680> corner

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
call your mother fly it in the corner

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.370 
call your mother fly it in the corner

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
double-sided knife come right into that

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.420 
double-sided knife come right into that
corner<00:01:48.540> bring<00:01:49.540> it<00:01:49.660> out<00:01:49.840> again<00:01:50.170> come<00:01:51.040> right<00:01:51.280> in
