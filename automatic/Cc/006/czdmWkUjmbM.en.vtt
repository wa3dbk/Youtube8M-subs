it's a very nicely designed unit feels
good<00:02:38.240> to<00:02:38.420> use<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:39.290> fire<00:02:39.740> steel<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.220> they've

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
good to use the fire steel that they've

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.700 
good to use the fire steel that they've
used<00:02:40.550> in<00:02:40.760> there<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.810> high<00:02:41.960> quality<00:02:41.990> and

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
used in there is of a high quality and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.260 
used in there is of a high quality and
thus<00:02:42.920> produce<00:02:43.100> a<00:02:43.520> really<00:02:43.880> nice<00:02:44.450> Sheriff's<00:02:44.990> box

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.640 
thus produce a really nice Sheriff's box
personally<00:02:47.270> I<00:02:47.300> would<00:02:47.630> recommend<00:02:47.930> using

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
personally I would recommend using

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.600 
personally I would recommend using
something<00:02:49.220> like<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.790> back<00:02:49.970> of<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.180> knife<00:02:50.350> to

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
something like the back of a knife to

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.000 
something like the back of a knife to
strike<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:53.390> steel<00:02:53.660> as<00:02:53.900> opposed<00:02:54.740> to<00:02:54.860> the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
strike the steel as opposed to the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.600 
strike the steel as opposed to the
built-in<00:02:55.400> striker<00:02:56.440> as<00:02:57.440> it's<00:02:57.770> just<00:02:58.070> easier<00:02:58.460> to

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
built-in striker as it's just easier to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.260 
built-in striker as it's just easier to
control<00:02:58.990> but<00:02:59.990> in<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.470> pinch<00:03:00.910> in<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:02.120> situation

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
control but in a pinch in a situation

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.070 
control but in a pinch in a situation
where<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:03.100> didn't<00:03:04.100> have<00:03:04.280> such<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.090> knife<00:03:05.600> then

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
where you didn't have such a knife then

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.960 
where you didn't have such a knife then
obviously<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.980> stripe<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.610> built-in

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
obviously the stripe the built-in

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.430 
obviously the stripe the built-in
striker<00:03:08.300> is<00:03:09.230> sufficient<00:03:13.360> as<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:14.570> said<00:03:14.630> it's

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
striker is sufficient as I said it's

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.040 
striker is sufficient as I said it's
available<00:03:15.740> in<00:03:16.130> either<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.550> silver<00:03:17.030> finish<00:03:17.240> or

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
available in either the silver finish or

product<00:03:28.400> has<00:03:28.520> been<00:03:28.550> around<00:03:28.970> for<00:03:29.210> a<00:03:29.270> while<00:03:29.420> and

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
product has been around for a while and

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.160 
product has been around for a while and
I<00:03:31.490> think<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.180> know<00:03:32.390> if<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:32.810> are<00:03:32.840> only<00:03:32.960> going

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
I think you know if you are only going

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.040 
I think you know if you are only going
to<00:03:33.320> carry<00:03:33.530> one<00:03:33.740> fire<00:03:33.980> still<00:03:34.390> then<00:03:35.390> this<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:36.020> a

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
to carry one fire still then this is a

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.620 
to carry one fire still then this is a
good<00:03:36.290> choice<00:03:36.500> because<00:03:36.940> obviously<00:03:37.940> it's<00:03:38.450> in

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
good choice because obviously it's in

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.320 
good choice because obviously it's in
its<00:03:38.870> unsealed<00:03:39.620> container<00:03:39.830> which<00:03:40.640> is<00:03:40.820> as<00:03:41.030> I

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
its unsealed container which is as I

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.870 
its unsealed container which is as I
said<00:03:41.390> waterproof<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.280> can<00:03:43.520> literally

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
said waterproof so you can literally

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.180 
said waterproof so you can literally
just<00:03:43.910> throw<00:03:44.300> it<00:03:44.450> inside<00:03:44.600> your<00:03:44.990> bag<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:45.380> not

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
just throw it inside your bag and not

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.270 
just throw it inside your bag and not
have<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.460> worry<00:03:46.490> about<00:03:46.820> it<00:03:49.000> alternatively

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
have to worry about it alternatively

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.310 
have to worry about it alternatively
