00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.019
 roj 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.019
 I do not think so 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.050
 twitter I wrote with the title 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 simple past what exactly is the book about 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.249
 it is this booklet 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.249
 it was called the simple past and the booklet this high falls 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.890
 the buses now complete 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.800
 a booklet in which I 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.900
 make sketches 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.730
 of 22 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.590
 players footballers who have played at ajax obviously do not have at ajax 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.510
 played 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.070
 and of that eric 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.339
 it is very simple that I like that woman 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.489
 That is actually much longer at Ajax to the farmers that they play a lot 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.579
 should have been a longer ajacied to stay full for he is 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.610
 their life 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.400
 there are several reasons why it failed 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.249
 mdm 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:04.960
 they succeeded because their injuries were at stake and the other happens because 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.790
 he put it on 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.980
 the power of money from abroad 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.460
 frank arneses are among 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.550
 also Patrick Kluivert 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.880
 I have indeed mentioned this moment of departure 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.080
 Van der Vaart is of course fans 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.100
 it really is a little symbol for the we 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.950
 generation of soccer players 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.730
 maybe play at ajax 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.259
 this diet is great for playing ajax 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.960
 but who also have different dreams 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.890
 and that is going abroad 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.890
 and that is with many other footballers from 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.500
 other generations not like that 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.140
 there was ajax can 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.580
 and less waist 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.280
 and actually in the last chapter about rafael van devaart I sketch one 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.110
 bit of the sadness I feel 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.660
 that the players 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.120
 stay relatively short it would be nice if they were longer 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.640
 bas van dervaart and heitinga and sneijder 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.140
 what beautiful 10 you could not have put together 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.880
 footballers of the past five years is year 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.330
 if you have it together 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
 could be absolutely global good 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.180
 of the well-known footballers against the fore 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.479
 people who follow ajax but there is also a lot of car 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.659
 there are also a number of old players 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.329
 less well known is ton blanker so we example a player who is whole 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.769
 played briefly but was seen in his early years as fantastic 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.769
 talent that also left its mark on it 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.689
 the two the crucifix 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.429
 that was it by the press 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:48.950
 Fed that she was immediately the third at the truth 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.180
 but with a heavy labor tax burden for the player to cook themselves 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.029
 the nineties has its share in this book 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.599
 and not only because players are now leaving for the big money faster 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:02.159
 we are going to compensate 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.159
 abroad but also the other outages 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.899
 for example, one of the players who had to deal with it 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.769
 that maybe just not 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.629
 in that golden period of 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.290
 95 96 97 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.559
 just not 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:19.989
 had sufficient qualities to excel that team 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.249
 but could probably have done that in a later period 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:24.749
 play another 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:25.670
 that will have 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.390
 how people address each other and therefore also 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.740
 in another way an example of how the plan 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.580
 go ahead with players 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.939
 this one there 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:37.049
 dalian daxue costs per case young 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.790
 he came in as a great talent scouted by tony cohen played at 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.639
 tourists more it reads 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.669
 and he originally came from sporting lisbon 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:46.589
 and 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:48.369
 wherever it had played 

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:51.969
 Although such a big flight from this man was not that easy 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:54.830
 could evade the temptations of 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.700
 the world and not so much the world of green grass, but outside 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:03.169
 but we came one of a great soccer player 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.169
 but knows then takes 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:17.329
 as a professional club 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.329
 anp 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:25.419
 unfortunately that did not always succeed in all those temptations 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.150
 and there is no criticism of him 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.610
 because life is full of temptations you have to 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.870
 have the strength to resist this 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.999
 in the past it was too strong for him 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:38.300
 and you saw all the lighting in the clubs 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.129
 he played with celtic at atletico madrid 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.229
 the dune did not work either marcio santos I will never forget that 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.229
 pick up from Schiphol on a dark Monday evening 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.130
 I saw him getting a new one for a round through with their cart over Schiphol 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.099
 actually got lost 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.770
 you don't want to know at that moment but it was almost symbolic but at ajax 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.219
 from which also lost a bit in the last competition day of it 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.159
 calendar year towards 96 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.879
 ended the failed romance between marcio santos to ajax 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:13.930
 in the 53rd minute he can be world champion 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.900
 substitute 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.710
 for mario melchiot 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.789
 in the Amsterdam arena 9 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.629
 psv with 2 0 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:23.949
 he has only just arrived in the field for about seventeen seconds 

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:26.180
 nothing new 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.189
 hardly any time to take his position 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:31.919
 the ball is sent to him by a rvc debutant 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.349
 thrown in 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:34.749
 was in groningen 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:36.680
 macho is not yet true 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.020
 is out of balance 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.099
 he means 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.029
 He sees a knee injury with the ball to the Ajax goal the fast 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.789
 and two in the deciding goal that can only be with a violation 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:47.949
 appearance 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.699
 he commits a violation 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.699
 the sight is unbearable 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:54.180
 next to 20 seconds 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.469
 beats marcke roberto santos's own book 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:58.860
 world champion 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.910
 with an okay
