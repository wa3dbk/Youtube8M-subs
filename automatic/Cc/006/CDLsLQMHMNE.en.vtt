00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.960
 I hope you are very good at 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.779
 this occasion is going to be a video as a 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.760
 video answer well this goes for several 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.369
 friends who have told me that 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.350
 they want to install the fire and sc of my 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.830
 friend oscar but he appears in the 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.830
 next image 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.040
 yes, this image is going to 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.989
 solve it now first what 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.750
 let's do is install a custom 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.460
 room if it is a matter of right of my 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.379
 Basque friend does not matter install a 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.199
 custom room or a grave is all that 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.649
 but is it good I recommend the 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.649
 hiniesta from here 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.070
 That's the coast where my friend Oscar 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.810
 you install it start if I kill you 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.250
 I understand that many friends have 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.250
 remained what is in that image 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.729
 and they tell me that I understand too 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.710
 that we are not using your phone 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.690
 They are aside as herein 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.300
 they are moving away talkative 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.960
 well for that simply friends 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.960
 please pass the reason to your 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.510
 card mini sd card base at the grave its 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.570
 sd card and it can already happen through a 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.200
 adapter or a mini- extruded adapter 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.690
 whatever if they pass the moon to their sdk and 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.640
 then when they place our phone and 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.410
 reach the steps that I do in the video if 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.040
 in the custom installation video 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.020
 that they receive is that 's how it is 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.350
 very well for example is the coast where 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.500
 my friend oscar if it's a coast where my 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.990
 good friend and good once they have 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.640
 that installed what is the costa room the 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.170
 next step is very important and it fits 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.510
 say that it 's only for those who really 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.340
 want to have that direction and that's the one 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.430
 my friend oscar if what we are going to do 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.210
 It is the change of the room if, as 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.210
 I do in this video 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.510
 very good as I do in this video 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.340
 let's do what is the change of 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.000
 firmware 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.099
 very good that would be the simple thing that 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.900
 you have to do those two steps and they come out 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.580
 again the custody of friends who 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.580
 they have that image they stay stagnant 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.160
 there and next mind we change from 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.870
 firmware and once we have done that 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.750
 and right now we could install 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.750
 quietly the rumor and ss of Oscar 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.440
 these would be the simple steps that 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.450
 they have to follow them again I repeat 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.210
 italy a dormÃ³n room if they are 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.830
 stagnant and if you have an apostle to the 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.960
 friends who also recommended them in 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.490
 good time and there simply what 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.830
 have to do is change firmware 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.420
 if there is what I say in the 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.730
 video they have have the battery 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.070
 loaded and everything also very much in mind what 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.540
 what I say in this video and simply a 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.330
 once they have a change of effect, which 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.570
 now the rumor is usually installed and 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.150
 ssd oscars and well that would be all friends 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.980
 that would be those steps for those who 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.590
 what those who have this problem tell me 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.170
 yes very well I think it would be all friends 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.270
 for now and good we'll see each other 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.450
 video is worth being with you bye 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.450
 bye
