why<00:01:47.870> here<00:01:48.230> mobs<00:01:48.470> pretty<00:01:49.070> scary<00:01:50.650> but<00:01:51.650> pretty

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
why here mobs pretty scary but pretty

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.830 
why here mobs pretty scary but pretty
much<00:01:52.160> it<00:01:52.670> is<00:01:52.850> amazing<00:01:53.270> what<00:01:53.360> they<00:01:53.450> did<00:01:53.630> guys

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
and I think doing a parody does it

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.040
