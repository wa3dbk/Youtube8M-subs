so<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:59.060> neck<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.959> actually<00:03:00.380> order<00:03:00.680> all

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
so the neck it to actually order all

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.530 
so the neck it to actually order all
these<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.280> same<00:03:01.489> day<00:03:01.760> but<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.090> Nikki<00:03:02.270> to

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
these the same day but the Nikki to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.030 
these the same day but the Nikki to
color<00:03:02.810> in<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.140> basic<00:03:03.440> how<00:03:03.560> that<00:03:03.709> came<00:03:03.890> the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
color in the basic how that came the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.450 
color in the basic how that came the
same

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
same

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.040 
same
and<00:03:04.790> I'm<00:03:04.850> thinking<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.270> because<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.720> naked<00:03:05.960> 3

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
and I'm thinking is because the naked 3

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.080 
and I'm thinking is because the naked 3
palette<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.800> will<00:03:07.010> palette<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:07.820> maybe<00:03:08.000> a

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
palette is it will palette so maybe a

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.070 
palette is it will palette so maybe a
