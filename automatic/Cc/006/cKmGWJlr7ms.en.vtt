 very faithful image of what the 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:16.100
 shoe in reality and for her it's a 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.960
 experience also in the power to be 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.960
 participant in this creation 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.940

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.760
 and designed for celebrities of the 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.010
 beyonce lady gaga aesthetic me 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.350
 what has been the biggest challenge you have 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.660
 had some extravagant design already 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.790
 who 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.050
 really every design when working with 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.450
 unique pieces 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.360
 it's a challenge it's something that I love every 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.290
 particular challenge was for a customer of 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.660
 qatar 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.240
 I wanted some shoes with a heel in 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.760
 transparent methacrylate and in the 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.040
 inside 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.079
 with what is val beach sand and 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.540
 it brought back many memories then 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.120
 also a shoe where the client is 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.400
 participate and where in a certain way put 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.019
 part of his soul in its history 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.849
 shoe and he does it like hers then 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.849
 a shoe of a certain magical form 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.420
 and what do you think of the Latino audience of 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.390
 Latin market as you see it I think that 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.320
 There is a potential and a talent 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.200
 Awesome 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.990
 I think the important thing is to start 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.660
 know especially in the luxury sector 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.560
 what 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.420
 is more settled than it is in Europe 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.210
 but I think that 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.730
 I will work very well with the public 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.960

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.580
 that is, in a certain way and it is 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.970
 fantastic because it has some tastes 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.100
 different likes the woman 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.740

 a pleasure to have this interview 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.110
 with the talented patricia rosales but 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.150
 the time came for our insta 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.860
 fashion where we will see five looks 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.860
 using in meat we are going to see 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.710
 mexico this look is elegant and super sic 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.169
 how about the black lace background looks 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.850
 very sophisticated and converts this outfit 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.100
 in an option to use in fashion week 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.910
 or at any fashion event I think 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.250
 a very original and funny proposal 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:12.830
 fashion flag are a white dress all 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.210
 lace and very sexy ideal for use with 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.460
 a bottom below if you want to wear 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.590
 during the afternoon you can even take 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.660
 to the beach with swimsuit down there 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.300
 if it does not matter if it is transparent a bit 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.650
 and it looks just divine the last 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.970
 option I think it will go like a nightgown 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.770
 formal for the night passion climax x2 a 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.139
 lemon I go 3 can be a perfect 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.820
 option for a day event or even 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.680
 night is a matter of opting for 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.750
 accessories in vibrant color during 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.970
 day like the lions or even the nude 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.250
 but in the night dark tones and with 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:47.520
 applications can be from adamantine 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:49.650
 estoperoles hasta serros is my hot cloud 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.360
 I believe that the lace can not look 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.160
 better than in a wedding dress 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.090
 there are also the best quality and very 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.580
 thin 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.590
 this dress cut if you have a dream not 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.870
 she can look better than a queen 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.150
 the day of our wedding so it fits 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.490
 It is without a doubt a perfect option for 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:09.870
 this special day because it is elegant 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:11.699
 feminine and above all sensual you think a 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.060
 bear that lace like these are the way 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:16.680
 Freshest and sexy to enjoy the summer 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.629
 this what is total blank but I 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.240
 I would transform it a bit by adding color 

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:24.599
 in perhaps patterned top and sandals 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.000
 Gladiator style simply beautiful 

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:28.590
 these lace looks we 're going a 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.539
 small cut but do not leave that at 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.819
 come back make an amazing necklace with 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:34.259
 pistaches and later we will see four 

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:38.090
 looks that use the combs more 

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:38.090
 popular we come back
