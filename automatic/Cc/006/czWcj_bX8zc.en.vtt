00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
this problem why is this happening

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.900 
this problem why is this happening
well<00:00:59.260> it's<00:00:59.860> because<00:01:00.250> your<00:01:00.460> computer<00:01:00.730> is

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
well it's because your computer is

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.030 
well it's because your computer is
instructed<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.570> output<00:01:02.020> audio<00:01:02.350> only<00:01:02.560> to<00:01:02.920> your

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
instructed to output audio only to your

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.100 
instructed to output audio only to your
speakers<00:01:03.400> first<00:01:03.730> because<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:04.600> speakers<00:01:04.960> are

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
speakers first because the speakers are

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.780 
speakers first because the speakers are
the<00:01:05.140> default<00:01:05.560> audio<00:01:05.650> output<00:01:06.220> device<00:01:06.250> and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
the default audio output device and

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.940 
the default audio output device and
since<00:01:07.570> you<00:01:07.660> can't<00:01:07.900> output<00:01:08.260> audio<00:01:08.440> to<00:01:08.680> two

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
since you can't output audio to two

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.190 
since you can't output audio to two
devices<00:01:09.100> simultaneously<00:01:09.580> on<00:01:10.390> Windows<00:01:10.690> 7<00:01:10.869> it

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
devices simultaneously on Windows 7 it

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.410 
devices simultaneously on Windows 7 it
outputs<00:01:11.860> audio<00:01:12.310> only<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.910> default<00:01:13.300> device

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
outputs audio only to the default device

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.990 
outputs audio only to the default device
your<00:01:14.080> speakers<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:15.400> now<00:01:15.550> we<00:01:15.610> know<00:01:15.790> what<00:01:15.880> the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
your speakers so now we know what the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.590 
your speakers so now we know what the
problem<00:01:16.300> is<00:01:16.479> how<00:01:16.930> do<00:01:16.990> we<00:01:17.140> fix<00:01:17.380> it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.419 

we<00:01:25.600> can<00:01:25.750> unplug<00:01:26.079> all<00:01:26.409> audio<00:01:26.770> output<00:01:27.159> devices

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
we can unplug all audio output devices

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.429 
we can unplug all audio output devices
from<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.820> PC<00:01:28.179> and<00:01:28.390> plug<00:01:28.630> in<00:01:28.810> only<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.170> one<00:01:29.320> you

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
from the PC and plug in only the one you

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.649 
from the PC and plug in only the one you
want<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.710> use<00:01:29.920> I'm<00:01:30.729> not<00:01:30.969> a<00:01:31.000> huge<00:01:31.240> fan<00:01:31.270> of<00:01:31.479> the

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
want to use I'm not a huge fan of the

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:32.969 
want to use I'm not a huge fan of the
solution<00:01:32.140> though<00:01:32.259> because<00:01:32.500> it<00:01:32.740> can<00:01:32.829> get

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
solution though because it can get

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.200 
solution though because it can get
pretty<00:01:33.039> metal<00:01:33.490> so<00:01:33.610> I'm<00:01:33.670> having<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:34.060> do<00:01:34.179> all

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
pretty metal so I'm having to do all

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.209 
pretty metal so I'm having to do all
that<00:01:34.509> unplugging<00:01:34.899> every<00:01:35.229> time<00:01:35.469> here's

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
that unplugging every time here's

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:37.889 
that unplugging every time here's
another<00:01:36.490> method<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.060> probably<00:01:37.569> the<00:01:37.689> most

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
another method and probably the most

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:45.490 
another method and probably the most
convenient

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.530 

try<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.730> plug<00:01:47.730> in<00:01:47.910> all<00:01:48.120> of<00:01:48.150> your<00:01:48.420> audio

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
going to use them to do this I use a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.050 
going to use them to do this I use a
process<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.980> combining<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.580> other<00:02:35.790> two

methods

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.640 

here's<00:02:44.670> what<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:44.880> do<00:02:44.970> most<00:02:45.300> of<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.510> time<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:46.020> like

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
here's what I do most of the time I like

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.290 
here's what I do most of the time I like
to<00:02:46.680> select<00:02:47.040> my<00:02:47.280> speakers<00:02:47.730> as<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> default

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
to select my speakers as a default

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.840 
to select my speakers as a default
device<00:02:48.630> because<00:02:49.080> that's<00:02:49.260> what<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.440> use<00:02:49.650> about

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
device because that's what I use about

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.760 
device because that's what I use about
75%<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.000> time<00:02:51.240> then<00:02:52.020> when<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.320> want<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.650> use

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
75% of the time then when I want to use

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.010 
75% of the time then when I want to use
my<00:02:52.890> headphones<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.610> shut<00:02:53.970> my<00:02:54.090> speakers<00:02:54.480> off<00:02:54.690> and

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
my headphones I shut my speakers off and

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.050 
my headphones I shut my speakers off and
wait<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.710> second<00:02:56.130> or<00:02:56.220> two<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.610> when<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:56.910> can

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
wait a second or two so when this can

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.490 
wait a second or two so when this can
recognize<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> device<00:02:58.080> is<00:02:58.290> no<00:02:58.470> longer

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
recognize that the device is no longer

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.180 
recognize that the device is no longer
connected<00:02:59.070> then<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.060> plug<00:03:00.360> in<00:03:00.510> my<00:03:00.540> headphones

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
connected then I plug in my headphones

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.530 
connected then I plug in my headphones

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.750 
since the default device is powered down
it<00:03:03.990> will<00:03:04.110> instead<00:03:04.380> output<00:03:04.830> sound<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.520> next

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
the playback devices list is which and

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:50.200 
the playback devices list is which and
here's<00:03:43.159> what<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.340> mean

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.730 

here<00:03:51.210> you<00:03:51.330> can<00:03:51.480> see<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:51.660> have<00:03:51.870> many<00:03:52.080> devices<00:03:52.350> to

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
here you can see I have many devices to

here you can see I have many devices to
