00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.790
 hello and welcome to the newspaper of the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.460
 geek it's anne and for the newspaper the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.500
 geek and so I'm in london at the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.560
 conference htc where we could discover the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.619
 new htc one m8 so they do not have 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.810
 called htc one edition in 2014 for that 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.740
 so it's just an 8 which I 'm not 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.820
 return to characteristics 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.560
 techniques since you know one is 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.450
 passed from a screen of 4.7 inches a screen 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.880
 of 5 inches with a full hd resolution 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.989
 there are no more physical buttons 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.500
 sensitive are now buttons 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.790
 virtual 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.170
 the processor is qualcomm 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.770
 snapdragon 801 16 gigabytes of memory 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.620
 internal a nano port sim a micro port 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.030
 sd so that's not bad of him 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.920
 yesterday so on from the infrared to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.430
 above and below so we find 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.829
 inevitably the famous ones famous 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.300
 pregnant boom sound that's above when 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.210
 I say below it was the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.409
 jack and here so on the as you 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.909
 can see it up and down the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.590
 famous multimedia speakers 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.030
 so here I put them here because in 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.479
 does the trait that stick all 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.280
 simply 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.909
 and you can see that compared to 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.770
 buy his one man last this close up 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.030
 in terms of general design is enough 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.590
 similar 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.360
 that's otherwise at the level at the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.979
 finish we find a finish htc 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.869
 so is there him is a little bit more 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.250
 brilliant it's pretty much at the level 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.270
 of the grip it's all in 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.890
 length I like it a lot 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.720
 by cons I do not like at all the fact 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.400
 that they put the button I do not know 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.930
 if you see there that's the button of 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.799
 lock above which means 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.509
 that potentially when you hold it 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.490
 like that well if you do not have any 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.020
 big geese it's going to be a bit of a bit a 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.890
 little difficult I do not understand 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.810
 besides why I was this 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.060
 still not put the button on the side 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.470
 as do almost all 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.060
 the builders on the smartphones of 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.259
 big size 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.430
 here is the apn sensor 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.260
 ultra pixels of kerveguen a thousand 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.070
 pixels the double led 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:05.760
 forgiveness flash like at apple and his 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.620
 iphone fifth to be able to have to 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.180
 see pictures with more colors 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.570
 natural when shooting with 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.810
 flash 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.700
 there is this famous second camera of 2 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.570
 megapixels so due to the cameras that 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.820
 actually allows to calculate the distance 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.070
 of focus which ultimately allows 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.540
 to be able to post the photos and 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.670
 can manage a little bit his bouquet so 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.500
 nokia already does it without necessarily having 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.090
 need a second samsung sensor 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.560
 now offers his gala with his 5 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.730
 so I do not know if there is a real 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.460
 advantage of having a second sensor 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.990
 but why not 24,1 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.060
 megapixels so it's not bad for 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.060
 actually the years of the photosites 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.690
 its bigger so it will be better for the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.780
 for management 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.310
 I am the master like that for the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.140
 debate management simulates quoted by 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.150
 against ben here is a willing mega 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.070
 pixels to not recruit as we want 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.540
 so why is he in his power plants 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.490
 in this sense simply because 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.190
 that I'm in the room for 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.360
 test the so are there good I'm not going 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.459
 show you the meaning in terms of video 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.230
 not much by cons actually 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.489
 when we compare it here we see it by 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.170
 report to buy these voices it's true 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.510
 that the technology like that one is 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.220
 much more fun that's about 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.010
 good sense now well it is enough 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.660
 classic we find lingfield here I 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.100
 I have not had time to 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.850
 the moment because we are 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.100
 we have just discovered it I 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.420
 not had time to fully discover 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.560
 all the news but me the big 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.420
 novelty is that me for now 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.960
 manage your own feeds and integrate 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.640
 also applications since buying 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.590
 it's trying to communicate on the 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.670
 sdk is so allow developers 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.020
 like foursquare like fitbit where all 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.910
 these things to be able to have 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.290
 directly our information on bling 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.990
 fidh that's in terms of responsiveness 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.210
 general good is enough it's great 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.160
 it's pretty fluid and as you can 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.820
 to see it absolutely years and we find 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.560
 android 4.4.2 in a pretty enough way 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.020
 classical 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.110
 that's just a little word this name for 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.370
 finish banks I would have liked that htc 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.850
 take a little bit more 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.830
 risks because here it's true that htc 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.350
 proposes an evolution of its htc one 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.990
 but it's not revolution and 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.830
 when we see what's on offer now 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:21.270
 the xperia z2 or the galaxy s 5 with with 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.660
 water resistance to shocks to 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:27.210
 state dust I think that htc 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.650
 should have put himself on this niche there 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.380
 also because it's so much fun when 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.370
 even something pretty interesting 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.350
 here I think I have almost finished 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.330
 for video so if you have any 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.280
 questions as usual a little sorry 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.540
 that we discover the product I do not have the 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.740
 time to repair or anything 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.990
 because we often criticize the fact 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.100
 that I speak as if I did not know 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.510
 the own true past somewhere 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.560
 since we discover the product is in a 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.630
 kind 30 minutes 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.810
 and here I have five small minutes to 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.830
 talk about the product and give my 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.020
 first impressions 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.030
 Well, I think it's about 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.840
 all so thank you very much for your 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.840
 attention and very quickly
