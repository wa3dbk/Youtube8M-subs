00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.290 
shoot so the red guy on his team goes
across<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.070> now<00:02:05.610> they've<00:02:05.850> crossed<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
across and now they've crossed the

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.359 
across and now they've crossed the
three-point<00:02:06.720> line<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.899> sort<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.649> reset<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
three-point line and sort of reset the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.550 
three-point line and sort of reset the
game<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:09.390> they<00:02:09.600> could<00:02:09.780> go<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.320> shot

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
game so now they could go in for a shot

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.130 
game so now they could go in for a shot
if<00:02:10.830> they<00:02:11.070> like<00:02:14.150> instead<00:02:15.150> he<00:02:15.269> passes<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.900> an

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
if they like instead he passes it to an

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.960 
if they like instead he passes it to an
open<00:02:16.410> guy<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.890> shoots<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.700> basket

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
open guy and shoots and that basket

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.520 
open guy and shoots and that basket
would<00:02:18.360> count<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.459> if<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.910> team<00:02:21.300> shoots<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.959> it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
would count so if a team shoots and it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.290 
would count so if a team shoots and it
hits<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:23.040> rim<00:02:23.250> or<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.610> backboard

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
hits the rim or the backboard

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.660 
hits the rim or the backboard
the<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.110> other<00:02:25.230> team<00:02:25.470> has<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:26.130> bring<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.489> ball

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
the the other team has to bring the ball

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.030 
the the other team has to bring the ball
back<00:02:26.940> across<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.810> three-point<00:02:28.260> line<00:02:28.440> before

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
back across the three-point line before

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.100 
back across the three-point line before
they<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.430> continue

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.380 

all<00:02:32.320> right<00:02:32.500> now<00:02:32.950> if<00:02:33.460> you<00:02:33.640> get<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.820> basket<00:02:34.300> you

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
all right now if you get a basket you

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.270 
all right now if you get a basket you
can<00:02:34.420> play<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.810> two<00:02:34.930> ways<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.710> team<00:02:35.980> gets<00:02:36.190> a

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
can play it two ways so a team gets a

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.580 
can play it two ways so a team gets a
basket<00:02:36.790> say<00:02:37.210> red<00:02:37.420> team<00:02:37.630> just<00:02:37.660> got<00:02:37.990> that<00:02:38.140> basket

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
basket say red team just got that basket

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.890 
basket say red team just got that basket
so<00:02:38.800> now<00:02:38.950> yellow<00:02:39.670> team<00:02:39.880> gets<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.330> start<00:02:40.570> with<00:02:40.720> it

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
so now yellow team gets to start with it

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.290 
so now yellow team gets to start with it
or<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:42.040> could<00:02:42.160> play<00:02:42.310> keeps<00:02:42.700> where<00:02:42.970> if<00:02:43.090> red

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
or you could play keeps where if red

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.120 
or you could play keeps where if red
team<00:02:43.480> gets<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.780> basket<00:02:44.200> they<00:02:44.410> get<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.740> keep<00:02:44.920> it

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130
