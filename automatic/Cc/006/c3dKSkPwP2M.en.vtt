affair<00:00:02.669> and<00:00:02.909> today<00:00:03.419> we're<00:00:03.600> going<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.780> be<00:00:03.870> using

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
affair and today we're going to be using

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.050 
affair and today we're going to be using
penetrating<00:00:04.710> epoxy<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.370> try<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:05.700> repair<00:00:06.029> a

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
penetrating epoxy to try and repair a

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.720 
penetrating epoxy to try and repair a
small<00:00:06.450> piece<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.750> rotted<00:00:07.680> wood<00:00:07.859> we're<00:00:08.610> going

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
small piece of rotted wood we're going

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.030 
small piece of rotted wood we're going
to<00:00:08.790> be<00:00:08.849> using<00:00:09.000> boat<00:00:09.809> lights<00:00:10.050> get<00:00:10.320> rot<00:00:10.530> but<00:00:10.980> I

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
to be using boat lights get rot but I

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.169 
to be using boat lights get rot but I
would<00:00:11.190> imagine<00:00:11.340> this<00:00:11.610> process<00:00:11.790> will<00:00:12.150> be

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
would imagine this process will be

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.400 
would imagine this process will be
fairly<00:00:12.420> similar<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:13.049> any<00:00:13.170> kind<00:00:13.380> of

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
fairly similar for any kind of

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.049 
fairly similar for any kind of
penetrating<00:00:13.830> epoxy<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.309> might<00:00:14.549> be<00:00:14.700> trying<00:00:14.910> to

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
penetrating epoxy you might be trying to

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.790 
penetrating epoxy you might be trying to
use<00:00:15.240> I'm<00:00:16.080> going<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.320> show<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.500> step-by-step

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
use I'm going to show you step-by-step

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.470 
use I'm going to show you step-by-step
how<00:00:17.130> I'm<00:00:17.460> doing<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.970> found<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.300> there

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
how I'm doing it I found that there

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.720 
how I'm doing it I found that there
wasn't<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> lot<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:18.960> information<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.800> how<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.460> go

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
wasn't a lot of information on how to go

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.460 
wasn't a lot of information on how to go
about<00:00:20.760> using<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.330> product<00:00:21.630> specifically<00:00:22.260> on

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
about using this product specifically on

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.400 
about using this product specifically on
a<00:00:22.550> bulkhead<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.730> had<00:00:24.060> some<00:00:24.359> some<00:00:24.930> dry<00:00:25.170> rot

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
a bulkhead that had some some dry rot

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.710 
a bulkhead that had some some dry rot
that<00:00:25.740> has<00:00:26.160> now<00:00:26.369> since<00:00:26.699> dried<00:00:27.000> but<00:00:27.330> isn't

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
that has now since dried but isn't

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.140 
that has now since dried but isn't
repaired<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> bulkhead<00:00:29.939> where

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
repaired so this is the bulkhead where

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.240 
repaired so this is the bulkhead where
there's<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.689> chain<00:00:30.960> plate<00:00:31.199> up<00:00:31.349> above<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.830> area

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
there's a chain plate up above this area

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.340 
there's a chain plate up above this area
that<00:00:32.790> had<00:00:32.969> leaked<00:00:33.239> many<00:00:33.540> years<00:00:33.780> ago<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.260> has

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
that had leaked many years ago it has

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.220 
that had leaked many years ago it has
since<00:00:34.590> been<00:00:34.820> rebated<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.480> repair<00:00:36.840> has<00:00:37.050> been

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
since been rebated the repair has been

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.530 
since been rebated the repair has been
made<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.219> chain<00:00:38.489> plate<00:00:38.730> doesn't<00:00:39.090> leak<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
made the chain plate doesn't leak and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.060 
made the chain plate doesn't leak and
looks<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.989> has<00:00:40.140> no<00:00:40.320> evidence<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.710> leaking

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
looks like it has no evidence of leaking

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.010 
looks like it has no evidence of leaking
for<00:00:41.219> many<00:00:41.370> years<00:00:41.640> now<00:00:41.879> as<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.719> wood<00:00:42.870> is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
for many years now as the wood is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.889 
for many years now as the wood is
completely<00:00:43.559> dry<00:00:43.800> however<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.570> dry

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
completely dry however this is dry

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.440 
completely dry however this is dry
rotted<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.500> if<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> simple<00:00:48.329> little

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
rotted and if we just do a simple little

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.779 
rotted and if we just do a simple little
finger<00:00:48.989> test<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:49.800> right<00:00:50.370> below<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
you know for example I can put my finger

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.189 
you know for example I can put my finger
in<00:00:55.949> here<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.329> I'm<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:57.420> sure<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.930> hear<00:00:58.109> it

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
in here and I'm not sure you can hear it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.270 
in here and I'm not sure you can hear it
I<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.350> hear<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.559> crunch<00:00:58.800> hold<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> is

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
I can hear it crunch hold it it is

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.939 
I can hear it crunch hold it it is
completely<00:00:59.699> dry<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.719> veneer<00:01:01.050> face<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.680> still

penetrating epoxy in in an effort to not

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.440 
penetrating epoxy in in an effort to not

wall here the infected areas from about

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.870 
wall here the infected areas from about
here<00:01:18.420> down<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:19.590> below<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:20.040> desk<00:01:20.610> surface

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
here down just below this desk surface

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.520 
here down just below this desk surface
some<00:01:21.180> one<00:01:21.270> where<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.420> camera<00:01:21.689> goes<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:22.049> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
some one where the camera goes to to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.170 
some one where the camera goes to to
about<00:01:22.799> right<00:01:22.979> here<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.430> that's<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.700> far<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:23.939> it

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
about right here and that's as far as it

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.300 
about right here and that's as far as it
goes<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.689> I'm<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.439> I'm<00:01:25.890> going<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.220> be

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
goes so I'm going to be I'm going to be

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.190 
goes so I'm going to be I'm going to be
working<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.880> putting<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.630> penetrating

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
working on putting that penetrating

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.929 
working on putting that penetrating
epoxy<00:01:28.530> there<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> first<00:01:29.460> step<00:01:29.729> is

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
epoxy there so the first step is

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.609 
epoxy there so the first step is
ensuring<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.720> completely<00:01:31.140> dry<00:01:31.290> according

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
ensuring it's completely dry according

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.310 
ensuring it's completely dry according
to<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> instructions<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:33.390> next<00:01:33.689> step<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.049> I'm

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
to the instructions the next step is I'm

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560 
to the instructions the next step is I'm
going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.710> drill<00:01:35.040> several<00:01:35.400> holes<00:01:35.579> into<00:01:36.270> this

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
going to drill several holes into this

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.010 
going to drill several holes into this
through<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> veneer<00:01:38.390> being<00:01:39.390> careful<00:01:39.780> not<00:01:39.810> to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
through the veneer being careful not to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.690 
through the veneer being careful not to
go<00:01:40.140> through<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.500> other<00:01:40.650> side<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.310> this

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
go through to the other side and this

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.810 
go through to the other side and this
will<00:01:41.880> allow<00:01:42.180> me<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.450> add<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:44.009> epoxy<00:01:44.549> let<00:01:44.700> it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
will allow me to add the epoxy let it

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.399 
will allow me to add the epoxy let it
hit<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.000> end<00:01:45.299> grain<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.630> wood<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.840> work

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
hit the end grain of the wood and work

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.039 
hit the end grain of the wood and work
its<00:01:46.649> way<00:01:46.829> down<00:01:47.100> into<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> grains<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.880> wood

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
its way down into the grains of the wood

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.340 
its way down into the grains of the wood
essentially<00:01:49.729> encapsulating<00:01:50.729> or

into<00:01:53.189> an<00:01:53.430> epoxy<00:01:53.759> resin<00:01:54.439> solid<00:01:55.439> wall<00:01:55.649> because

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
into an epoxy resin solid wall because

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.249 
into an epoxy resin solid wall because
this<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.909> where<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.180> wall<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.780> bulkhead<00:01:58.140> is

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
this is where the wall the bulkhead is

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.840 
this is where the wall the bulkhead is
glassed<00:01:58.590> into<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.100> hole<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.700> that

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
glassed into the hole you can see that

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.959 
glassed into the hole you can see that
the<00:02:00.270> glass<00:02:00.450> curved<00:02:00.990> here<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:02.850> it

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the glass curved here and and because it

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.999 
the glass curved here and and because it
is<00:02:03.090> rotted<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:04.110> along<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.560> edge<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.860> that

that penetrating epoxy right along the
edge<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:09.300> help<00:02:09.569> establish<00:02:10.170> that

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
edge of this to help establish that

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.790 
edge of this to help establish that
connection

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
connection

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.800

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
glass student section of the bulkhead

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.160 
glass student section of the bulkhead
and<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.640> dry<00:02:16.150> rotted<00:02:16.450> section<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:16.960> you<00:02:17.020> can

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
and the dry rotted section and you can

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.030 
and the dry rotted section and you can
hear<00:02:17.640> solid<00:02:18.640> solid<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.720> then<00:02:20.620> right<00:02:20.800> there<00:02:20.980> it

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
hear solid solid and then right there it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.690 
hear solid solid and then right there it
gets<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.370> thud<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:23.740> this<00:02:24.070> is<00:02:24.220> about<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.580> edge

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
gets that thud so this is about the edge

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.670 
gets that thud so this is about the edge
it's<00:02:24.940> about<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.180> 4-inch<00:02:25.720> swath<00:02:26.110> right<00:02:26.350> along

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
it's about a 4-inch swath right along

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.380 
it's about a 4-inch swath right along
here<00:02:26.920> that's<00:02:27.430> dry<00:02:27.730> rotted<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.120> we're<00:02:28.210> going<00:02:28.330> to

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
here that's dry rotted so we're going to

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.860 
here that's dry rotted so we're going to
give<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.600> shot<00:02:30.240> so<00:02:31.240> today<00:02:31.480> we're<00:02:31.660> going<00:02:31.750> to

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
give this a shot so today we're going to

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.450 
give this a shot so today we're going to
be<00:02:32.070> mixing<00:02:33.070> up<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.610> penetrating<00:02:34.150> epoxy<00:02:34.690> and

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.340 
interesting thing is it said to start in
one<00:04:32.449> side<00:04:32.750> and<00:04:32.780> work<00:04:33.289> your<00:04:33.320> way<00:04:33.530> down<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:35.690> work

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
one side and work your way down the work

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.980 
one side and work your way down the work
your<00:04:36.530> way<00:04:36.650> along<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.729> edge<00:04:37.940> of<00:04:37.970> this<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:38.600> I'm

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
your way along the edge of this so I'm

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.189 
your way along the edge of this so I'm
going<00:04:39.259> to<00:04:39.289> start<00:04:39.530> at<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.710> bottom<00:04:41.080> again<00:04:42.080> I'm

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
going to start at the bottom again I'm

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.990 
going to start at the bottom again I'm
just<00:04:42.320> injecting<00:04:42.889> in<00:04:43.039> some<00:04:43.280> until<00:04:43.580> it<00:04:43.669> starts

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
just injecting in some until it starts

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.110 
just injecting in some until it starts
to<00:04:44.120> run<00:04:44.300> out<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:46.250> thought<00:04:46.520> here<00:04:46.789> is<00:04:46.940> that

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
to run out the thought here is that

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.760 
to run out the thought here is that
that's<00:04:47.270> now<00:04:47.479> penetrating<00:04:48.139> down<00:04:48.289> into<00:04:48.350> the

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
that's now penetrating down into the

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.999 
that's now penetrating down into the
wood<00:04:48.919> fibers<00:04:50.500> this<00:04:51.500> is<00:04:51.680> a<00:04:51.710> slow<00:04:51.979> process

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
wood fibers this is a slow process

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:53.499 
wood fibers this is a slow process
because<00:04:52.639> you're<00:04:52.789> essentially<00:04:53.120> letting<00:04:53.389> a

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
because you're essentially letting a

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.170 
because you're essentially letting a
little<00:04:53.599> bit<00:04:53.840> soak<00:04:54.139> in<00:04:54.380> and<00:04:54.590> then<00:04:55.060> taking<00:04:56.060> it

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
little bit soak in and then taking it

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.719 
little bit soak in and then taking it
out<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.570> trying<00:04:57.320> a<00:04:57.410> little<00:04:57.500> bit<00:04:57.620> more<00:04:57.830> I

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
out and trying a little bit more I

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.120 
out and trying a little bit more I
thought<00:04:59.240> well<00:04:59.449> you<00:04:59.539> can<00:04:59.690> see<00:04:59.870> this<00:04:59.990> so<00:05:00.229> over

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
thought well you can see this so over

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.589 
thought well you can see this so over
here<00:05:01.310> with<00:05:01.430> a<00:05:01.520> little<00:05:01.729> bit<00:05:01.820> more<00:05:01.970> solid<00:05:02.210> I'm

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
here with a little bit more solid I'm

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.080 
here with a little bit more solid I'm
noticing<00:05:03.259> that<00:05:03.410> it's<00:05:03.650> not<00:05:03.800> staying<00:05:04.699> in<00:05:04.910> there

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
noticing that it's not staying in there

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.450 
noticing that it's not staying in there
as<00:05:05.300> it's<00:05:06.199> not<00:05:06.380> soaking<00:05:06.800> in<00:05:06.889> as<00:05:07.009> much<00:05:07.190> as<00:05:07.340> it<00:05:07.430> is

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
as it's not soaking in as much as it is

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.680 
as it's not soaking in as much as it is
in<00:05:07.669> these<00:05:07.759> other<00:05:07.910> spots<00:05:08.240> where<00:05:08.449> it's<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.599> little

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
in these other spots where it's a little

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.180 
in these other spots where it's a little
bit<00:05:08.840> more<00:05:09.020> rotted<00:05:09.500> so<00:05:10.130> for<00:05:10.400> example<00:05:10.880> here<00:05:11.949> if<00:05:12.949> I

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
bit more rotted so for example here if I

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.070 
bit more rotted so for example here if I
inject<00:05:13.580> it<00:05:13.669> slowly<00:05:14.030> it's<00:05:14.300> almost<00:05:14.539> absorbing

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
inject it slowly it's almost absorbing

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.200 
inject it slowly it's almost absorbing
into<00:05:15.229> the<00:05:15.320> wood<00:05:15.500> as<00:05:15.830> quickly<00:05:16.610> as<00:05:16.820> I'm<00:05:16.940> letting

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
into the wood as quickly as I'm letting

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.070 
into the wood as quickly as I'm letting
it<00:05:17.330> drip<00:05:17.660> into<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.020> hole<00:05:19.539> that's<00:05:20.539> a<00:05:20.630> good<00:05:20.810> sign

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
it drip into the hole that's a good sign

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.950 
it drip into the hole that's a good sign
for<00:05:21.110> me<00:05:22.150> tells<00:05:23.150> me<00:05:23.300> it's<00:05:23.449> starting<00:05:23.780> to<00:05:23.840> really

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
for me tells me it's starting to really

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.189 
for me tells me it's starting to really
work<00:05:24.260> its<00:05:24.440> way<00:05:24.560> down<00:05:24.590> into<00:05:25.010> the<00:05:25.130> fibers<00:05:26.199> well

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
work its way down into the fibers well

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.540 
work its way down into the fibers well
I'm<00:05:27.289> doing<00:05:27.560> this<00:05:27.710> it<00:05:27.830> is<00:05:27.949> important<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.370> note

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
I'm doing this it is important to note

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.270 
I'm doing this it is important to note
that<00:05:28.580> all<00:05:29.479> the<00:05:29.720> instructions<00:05:30.289> say<00:05:30.500> that<00:05:30.710> you

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
that all the instructions say that you

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.500 
that all the instructions say that you
know<00:05:31.370> there's<00:05:31.550> not<00:05:31.729> a<00:05:31.789> product<00:05:32.180> out<00:05:32.330> there

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
know there's not a product out there

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.689 
know there's not a product out there
that<00:05:32.630> actually<00:05:32.750> displaces<00:05:33.590> moisture<00:05:34.039> so<00:05:34.550> this

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
that actually displaces moisture so this

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.930 
that actually displaces moisture so this
repair<00:05:35.030> will<00:05:35.210> only<00:05:35.389> work<00:05:35.659> if<00:05:35.870> me<00:05:36.080> the<00:05:36.909> cause<00:05:37.909> of

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
repair will only work if me the cause of

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.490 
repair will only work if me the cause of
the<00:05:38.300> water<00:05:38.510> intrusion<00:05:38.780> of<00:05:39.020> the<00:05:39.080> leak<00:05:39.289> has<00:05:39.470> been

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
the water intrusion of the leak has been

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.040 
the water intrusion of the leak has been
resolved<00:05:40.159> and<00:05:40.220> the<00:05:40.970> wood<00:05:41.180> is<00:05:41.210> thoroughly

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
resolved and the wood is thoroughly

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.839 
resolved and the wood is thoroughly
dried<00:05:42.320> out<00:05:42.530> normally<00:05:43.159> what<00:05:43.280> people<00:05:43.610> will<00:05:43.699> do

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
dried out normally what people will do

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:45.339 
dried out normally what people will do
is<00:05:44.030> drill<00:05:44.330> holes<00:05:44.599> like<00:05:44.810> this<00:05:44.960> if<00:05:45.110> this<00:05:45.199> was

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349 
is drill holes like this if this was

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:47.080 
is drill holes like this if this was
still<00:05:45.590> wet<00:05:45.740> drill<00:05:46.039> holes<00:05:46.280> like<00:05:46.490> this<00:05:46.669> and<00:05:46.940> and

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
still wet drill holes like this and and

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.409 
still wet drill holes like this and and
put<00:05:47.690> a<00:05:47.720> fan<00:05:48.050> on<00:05:48.080> it<00:05:48.380> for<00:05:48.650> days<00:05:48.919> or<00:05:49.909> weeks<00:05:49.940> at<00:05:50.360> a

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
put a fan on it for days or weeks at a

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.240 
put a fan on it for days or weeks at a
time<00:05:50.449> whatever<00:05:50.990> it<00:05:51.139> takes<00:05:51.349> to<00:05:51.560> really

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
time whatever it takes to really

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.580 
time whatever it takes to really
eliminate<00:05:52.849> that<00:05:53.030> moisture<00:05:53.539> in<00:05:53.659> the<00:05:53.720> wood<00:05:53.750> all

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
eliminate that moisture in the wood all

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.320 
eliminate that moisture in the wood all
this<00:05:55.159> would<00:05:55.400> do<00:05:55.610> if<00:05:55.789> there<00:05:56.120> was<00:05:56.240> still

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
this would do if there was still

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.969 
this would do if there was still
moisture<00:05:56.659> in<00:05:56.840> the<00:05:56.930> wood<00:05:56.960> we<00:05:57.860> would

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
moisture in the wood we would

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.249 
moisture in the wood we would
essentially<00:05:58.340> be<00:05:58.580> packing<00:05:59.389> that<00:05:59.570> that

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:00.259 
essentially be packing that that

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.640 
essentially be packing that that
moisture<00:06:00.919> around<00:06:01.340> the<00:06:01.729> epoxy<00:06:02.570> resin<00:06:02.960> if<00:06:03.440> it

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
moisture around the epoxy resin if it

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.370 
moisture around the epoxy resin if it
was<00:06:03.740> a<00:06:03.770> really<00:06:04.039> tiny<00:06:04.340> pocket<00:06:04.909> of<00:06:05.120> water<00:06:05.389> you

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
was a really tiny pocket of water you

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.719 
was a really tiny pocket of water you
know<00:06:06.470> you<00:06:06.530> might<00:06:06.770> argue<00:06:06.979> that<00:06:07.340> that<00:06:07.460> wouldn't

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
know you might argue that that wouldn't

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.909 
know you might argue that that wouldn't
be<00:06:07.789> critical<00:06:08.300> but<00:06:08.509> not<00:06:09.229> knowing<00:06:09.620> how<00:06:09.740> much

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
be critical but not knowing how much

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:11.830 
be critical but not knowing how much
could<00:06:10.159> be<00:06:10.310> in<00:06:10.400> a<00:06:10.490> bulkhead<00:06:10.789> for<00:06:11.210> example<00:06:11.690> it's

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
could be in a bulkhead for example it's

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.899 
could be in a bulkhead for example it's
just<00:06:12.080> best<00:06:12.259> to<00:06:12.500> ensure<00:06:13.280> it's<00:06:13.460> dried<00:06:13.729> out

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:13.909 
just best to ensure it's dried out

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:16.990

hope<00:06:22.540> you<00:06:22.660> can<00:06:22.750> see<00:06:22.960> it<00:06:23.050> through<00:06:23.140> the<00:06:23.290> camera

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
hope you can see it through the camera

the<00:06:23.800> epoxy<00:06:24.250> is<00:06:24.280> working<00:06:24.640> its<00:06:24.760> way<00:06:24.910> in<00:06:25.090> there

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
the epoxy is working its way in there

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.090 
the epoxy is working its way in there
I'm<00:06:26.560> just<00:06:26.860> slowly<00:06:27.510> gently<00:06:28.510> squeezing<00:06:28.870> on<00:06:29.140> it

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.650 

what<00:06:33.100> this<00:06:33.250> is<00:06:33.430> doing<00:06:33.610> is<00:06:33.760> a<00:06:33.820> capillary<00:06:34.300> action

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
what this is doing is a capillary action

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.420 
what this is doing is a capillary action
if<00:06:34.960> you<00:06:35.080> can<00:06:35.290> see<00:06:35.590> here<00:06:36.240> the<00:06:38.070> epoxies<00:06:39.070> come<00:06:39.280> out

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
if you can see here the epoxies come out

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.620 
if you can see here the epoxies come out
I'm<00:06:39.550> just<00:06:39.670> running<00:06:39.910> into<00:06:40.030> the<00:06:40.120> eddy<00:06:40.300> and<00:06:40.450> grain

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
I'm just running into the eddy and grain

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.090 
I'm just running into the eddy and grain

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
of this edge of this plywood you just

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.440 
of this edge of this plywood you just
see<00:06:42.190> it<00:06:42.310> soaking<00:06:42.850> right<00:06:43.000> into<00:06:43.150> the<00:06:43.240> plywood

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
see it soaking right into the plywood

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.600 
see it soaking right into the plywood
one<00:06:44.380> drop<00:06:44.590> finally<00:06:44.950> started<00:06:45.160> to<00:06:45.190> run<00:06:45.340> over<00:06:45.520> the

one drop finally started to run over the
top<00:06:45.820> but<00:06:46.030> I've<00:06:46.120> probably<00:06:46.870> squirted<00:06:47.440> in<00:06:47.560> here<00:06:47.830> I

top but I've probably squirted in here I

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.820 
top but I've probably squirted in here I
don't<00:06:49.090> know<00:06:49.150> a<00:06:49.180> steady<00:06:49.540> stream<00:06:49.900> the<00:06:50.380> size<00:06:50.620> of<00:06:50.770> a

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
don't know a steady stream the size of a

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.610 
don't know a steady stream the size of a
trickle<00:06:51.280> for<00:06:52.000> the<00:06:52.090> last<00:06:52.270> five<00:06:52.720> or<00:06:52.750> six<00:06:53.170> seconds

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.980 
trickle for the last five or six seconds
and<00:06:53.920> most<00:06:54.910> of<00:06:55.060> its<00:06:55.180> just<00:06:55.330> soaking<00:06:55.570> right<00:06:55.810> into

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
and most of its just soaking right into

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.940 
and most of its just soaking right into
the<00:06:56.080> wood<00:06:56.200> fibre<00:06:57.990> you<00:06:58.990> can<00:06:59.110> see<00:06:59.260> it<00:06:59.350> running<00:06:59.860> on

00:06:59.940 --> 00:06:59.950 
the wood fibre you can see it running on

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.340 
the wood fibre you can see it running on
the<00:07:00.160> edge<00:07:00.310> of<00:07:00.340> that<00:07:00.520> seam<00:07:00.880> and<00:07:01.050> just<00:07:02.050> soaking

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.350 
the edge of that seam and just soaking

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:09.790 
the edge of that seam and just soaking
right<00:07:02.620> into<00:07:02.800> the<00:07:02.890> wood

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.680 

it's<00:07:10.220> important<00:07:10.640> we<00:07:10.760> wipe<00:07:10.970> this<00:07:11.150> down<00:07:11.210> too

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:11.690 
it's important we wipe this down too

it's important we wipe this down too
we're<00:07:12.080> not<00:07:12.260> wanting<00:07:12.710> to<00:07:14.350> encapsulate<00:07:15.350> the

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
we're not wanting to encapsulate the

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.040 
we're not wanting to encapsulate the
outside<00:07:16.160> of<00:07:16.250> the<00:07:16.310> wall<00:07:16.490> here<00:07:16.760> so<00:07:17.000> we<00:07:17.510> get<00:07:17.720> fix

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
outside of the wall here so we get fix

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.740 
outside of the wall here so we get fix
our<00:07:18.200> drips<00:07:18.500> here<00:07:18.710> they<00:07:18.950> start<00:07:19.250> to<00:07:19.280> occur<00:07:19.750> the

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750 
our drips here they start to occur the

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:31.540 
our drips here they start to occur the
good<00:07:20.930> news<00:07:21.140> is<00:07:29.440> start<00:07:30.440> to<00:07:30.530> sound<00:07:30.770> solid<00:07:31.250> I'm

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550 
good news is start to sound solid I'm

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:37.450 
good news is start to sound solid I'm
like<00:07:35.200> so<00:07:36.200> it's<00:07:36.740> definitely<00:07:37.130> starting<00:07:37.400> to

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.460 
like so it's definitely starting to

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:46.220 
like so it's definitely starting to
sound<00:07:37.580> a<00:07:37.730> lot<00:07:37.850> better
