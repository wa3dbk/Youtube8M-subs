00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.110
 the blood 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.820
 It's nice that the threat that 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.250
 talking and today comes bringing 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.590
 will vote for the 20 minecraft on my channel 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.990
 and I'm going to partner with others 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.359
 channels there are some videos and 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.980
 You have to think you're going to make this video. 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.260
 that even if only to present 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.070
 here to this idea in what I had for the 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.380
 main floor basketball is floor entered 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.750
 to love kindergarten that does not 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.180
 like when you see you leaving you can close the 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.710
 video and go running because that's 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.500
 It will still be used only in videos 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.539
 beauty minecraft and i'm doing the 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:53.289
 partnership and the vehicle with bm &amp; f house tv 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:56.050
 and with discover Brazil, did not find out 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:58.420
 brazil games says by games brasil there are 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.050
 something like this is one of the new 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.910
 and 63 jobs are sure to save 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.100
 with the game tech, we just need to know 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.020
 What exactly but one thing I love you? 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.990
 I assure you nothing adventurous at all. 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.450
 nature map open things change 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.340
 It's but we're going to decide to record some 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.119
 minecraft thing like a paper 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.040
 main 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.180
 Let 's go dad and everyone else and see the 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.430
 what are you going to give 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.049
 I think it's going to be cool today 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.439
 I will only show with experience that the 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:29.710
 people did here on a plantation and nothing else 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:34.000
 too much to cause even here as 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.740
 As warning was built the walkway 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.520
 greenhouse than a plantation xiii one 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.979
 The experience I was doing is and let's 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.820
 see if it will work if you do not 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:50.229
 but just wait on the other person 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.720
 come back and do the harvest 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.500
 Botafogo back then let's hit a 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.880
 I'll tell you something, I'll see you soon. 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.799
 It will start to get pretty difficult. 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.590
 quite so then I go to one per week 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.259
 only from minecraft not 1 to the mouth more 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.520
 gay not place is not going to be just for that 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.160
 It 's just that it gets bad and rap country more 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.740
 combating the idea that 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:23.370
 lets me see what I'll do 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:29.700
 a fantastic fantastic idea that was 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:32.370
 the author of it so the dengue is that 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.640
 This crap is all over here in 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.640
 somewhere 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.520
 Where is where? 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.340
 I found it now 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.540
 now come on 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.540
 it took me a while to get back 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:03:02.940
 Let's send it to hell, right? 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:06.690
 literally talking about serious people 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:12.390
 here are only serious games here we go 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:14.940
 just put here and now let's give the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.680
 touch the wrong end we'll give the touch 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:48.180
 end here 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:04:02.480
 until then a problem will work in the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:04:02.480
 background will work the first 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:40.760
 That's right back here after taking a 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.680
 scolding for sending was hell is 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.400
 experience that worked out right 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.900
 I think it was cool, it was cool, but 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.360
 this same child video to warn the 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.390
 guys, we'll be occupying the 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:58.310
 minecraft video is initially with the 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:07:03.470
 partnership with AMD to with a tv and game 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:06.200
 with brush gamers brazil 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:09.230
 That's right, and initially with him leaving. 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.450
 and can probably extend these 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.180
 partnerships with other channels , just see 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:17.180
 The idea is that it's nothing 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.680
 adventurers and let's go 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.350
 try to do something else this is there 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.870
 survival and everything else - maps and 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:26.420
 adventurer that this sucks but it is 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:29.560
 That's it, people said later. 

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.560
 and it was
