to have somebody on the show week after
week<00:01:09.840> talking<00:01:10.469> about<00:01:10.859> how<00:01:11.159> important<00:01:11.609> that<00:01:11.700> is

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
week talking about how important that is

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.330 
week talking about how important that is
but<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.179> essential<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.200> our<00:01:13.590> heart<00:01:14.039> for

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
but it's essential to our heart for

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.889 
but it's essential to our heart for
heart<00:01:14.520> health<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.090> talk<00:01:15.299> about<00:01:15.509> that

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
heart health so talk about that

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.289 
heart health so talk about that
the<00:01:16.170> heart<00:01:16.409> early<00:01:16.679> diet<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.100> very<00:01:17.700> important

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
the heart early diet is very important

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.669 
the heart early diet is very important
because<00:01:18.569> it's<00:01:19.289> easily<00:01:19.770> controllable<00:01:20.429> and<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
because it's easily controllable and it

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:24.559 
because it's easily controllable and it
modifies<00:01:22.679> most<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.819> other<00:01:23.969> cardiac<00:01:24.420> risk

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
modifies most of the other cardiac risk

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.099 
modifies most of the other cardiac risk
factors<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.079> diabetes<00:01:26.009> hypertension<00:01:27.109> high

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
factors like diabetes hypertension high

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.709 
factors like diabetes hypertension high
cholesterol<00:01:28.189> in<00:01:29.189> turn<00:01:29.549> decreasing<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
cholesterol in turn decreasing the

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.410 
cholesterol in turn decreasing the
cardiovascular<00:01:31.560> risk<00:01:31.850> substantially<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.270> by

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
cardiovascular risk substantially so by

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.849 
cardiovascular risk substantially so by
doing<00:01:33.689> one<00:01:33.929> thing<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.380> think<00:01:34.469> you're<00:01:34.649> already

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
doing one thing I think you're already

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.160 
doing one thing I think you're already
controlling<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.670> lot<00:01:35.819> of<00:01:35.969> other<00:01:36.090> things<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
controlling a lot of other things so it

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.440 
controlling a lot of other things so it
helps<00:01:37.560> quite<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> bit<00:01:38.189> absolutely<00:01:38.969> and<00:01:39.179> it<00:01:39.329> can

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
helps quite a bit absolutely and it can

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.080 
helps quite a bit absolutely and it can
be<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.810> difficult<00:01:40.109> though<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.740> our<00:01:40.859> culture<00:01:41.340> we

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
be so difficult though in our culture we

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.270 
be so difficult though in our culture we
overeat<00:01:42.899> our<00:01:43.200> portion<00:01:43.619> sizes<00:01:43.649> are<00:01:44.039> out<00:01:44.249> of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
overeat our portion sizes are out of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.819 
overeat our portion sizes are out of
control<00:01:44.789> we<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.389> much<00:01:45.539> processed<00:01:46.530> foods

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
control we have so much processed foods

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.010 
control we have so much processed foods
that<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.130> are<00:01:47.249> indulging<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.880> daily<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.509> how<00:01:48.959> do

but<00:02:19.600> it's<00:02:19.720> very<00:02:20.410> important<00:02:20.800> thing<00:02:20.980> is

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
but it's very important thing is

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.490 
but it's very important thing is
controlling<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.060> portion<00:02:22.270> size<00:02:22.720> if<00:02:23.380> you

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500

controlling the portion size if you
control<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.920> portion<00:02:24.280> size<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.520> think<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.060> goes

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
control the portion size I think it goes

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.350 
control the portion size I think it goes
long<00:02:25.510> way<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:27.430> it's<00:02:27.580> out<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.760> control<00:02:28.210> like

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
long way and it's out of control like

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.840

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
cholesterol is the most important thing

for the heart disease especially

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.320 
for the heart disease especially
limiting<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.360> saturated<00:03:17.050> and<00:03:17.440> your<00:03:18.430> trans

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
fats actually decrease your

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.210 
fats actually decrease your
cardiovascular<00:03:21.790> risk<00:03:22.590> substantially<00:03:23.590> if<00:03:24.040> we

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
cardiovascular risk substantially if we

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.850 
cardiovascular risk substantially if we
can<00:03:24.370> decrease<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:25.000> trans<00:03:25.360> fats<00:03:25.840> by<00:03:26.380> two

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
can decrease the trans fats by two

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.940 
can decrease the trans fats by two
percent<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.940> decreases<00:03:28.450> our<00:03:28.600> cardiovascular

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
percent it decreases our cardiovascular

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.810 
percent it decreases our cardiovascular
disease<00:03:29.950> risk<00:03:30.190> by<00:03:30.850> 53<00:03:31.570> percent<00:03:31.770> so<00:03:32.770> I<00:03:33.130> think<00:03:33.250> we

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
disease risk by 53 percent so I think we

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.120 
disease risk by 53 percent so I think we
are<00:03:33.880> so<00:03:34.480> much<00:03:34.660> into<00:03:34.989> these<00:03:35.170> saturated<00:03:35.830> trans

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
are so much into these saturated trans

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.000 
are so much into these saturated trans
fats<00:03:36.459> which<00:03:36.880> are<00:03:37.060> mostly<00:03:37.480> in<00:03:37.600> our<00:03:37.720> solid<00:03:38.290> fats

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
fats which are mostly in our solid fats

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.970 
fats which are mostly in our solid fats

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
like butter masala dressings cheese I

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.199 
like butter masala dressings cheese I
have<00:03:45.010> noticed<00:03:45.550> excuse<00:03:45.790> me<00:03:45.880> I<00:03:45.940> didn't<00:03:46.120> mean

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
have noticed excuse me I didn't mean

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.790 
have noticed excuse me I didn't mean
interrupt<00:03:46.510> I<00:03:46.600> was<00:03:46.720> gonna<00:03:46.840> say<00:03:47.050> I<00:03:47.230> noticed<00:03:47.470> that

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
interrupt I was gonna say I noticed that

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.400 
interrupt I was gonna say I noticed that
I<00:03:48.010> do<00:03:48.370> see<00:03:48.880> more<00:03:49.120> packaging<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:49.780> says<00:03:50.080> no

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
I do see more packaging that says no

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.800 
I do see more packaging that says no
trans<00:03:50.830> fats<00:03:51.160> so<00:03:51.400> companies<00:03:51.790> are<00:03:52.000> trying<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.660> be

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
trans fats so companies are trying to be

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.199 
trans fats so companies are trying to be
more<00:03:53.440> proactive<00:03:53.739> and<00:03:54.160> more<00:03:54.370> aware<00:03:54.880> exactly

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
more proactive and more aware exactly

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.000 
more proactive and more aware exactly
making<00:03:55.780> sure<00:03:55.930> that<00:03:56.050> those<00:03:56.170> stay<00:03:56.470> out<00:03:56.680> that's

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
making sure that those stay out that's

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.290 
making sure that those stay out that's
correct<00:03:57.220> I<00:03:57.400> think<00:03:57.520> in<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.670> last<00:03:57.790> few<00:03:58.030> years

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
correct I think in the last few years

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.600 
correct I think in the last few years
there<00:03:58.750> is<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:58.900> substantial<00:03:59.530> change<00:03:59.739> in<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.459> way

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
there is a substantial change in the way

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.640 
there is a substantial change in the way
we<00:04:00.820> look<00:04:01.000> at<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.209> trans<00:04:01.480> fat<00:04:01.750> after<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.470> major

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
we look at the trans fat after the major

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.280 
we look at the trans fat after the major
that<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.580> report<00:04:04.390> came<00:04:04.570> out<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:04.750> few<00:04:04.870> years<00:04:05.020> ago

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
that the report came out a few years ago

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.010 
that the report came out a few years ago
in<00:04:05.470> 2006<00:04:06.160> I<00:04:06.370> think<00:04:06.640> we<00:04:07.000> are<00:04:07.120> changing<00:04:07.660> but<00:04:07.840> we

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
in 2006 I think we are changing but we

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.140 
in 2006 I think we are changing but we
still<00:04:08.290> have<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:08.530> long<00:04:08.830> way<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.340> go<00:04:09.640> right<00:04:10.120> I

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
still have a long way to go right I

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.390 
still have a long way to go right I
think<00:04:10.870> we're<00:04:11.080> going<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.260> look<00:04:11.500> at<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.800> good

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
think we're going to look at the good

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.420 
think we're going to look at the good
fat<00:04:12.640> and<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.090> bad<00:04:13.270> fat<00:04:13.540> ok<00:04:13.930> so<00:04:14.170> if<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.100> want<00:04:15.340> to

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
fat and the bad fat ok so if you want to

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.789 
fat and the bad fat ok so if you want to
use<00:04:15.550> the<00:04:15.760> fat<00:04:15.940> use<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.540> monounsaturated<00:04:16.959> fats

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
use the fat use the monounsaturated fats

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.650 
use the fat use the monounsaturated fats
like<00:04:18.070> you<00:04:18.190> know<00:04:18.280> canola<00:04:18.640> oil<00:04:18.880> or<00:04:19.090> olive<00:04:19.299> oil

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
like you know canola oil or olive oil

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.680 
like you know canola oil or olive oil
are<00:04:20.109> polyunsaturated<00:04:20.620> fats<00:04:21.430> like<00:04:21.700> your

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
are polyunsaturated fats like your

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.540 
are polyunsaturated fats like your
exceeds<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.130> nuts

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
exceeds and the nuts

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.380 
exceeds and the nuts
so<00:04:25.270> coming<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.290> proteins<00:04:27.390> proteins

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
so coming to the the proteins proteins

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.890 
so coming to the the proteins proteins
are<00:04:28.600> really<00:04:29.550> should<00:04:30.550> be<00:04:30.640> our<00:04:30.729> main<00:04:31.000> source<00:04:31.630> for

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
are really should be our main source for

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.850 
are really should be our main source for
the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.189 
the
calories<00:04:33.250> they're<00:04:34.180> good<00:04:34.539> proteins<00:04:34.960> like<00:04:35.139> a

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
calories they're good proteins like a

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.999 
calories they're good proteins like a
lean<00:04:35.469> meat<00:04:35.710> fish<00:04:36.340> chicken<00:04:36.870> egg<00:04:37.870> whites<00:04:38.169> those

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
lean meat fish chicken egg whites those

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:40.200 
lean meat fish chicken egg whites those
are<00:04:39.129> all<00:04:39.219> and<00:04:39.550> then<00:04:39.699> if<00:04:39.849> you<00:04:39.969> are<00:04:40.030> a<00:04:40.090> vegetarian

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
are all and then if you are a vegetarian

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.740 
are all and then if you are a vegetarian
you<00:04:40.930> can<00:04:41.050> go<00:04:41.229> with<00:04:41.409> beans<00:04:41.919> peas<00:04:42.879> these<00:04:43.599> are

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
you can go with beans peas these are

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.839 
you can go with beans peas these are
good<00:04:44.080> sources<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.710> protein<00:04:44.770> at<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.370> same<00:04:45.580> time

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
good sources of protein at the same time

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.959 
good sources of protein at the same time
very<00:04:45.879> low<00:04:46.360> fat<00:04:46.629> and<00:04:46.930> also<00:04:47.439> limited<00:04:48.430> are<00:04:48.759> no

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:48.969 
very low fat and also limited are no

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.270 
very low fat and also limited are no
cholesterol<00:04:49.300> so<00:04:50.110> that<00:04:50.469> way<00:04:50.680> you're<00:04:50.979> getting

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
cholesterol so that way you're getting

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.219 
cholesterol so that way you're getting
the<00:04:51.400> protein<00:04:51.849> at<00:04:52.509> the<00:04:52.659> same<00:04:52.810> time<00:04:53.050> you're<00:04:53.199> not

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
the protein at the same time you're not

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.469 
the protein at the same time you're not
getting<00:04:53.500> as<00:04:53.770> much<00:04:54.039> fat<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.669> now<00:04:54.849> I<00:04:54.879> see<00:04:55.180> some

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
getting as much fat and now I see some

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.959 
getting as much fat and now I see some
to<00:04:55.659> avoid<00:04:56.080> you're<00:04:56.560> saying<00:04:56.860> organ<00:04:57.460> meats<00:04:57.699> egg

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:57.969 
to avoid you're saying organ meats egg

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:02.969 
to avoid you're saying organ meats egg
yolks<00:04:58.539> a<00:04:59.400> lot<00:05:00.400> of<00:05:00.759> yeah<00:05:01.689> a<00:05:01.719> lot<00:05:02.319> of<00:05:02.349> cholesterol

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
yolks a lot of yeah a lot of cholesterol

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.159 
yolks a lot of yeah a lot of cholesterol
then<00:05:03.789> going<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.659> fruits<00:05:04.960> and

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
then going to the the fruits and

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.409 
then going to the the fruits and
vegetables<00:05:05.620> our<00:05:05.949> carbohydrate<00:05:06.340> diet<00:05:06.879> I<00:05:07.090> think

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
vegetables our carbohydrate diet I think

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.899 
vegetables our carbohydrate diet I think
we<00:05:07.569> need<00:05:07.719> to<00:05:07.840> use<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.259> lot<00:05:08.860> more<00:05:09.069> vegetables<00:05:09.250> a

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
we need to use a lot more vegetables a

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.869 
we need to use a lot more vegetables a
lot<00:05:10.150> more<00:05:10.389> fruits<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:11.189> we<00:05:12.189> I<00:05:12.370> don't<00:05:12.639> think<00:05:12.819> we

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:12.879 
lot more fruits and we I don't think we

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.159 
lot more fruits and we I don't think we
can<00:05:12.969> get<00:05:13.150> enough<00:05:13.330> of<00:05:13.599> the<00:05:13.750> fruits<00:05:13.990> and

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
can get enough of the fruits and

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.839 
can get enough of the fruits and
vegetables<00:05:14.710> these<00:05:15.069> are<00:05:15.219> very<00:05:15.490> good<00:05:15.669> sources

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
vegetables these are very good sources

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.390 
vegetables these are very good sources
of<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.210> minerals<00:05:16.629> vitamins<00:05:17.139> and<00:05:17.770> good<00:05:18.069> amount

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
of the minerals vitamins and good amount

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.519 
of the minerals vitamins and good amount
of<00:05:18.550> fiber<00:05:18.789> which<00:05:19.479> is<00:05:19.599> very<00:05:19.779> important<00:05:20.349> in

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:20.529 
of fiber which is very important in

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.140 
of fiber which is very important in
decreasing<00:05:20.979> the<00:05:21.219> weights<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:21.819> decreasing

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
decreasing the weights and decreasing

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.029 
decreasing the weights and decreasing
the<00:05:22.330> risk<00:05:22.419> of<00:05:22.629> colon<00:05:22.870> cancer<00:05:23.409> and<00:05:23.860> that

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
the risk of colon cancer and that

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.969 
the risk of colon cancer and that
diseases<00:05:24.520> your<00:05:24.729> risk<00:05:25.180> of<00:05:25.389> the<00:05:25.710> heart<00:05:26.710> disease

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
diseases your risk of the heart disease

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.649 
diseases your risk of the heart disease
and<00:05:27.189> then<00:05:27.460> once<00:05:27.759> again<00:05:27.909> you<00:05:28.090> had<00:05:28.360> our<00:05:28.509> good

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:28.659 
and then once again you had our good

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:30.689 
and then once again you had our good
things<00:05:28.930> to<00:05:29.199> to<00:05:29.770> promote<00:05:29.949> and<00:05:30.310> then<00:05:30.400> we<00:05:30.550> have

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
things to to promote and then we have

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.369 
things to to promote and then we have
our<00:05:30.849> not-so-good<00:05:31.419> veggies<00:05:31.870> you<00:05:32.259> know

I think if you follow those I think in

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.790 
I think if you follow those I think in
the<00:05:51.669> long<00:05:51.849> run<00:05:52.210> there<00:05:52.539> is<00:05:52.659> a<00:05:52.690> good<00:05:53.110> chance<00:05:53.469> of

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
the long run there is a good chance of

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.010 
the long run there is a good chance of

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
following a heart-healthy diet if you

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.649 
following a heart-healthy diet if you
just<00:05:56.199> go<00:05:56.409> every<00:05:57.400> day<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:57.969> same<00:05:58.150> thing<00:05:58.479> I<00:05:58.599> think

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
just go every day the same thing I think
