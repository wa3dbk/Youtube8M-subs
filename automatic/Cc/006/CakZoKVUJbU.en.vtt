00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.870 
what you're doing you know you're
talking<00:03:21.860> about<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.430> then<00:03:22.519> you<00:03:22.610> can<00:03:22.730> teach

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
talking about and then you can teach

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.910 
talking about and then you can teach
people<00:03:23.150> which<00:03:23.750> using<00:03:24.140> more<00:03:24.260> confidence<00:03:24.799> also

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
people which using more confidence also

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.240 
people which using more confidence also
so<00:03:25.420> yeah<00:03:26.420> it's<00:03:26.600> just<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.870> win-win<00:03:27.079> so<00:03:27.860> that'd<00:03:28.130> be

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
so yeah it's just a win-win so that'd be

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:36.960 
so yeah it's just a win-win so that'd be
my<00:03:28.430> answer<00:03:29.180> Nathan<00:03:29.630> is<00:03:29.870> little<00:03:30.170> it's<00:03:30.950> question

and but the biggest thing for more up
what<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.400> actually<00:04:23.639> do<00:04:23.970> do<00:04:24.120> every<00:04:24.960> single<00:04:25.050> time

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
what I actually do do every single time

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.830 
what I actually do do every single time
I<00:04:25.350> workout<00:04:25.710> is<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.789> first<00:04:27.060> movement<00:04:27.389> of<00:04:27.690> my

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
I workout is the first movement of my

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.779 
I workout is the first movement of my
workout<00:04:28.169> is<00:04:28.289> usually<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.889> compound<00:04:29.490> movement

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
workout is usually a compound movement

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.840 
workout is usually a compound movement
so<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.000> benchpress<00:04:30.389> to<00:04:30.780> squat<00:04:31.199> military<00:04:32.190> press

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
I don't do that this and that's another

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.090 
I don't do that this and that's another
video<00:04:35.280> but<00:04:36.169> I'm<00:04:37.169> doing<00:04:37.380> my<00:04:37.470> calves<00:04:37.650> in<00:04:37.800> over<00:04:38.039> a

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
row or pull-ups I always make sure to

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.770 
row or pull-ups I always make sure to
warm<00:04:40.350> up<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:40.740> I<00:04:41.310> do<00:04:41.370> that<00:04:41.729> by<00:04:42.030> doing<00:04:42.539> this

warm up and I do that by doing this
exact<00:04:43.260> same<00:04:43.470> movement<00:04:43.680> so<00:04:43.919> I<00:04:43.949> say<00:04:44.220> they're

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
exact same movement so I say they're

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.390 
exact same movement so I say they're
gonna<00:04:44.460> bench<00:04:44.669> press<00:04:44.940> I'll<00:04:45.510> do<00:04:45.900> just<00:04:46.500> a<00:04:46.590> 45<00:04:47.039> you

know<00:04:47.490> that's<00:04:47.639> real<00:04:48.180> like<00:04:48.389> you're<00:04:48.900> about<00:04:49.380> to

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
know that's real like you're about to

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.830 
know that's real like you're about to
810<00:04:49.949> reps<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:50.820> I'll<00:04:50.940> actually<00:04:51.030> bump<00:04:51.720> the

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
810 reps and I'll actually bump the

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.839 
810 reps and I'll actually bump the
weight<00:04:52.020> up<00:04:52.169> to<00:04:52.650> any<00:04:52.979> weight<00:04:53.220> that<00:04:53.490> I'm

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
weight up to any weight that I'm

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.240 
weight up to any weight that I'm
actually<00:04:54.030> do<00:04:54.360> for<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.630> working<00:04:55.050> set<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:55.889> I'll<00:04:56.070> do

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
actually do for a working set so I'll do

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.950 
actually do for a working set so I'll do
about<00:04:56.520> three<00:04:56.789> warm-up<00:04:57.150> sets<00:04:57.389> just<00:04:57.570> kind<00:04:57.840> of<00:04:57.900> a

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
about three warm-up sets just kind of a

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.500 
about three warm-up sets just kind of a
light<00:04:58.260> weight<00:04:58.530> on<00:04:58.919> your<00:04:59.760> skating<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.240> muscle

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
light weight on your skating the muscle

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.629 
light weight on your skating the muscle
used<00:05:00.660> to<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.900> movement<00:05:01.260> so<00:05:01.800> they're<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.430> same

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
used to the movement so they're the same

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.010 
used to the movement so they're the same
as<00:05:02.820> a<00:05:02.849> squat<00:05:03.180> you<00:05:03.360> know<00:05:03.449> instead<00:05:03.690> of<00:05:03.810> starting

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
as a squat you know instead of starting

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.520 
as a squat you know instead of starting
to<00:05:04.110> 2500<00:05:04.830> in<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.070> bar<00:05:05.280> for<00:05:05.580> 10<00:05:05.760> up<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.510> 185<00:05:07.080> and

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
to 2500 in the bar for 10 up to 185 and

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.650 
to 2500 in the bar for 10 up to 185 and
then<00:05:07.650> on<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:08.010> 25<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:08.849> then<00:05:09.180> I<00:05:09.210> get<00:05:09.419> into<00:05:09.510> the

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
then on to 25 and then I get into the

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.020 
then on to 25 and then I get into the
heavy<00:05:09.810> stuff<00:05:10.050> so<00:05:10.380> I<00:05:10.740> find<00:05:11.610> that's<00:05:11.760> the<00:05:11.849> best

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
heavy stuff so I find that's the best

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.070 
heavy stuff so I find that's the best
way<00:05:12.150> to<00:05:12.180> warm<00:05:12.389> up<00:05:12.479> you're<00:05:12.780> actually<00:05:12.870> getting

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
way to warm up you're actually getting

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.210 
way to warm up you're actually getting
