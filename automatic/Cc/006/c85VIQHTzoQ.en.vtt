then they're able to adjust and pull it

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.440 
then they're able to adjust and pull it
to<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.580> fitting<00:02:21.760> they<00:02:21.910> require<00:02:22.240> when

to the to the fitting they require when

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.590 
to the to the fitting they require when
they're<00:02:22.600> swell<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:24.250> with<00:02:24.400> our<00:02:24.550> slippers<00:02:25.060> we

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
they're swell so with our slippers we

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.360 
they're swell so with our slippers we
put<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.870> heel<00:02:26.260> stiffener<00:02:26.800> giving<00:02:27.130> more

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
put a heel stiffener giving more

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.810 
put a heel stiffener giving more
firmness<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.450> support<00:02:28.570> around<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.200> back<00:02:29.820> the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
firmness and support around the back the

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.390 
firmness and support around the back the
sole<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.330> a<00:02:31.390> more<00:02:31.540> durable<00:02:31.780> sole<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
sole is a more durable sole and so the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.700 
sole is a more durable sole and so the
slipper<00:02:33.670> has<00:02:33.790> less<00:02:34.240> natural<00:02:34.930> twist<00:02:35.260> which<00:02:35.590> is

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
slipper has less natural twist which is

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.890 
slipper has less natural twist which is
very<00:02:35.950> important<00:02:36.550> because<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:37.570> means<00:02:37.750> that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
very important because it means that

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.210 
very important because it means that
while<00:02:38.110> people<00:02:38.260> are<00:02:38.410> still<00:02:38.590> comfortable<00:02:38.860> in

while people are still comfortable in
their<00:02:39.340> slippers<00:02:39.730> they're<00:02:40.390> less<00:02:40.840> vulnerable

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
their slippers they're less vulnerable

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.410 
their slippers they're less vulnerable
to<00:02:41.350> falling<00:02:41.710> at<00:02:42.040> home<00:02:42.250> which<00:02:42.970> is<00:02:43.000> also

lastly I'd say that besides Footwear

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.449 
lastly I'd say that besides Footwear
that<00:03:46.530> you're<00:03:47.530> also<00:03:47.680> wearing<00:03:48.069> socks<00:03:48.250> or
