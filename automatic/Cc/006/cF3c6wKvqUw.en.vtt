00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
ethernet cable this slingbox 500

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.740 
ethernet cable this slingbox 500
actually<00:01:02.070> has<00:01:02.250> Wi-Fi<00:01:02.820> capability<00:01:03.449> has<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
actually has Wi-Fi capability has a

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.539 
actually has Wi-Fi capability has a
built-in<00:01:04.379> Wi-Fi<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.250> connect

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
built-in Wi-Fi so you can connect

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.149 
built-in Wi-Fi so you can connect
wirelessly<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.299> your<00:01:06.330> network<00:01:06.860> next<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:07.979> do

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
wirelessly to your network next we do

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.670 
wirelessly to your network next we do
have<00:01:08.400> an<00:01:08.700> ir<00:01:09.240> emitter<00:01:09.600> cable<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.530> is

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
have an ir emitter cable so this is

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.010 
have an ir emitter cable so this is
going<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:11.040> your<00:01:11.280> infrared<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.840> is

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
going to be your infrared so this is

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.750 
going to be your infrared so this is
actually<00:01:13.170> optional<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.920> don't<00:01:14.070> really<00:01:14.520> need

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
actually optional you don't really need

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.609 
actually optional you don't really need
this<00:01:14.909> because<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.420> does<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.810> an<00:01:15.960> IR<00:01:16.259> already

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
this because it does have an IR already

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.179 
this because it does have an IR already
built<00:01:16.920> into<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> slingbox<00:01:18.450> 500<00:01:18.799> but<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:20.070> you

blaster<00:01:24.810> won't<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.170> visible<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.830> your

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
blaster won't be visible on your

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.100 
blaster won't be visible on your
slingbox<00:01:26.280> 500<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.180> always<00:01:27.420> use<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.750> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
slingbox 500 you can always use this to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.600 
slingbox 500 you can always use this to
connect<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> slingbox<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.220> then<00:01:29.310> kind<00:01:29.490> of

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
connect to the slingbox and then kind of

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.940 
connect to the slingbox and then kind of
place<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.030> where<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.689> will<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.020> visible<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.860> you

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
place it where it will be visible so you

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.710 
place it where it will be visible so you
can<00:01:32.100> actually<00:01:32.250> use<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.549> controller<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.299> comes

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
can actually use a controller that comes

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.359 
can actually use a controller that comes
with<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.710> we'll<00:01:34.829> take<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.979> look<00:01:35.130> at<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
with it but we'll take a look at the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.530 
with it but we'll take a look at the
controller<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.820> everything<00:01:36.210> here<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.509> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
controller and everything here in a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.910 
controller and everything here in a
little<00:01:36.659> bit<00:01:36.840> as<00:01:37.020> well<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.500> also<00:01:37.650> get<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
little bit as well we also get a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.310 
little bit as well we also get a
composite<00:01:38.340> video<00:01:38.640> cable<00:01:38.790> along<00:01:39.450> with<00:01:39.689> an<00:01:39.960> AC

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
composite video cable along with an AC

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.810 
composite video cable along with an AC
adapter<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.250> going<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.460> your<00:01:41.610> power

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
adapter so it's going to be your power

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.300 
adapter so it's going to be your power
adapter<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.530> course<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.979> your<00:01:44.100> slingbox

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
adapter for of course to your slingbox

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.100 
adapter for of course to your slingbox
and<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> two<00:01:45.450> piece<00:01:45.689> here<00:01:45.930> we

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
and it's like a two piece here we

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.530 
and it's like a two piece here we
actually<00:01:46.549> simply<00:01:47.549> place<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.030> little<00:01:48.299> part

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
actually simply place this little part

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.609 
actually simply place this little part
onto<00:01:48.899> or<00:01:49.770> into<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.280> AC<00:01:50.790> adapter<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.689> then<00:01:52.290> we

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
onto or into the AC adapter and then we

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.010 
onto or into the AC adapter and then we
were<00:01:53.130> able<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.430> actually<00:01:54.149> power<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.780> our

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
were able to actually power up our

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.819 
were able to actually power up our
slingbox<00:01:55.979> 500<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.850> course<00:01:57.119> next<00:01:57.840> we<00:01:58.110> do<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.560> a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
slingbox 500 of course next we do have a

mentioned earlier it does have a sort of
unique<00:02:43.150> design<00:02:43.599> here<00:02:44.079> has<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.620> curvy<00:02:45.190> type<00:02:45.489> of

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
unique design here has a curvy type of

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.399 
unique design here has a curvy type of
design<00:02:45.879> it<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.239> made<00:02:46.420> out<00:02:46.569> of<00:02:46.599> plastic<00:02:47.139> so<00:02:47.290> it

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
design it is made out of plastic so it

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.619 
design it is made out of plastic so it
makes<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.739> really<00:02:47.980> lightweight<00:02:48.599> taking<00:02:49.599> a

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
makes it really lightweight taking a

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.349 
makes it really lightweight taking a
look<00:02:49.750> at<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.049> front<00:02:50.260> right<00:02:50.470> here<00:02:50.530> we<00:02:50.920> do<00:02:51.099> have

look at the front right here we do have

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.479 
look at the front right here we do have
indicator<00:02:52.359> on<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.750> left<00:02:53.049> side<00:02:53.290> for<00:02:54.099> our<00:02:54.250> power

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
indicator on the left side for our power

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.220 
indicator on the left side for our power
in<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.879> next<00:02:55.150> step<00:02:55.329> we<00:02:55.510> have<00:02:55.690> our<00:02:55.840> network

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
in the next step we have our network

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.259 
in the next step we have our network
indicator<00:02:56.739> now<00:02:57.430> taking<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.700> look<00:02:57.879> at<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.060> far

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269

little<00:03:30.310> IRA<00:03:30.639> admit<00:03:31.030> or<00:03:31.150> cable<00:03:31.449> that<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.659> came

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
little IRA admit or cable that it came

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.599 
little IRA admit or cable that it came
with<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.169> plug<00:03:32.319> it<00:03:32.440> into<00:03:32.560> there<00:03:32.859> and<00:03:33.040> then

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
have that little IR blaster showing

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.420 
have that little IR blaster showing
somewhere<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:37.720> your<00:03:38.290> entertainment<00:03:38.829> setup<00:03:39.190> so

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
somewhere in your entertainment setup so

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.979 
somewhere in your entertainment setup so
you<00:03:39.519> can<00:03:39.639> actually<00:03:39.760> use<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.209> remote<00:03:40.449> control

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
you can actually use a remote control

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.080 
you can actually use a remote control
now<00:03:41.409> next<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.739> that<00:03:41.829> we<00:03:41.979> do<00:03:42.099> have<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.310> USB<00:03:42.639> port

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
now next to that we do have a USB port

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.030 
now next to that we do have a USB port
so<00:03:43.150> you<00:03:43.269> can<00:03:43.479> actually<00:03:43.629> plug<00:03:44.019> in<00:03:44.260> like<00:03:44.859> an

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
so you can actually plug in like an

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.619 
so you can actually plug in like an
external<00:03:45.430> hard<00:03:45.459> drive<00:03:45.760> with<00:03:46.090> your<00:03:46.209> movies<00:03:46.599> and

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
external hard drive with your movies and

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.119 
external hard drive with your movies and
things<00:03:46.900> like<00:03:47.169> that<00:03:47.229> which<00:03:47.560> is<00:03:47.590> pretty<00:03:47.829> cool

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
things like that which is pretty cool

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.589 
things like that which is pretty cool
and<00:03:48.370> next<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.030> we<00:03:49.239> have<00:03:49.359> an<00:03:49.479> ethernet

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
and next to that we have an ethernet

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.920 
and next to that we have an ethernet
port<00:03:50.109> so<00:03:50.319> if<00:03:50.440> you<00:03:50.530> don't<00:03:50.739> have<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:52.090> Wi-Fi

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
port so if you don't have a Wi-Fi

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.569 
port so if you don't have a Wi-Fi
connection<00:03:52.989> at<00:03:53.650> home<00:03:53.680> that<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.250> can<00:03:54.370> simply

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
connection at home that you can simply

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.729 
connection at home that you can simply
plug<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:55.180> in<00:03:55.299> through<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.079> ethernet<00:03:56.379> port

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
plug it in through the ethernet port

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.319 
plug it in through the ethernet port
right<00:03:56.859> there<00:03:56.919> but<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.699> slingbox<00:03:58.090> 500

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
right there but the slingbox 500

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.780 
right there but the slingbox 500
actually<00:03:58.959> has<00:03:59.169> Wi-Fi<00:03:59.769> access<00:04:00.010> so<00:04:00.549> you<00:04:00.639> can

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790
