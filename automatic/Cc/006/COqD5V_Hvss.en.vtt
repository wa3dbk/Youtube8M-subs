00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.040
 what 's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.889
 new video train destiny in this video 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.380
 Let's clarify two important questions ok 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.740
 first of all new maximum level s40 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.650
 know the one videos presented that 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.090
 second is how will the transition be 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.100
 because the light level will be like that 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.350
 omitted and kept separately for 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.990
 normal level so light will continue 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.630
 stay in but we will be separated 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.540
 In addition to that, it has been possible to level over the ep 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.420
 the whole thing is clear we will be on 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.250
 level 34 states so far level 34 cents 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.860
 So the label that you with your 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.710
 character currently have armor 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.690
 is also conditional on the state for the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.430
 taking king of the possessed for 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.399
 be you that our bungie is very clear 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.300
 for example, be level 34 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.820
 or 32 31 shit not dismantled 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.100
 now your armor as soon as that is 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.350
 the new system goes live from king of 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.539
 obsessed then look at the system 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.240
 in your inventory for example with 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.700
 Your hunter will see what you have there 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.010
 you for armor parts which light 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.200
 You reach level there and that will 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.600
 then decisively be a new level 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.680
 which starts me at level 40 then 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.580
 high to level so nothing important 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.869
 delete ladies and gentlemen 0 5% ladies 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.970
 here on the channel at 40,000 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.350
 subscribers there in the comments 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.770
 Write how we push that somehow 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.590
 can 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.570
 Do not kill anyone 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.670
 any females I digress 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.740
 people have so clarified the first time 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.920
 maximum then becomes the transition from 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.890
 system the third is actually second 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.710
 this item here's part of light me 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.450
 guess it is hot sparks light 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.299
 for whom is she interesting all the way 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.189
 clear for those who are level 25 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.500
 have not reached yet because of this 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.899
 page is so far on yours 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.659
 character activates your character 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.700
 immediately blow to level 25 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.310
 that means in the clear text people never 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.140
 So have played destiny degree the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.170
 Whole installed in the tower 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.550
 then go to the post office to run this 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.070
 activate item 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.830
 level 25 we have a bit 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.440
 longer for used in many 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.570
 wise for newcomers are the first you 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.970
 can then go straight into the rails 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.350
 at least that will look like and secondly 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.370
 was announced that king of 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:33.750
 obsessed only at level 25 begins yes 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.870
 I would not have a problem now 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.840
 seen when you start afresh as a freshman 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.790
 and not at level 25 starts so am 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:49.350
 I'm the only one who completely sets it 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.300
 she does not find any swear word here 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.590
 So with a character, that will be a clue 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.510
 In any case, what we give here 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.690
 may be seen only be used by character 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.450
 husen orthopÃ¤die travel twenty five may 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.540
 So accordingly only after the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.950
 Translation may only be used for character 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.500
 the not yet applied level 25 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.360
 but what happened when 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.860
 I get the thing now from the poststelle 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.510
 pick up because I want to go back there 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.170
 make and activate it 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.239
 because then I'm supposed to go back to 25 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.670
 So everyone seems to think so 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.650
 spectators here and also the 40,000 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.720
 subscribers logically know of it 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.320
 never play then also destiny and have 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.650
 then somewhere a character on ca me 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.989
 say level 25 should be in there 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.459
 Ladies of her look ours 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.980
 However, videos are already on level 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.590
 95 my face 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.300
 Joking aside I think it should 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.310
 really be in that one level 25 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.320
 first reached alone and secondly 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.940
 again, if you are a newcomer 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.680
 then you want to explore it first 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.760
 you do not go so no 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.920
 I know but I catch mine 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.390
 Training started in the third year 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.250
 I'm at the bottom and learn first 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.290
 let me have a look at it all 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.510
 I do not understand what everyone thinks 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.300
 that's fair about people because of me 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.550
 think that the story then for all 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.489
 it gets easier when you planets 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.980
 30 my kosmodrom what is the level 5 6 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.959
 7 or something you come with all 25's 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.340
 pure crashed a completely different one 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.440
 Experience a completely different gaming experience 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.700
 but maybe that's exactly what you wanted 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.590
 you do it you have to say too 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.250
 if people then have several characters 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.640
 create 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.870
 then they start at zero 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.640
 I just do not understand the meaning 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.060
 people do not buy then 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.590
 king of the possessed because they only then 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.900
 King of the obsessed want to play 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.280
 but really the whole package but he 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.850
 you can now really long off 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.070
 hold 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.720
 to the point where I was just off of 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.120
 because not after activation then but 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.610
 my character on level 25 under push 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.030
 we see here in the stream is dietzsch 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.669
 at level 34 and we do not see any there 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.100
 possibility in itself so down there on the left 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.979
 it follows that we are 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.350
 can either delete or activate 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.620
 that means to me that like me 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.289
 now only people see this item 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.710
 to get 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:14.220
 insofar as you restart and the system 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.630
 does not recognize if you are level 25 because 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.100
 I think if you're above level 25 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.169
 then it will not be like that at the 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.430
 emerge post office because he can do that 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.020
 yes, do not even disassemble here 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.930
 Although I have to say that too 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.490
 For example, it comes to the point you 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.979
 create a new character one 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.960
 third I know pregarten warlock 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.180
 you do not like the hunter then 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.950
 dismantled the hunter and then you can 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.570
 yes then restart practically 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.120
 then it would be really hard for 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.280
 all of that for us as hardcore too 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.080
 player long time for the player 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.390
 new character also this item with 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.030
 so there are many questions about this 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.680
 not answered looked that just king 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.690
 he occupied with the get and 20 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.130
 will start and that the newcomer 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.490
 at least for one character 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.720
 that level boost will give that would be 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.520
 then we also see people over there 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.020
 Incidentally, the legendary brands are there 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:07.169
 it might be an extra video too 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:09.360
 bottom left where where 999 1999 pieces of im 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.800
 That's what he does for me 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.630
 I think I'm doing a video because there 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.700
 there are also serious changes 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.620
 if i would say if this video 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.900
 here interesting or informative 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.890
 then it was beautiful like that one 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.910
 thumb up there to us 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.010
 support 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.320
 and if you are not one of our daily ones 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.570
 whose videos want to miss more 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.789
 subscribed to the YouTube channel until the 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.789
 next video bye
