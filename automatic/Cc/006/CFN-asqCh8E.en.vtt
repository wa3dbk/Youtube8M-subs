00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
it up and it's really easy to find and

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.290 
it up and it's really easy to find and
all<00:00:22.260> people<00:00:22.560> join<00:00:22.970> so<00:00:23.970> it's<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.180> really

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
all people join so it's a really

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.450 
all people join so it's a really
effective<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.960> easy<00:00:25.019> way<00:00:25.350> people<00:00:26.310> seem<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
effective and easy way people seem to

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.609 
effective and easy way people seem to
like<00:00:26.609> him<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:26.970> enjoy<00:00:27.210> them<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.930> thought

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
like him and enjoy them so I thought

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.810 
like him and enjoy them so I thought
this<00:00:28.740> would<00:00:28.800> be<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.980> good<00:00:29.189> way<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.369> make<00:00:29.550> sub

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
this would be a good way to make sub

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.900 
this would be a good way to make sub
matches<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.900> every<00:00:31.410> night<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.920> guess<00:00:32.279> every

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
matches so every night I guess every

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.360 
matches so every night I guess every
weeknight<00:00:33.239> anyway<00:00:33.540> between<00:00:34.290> 7pm<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.829> 10pm<00:00:34.890> on

where<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.710> useful<00:03:22.010> back<00:03:22.190> in<00:03:22.340> MC<00:03:23.120> 34<00:03:23.510> craning

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
where the useful back in MC 34 craning

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.750 
where the useful back in MC 34 craning
pine<00:03:24.140> battles<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.650> some<00:03:24.770> matches<00:03:24.860> but<00:03:25.550> they

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
pine battles and some matches but they

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.540 
pine battles and some matches but they
don't<00:03:25.910> have<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.090> right<00:03:26.330> now<00:03:26.480> so<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:28.310> sucks

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
don't have that right now so that sucks

a<00:03:28.610> lot<00:03:28.780> but<00:03:29.780> for<00:03:29.960> right<00:03:30.080> now<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:30.470> think<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.800> best

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
a lot but for right now I think the best

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.530 
a lot but for right now I think the best
way<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.100> doing<00:03:31.190> is<00:03:31.400> he<00:03:31.550> doing<00:03:32.180> on<00:03:32.270> Twitter

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
way of doing is he doing on Twitter
