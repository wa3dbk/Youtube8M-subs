to<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.600> table<00:01:02.750> was<00:01:02.930> dual<00:01:03.320> compound

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
to the table was dual compound

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.139 
to the table was dual compound
technology<00:01:04.430> where<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:04.670> actually<00:01:04.820> had

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
technology where you actually had

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.540 
technology where you actually had
different<00:01:05.660> compounds<00:01:06.350> of<00:01:06.470> rubber<00:01:06.710> on<00:01:06.920> the

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
different compounds of rubber on the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.730 
different compounds of rubber on the
tires<00:01:07.700> themselves<00:01:08.509> these<00:01:09.080> take<00:01:09.410> it<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:09.710> a

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
tires themselves these take it to a

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.109 
tires themselves these take it to a
whole<00:01:09.979> nother<00:01:10.130> level<00:01:10.369> now<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.700> front<00:01:11.000> is

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
whole nother level now the front is

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.430 
whole nother level now the front is
still<00:01:11.300> going<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.509> be<00:01:11.600> very<00:01:11.630> similar<00:01:12.050> and<00:01:12.410> that

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
still going to be very similar and that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.430 
still going to be very similar and that
it<00:01:13.280> has<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.759> firmer<00:01:14.450> rubber<00:01:14.720> in<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.080> center

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
it has a firmer rubber in the center

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.529 
it has a firmer rubber in the center
softer<00:01:16.220> rubber<00:01:16.430> on<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.789> shoulders<00:01:17.180> what<00:01:17.390> that

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
softer rubber on the shoulders what that

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.660 
softer rubber on the shoulders what that
allows<00:01:17.780> them<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.140> do<00:01:18.320> is<00:01:18.500> give<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.280> tire

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
allows them to do is give you a tire

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.340 
allows them to do is give you a tire
that's<00:01:19.850> not<00:01:20.060> going<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.300> wear<00:01:20.479> down<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:20.990> center

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
that's not going to wear down the center

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.080 
that's not going to wear down the center
quite<00:01:21.619> as<00:01:21.770> quickly<00:01:22.039> gives<00:01:22.759> you<00:01:22.880> better

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
quite as quickly gives you better

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.090 
quite as quickly gives you better
straight-line<00:01:23.660> stability<00:01:23.810> at<00:01:24.380> high<00:01:24.710> speeds

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
straight-line stability at high speeds

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.580 
straight-line stability at high speeds
but<00:01:25.640> then<00:01:25.760> you<00:01:25.880> crank<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:26.360> over<00:01:26.479> into<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.900> turn

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
but then you crank it over into the turn

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.200 
but then you crank it over into the turn
and<00:01:27.830> you're<00:01:28.010> going<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.189> have<00:01:28.369> a<00:01:28.580> softer

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
and you're going to have a softer

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.940 
and you're going to have a softer
compound<00:01:29.360> of<00:01:29.750> rubber<00:01:29.960> on<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.560> shoulder<00:01:30.920> of

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
compound of rubber on the shoulder of

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.440 
compound of rubber on the shoulder of
the<00:01:31.159> tire<00:01:31.340> which<00:01:31.790> obviously<00:01:32.030> gives<00:01:32.180> you<00:01:32.420> a

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
the tire which obviously gives you a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.850 
the tire which obviously gives you a
better<00:01:32.540> grip<00:01:32.659> it<00:01:33.049> warms<00:01:33.320> up<00:01:33.470> a<00:01:33.560> little<00:01:33.710> better

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
better grip it warms up a little better

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.620 
better grip it warms up a little better
and<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.460> gives<00:01:34.580> you<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:34.700> better<00:01:34.820> feel<00:01:34.909> in<00:01:35.420> the

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
and it gives you a better feel in the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.890 
and it gives you a better feel in the
turn<00:01:35.840> now<00:01:36.799> that's<00:01:37.310> all<00:01:37.729> still<00:01:38.240> true<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:38.659> the

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
turn now that's all still true and the

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.020 
turn now that's all still true and the
same<00:01:39.110> for<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:39.560> front<00:01:39.830> on<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.189> pilot<00:01:40.520> power<00:01:40.670> 3

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
same for the front on the pilot power 3

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.749 
same for the front on the pilot power 3
the<00:01:41.509> rear<00:01:41.840> however<00:01:42.320> gets<00:01:42.590> what<00:01:42.799> they<00:01:42.920> call<00:01:43.159> two

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
the rear however gets what they call two

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.910 
the rear however gets what they call two
ct+<00:01:44.509> technology<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:45.500> it's<00:01:45.619> going<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.799> be<00:01:45.890> a

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
ct+ technology so it's going to be a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.609 
ct+ technology so it's going to be a
similar<00:01:46.520> concept<00:01:46.880> firmer<00:01:47.810> rubber<00:01:48.020> in<00:01:48.290> the

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
similar concept firmer rubber in the

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.740 
similar concept firmer rubber in the
center<00:01:49.009> softer<00:01:49.820> rubber<00:01:49.970> on<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.329> shoulders

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
center softer rubber on the shoulders

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.359 
center softer rubber on the shoulders
but<00:01:51.110> what<00:01:51.259> they've<00:01:51.409> done<00:01:51.439> now<00:01:51.619> is<00:01:52.130> they've

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
but what they've done now is they've

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.240 
but what they've done now is they've
actually<00:01:52.610> taken<00:01:53.570> that<00:01:53.930> Center<00:01:54.619> rubber<00:01:54.979> that's

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
actually taken that Center rubber that's

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.280 
actually taken that Center rubber that's
a<00:01:55.460> firmer<00:01:55.820> compound<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.659> they've<00:01:57.049> actually

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
a firmer compound and they've actually

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
on top of that now first question I had

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.270 
on top of that now first question I had
was<00:02:11.630> well<00:02:11.840> if<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.350> wear<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.769> tire<00:02:12.920> out<00:02:13.130> are

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
was well if you wear the tire out are

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.039 
was well if you wear the tire out are
you<00:02:13.340> ever<00:02:13.489> going<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.790> reach<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.450> firmer

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
you ever going to reach that firmer

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.199 
you ever going to reach that firmer
rubber<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.530> answer<00:02:15.739> was<00:02:15.860> no<00:02:16.100> it's<00:02:16.760> well

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
rubber and the answer was no it's well

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.930 
rubber and the answer was no it's well
below<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.690> wear<00:02:17.840> bars<00:02:18.019> you're<00:02:18.320> not<00:02:18.470> going<00:02:18.650> to

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
below the wear bars you're not going to

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.330 
below the wear bars you're not going to
-<00:02:19.180> akin<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.810> situation<00:02:20.110> where<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:21.130> wear

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
- akin to a situation where you wear

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.640 
- akin to a situation where you wear
through<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.940> softer<00:02:22.390> layer<00:02:22.900> on<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.290> shoulder

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
through the softer layer on the shoulder

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.170 
through the softer layer on the shoulder
and<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.010> get<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:24.550> firmer<00:02:24.940> rubber

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
and you get to that firmer rubber

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.220 
and you get to that firmer rubber
obviously<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.720> wouldn't<00:02:25.930> want<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.110> to

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
obviously you wouldn't want that to

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.460 
obviously you wouldn't want that to
happen<00:02:26.410> that's<00:02:27.130> not<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.610> intended<00:02:27.940> use<00:02:28.470> or

far<00:03:27.100> as<00:03:27.160> compounds<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:27.970> what<00:03:28.780> is<00:03:29.050> what<00:03:29.410> on

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
far as compounds and what is what on

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.560 
far as compounds and what is what on
these<00:03:29.890> tires<00:03:30.190> obviously<00:03:30.880> you<00:03:31.030> need<00:03:31.150> different

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
these tires obviously you need different

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.300 
these tires obviously you need different
compounds<00:03:31.930> for<00:03:32.110> front<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.350> rear<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:33.010> if

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
compounds for front and rear so if

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.820 
compounds for front and rear so if
you're<00:03:33.459> going<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.090> look<00:03:34.270> at<00:03:34.330> a<00:03:34.360> scale<00:03:34.660> from<00:03:34.990> one

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
you're going to look at a scale from one

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.949 
you're going to look at a scale from one
to<00:03:35.980> four<00:03:36.160> on<00:03:38.190> compound<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.430> rubber<00:03:40.060> hardness

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
to four on compound and rubber hardness

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.050 
to four on compound and rubber hardness
the<00:03:41.530> softest<00:03:42.010> rubber<00:03:42.220> is<00:03:42.340> actually<00:03:42.430> found<00:03:42.820> on

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
the softest rubber is actually found on

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.820 
the softest rubber is actually found on
the<00:03:43.240> shoulders<00:03:43.660> of<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:44.080> front<00:03:44.350> tire<00:03:44.530> so

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
the shoulders of the front tire so

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.070 
the shoulders of the front tire so
that'd<00:03:45.400> be<00:03:45.550> our<00:03:45.730> number<00:03:46.300> one<00:03:46.330> in<00:03:46.690> fact<00:03:46.900> I'll

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
that'd be our number one in fact I'll

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.360 
that'd be our number one in fact I'll
throw<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.320> graphic<00:03:47.680> up<00:03:47.800> so<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.010> can<00:03:48.130> kind<00:03:48.340> of

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
throw a graphic up so you can kind of

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.090 
throw a graphic up so you can kind of
see<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:49.030> 2ct<00:03:49.570> technology<00:03:50.200> as<00:03:50.350> well<00:03:50.530> are<00:03:50.920> the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
see the 2ct technology as well are the

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.780 
see the 2ct technology as well are the
two<00:03:51.250> cg+

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
two cg+

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.420 
two cg+
rather<00:03:52.090> so<00:03:52.600> number<00:03:53.050> one<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.650> shoulders<00:03:54.280> of

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
rather so number one is the shoulders of

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.590 
rather so number one is the shoulders of
the<00:03:54.489> front<00:03:54.700> tire<00:03:54.880> number<00:03:55.180> two<00:03:55.360> is<00:03:55.420> the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
the front tire number two is the

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.479 
the front tire number two is the
shoulders<00:03:55.959> of<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.200> rear<00:03:56.380> tire<00:03:56.650> number<00:03:57.280> three

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
shoulders of the rear tire number three

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.010 
shoulders of the rear tire number three
is<00:03:57.550> actually<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.000> center<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.630> front<00:03:58.870> tire

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
is actually the center of the front tire

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.180 
is actually the center of the front tire
and<00:03:59.230> then<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.410> hardest<00:03:59.709> rubber<00:03:59.890> is<00:04:00.070> actually

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
and then the hardest rubber is actually

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.890 
and then the hardest rubber is actually
the<00:04:00.400> center<00:04:00.640> of<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.880> rear<00:04:01.060> since<00:04:01.690> that's

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
the center of the rear since that's

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.030 
the center of the rear since that's
obviously<00:04:02.320> what's<00:04:02.590> going<00:04:02.800> to<00:04:02.890> wear<00:04:03.010> out

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
obviously what's going to wear out

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.040 
obviously what's going to wear out
fastest<00:04:03.610> on<00:04:03.730> most<00:04:03.940> bikes<00:04:04.150> in<00:04:04.420> most<00:04:04.840> conditions

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
fastest on most bikes in most conditions

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.780 
fastest on most bikes in most conditions
IPC<00:04:05.560> track<00:04:05.890> guys<00:04:06.070> are<00:04:06.250> probably<00:04:06.340> saying<00:04:06.640> I

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
IPC track guys are probably saying I

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.030 
IPC track guys are probably saying I
wear<00:04:07.090> out<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.300> sides<00:04:07.540> first<00:04:07.840> which<00:04:08.650> is<00:04:08.800> great

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
wear out the sides first which is great

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.400 
wear out the sides first which is great
but<00:04:09.510> these<00:04:10.510> tires<00:04:10.720> going<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:10.959> perform<00:04:11.260> great

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
but these tires going to perform great

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.740 
but these tires going to perform great
like<00:04:11.709> I<00:04:11.739> said<00:04:12.010> 5050<00:04:12.670> both<00:04:12.880> on<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.300> street<00:04:13.570> and

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
like I said 5050 both on the street and

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
like I said 5050 both on the street and
on<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.110> track<00:04:14.290> now

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
on the track now

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.470 
on the track now
another<00:04:15.310> comparison<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:16.030> has<00:04:16.120> been<00:04:16.299> made

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
another comparison that has been made

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.500 
another comparison that has been made
between<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.080> two<00:04:17.260> Ct<00:04:17.790> pilot<00:04:18.790> power<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.239> the

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
between the two Ct pilot power and the

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.380 
between the two Ct pilot power and the
power<00:04:19.660> pilot<00:04:20.230> power<00:04:20.410> three<00:04:20.950> is<00:04:21.250> some<00:04:21.910> lap<00:04:22.120> time

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
power pilot power three is some lap time

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.180 
power pilot power three is some lap time
testing

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
testing

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.000 
testing
which<00:04:23.820> has<00:04:24.000> some<00:04:24.180> pretty<00:04:24.420> impressive<00:04:24.840> numbers

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
which has some pretty impressive numbers

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.100 
which has some pretty impressive numbers
the<00:04:26.010> pilot<00:04:26.610> power<00:04:26.760> three<00:04:27.180> actually<00:04:27.660> put<00:04:27.900> down

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
the pilot power three actually put down

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.920 
the pilot power three actually put down
four<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.740> half<00:04:28.770> seconds<00:04:29.400> faster<00:04:30.090> lap<00:04:30.600> times

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
four and a half seconds faster lap times

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.770 
four and a half seconds faster lap times
in<00:04:31.170> wet<00:04:31.620> conditions<00:04:32.100> then<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.970> pilot<00:04:33.540> power

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
in wet conditions then the pilot power

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.200 
in wet conditions then the pilot power
to<00:04:34.020> CT<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:34.590> in<00:04:34.980> dry<00:04:35.190> conditions<00:04:35.670> it<00:04:35.850> was<00:04:35.970> still

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
to CT and in dry conditions it was still

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.810 
to CT and in dry conditions it was still
a<00:04:36.240> respectable<00:04:36.390> four<00:04:37.110> seconds<00:04:37.530> a<00:04:37.560> lap<00:04:37.710> faster

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
a respectable four seconds a lap faster

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.490 
a respectable four seconds a lap faster
so<00:04:38.820> very<00:04:39.330> very<00:04:39.720> impressive<00:04:40.110> numbers

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
so very very impressive numbers

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.860 
so very very impressive numbers
especially<00:04:40.710> knowing<00:04:41.310> how<00:04:41.760> good<00:04:41.820> those<00:04:42.330> two<00:04:42.540> CT

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
especially knowing how good those two CT

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.170 
especially knowing how good those two CT
tires<00:04:43.170> are<00:04:43.500> that<00:04:44.430> these<00:04:44.640> tires<00:04:44.970> are

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
tires are that these tires are

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.550 
tires are that these tires are
performing<00:04:45.630> that<00:04:45.660> much<00:04:45.960> better<00:04:46.200> is

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
performing that much better is

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.200 
performing that much better is
definitely<00:04:47.130> pretty<00:04:47.340> impressive<00:04:47.730> now<00:04:48.030> what

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
definitely pretty impressive now what

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.310 
definitely pretty impressive now what
we're<00:04:48.330> going<00:04:48.450> to<00:04:48.480> do<00:04:48.690> is<00:04:48.840> actually<00:04:48.990> going<00:04:49.230> to

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
we're going to do is actually going to

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.710 
we're going to do is actually going to
get<00:04:49.710> these<00:04:49.920> particular<00:04:50.490> tires<00:04:50.730> onto<00:04:51.480> a<00:04:51.510> bike

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
get these particular tires onto a bike

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.420 
get these particular tires onto a bike
do<00:04:52.290> some<00:04:52.440> real-world<00:04:52.650> testing<00:04:53.220> we're<00:04:53.310> going

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
do some real-world testing we're going

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.160 
do some real-world testing we're going
to<00:04:53.490> take<00:04:53.640> them<00:04:53.790> out<00:04:53.880> on<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.090> street<00:04:54.360> take<00:04:55.020> them

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
to take them out on the street take them

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.660 
to take them out on the street take them
up<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.470> mountains<00:04:55.770> push<00:04:56.280> them<00:04:56.430> a<00:04:56.460> little

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
up to the mountains push them a little

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.610 
up to the mountains push them a little
bit<00:04:56.820> see<00:04:57.240> how<00:04:57.300> they<00:04:57.420> actually<00:04:57.570> perform<00:04:58.110> in<00:04:58.260> the

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
bit see how they actually perform in the

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.560 
bit see how they actually perform in the
real<00:04:58.830> world<00:04:59.010> give<00:04:59.550> you<00:04:59.640> some<00:04:59.790> feedback<00:05:00.180> so

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
real world give you some feedback so

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.670 
real world give you some feedback so
you're<00:05:00.690> gonna<00:05:00.780> want<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:00.990> stay<00:05:01.140> tuned<00:05:01.350> for<00:05:01.530> that

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
you're gonna want to stay tuned for that
