00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.220
 that is so that the fat does not escape 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.220
 what am I doing at the same time 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.060
 It can be cut in more times 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.230
 case of how is that mass that is not 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.480
 high finite never 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.110
 It is convenient to give with talk and stretch 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.110
 and mine 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.170
 I'm not going to fit it well follow 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.330
 more or less until it arrives 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.330
 to that teacher 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.729
 I will leave her as a dance 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.149
 to rest and this was fine 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.149
 it's good 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.990
 to leave formations 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.230
 so that's why I'm not transported 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.480
 this mass is well laid rest 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.740
 well I would like to cut in this 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.400
 could you 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.860
 but you sure are going 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.220
 the way to cut and I show it well 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.250
 when we come from the event 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.570
 I'm going to grab the dough usually 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.659
 four fingers 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.060
 be afraid not my very big hand my 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.580
 hands girls I do a little more than 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.980
 they excel but more or less a 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.580
 approximately four fingers I will grab 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.680
 the mass I 'm not going to press hard for 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.690
 be soft and with the other I'm going to 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.320
 back let's do the same thing I'm going to 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.020
 press gently and what I'm going to do is 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.830
 press against my finger the dough and leaves 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.300
 to contribute 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.140
 yes 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.569
 against the finger and it's a blow no 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.689
 so as not to cut dry 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.299
 if the shots I will tear the dough and 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:49.030
 Grace will come out and when I want it 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.030
 I'm not going to arm it then 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.950
 there 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.540
 continued 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.540
 always that advice 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.700
 in this case it is to cut to see 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.459
 that there are others more at the time of doing 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.280
 this is not to cut it will cost 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.740
 a lot of cutting the island and it 's the best 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.490
 It will not cost much more 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.490
 today 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.560
 notice that I'm respecting an order like 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.299
 I'm cutting it, I'm leaving it when 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.360
 I'm going to start reaching, I'm going to start 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.730
 with the first one that I cut to the last 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.480
 I'm not going to start the last one because it's not going 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.580
 to fix 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.129
 this half moon does not have much work 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.849
 yes but it has to needs a lot 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.849
 little 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.920
 it can be imported if the 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.920
 grease 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.140
 they have to cut him
