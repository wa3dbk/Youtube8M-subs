we're<00:01:09.820> going<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:10.060> bring<00:01:10.270> this<00:01:10.509> up<00:01:10.570> so<00:01:11.080> we<00:01:11.439> can

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
we're going to bring this up so we can

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.690 
we're going to bring this up so we can

the<00:01:15.759> bottom<00:01:16.060> of<00:01:16.150> window<00:01:16.270> so<00:01:16.570> we<00:01:16.689> can<00:01:16.810> apply

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
the bottom of window so we can apply

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.740 
the bottom of window so we can apply
some<00:01:17.350> wheel<00:01:17.860> bearing<00:01:18.159> grease<00:01:18.189> so<00:01:18.880> it<00:01:19.420> will<00:01:19.600> go

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
some wheel bearing grease so it will go

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.249 
some wheel bearing grease so it will go
up<00:01:19.960> smooth<00:01:20.650> as<00:01:20.799> possible<00:01:21.869> once<00:01:22.869> it's<00:01:23.020> at<00:01:23.140> this

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
up smooth as possible once it's at this

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.359 
up smooth as possible once it's at this
point<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.150> have<00:01:25.329> it<00:01:25.479> down<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:27.100> only<00:01:27.280> way

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
point if you have it down the only way

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.670 
point if you have it down the only way
to<00:01:27.430> get<00:01:27.579> it<00:01:27.670> up<00:01:27.820> is<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.030> use<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:29.049> key<00:01:29.259> or<00:01:29.500> we

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
to get it up is to use the key or we

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.319 
to get it up is to use the key or we
could<00:01:29.829> just<00:01:29.860> energize<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.549> motor<00:01:30.759> directly

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
could just energize the motor directly

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.260 
could just energize the motor directly
and<00:01:32.049> if<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:32.259> try<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.530> use<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.490> key<00:01:33.700> what

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
and if you try to use the key what

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.569 
and if you try to use the key what
you're<00:01:34.390> going<00:01:34.509> to<00:01:34.540> find<00:01:34.869> is<00:01:35.200> that<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:36.280> knows

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
you're going to find is that it knows

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.899 
you're going to find is that it knows
that<00:01:37.000> it's<00:01:37.329> down<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:39.189> when<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:39.399> go<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.549> engage

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
that it's down so when you go to engage

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.690 
that it's down so when you go to engage
the<00:01:40.090> key<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:41.439> knows<00:01:41.710> that<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:42.100> latches<00:01:42.490> aren't

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
the key it knows that the latches aren't

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.740 
the key it knows that the latches aren't
latched<00:01:42.909> so<00:01:43.210> if<00:01:43.329> you<00:01:43.420> do<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:43.570> a<00:01:43.630> couple

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
latched so if you do it a couple

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.899 
latched so if you do it a couple
different<00:01:44.200> ways<00:01:44.229> and<00:01:44.680> you<00:01:44.770> can<00:01:44.890> fool<00:01:45.189> the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
different ways and you can fool the

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.800 
different ways and you can fool the
relay<00:01:46.979> by<00:01:47.979> closing<00:01:48.430> the<00:01:48.610> last<00:01:48.729> man<00:01:49.149> so<00:01:49.570> we<00:01:49.659> can

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
relay by closing the last man so we can

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.740 
relay by closing the last man so we can
get<00:01:49.899> any<00:01:50.079> kind<00:01:50.259> of<00:01:50.380> tool<00:01:51.040> and<00:01:51.700> just<00:01:52.090> clap<00:01:52.360> close

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
get any kind of tool and just clap close

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.280 
get any kind of tool and just clap close
each<00:01:53.020> jaar<00:01:53.350> jaar<00:01:54.040> has<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.369> plug

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
each jaar jaar has a plug

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.700 
each jaar jaar has a plug
that<00:01:55.920> says<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.220> communication<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.410> relay

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
that says the communication to the relay

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.240 
that says the communication to the relay
and<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.040> motor<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.820> it'll<00:02:00.060> allow<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:02.130> get

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
and the motor so it'll allow it to get

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:10.040 
and the motor so it'll allow it to get
the<00:02:02.400> power<00:02:06.170> we're<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.440> go<00:02:07.500> up<00:02:07.650> and<00:02:08.810> as<00:02:09.810> we

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the power we're going to go up and as we

battery or a jumper pack like this is I
happen<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:36.780> have<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:37.020> little<00:04:37.380> pigtail<00:04:38.310> that's

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
happen to have a little pigtail that's

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.940 
happen to have a little pigtail that's
made<00:04:38.850> just<00:04:38.880> for<00:04:39.240> this<00:04:39.419> but<00:04:39.750> I<00:04:40.020> pretty<00:04:40.830> much

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
made just for this but I pretty much

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:50.659 
made just for this but I pretty much
want<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.370> get<00:04:41.490> at<00:04:41.810> both<00:04:42.810> points<00:04:43.200> here<00:04:49.490> this<00:04:50.490> is

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
want to get at both points here this is

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.960 
want to get at both points here this is
12<00:04:50.760> plus<00:04:51.860> you<00:04:52.860> can't<00:04:53.100> hurt<00:04:53.250> yourself<00:04:53.340> this<00:04:53.820> is

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
12 plus you can't hurt yourself this is

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.629 
12 plus you can't hurt yourself this is
pretty<00:04:54.150> simple<00:04:56.540> gonna<00:04:57.540> drive<00:04:57.810> it<00:04:57.960> up<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:59.490> it

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
pretty simple gonna drive it up and it

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.190 
pretty simple gonna drive it up and it
for<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.850> opposite<00:05:00.240> direction<00:05:00.390> you're<00:05:00.990> just

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
for the opposite direction you're just

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:11.070 
for the opposite direction you're just
gonna<00:05:01.289> reverse<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.860> polarity<00:05:02.450> so

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.429 

like<00:05:12.080> so<00:05:12.819> it's<00:05:13.819> also<00:05:13.969> a<00:05:14.120> good<00:05:14.180> idea<00:05:14.439> while

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:15.439 
like so it's also a good idea while

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:19.089 
like so it's also a good idea while
you're<00:05:15.620> in<00:05:15.770> here<00:05:16.629> to<00:05:17.629> grease<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.050> cables<00:05:18.499> the

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
you're in here to grease the cables the

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.959 
you're in here to grease the cables the
draw<00:05:19.340> cables<00:05:19.789> that<00:05:20.029> work<00:05:20.479> both<00:05:20.719> latches<00:05:21.969> as

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
draw cables that work both latches as

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.239 
draw cables that work both latches as
far<00:05:23.210> as<00:05:23.270> where<00:05:23.419> this<00:05:23.629> the<00:05:24.620> window<00:05:24.949> is<00:05:25.039> going<00:05:25.189> to

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:25.249 
far as where this the window is going to

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.820 
far as where this the window is going to
travel<00:05:25.610> up<00:05:25.969> and<00:05:26.090> down<00:05:26.210> in<00:05:26.659> we<00:05:27.409> can<00:05:27.590> use<00:05:27.680> some

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
travel up and down in we can use some

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.909 
travel up and down in we can use some
penetrating<00:05:28.340> wall<00:05:29.199> silicon<00:05:30.199> spray<00:05:30.379> likes<00:05:30.650> to

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
penetrating wall silicon spray likes to

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.779 
penetrating wall silicon spray likes to
evaporate<00:05:31.879> if<00:05:32.139> it's<00:05:33.139> really<00:05:33.680> really<00:05:33.979> dry<00:05:34.189> and

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
evaporate if it's really really dry and

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.939 
evaporate if it's really really dry and
you<00:05:35.120> got<00:05:35.210> a<00:05:35.240> lot<00:05:35.419> of<00:05:35.569> dirt<00:05:35.719> or<00:05:35.840> sediment<00:05:36.319> I'd

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
you got a lot of dirt or sediment I'd

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.739 
you got a lot of dirt or sediment I'd
recommend<00:05:37.520> taking<00:05:37.699> the<00:05:37.999> the<00:05:38.210> run<00:05:38.389> channel

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:38.749 
recommend taking the the run channel

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:40.239 
recommend taking the the run channel
sleeves<00:05:39.050> right<00:05:39.229> out<00:05:39.409> and<00:05:39.560> clean<00:05:39.800> with<00:05:40.039> soap

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:40.249 
sleeves right out and clean with soap

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:42.339 
sleeves right out and clean with soap
and<00:05:40.340> water<00:05:40.580> but<00:05:41.270> this<00:05:41.449> isn't<00:05:41.629> too<00:05:41.870> bad<00:05:41.900> they

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
and water but this isn't too bad they

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.219 
and water but this isn't too bad they
just<00:05:42.379> get<00:05:42.710> dried<00:05:43.009> so<00:05:43.849> grease<00:05:44.810> is<00:05:44.990> really

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
just get dried so grease is really

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.860 
just get dried so grease is really
sloppy<00:05:45.490> but<00:05:46.490> you<00:05:46.610> can<00:05:46.789> easily<00:05:47.029> access<00:05:47.389> it<00:05:47.659> from

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
sloppy but you can easily access it from

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.740 
sloppy but you can easily access it from
the<00:05:48.020> side<00:05:48.370> with<00:05:49.370> a<00:05:49.400> sprayer<00:05:49.849> and<00:05:50.120> you<00:05:50.449> can<00:05:50.629> get

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
the side with a sprayer and you can get

00:05:50.750 --> 00:06:06.030 
the side with a sprayer and you can get
it<00:05:50.840> from<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.110> top<00:05:51.319> here<00:05:51.680> as<00:05:51.800> well

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:14.219 

and<00:06:06.520> we'll<00:06:06.640> get<00:06:06.760> this<00:06:06.910> thing<00:06:07.090> up<00:06:07.180> again

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.379 

and<00:06:15.229> we're<00:06:15.620> all<00:06:15.710> Greece<00:06:15.970> okay<00:06:16.970> so<00:06:17.030> we're<00:06:17.300> going

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
and we're all Greece okay so we're going

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:26.530 
and we're all Greece okay so we're going
to<00:06:17.479> put<00:06:17.629> the<00:06:17.750> factory<00:06:18.169> plug<00:06:18.349> back<00:06:18.620> in

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:32.720 

now<00:06:27.230> we're<00:06:27.410> back<00:06:27.560> with<00:06:27.830> the<00:06:27.950> key

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.100 

now<00:06:33.730> it's<00:06:33.880> unlocked<00:06:34.240> you<00:06:34.420> can<00:06:34.570> actually<00:06:34.750> just

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
now it's unlocked you can actually just

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.200 
now it's unlocked you can actually just
pull<00:06:35.290> the<00:06:35.410> handle<00:06:35.860> and<00:06:36.070> it<00:06:36.640> will<00:06:36.790> release<00:06:37.180> the

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
pull the handle and it will release the

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.770

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.670 
now you can put this back together and
that's<00:06:43.150> just<00:06:43.360> pretty<00:06:43.540> much<00:06:43.840> what<00:06:44.380> we<00:06:44.500> took

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680
