00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
involved in tuning up the cutting iron

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.830 
involved in tuning up the cutting iron
on<00:00:16.209> these<00:00:17.130> thickness<00:00:18.130> engages<00:00:18.700> that<00:00:19.029> are

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
on these thickness engages that are

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.450 
on these thickness engages that are
designed<00:00:20.079> and<00:00:20.200> takes<00:00:20.380> train<00:00:20.650> with<00:00:20.919> specific

of<00:00:25.689> folks<00:00:25.930> do<00:00:26.169> is<00:00:26.469> basically<00:00:27.279> take<00:00:27.790> the<00:00:28.000> burr

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
of folks do is basically take the burr

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.530 
of folks do is basically take the burr
completely<00:00:28.899> off<00:00:29.079> birds<00:00:29.529> seem<00:00:29.890> to<00:00:30.540> bother

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
completely off birds seem to bother

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.600 
completely off birds seem to bother
people<00:00:31.930> for<00:00:32.200> whatever<00:00:32.349> reason<00:00:32.829> and<00:00:32.980> the<00:00:33.399> thing

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
people for whatever reason and the thing

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.860 
people for whatever reason and the thing
you<00:00:33.640> need<00:00:33.760> to<00:00:33.820> remember<00:00:33.969> this<00:00:34.180> is<00:00:34.300> a<00:00:34.420> scraper

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
you need to remember this is a scraper

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.190 
you need to remember this is a scraper
and<00:00:35.590> so<00:00:35.800> you<00:00:35.860> need<00:00:36.340> to<00:00:36.460> have<00:00:36.610> that<00:00:36.879> burr<00:00:37.210> and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
and so you need to have that burr and

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.610 
and so you need to have that burr and
this<00:00:38.379> angle<00:00:38.860> should<00:00:38.890> be<00:00:39.129> at<00:00:39.550> oh<00:00:39.850> you<00:00:40.690> know<00:00:40.840> 20

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
this angle should be at oh you know 20

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.270 
this angle should be at oh you know 20
degrees<00:00:41.950> 30<00:00:42.250> degrees<00:00:42.340> not<00:00:43.240> real<00:00:43.630> far<00:00:44.020> back<00:00:44.350> so

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
degrees 30 degrees not real far back so

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.010 
degrees 30 degrees not real far back so
to<00:00:45.340> put<00:00:45.610> a<00:00:45.640> burr<00:00:45.940> on<00:00:45.970> I<00:00:46.360> just<00:00:46.540> use<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.780> back<00:00:46.990> of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
to put a burr on I just use the back of

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.280 
to put a burr on I just use the back of
a<00:00:47.260> chisel<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:49.030> what<00:00:49.329> I'm<00:00:49.450> gonna<00:00:49.600> do<00:00:49.810> is<00:00:49.989> pull

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
a chisel and what I'm gonna do is pull

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.610 
a chisel and what I'm gonna do is pull
down<00:00:51.150> which<00:00:52.150> puts<00:00:52.450> the<00:00:52.570> burr<00:00:52.780> going<00:00:53.440> one<00:00:53.590> way

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
down which puts the burr going one way

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.500 
down which puts the burr going one way
in<00:00:53.800> that<00:00:53.890> little<00:00:54.160> reflection<00:00:54.670> you<00:00:54.760> see<00:00:54.790> is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
in that little reflection you see is

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.930 
in that little reflection you see is
actually<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.290> burr<00:00:56.640> then<00:00:57.640> I'm<00:00:57.730> just<00:00:57.820> gonna

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
actually the burr then I'm just gonna

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.610 
actually the burr then I'm just gonna
bring<00:00:58.270> it<00:00:58.420> back<00:00:58.600> up<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:01.120> there<00:01:01.360> you<00:01:01.390> can<00:01:01.660> I<00:01:01.930> can

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
bring it back up and there you can I can

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.560 
bring it back up and there you can I can
feel<00:01:02.920> that<00:01:03.130> Britta<00:01:03.460> that's<00:01:03.850> what<00:01:04.059> I'm<00:01:04.180> going

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
feel that Britta that's what I'm going

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.010 
feel that Britta that's what I'm going
for<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:05.079> it<00:01:05.619> should<00:01:05.829> behave<00:01:08.159> as<00:01:09.159> a<00:01:09.219> scraper

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
for and it should behave as a scraper

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.260 
for and it should behave as a scraper
when<00:01:11.020> you<00:01:11.140> do<00:01:11.290> it<00:01:11.469> so<00:01:11.920> this<00:01:12.850> is<00:01:12.909> the<00:01:13.030> one<00:01:13.180> that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
when you do it so this is the one that

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.149 
when you do it so this is the one that
was<00:01:13.390> already<00:01:13.540> on<00:01:13.810> there<00:01:14.140> this<00:01:14.680> one<00:01:14.890> does<00:01:15.130> have

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
one of these back on these really should

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.300 
one of these back on these really should
not<00:01:37.450> require<00:01:37.900> a<00:01:38.460> lot<00:01:39.460> of<00:01:39.490> maintenance<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:42.130> one

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
not require a lot of maintenance now one

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.070 
not require a lot of maintenance now one
thing<00:01:42.400> I<00:01:42.490> do<00:01:42.580> want<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:42.939> emphasize<00:01:43.060> when<00:01:43.869> you're

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
thing I do want to emphasize when you're

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.770 
thing I do want to emphasize when you're
putting<00:01:44.530> that<00:01:44.710> burr<00:01:45.100> on<00:01:45.130> there<00:01:45.580> or<00:01:45.729> if<00:01:46.000> for

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
putting that burr on there or if for

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.450 
putting that burr on there or if for
some<00:01:46.840> reason<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.439> feel<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.770> need<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.130> grind

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
some reason you feel the need to grind

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.039 
some reason you feel the need to grind
it<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:50.439> you<00:01:51.159> take<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.610> too<00:01:51.880> far<00:01:51.909> back<00:01:52.509> if<00:01:52.900> you

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
it if you take it too far back if you

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.249 
it if you take it too far back if you
make<00:01:53.259> this<00:01:53.500> angle<00:01:53.799> now<00:01:54.549> from<00:01:55.479> here<00:01:55.900> back<00:01:56.229> to

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
make this angle now from here back to

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.399 
make this angle now from here back to
here<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:57.009> basically<00:01:57.220> create<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.820> cutting<00:01:58.240> edge

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
here you basically create a cutting edge

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.780 
here you basically create a cutting edge
and<00:01:59.409> you'll<00:01:59.619> start<00:01:59.860> snipping<00:02:00.159> your<00:02:00.400> stringing

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
and you'll start snipping your stringing

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.870 
and you'll start snipping your stringing
in<00:02:00.909> half<00:02:01.470> now<00:02:02.470> this<00:02:02.680> tool<00:02:02.979> I<00:02:03.369> mean<00:02:03.610> there's<00:02:03.790> a

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
in half now this tool I mean there's a

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.260 
in half now this tool I mean there's a
reason<00:02:04.060> we<00:02:04.330> put<00:02:04.780> that<00:02:05.049> notch<00:02:05.710> in<00:02:06.100> there<00:02:06.310> and

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
reason we put that notch in there and

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.630 
reason we put that notch in there and
the<00:02:07.360> sole<00:02:07.600> purpose<00:02:07.990> of<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.409> to<00:02:08.500> be<00:02:08.979> clamp

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
the sole purpose of that is to be clamp

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.089 
the sole purpose of that is to be clamp
down<00:02:09.939> this<00:02:10.209> is<00:02:10.390> not<00:02:10.599> a<00:02:10.629> tool<00:02:11.049> you<00:02:11.769> should<00:02:11.920> try

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
down this is not a tool you should try

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.670 
down this is not a tool you should try
to<00:02:12.159> hold<00:02:12.459> in<00:02:12.640> your<00:02:12.670> hand<00:02:13.120> in<00:02:13.239> use<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.989> does<00:02:14.349> need

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
to hold in your hand in use it does need

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.720 
to hold in your hand in use it does need
to<00:02:14.709> be<00:02:14.920> clamped

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.190 

so<00:02:17.970> I've<00:02:18.060> got<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.239> piece<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.510> string<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.110> I

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
so I've got a piece of string that I

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.790 
so I've got a piece of string that I
sliced<00:02:19.500> off<00:02:19.830> before<00:02:20.900> if<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.080> go<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.349> pull<00:02:22.650> on

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
sliced off before if I go to pull on

sliced off before if I go to pull on
this<00:02:23.900> see<00:02:24.900> how<00:02:25.019> we're<00:02:25.170> getting<00:02:25.349> a<00:02:25.410> shaving

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
this see how we're getting a shaving

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.809 
this see how we're getting a shaving
there<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.500> saving<00:02:29.040> that's<00:02:29.519> what

there that that saving that's what
should<00:02:30.000> be<00:02:30.060> happening<00:02:30.390> if<00:02:30.959> we're<00:02:31.530> not<00:02:31.739> getting

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
should be happening if we're not getting

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.370 
should be happening if we're not getting
the<00:02:32.250> shaving<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:33.239> need<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.510> redo<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:33.900> birth

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
the shaving you need to redo that birth

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.680 
the shaving you need to redo that birth
now<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.370> point<00:02:35.849> I<00:02:35.880> want<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.090> emphasize<00:02:36.180> is

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
now the point I want to emphasize is

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.229 
now the point I want to emphasize is
when<00:02:36.840> I'm<00:02:36.930> using<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.500> tool<00:02:38.060> all<00:02:39.060> right

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
when I'm using this tool all right

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.390 
when I'm using this tool all right
little<00:02:39.720> more<00:02:39.810> comfortable<00:02:40.260> here<00:02:40.500> I'm<00:02:40.980> holding

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
little more comfortable here I'm holding

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.220 
little more comfortable here I'm holding
it<00:02:41.489> when<00:02:41.730> I'm<00:02:41.849> starting<00:02:42.120> out<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.900> other<00:02:42.989> piece

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
it when I'm starting out the other piece

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.949 
it when I'm starting out the other piece
of<00:02:43.380> string<00:02:43.819> I'm<00:02:44.819> holding<00:02:45.180> him<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.390> my<00:02:45.569> fingers

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
of string I'm holding him to my fingers

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.680 
of string I'm holding him to my fingers
and<00:02:46.110> pulling<00:02:46.319> up<00:02:46.560> in<00:02:46.739> an<00:02:46.830> angle<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:48.239> makes<00:02:48.450> a

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
and pulling up in an angle that makes a

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.350 
and pulling up in an angle that makes a
tool<00:02:48.900> easy<00:02:49.379> to<00:02:49.769> use<00:02:50.069> they<00:02:50.880> tend<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.150> have<00:02:51.299> a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
tool easy to use they tend to have a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.360 
tool easy to use they tend to have a
natural<00:02:51.930> propensity<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.709> want<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:52.980> just<00:02:53.069> drop

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
natural propensity to want to just drop

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.490 
natural propensity to want to just drop
to<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.670> bottom<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.150> groove<00:02:54.450> am<00:02:55.110> i<00:02:55.200> holding

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
to the bottom of the groove am i holding

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.800 
to the bottom of the groove am i holding
between<00:02:55.680> my<00:02:55.950> fingers<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.610> pulling<00:02:56.819> up<00:02:57.180> see

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
between my fingers and pulling up see

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.339 
between my fingers and pulling up see
that<00:02:57.840> shaving<00:02:58.260> coming<00:02:58.620> off<00:02:58.769> there<00:02:58.980> nicely<00:03:00.349> all

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
that shaving coming off there nicely all

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.199 
that shaving coming off there nicely all
right<00:03:01.500> that's<00:03:02.130> what<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.489> should<00:03:02.519> be<00:03:02.880> doing

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
right that's what it should be doing

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.270 
right that's what it should be doing
that<00:03:03.750> keeps<00:03:04.079> it<00:03:04.290> from<00:03:04.440> just<00:03:04.650> dropping<00:03:05.069> right

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
that keeps it from just dropping right

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.120 
that keeps it from just dropping right
down<00:03:05.519> I<00:03:05.849> don't<00:03:06.810> spend<00:03:07.079> a<00:03:07.230> lot<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.440> time<00:03:07.799> setting

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
down I don't spend a lot of time setting

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.490 
down I don't spend a lot of time setting
the<00:03:08.370> thickness<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.910> this<00:03:09.090> thing<00:03:09.360> what<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.230> tend

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
the thickness of this thing what I tend

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.470 
the thickness of this thing what I tend
to<00:03:10.560> do<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.860> just<00:03:10.890> put<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.250> finger<00:03:11.549> behind<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.239> and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
to do is just put a finger behind it and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.589 
to do is just put a finger behind it and
lean<00:03:13.410> on<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.829> little<00:03:13.950> bit<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:15.120> lets<00:03:15.239> me<00:03:15.390> take

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
lean on it a little bit it lets me take

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.470 
lean on it a little bit it lets me take
off<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> little<00:03:16.140> bit<00:03:16.349> more<00:03:16.560> material<00:03:17.329> want<00:03:18.329> to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
off a little bit more material want to

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.990 
off a little bit more material want to
re-emphasize<00:03:18.720> if<00:03:19.470> I<00:03:19.680> make<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.160> grind<00:03:20.579> too

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
re-emphasize if I make this grind too

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.410 
re-emphasize if I make this grind too
much<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:22.200> becomes<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.709> real<00:03:22.980> point<00:03:23.389> when<00:03:24.389> I

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
much and it becomes a real point when I

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.390 
much and it becomes a real point when I
do<00:03:24.569> this<00:03:24.870> finger<00:03:25.290> thing<00:03:25.560> I'll<00:03:25.799> actually<00:03:25.980> clip

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
do this finger thing I'll actually clip

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.640 
do this finger thing I'll actually clip
the<00:03:26.519> piece<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:26.910> half<00:03:27.120> if<00:03:27.510> you're<00:03:28.019> having<00:03:28.290> your

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
the piece in half if you're having your

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.740 
the piece in half if you're having your
pieces<00:03:28.889> clip<00:03:29.340> in<00:03:29.489> half<00:03:29.730> it's<00:03:30.299> probably

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
pieces clip in half it's probably

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.660 
pieces clip in half it's probably
because<00:03:31.049> you<00:03:31.200> put<00:03:31.440> too<00:03:31.470> sharp<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.069> a<00:03:32.190> bevel<00:03:32.579> on

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
because you put too sharp of a bevel on

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.490 
because you put too sharp of a bevel on
there<00:03:32.940> but<00:03:33.480> once<00:03:33.660> again<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.079> thing<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.319> want

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
there but once again the thing I want

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.770 
there but once again the thing I want
emphasize<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.310> if<00:03:35.549> you're<00:03:35.970> not<00:03:36.150> getting<00:03:36.540> this

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
emphasize is if you're not getting this

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.170 
emphasize is if you're not getting this
shaving<00:03:37.700> like<00:03:38.700> we're<00:03:38.910> getting<00:03:39.209> here<00:03:41.180> it's

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
shaving like we're getting here it's

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.479 
shaving like we're getting here it's
either<00:03:42.389> your<00:03:42.569> material<00:03:43.139> being<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:44.280> know<00:03:44.400> too

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.160 
lay it down bring it back in a nutshell
that's<00:03:58.049> how<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.290> sharpen<00:03:58.709> this<00:03:58.889> tool
