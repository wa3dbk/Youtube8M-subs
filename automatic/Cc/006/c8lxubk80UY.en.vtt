00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.740
 can do to good complement your 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.470
 healthy eating that we are 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.320
 following in the challenge minus 49 and good 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.479
 look that I was going without weights up from 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.199
 your weight 10 kilograms around 

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.510
 20 pounds 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.519
 you have to be very careful imagine 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.909
 what are you walking with on the street with 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:42.530
 a suitcase of 5 kilos or 10 kilos in each 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:45.589
 arm how long are you going to put up with 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.210
 that's what you do to your body every 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.010
 once you start exercising and that 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.899
 you're going to run when you bring too much 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.569
 overweight what you do is that you're going to 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.010
 spend the bones you can hurt yourself 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:57.499
 then we will try to do 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.659
 low impact exercise on all 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:01.659
 that we bring more of that on good 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.509
 kilograms of overweight can leave a 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.030
 little flight 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.280
 you can try a little spinning 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.680
 the same are exercises and also to your 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.350
 side that I mean with high impact is 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.619
 which separates two feet of floor this is something 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.619
 magnet 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.270
 d 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.050
 that's why but we have a lot now 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.210
 overweight I want to stay seven 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.780
 degrees to get out of being yes 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.780
 we can go out to do is to walk out 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.970
 in spaces too overweight ok 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.130
 in term we are eating healthy 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.930
 so let's give it a time and a 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.150
 respect to our body to start 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.710
 drop those pounds and those pounds and once 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.810
 what do we do better than our weight 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:55.050
 we can start doing more exercise 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:55.050
 the good people completely 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.829
 in your body so let's avoid it 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.109
 for this moment if it's too much 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:20.389
 overweight ok in addition to today where 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:24.459
 We are fat, like me, so 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:24.459

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.510
 in the afternoon also a lot of 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.230
 calories is true that these 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.960
 cloned agitators 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.390
 and in second 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.400
 it is difficult to follow a diet like 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.710
 we 're carrying it like this for its heavy and 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.510

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.340
 all those calories so for today 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.260

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.140
