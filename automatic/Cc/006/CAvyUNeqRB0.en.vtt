00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
sturdy how this was obviously really

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.639 
sturdy how this was obviously really
cheaply<00:01:47.460> made<00:01:47.759> because<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.810> doesn't<00:01:49.350> really

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
cheaply made because it doesn't really

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.789 
cheaply made because it doesn't really
it<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.970> not<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.720> snug<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.439> would<00:01:52.590> like<00:01:52.740> it

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
it it's not as snug as I would like it

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.139 
it it's not as snug as I would like it
it's<00:01:53.549> sort<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.909> around<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:56.149> closed

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
it's sort of around in there it's closed

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.770 
it's sort of around in there it's closed
by<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.020> velcro<00:01:58.710> thing<00:01:59.130> there<00:01:59.340> but<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.360> slides

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
by the velcro thing there but it slides

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.330 
by the velcro thing there but it slides
around<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.229> lot<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.560> feel<00:02:01.770> if<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.009> hit<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.189> on

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
around a lot and I feel if you hit it on

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.100 
around a lot and I feel if you hit it on
the<00:02:02.399> edge<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:03.210> wouldn't<00:02:03.509> protect<00:02:03.810> against

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the edge you wouldn't protect against

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.749 
the edge you wouldn't protect against
much<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.770> bang<00:02:05.189> up<00:02:05.369> your<00:02:05.520> corners<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.060> stuff

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
much you bang up your corners and stuff

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.550 
much you bang up your corners and stuff
when<00:02:08.759> i'm<00:02:08.879> using<00:02:09.149> front<00:02:09.420> facing<00:02:09.780> camera<00:02:10.229> it

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
when i'm using front facing camera it

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.790 
when i'm using front facing camera it
does<00:02:10.830> cover<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.489> bit

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
does cover it a bit

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.920 
does cover it a bit
so<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.070> have<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.340> move<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:12.610> back<00:02:12.790> up<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.270> redo

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
so I have to move it back up and redo

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.070 
so I have to move it back up and redo
the<00:02:13.990> velcro<00:02:14.200> every<00:02:14.650> once<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.100> while<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:16.720> it

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
the velcro every once in a while but it

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.860 
the velcro every once in a while but it
is<00:02:17.590> it's<00:02:17.980> nice<00:02:18.280> pre-accident<00:02:18.790> its<00:02:19.210> most<00:02:19.450> like

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
have to bend this thing out and I feel

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.490 
have to bend this thing out and I feel
like<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.710> wears<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.160> out<00:02:45.930> also<00:02:46.930> if<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.320> do

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
like that wears it out also if you do

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.440 
like that wears it out also if you do
have<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.740> keyboard<00:02:48.460> dock<00:02:48.640> for<00:02:48.880> this<00:02:49.000> which<00:02:49.240> I

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
have the keyboard dock for this which I

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.900 
have the keyboard dock for this which I
am<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:50.080> ordered<00:02:50.590> in<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.770> mail<00:02:50.920> I'm<00:02:51.520> going<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.850> do

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
am I ordered in the mail I'm going to do

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.880 
am I ordered in the mail I'm going to do
a<00:02:51.940> review<00:02:52.300> on<00:02:52.390> that<00:02:52.570> soon<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:55.110> don't<00:02:56.110> think<00:02:56.380> it

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
a review on that soon I don't think it

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.620 
a review on that soon I don't think it
might<00:02:57.190> be<00:02:57.220> able<00:02:57.490> to<00:02:57.700> fit<00:02:57.910> into<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.210> doesn't

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
might be able to fit into it doesn't

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.450 
might be able to fit into it doesn't
really<00:02:58.810> look<00:02:59.050> like<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.380> all<00:02:59.770> the<00:03:00.010> ports<00:03:00.340> are

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
really look like it all the ports are

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.610 
really look like it all the ports are
open<00:03:00.520> but<00:03:01.270> I<00:03:01.330> don't<00:03:01.570> think<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.930> would<00:03:02.020> fit<00:03:02.050> in

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
open but I don't think it would fit in

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.250 
open but I don't think it would fit in
with<00:03:02.860> this<00:03:02.920> Welker<00:03:03.430> thing<00:03:04.050> probably<00:03:05.050> what

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
with this Welker thing probably what

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.710 
with this Welker thing probably what
you'd<00:03:05.410> have<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.620> do<00:03:05.830> is<00:03:05.860> take<00:03:06.280> this<00:03:07.060> Welker<00:03:07.540> off

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
you'd have to do is take this Welker off

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.950 
you'd have to do is take this Welker off
and<00:03:08.550> slide<00:03:09.550> it<00:03:09.610> in<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:09.970> that'll<00:03:10.330> crop

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
and slide it in and that'll crop

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.860 
and slide it in and that'll crop
actually<00:03:11.410> probably<00:03:11.770> will<00:03:12.070> will<00:03:12.490> work<00:03:15.450> as<00:03:16.450> for

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
actually probably will will work as for

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.690 
actually probably will will work as for
the<00:03:16.930> screen<00:03:17.200> protector<00:03:17.739> it<00:03:18.220> really<00:03:18.459> does

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
the screen protector it really does

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.430 
the screen protector it really does
