batter<00:01:48.819> so<00:01:49.479> there<00:01:49.660> are<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.020> many<00:01:50.229> ways<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.560> get

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
batter so there are so many ways to get

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.740 
batter so there are so many ways to get
your<00:01:50.800> bananas<00:01:51.160> for<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.670> banana<00:01:51.970> fritters<00:01:52.390> you

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
your bananas for the banana fritters you

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.449 
your bananas for the banana fritters you
can<00:01:52.869> get<00:01:52.990> nice<00:01:53.200> small<00:01:53.590> fritters<00:01:53.979> by<00:01:54.160> cutting

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:54.459 
can get nice small fritters by cutting

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.639 
can get nice small fritters by cutting
them<00:01:54.610> into<00:01:54.729> little<00:01:55.000> angles<00:01:55.450> like<00:01:56.020> this<00:01:56.380> way

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
them into little angles like this way

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.469 
them into little angles like this way
and<00:01:57.009> there's<00:01:57.399> also<00:01:57.610> another<00:01:57.729> way<00:01:58.090> if<00:01:58.149> you<00:01:58.300> want

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
them a little bigger you can cut them in

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.210 
them a little bigger you can cut them in
half<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.479> then<00:02:01.569> cut<00:02:01.929> it<00:02:02.080> in<00:02:02.410> another<00:02:02.979> half

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
half and then cut it in another half

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.859 
half and then cut it in another half
like<00:02:03.459> what<00:02:03.610> I'm<00:02:03.700> doing<00:02:03.729> over<00:02:04.090> here<00:02:04.119> so<00:02:04.660> you<00:02:04.720> get

to about medium-high heat and it's

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.730 
to about medium-high heat and it's
seeking<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.990> batter<00:02:17.140> out<00:02:17.319> of<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.500> fridge<00:02:17.709> so

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
seeking the batter out of the fridge so

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.470 
seeking the batter out of the fridge so
this<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:18.160> what<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.400> looks<00:02:18.550> like<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:19.180> put<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.420> in

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
this is what it looks like you put it in

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
the fridge it will get a little bit

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.010 
the fridge it will get a little bit
thicker<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:21.970> can<00:02:22.180> just<00:02:22.390> put<00:02:22.660> about

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
thicker so you can just put about

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.190 
thicker so you can just put about
another<00:02:23.380> teaspoon<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:24.370> water<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:25.870> the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
another teaspoon of water so just the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.570 
another teaspoon of water so just the

oil to see if it's hot just take a bit

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.160 
oil to see if it's hot just take a bit
of<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.730> batter<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.120> see<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.810> starts<00:02:29.080> to
