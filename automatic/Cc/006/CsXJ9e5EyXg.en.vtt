Guatemala the clamping and Selenia is

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.399 
Guatemala the clamping and Selenia is
not<00:00:46.859> common<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:48.030> or<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.960> me<00:00:49.109> it's<00:00:49.229> not

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
not common but it's or for me it's not

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.049 
not common but it's or for me it's not
common<00:00:49.829> because<00:00:49.979> it's<00:00:50.309> usually<00:00:50.519> it's<00:00:50.729> very<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
common because it's usually it's very a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.000 
common because it's usually it's very a
unique<00:00:51.420> style<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.989> get<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.350> do<00:00:52.469> moves<00:00:52.739> you've

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
unique style you get to do moves you've

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.639 
unique style you get to do moves you've
never<00:00:53.250> even<00:00:53.659> really<00:00:54.659> thought<00:00:54.689> about<00:00:54.960> being

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
never even really thought about being

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.349 
never even really thought about being
possible<00:00:56.219> before<00:00:56.609> all<00:00:56.820> we've<00:00:56.969> never<00:00:57.119> done

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
possible before all we've never done

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:57.770 
possible before all we've never done
before

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
before

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.599 
before
very<00:00:58.049> very<00:00:58.229> three<00:00:58.530> damage<00:00:58.859> I'm<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.399> like

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
very very three damage I'm to do like

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.670 
very very three damage I'm to do like
far<00:01:00.059> more<00:01:00.299> separation<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.229> means<00:01:01.469> they

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
far more separation that means they

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.410 
far more separation that means they
really<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.159> I<00:01:02.189> may<00:01:02.489> go<00:01:02.670> jump<00:01:02.909> and<00:01:03.089> jump

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
really like I may go jump and jump

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.820 
really like I may go jump and jump
I'm<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.689> to<00:01:03.750> use<00:01:03.929> especially<00:01:04.110> when<00:01:04.470> you're

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
I'm going to use especially when you're

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.039 
I'm going to use especially when you're
like<00:01:05.100> in-between<00:01:05.519> two<00:01:06.119> scoops<00:01:06.450> it's

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
like in-between two scoops it's

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.749 
like in-between two scoops it's
something<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.740> would<00:01:07.950> maybe<00:01:08.159> do<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
something that you would maybe do in a

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.919 
something that you would maybe do in a
World<00:01:09.659> Cup<00:01:09.750> bouldering<00:01:10.679> competition<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.640> not

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:11.929 
World Cup bouldering competition but not

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.600 
World Cup bouldering competition but not
anywhere<00:01:12.929> else<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.280> had<00:01:14.429> to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
anywhere else but here you just had to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.399 
anywhere else but here you just had to
go<00:01:14.789> for<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.240> what's<00:01:15.929> really<00:01:16.229> nice

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.289 

think<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.130> mix<00:01:20.310> bouldering<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.880> Sardinia

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
think the mix bouldering in Sardinia

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.700 
think the mix bouldering in Sardinia
really<00:01:21.600> unique<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> shape<00:01:22.350> with<00:01:22.500> your

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
really unique is the shape with your

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.980 
really unique is the shape with your
Apple<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.070> lot<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.640> look<00:01:24.149> for<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> lot<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.719> first

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
Apple a lot and look for a lot of first

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.620 
Apple a lot and look for a lot of first
descents<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:26.369> think<00:01:26.640> Sardinia<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.420> very

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
descents and I think Sardinia is very

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.389 
descents and I think Sardinia is very
special<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.680> find<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.100> crazy

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
special because you can find this crazy

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.219 
special because you can find this crazy
for<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> rocking<00:01:30.270> inside<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
for the rocking inside in here the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.490 
for the rocking inside in here the
granite<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.729> would<00:01:33.570> say<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:33.869> unique

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
granite is I would say it's unique

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.770 
granite is I would say it's unique
the<00:01:34.920> rock<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.310> definitely<00:01:35.850> rough<00:01:36.060> I'm<00:01:36.509> not

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the rock is definitely rough I'm not

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
the rock is definitely rough I'm not
gonna<00:01:36.960> lie<00:01:37.170> about<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.649> but<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.369> more

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
gonna lie about that but it's more

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.610 
gonna lie about that but it's more
rewarding<00:01:39.030> when<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.299> get<00:01:39.600> stop<00:01:40.140> him

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.820 

well<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:49.030> can<00:01:49.240> also<00:01:49.390> find<00:01:49.840> more<00:01:50.080> typical

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
well you can also find more typical

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.190 
well you can also find more typical
polar<00:01:51.070> problems<00:01:51.490> even<00:01:52.300> much<00:01:52.690> more<00:01:52.930> easy

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
polar problems even much more easy

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.050 
polar problems even much more easy
border<00:01:53.620> than<00:01:53.830> hot<00:01:54.010> boulders<00:01:54.460> but<00:01:54.730> more<00:01:54.940> than

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
border than hot boulders but more than

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.750 
border than hot boulders but more than
anything<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.660> rock<00:01:56.080> was<00:01:56.290> virgin<00:01:56.680> but<00:01:57.520> I<00:01:57.550> was

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
anything the rock was virgin but I was

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.520 
anything the rock was virgin but I was
actually<00:01:57.970> really<00:01:58.390> impressed<00:01:58.570> about<00:01:58.930> how<00:01:59.080> much

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
actually really impressed about how much

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.410 
actually really impressed about how much
rock<00:01:59.800> there<00:02:00.040> was<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.700> there's<00:02:01.030> so<00:02:01.240> much<00:02:01.360> more

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
rock there was and there's so much more

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.850 
rock there was and there's so much more
than<00:02:01.780> what<00:02:01.930> I<00:02:01.960> thought<00:02:02.050> yeah<00:02:02.470> there's<00:02:02.680> this

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
than what I thought yeah there's this

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.950 
than what I thought yeah there's this
there's<00:02:03.220> more<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.700> do<00:02:03.850> this<00:02:04.030> really<00:02:04.480> get<00:02:04.840> a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
there's more to do this really get a

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.590 
there's more to do this really get a
wish<00:02:05.140> for<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:05.620> think<00:02:06.070> we<00:02:06.220> just<00:02:06.460> tried<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.360> climb

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
wish for I think we just tried to climb

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.580 
wish for I think we just tried to climb
2<00:02:08.350> or<00:02:08.560> 5<00:02:08.800> percent<00:02:09.070> of<00:02:09.520> of<00:02:10.180> the<00:02:10.420> things<00:02:10.500> we<00:02:11.500> have

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
2 or 5 percent of of the things we have

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.620 
2 or 5 percent of of the things we have
seen<00:02:11.620> it's<00:02:12.310> not<00:02:12.580> just<00:02:12.820> for<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.030> bouldering<00:02:13.390> it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
seen it's not just for the bouldering it

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.150 
seen it's not just for the bouldering it
has<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.560> much<00:02:14.770> more<00:02:14.980> more<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:15.970> offer<00:02:16.770> this<00:02:17.770> wild
