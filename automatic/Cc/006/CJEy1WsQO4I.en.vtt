the<00:00:26.310> calcium<00:00:26.730> my<00:00:27.240> uromastyx<00:00:27.869> gets<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.289> very

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
the calcium my uromastyx gets a very

the calcium my uromastyx gets a very
varied<00:00:29.490> diet<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.830> don't<00:00:31.830> want<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.070> give<00:00:32.189> them

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
varied diet so I don't want to give them

varied diet so I don't want to give them
excess<00:00:32.790> calcium<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.600> can<00:00:33.780> cause<00:00:33.960> problems

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
excess calcium this can cause problems

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.930 
excess calcium this can cause problems
you<00:00:34.680> need<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.890> be<00:00:34.980> very<00:00:35.190> careful<00:00:35.370> when<00:00:35.700> using

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
you need to be very careful when using

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
with every feeding something that I

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.819 
with every feeding something that I
found<00:00:41.640> very<00:00:41.760> useful<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.840> put<00:00:43.649> my

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
found very useful was to put my

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.920 
found very useful was to put my

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
can just kind of sprinkle it on top of

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.580 
can just kind of sprinkle it on top of
her<00:00:47.550> vegetables<00:00:48.059> whenever<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.079> feed<00:00:49.410> her

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and they also have this out there it's

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.889 
and they also have this out there it's
called<00:00:54.870> uromastyx<00:00:55.620> dust<00:00:56.539> there's<00:00:57.539> different

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
called uromastyx dust there's different

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.720 
called uromastyx dust there's different
formulas<00:00:58.379> there's<00:00:58.620> insect<00:00:59.039> formulas<00:00:59.550> and

formula and this can be used when you

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.359 
formula and this can be used when you
don't<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.559> wide<00:01:04.830> variety<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
don't have that wide variety of

vegetables that are recommended for the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.840 
vegetables that are recommended for the
uromastyx<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.650> what<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.430> do<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.610> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
uromastyx and what this will do is it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.340 
uromastyx and what this will do is it
will<00:01:11.880> complete<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> nutritional<00:01:12.960> value<00:01:12.990> of

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
will complete the nutritional value of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
uromastyx so that's something that you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.859 
uromastyx so that's something that you
want<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.310> look<00:01:17.580> into<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.240> can't<00:01:18.509> provide

the wide variety on a daily basis now as

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.560 
the wide variety on a daily basis now as
far<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:22.799> frequency<00:01:23.490> goes<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.000> juvenile

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
far as frequency goes the juvenile

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.539 
far as frequency goes the juvenile
uromastyx<00:01:25.439> should<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.890> eating<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> daily

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
uromastyx should be eating on a daily

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.899 
uromastyx should be eating on a daily
basis<00:01:27.090> both<00:01:27.840> vegetables<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.030> insects<00:01:30.380> the

basis both vegetables and insects the

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.670 
basis both vegetables and insects the
adult<00:01:32.909> uromastyx<00:01:33.570> tend<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.020> not<00:01:34.140> eat<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.560> many

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
adult uromastyx tend to not eat as many

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.870 
adult uromastyx tend to not eat as many
insects<00:01:36.170> mine's<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.320> little<00:01:37.350> special<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.549> most
