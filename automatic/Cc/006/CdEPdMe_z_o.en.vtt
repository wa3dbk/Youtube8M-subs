 with his unipersonal power 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:28.019
 everything what the show is called cholo power 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.260
 and part of a premise that is that in 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.579
 last 30 to 35 years we have been 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.750
 trained to make a kind 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.750
 top let's say 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.020
 but we have been bursting so much 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.450
 governments all the more the politician that 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.070
 we are trained for anything and 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.730
 from that I start to develop 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.170
 bills 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.690
 a word very heard for you that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.970
 be cholo power spoon power is a 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.890
 Peruvian today not an enterprising type a 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.790
 guy with claw a creative guy a guy 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.790
 that the return to the city 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.020
 the power attitude comes or does not come 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.570
 of the lining 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.570
 and it 's that you're going to present yourself at the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.520
 peruvian japanese japanese japanese who 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:23.740
 for example, the show can be a 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:28.260
 just power that strong has options 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.260
 because there are your tone specimens 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.730
 who could be a cholo power 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.740
 no no no 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:58.040
 I do not know who can be a tractor I think 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.160
 that everything is a cholo power if I play is a 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.770
 they only look for their children studying 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.430
 good careers the most intelligent of the 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:12.140
 a very clear progress in hers 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:15.170
 tastes of show business is very clear 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.660
 his game and he's a guy who was in 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.970
 Italy has also failed to get well 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:25.160
 it handles well the radio does not have years in 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.470
 this business is not if it's a guy that I 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.630
 I think without hurting anyone has 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.140
 parallel to the tele crisis of 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.140
 arbitration 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.810
 cristian where I think it's also a 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.569
 single power 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.300

 the time alone power is not only that 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.260
 the back is broken working but it is 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.000
 fundamentally the entrepreneur the 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.670
 creative one that turns the 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.670
