00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.389
 the camera d test the camera 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.370
 unlike most bridge cameras 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.650
 the only one to take the picture 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.510
 ordinary 123 to large c mos sensor 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.360
 own the panasonic lumix 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.260
 fz100 about a 10 inch model with 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.670
 dimensions of 13 2 x 8 mm 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.770
 together with the sony cybershot rx 10 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.140
 the fz 1000 offers the largest 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.700
 picture sensor in the bridge class as 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.980
 sensor sensitivities can be iso 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.660
 Use 80 to 25,600 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.790
 the choice is one third or whole 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.020
 stages possible as well as there are of course 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.690
 also an iso automatic 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.440
 in addition to jpeg images are the fz 1000 too 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.440
 raw recordings possible 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.220
 the recordings of the fz 1000 convincing 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.110
 until at least 400 iso with a very 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.130
 good picture quality is a picture noise 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.800
 virtually invisible 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.570
 at iso 800 1.600 for this then 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.090
 for the first time it keeps lightly on it however 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.299
 It is still discreetly disturbing in the background 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.799
 thus by no means attacks on iso 3200 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.549
 the in-camera noise reduction then 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.650
 visible one 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.530
 As a result, fewer details are resolved 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.720
 iso 6.400 then provide for another 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.430
 Waste at the image quality iso 12.800 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.560
 you only have one emergency option iso 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.560
 25,600 should be avoided 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.780
 at less is the recording is 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.440
 iso 400 perfectly and up to 1600 iso good 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.229
 usable 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.430
 more than iso 3,200 should be at higher 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.370
 claims to the picture quality but 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.470
 not be adjusted 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.510
 the fz 1000 moves on one 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.560
 level with the Sony cybershot x10 and 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.120
 so well above that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:53.870
 average b quality level in 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:53.870
 this class is our final conclusion 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.880
 The Panasonic Lumix Fz100 delivers in 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.380
 many points impressive and 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.600
 actually very good in all points 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.130
 first results once must 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.570
 of course beyond any doubt 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.789
 the image quality are called 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.799
 this almost moves to system camera 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.439
 level the pictures show a lot 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.720
 details only from iso 3.200 falls the 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:18.659
 Image quality visible from good cuts 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.099
 also 16 times the sum from it convinces 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.930
 with many focal lengths even the 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.970
 Bildecken often move on one 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.220
 very good level that the light intensity 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.450
 only in wide angle is above f 2.8 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.810
 but the very good image quality at 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.340
 higher 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.160
 sensor sensitivities absolutely 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.690
 tolerable with 25 to 400 mm 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.090
 Small picture focal length and one 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.520
 light intensity of f2 8 to 4 is one 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.780
 excellently equipped especially 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.910
 We were also impressed by the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.440
 working speed the series with 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.540
 rate is me up to twelve pictures per 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.510
 Second, the cache is very high 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.430
 53 jpeg and 13 roppel then really big 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.080
 the autofocus puts at everyone 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.970
 focal length extremely fast in the sharp 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.019
 Wide angle we have only 0.07 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.120
 seconds measured 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.349
 not even one second also goes by 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.970
 until the operational readiness of the 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.640
 bridge camera after turning on 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.310
 only 101 seconds one must also on the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.080
 first picture taking is also waiting on the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.600
 Ausstattungsseite awaits you 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.380
 the panasonic lumix fz100 only the best 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.450
 from the best 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.040
 the pre folding display with high 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.860
 Resolution allows a very comfortable 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.780
 In addition, image control are a very high 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.810
 high resolution as well as very much 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.290
 many keys and everyone on board 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.230
 manual setting options 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.130
 The FZ 1000 offers a lot of reports 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.080
 you can thanks to the additional 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.260
 electronic shutter up to one 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.820
 16 thousandths of a second at the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.220
 Video recording allows the panasonic 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.959
 lumix fz100 as the first camera without 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.709
 interchangeable the ultra hd 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.500
 or 4 k recording 3,840 x 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.940
 2,160 pixels can be with 25 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.829
 full frames per second and one 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.079
 capture sensational b quality 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.400
 but also the full HD recordings know 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.769
 with a really great quality 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.340
 and also 50 full frames per second too 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.709
 like 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.359
 the manual video options the good 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.069
 stereo microphone and the connection for 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.040
 An external microphone are also available 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.660
 commendable if you at the fz 1000 something 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.100
 would have to criticize then these are the 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.540
 missing touchscreen and not 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.450
 Existing seal of the camera body 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.150
 both points are a pity that 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.680
 the fz 1831 gram already a correct 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.420
 It is difficult to break because of the 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.320
 topausstattung but really not as 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.410
 see criticism 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.030
 the panasonic lumix fz100 is one 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.530
 bridge camera of extra class for 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.789
 photographers with the desire for one 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.610
 larger zoo area and one 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.260
 Image quality on system camera level only 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.880
 who often has a bright optics 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.169
 needed should then rather to 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.660
 system camera grab 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.889
 otherwise the fz 1000 is also the 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.889
 most satisfied users satisfied 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.599
 the idea 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.599
 the test judgments to the camera
