00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
goes on for a while but yeah that was

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.020 
goes on for a while but yeah that was
getting<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.080> lucky<00:04:52.440> metal<00:04:52.770> on<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.010> type<00:04:53.820> 59

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
getting the lucky metal on the type 59

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.170 
getting the lucky metal on the type 59
and<00:04:54.750> it<00:04:55.350> was<00:04:55.440> because<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:56.040> t28<00:04:56.550> prototype<00:04:56.820> in

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
and it was because the t28 prototype in

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.550 
and it was because the t28 prototype in
the<00:04:57.240> back<00:04:57.390> back<00:04:57.630> there<00:04:57.660> killed<00:04:58.200> his<00:04:58.410> own

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
the back back there killed his own

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.290 
the back back there killed his own
teammate<00:04:59.010> and<00:04:59.280> I<00:04:59.640> was<00:04:59.760> right<00:04:59.940> next<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:00.270> him

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
teammate and I was right next to him

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.420 
teammate and I was right next to him
when<00:05:00.480> he<00:05:00.570> did<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:00.870> so<00:05:01.740> I<00:05:01.770> think<00:05:01.950> that's<00:05:02.220> really

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
when he did it so I think that's really

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.580 
when he did it so I think that's really
awesome<00:05:02.550> that's<00:05:02.910> first<00:05:03.900> time<00:05:04.080> I've<00:05:04.200> ever<00:05:04.260> seen

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
awesome that's first time I've ever seen

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.250 
awesome that's first time I've ever seen
that<00:05:04.800> metal<00:05:05.070> get<00:05:05.580> get<00:05:05.850> get<00:05:06.630> awarded<00:05:07.140> to

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
that metal get get get awarded to

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.610 
that metal get get get awarded to
anybody<00:05:07.680> in<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:07.950> game<00:05:08.540> let<00:05:09.540> alone<00:05:09.570> want<00:05:10.110> me<00:05:10.350> I

anybody in the game let alone want me I

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.800 
anybody in the game let alone want me I
think<00:05:11.580> it's<00:05:11.700> probably<00:05:11.820> a<00:05:12.030> more<00:05:12.180> rare<00:05:12.420> metal<00:05:12.720> to

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
think it's probably a more rare metal to

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.070 
think it's probably a more rare metal to
get<00:05:13.730> about<00:05:14.730> I<00:05:14.790> saw<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.060> chance<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.540> try<00:05:15.780> for<00:05:15.840> it
