00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
is just parchment paper I used the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.630 
is just parchment paper I used the
bottom<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.260> glass<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.219> traced<00:00:38.460> it

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
bottom of a glass and just traced it

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.060 
bottom of a glass and just traced it
with<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.789> sharpie<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.539> then<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.769> that

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
with a sharpie and then if you have that

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.049 
with a sharpie and then if you have that
you<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:41.789> practice<00:00:42.570> all<00:00:42.929> day<00:00:43.079> long<00:00:44.059> whatever

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
you can practice all day long whatever

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.209 
you can practice all day long whatever
technique<00:00:45.629> you're<00:00:45.809> trying<00:00:46.109> to<00:00:46.320> master<00:00:46.859> so

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
technique you're trying to master so

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.970 
technique you're trying to master so
with<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> trophy<00:00:47.940> wave<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.839> a<00:00:49.019> six<00:00:49.320> pointed

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
with the trophy wave it's a six pointed

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.750 
with the trophy wave it's a six pointed
star<00:00:50.780> basically<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.440> you're<00:00:52.949> starting<00:00:53.489> at<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
star basically so you're starting at the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.139 
star basically so you're starting at the
top<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.329> going<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:55.050> two<00:00:55.579> three<00:00:56.579> four

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
top and just going one two three four

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.869 
top and just going one two three four
five<00:00:57.719> six<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.620> then<00:00:58.710> finishing<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.429> a<00:00:59.550> swirl

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
five six and then finishing with a swirl

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.419 
five six and then finishing with a swirl
so<00:01:00.659> you<00:01:00.749> can<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.079> keep<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.409> practicing<00:01:01.649> until

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
so you can just keep on practicing until

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.380 
so you can just keep on practicing until
that<00:01:02.579> looks<00:01:02.789> perfect

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
that looks perfect

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.820 
that looks perfect
and<00:01:03.539> then<00:01:03.929> you're<00:01:04.080> not<00:01:04.199> wasting<00:01:04.650> any

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
and then you're not wasting any

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.740 
and then you're not wasting any
