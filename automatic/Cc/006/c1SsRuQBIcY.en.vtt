blues composite Scale if you look at

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.180 
blues composite Scale if you look at
diagram<00:00:10.389> for<00:00:10.930> you'll<00:00:11.500> see<00:00:11.710> that<00:00:11.830> you<00:00:11.950> have<00:00:12.070> the

Blues composite Scale and I've talked
about<00:00:13.959> this<00:00:14.110> in<00:00:14.170> many<00:00:14.469> of<00:00:14.590> my<00:00:14.680> blues<00:00:14.920> series

it's the sum of the blues scale and the

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.140 
it's the sum of the blues scale and the
major<00:00:17.380> pentatonic<00:00:17.740> scale<00:00:18.250> so<00:00:18.970> you're<00:00:19.090> getting

playing in a blue situation you have

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.030 
playing in a blue situation you have
this<00:00:32.830> entire<00:00:33.250> scale<00:00:33.670> to<00:00:34.030> choose<00:00:34.300> from<00:00:34.600> and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
this entire scale to choose from and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.200 
this entire scale to choose from and
there<00:00:36.040> are<00:00:36.100> a<00:00:36.130> lot<00:00:36.220> of<00:00:36.250> great<00:00:36.610> double<00:00:37.030> stop

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
there are a lot of great double stop

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.970 
there are a lot of great double stop
triple<00:00:37.629> sup<00:00:37.780> ideas<00:00:38.200> if<00:00:38.379> you<00:00:38.469> just<00:00:38.649> take<00:00:38.770> what

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
triple sup ideas if you just take what

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.709 
triple sup ideas if you just take what
you've<00:00:39.160> learned<00:00:39.219> in<00:00:39.640> these<00:00:39.879> previous<00:00:40.300> lessons

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
you've learned in these previous lessons

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.600 
you've learned in these previous lessons
in<00:00:40.840> this<00:00:40.960> series<00:00:41.170> you'll<00:00:42.129> be<00:00:42.280> able<00:00:42.340> to<00:00:42.460> get

in this series you'll be able to get

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.610 
in this series you'll be able to get
more<00:00:42.850> ideas<00:00:42.969> and<00:00:43.239> more<00:00:43.539> sound<00:00:43.840> so<00:00:44.230> I'll

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
more ideas and more sound so I'll

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.209 
more ideas and more sound so I'll
demonstrate<00:00:45.070> for<00:00:45.579> example<00:00:45.940> from<00:00:50.190> there<00:00:51.190> I

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
demonstrate for example from there I

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.450 
demonstrate for example from there I
went<00:00:51.309> down<00:00:51.670> sweded<00:00:52.149> up<00:00:52.270> by<00:00:52.390> throwing<00:00:52.660> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.500 

certain<00:00:57.460> positions<00:00:57.969> would<00:00:58.090> lend<00:00:58.329> themselves

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
certain positions would lend themselves

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.990 
certain positions would lend themselves
to<00:00:58.840> certain<00:00:59.230> licks<00:00:59.469> more<00:00:59.859> easily<00:01:00.250> but<00:01:00.820> for

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
to certain licks more easily but for

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.549 
to certain licks more easily but for
example

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.100 

there<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.909> double<00:01:06.299> stops<00:01:06.509> coming<00:01:06.930> right

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
there we have double stops coming right

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:29.200 
there we have double stops coming right
down<00:01:07.850> composite<00:01:08.850> Scale

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.790 

all<00:01:30.210> right<00:01:30.420> now<00:01:30.690> like<00:01:31.230> I<00:01:31.350> said<00:01:31.410> I'm<00:01:31.620> not<00:01:31.680> going

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
all right now like I said I'm not going

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.220 
all right now like I said I'm not going
to<00:01:31.920> show<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.160> any<00:01:32.400> licks<00:01:32.760> you<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.020> figure

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
to show you any licks you have to figure

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.810 
to show you any licks you have to figure
out<00:01:34.380> some<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.680> these<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.950> your<00:01:35.130> own<00:01:35.190> but<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
out some of these on your own but the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.550 
out some of these on your own but the
thing<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.090> if<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.540> start<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.290> see

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
thing is if you start with that see

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.490 
thing is if you start with that see
blues<00:01:37.890> scale<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.520> then<00:01:39.000> add<00:01:39.270> another<00:01:39.750> note<00:01:40.320> in

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
blues scale and then add another note in

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.700 
blues scale and then add another note in
for<00:01:40.830> example<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> sixth<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.660> a<00:01:43.440> couple

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
for example the sixth we have a couple

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.010 
for example the sixth we have a couple
of<00:01:43.890> sixes<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.370> this<00:01:44.670> position<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.660> if<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.840> take

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
of sixes in this position so if you take

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.090 
of sixes in this position so if you take
your<00:01:46.080> see<00:01:46.440> blues<00:01:46.770> scale<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:49.530> then<00:01:49.680> add<00:01:49.890> that

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
your see blues scale and then add that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.390 
your see blues scale and then add that
six

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400

and<00:02:22.580> then<00:02:23.120> sweeten<00:02:23.569> it<00:02:23.660> up<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.900> throw<00:02:24.140> in<00:02:24.230> 26<00:02:24.590> and

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
and then sweeten it up I throw in 26 and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.380 
and then sweeten it up I throw in 26 and
or<00:02:24.950> throw<00:02:25.220> in<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.489> three<00:02:25.790> in<00:02:28.120> here's<00:02:29.120> the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
or throw in the three in here's the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.020 
or throw in the three in here's the
pedal<00:02:29.870> tone<00:02:30.080> up<00:02:30.260> on<00:02:30.410> top<00:02:30.620> right<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:31.340> I'm<00:02:31.459> goes

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
pedal tone up on top right so I'm goes

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.759 
pedal tone up on top right so I'm goes
back<00:02:32.269> to<00:02:32.450> one<00:02:32.599> of<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.720> lessons<00:02:32.930> actually<00:02:33.680> it

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
back to one of the lessons actually it

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.650 
back to one of the lessons actually it
was<00:02:33.800> lesson<00:02:34.280> number<00:02:34.489> four<00:02:34.670> where<00:02:35.300> we<00:02:35.420> said

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
was lesson number four where we said

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.570 
was lesson number four where we said
double<00:02:36.349> stops<00:02:36.590> with<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.800> root<00:02:37.069> is<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.310> upper

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
double stops with the root is the upper

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.309 
double stops with the root is the upper
voice<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.090> here's<00:02:38.300> just<00:02:38.390> see<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:39.680> going<00:02:41.319> that

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
voice so here's just see you going that

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.960 
voice so here's just see you going that
was<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.500> sea<00:02:42.739> blue<00:02:42.980> scale<00:02:43.310> that's<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.670> source

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
was a sea blue scale that's the source

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.640 
was a sea blue scale that's the source
of<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.330> lower<00:02:44.630> line<00:02:44.989> well<00:02:45.950> we<00:02:46.069> can<00:02:46.220> go

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.800 

I'm<00:02:51.329> throwing<00:02:52.329> into<00:02:52.720> 3<00:02:52.989> into<00:02:53.019> 6<00:02:53.290> right<00:02:53.829> there

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.319 

and<00:02:58.810> notice<00:02:59.680> how<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.890> sound<00:03:00.220> changes<00:03:00.489> because

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
and notice how the sound changes because

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.390 
and notice how the sound changes because
it<00:03:01.510> sweetens<00:03:01.930> up<00:03:02.079> with<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.379> 3<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:02.950> 6<00:03:03.220> and

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
it sweetens up with the 3 and the 6 and

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.759 
it sweetens up with the 3 and the 6 and
the<00:03:03.489> 9<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.909> some<00:03:04.090> degree<00:03:04.239> so<00:03:04.959> this<00:03:05.140> is<00:03:05.319> an<00:03:05.409> idea

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
the 9 to some degree so this is an idea

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.580 
the 9 to some degree so this is an idea
of<00:03:06.040> applying<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.700> blues<00:03:06.970> composite<00:03:07.659> Scale<00:03:07.900> to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
of applying the blues composite Scale to

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.830 
of applying the blues composite Scale to
this<00:03:08.739> big<00:03:09.010> blues<00:03:09.250> approach<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:10.359> have<00:03:10.510> double

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
this big blues approach you have double

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.360 
this big blues approach you have double
stops<00:03:11.049> triple<00:03:11.439> stops<00:03:11.650> letting<00:03:11.980> things<00:03:12.129> ring

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
stops triple stops letting things ring

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.099 
stops triple stops letting things ring
together<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.970> so<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:13.540> can<00:03:13.780> see<00:03:13.959> this<00:03:14.019> will

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
together and so you can see this will

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.340 
together and so you can see this will
keep<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.409> busy<00:03:14.439> for<00:03:14.769> a<00:03:14.950> few<00:03:15.099> lifetimes
