storage so I'm gonna go ahead and select

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.470 
storage so I'm gonna go ahead and select
this<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.700> his<00:02:57.359> here's<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:59.329> option<00:03:00.329> right

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
start say I only get one passing zeroes

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.710 
start say I only get one passing zeroes
and<00:03:32.590> he<00:03:32.770> ever<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:33.790> UH<00:03:33.819> greater<00:03:34.180> version

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
and he ever the the UH greater version

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.220 
and he ever the the UH greater version
has<00:03:35.130> these<00:03:36.130> other<00:03:36.370> options<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:37.090> stuff<00:03:37.239> out

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230

there<00:03:38.530> I<00:03:38.620> can<00:03:38.800> click<00:03:39.130> on<00:03:39.340> that<00:03:39.580> let<00:03:40.090> me<00:03:40.180> try

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
there I can click on that let me try

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:49.949 
there I can click on that let me try
this<00:03:44.550> it<00:03:45.550> has<00:03:45.760> three<00:03:46.690> passes<00:03:48.540> but<00:03:49.540> all<00:03:49.660> I<00:03:49.690> need

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
this it has three passes but all I need

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.000 
this it has three passes but all I need
is<00:03:50.050> one<00:03:50.080> pass<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.750> what<00:03:52.930> this<00:03:53.080> dude<00:03:53.319> is<00:03:53.620> this

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
is one pass and what this dude is this

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.990 
is one pass and what this dude is this
passes<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.560> program<00:03:57.040> passes<00:03:57.580> and<00:03:57.790> makes

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
passes that the program passes and makes

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.530 
passes that the program passes and makes
a<00:03:58.150> lot<00:03:58.299> of<00:03:58.480> zeros<00:03:58.959> on<00:03:59.680> the<00:04:00.310> whole<00:04:00.519> judge<00:04:00.940> so<00:04:01.269> be

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
a lot of zeros on the whole judge so be

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.039 
a lot of zeros on the whole judge so be
like<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.750> brand-new<00:04:02.080> hard<00:04:02.799> drive<00:04:03.540> like<00:04:04.540> I<00:04:04.600> say

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
like a brand-new hard drive like I say

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.199 
like a brand-new hard drive like I say
somebody<00:04:05.500> wants<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.310> try<00:04:06.549> to<00:04:06.580> read

somebody wants to try to read
information<00:04:07.420> off<00:04:08.110> of<00:04:08.260> it<00:04:08.440> it'll<00:04:08.739> be<00:04:08.860> only<00:04:09.040> zero

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
information off of it it'll be only zero

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.309 
information off of it it'll be only zero
that<00:04:09.730> they'll<00:04:09.940> read<00:04:12.239> so<00:04:13.239> I'm<00:04:14.019> gonna<00:04:14.140> go<00:04:14.260> ahead

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
that they'll read so I'm gonna go ahead

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.780 
that they'll read so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:04:14.410> click<00:04:14.620> start<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:17.560> it's<00:04:18.100> gonna<00:04:18.310> ask<00:04:18.519> me<00:04:18.669> to

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:44.320 

there<00:04:39.569> we<00:04:39.690> have<00:04:39.900> it<00:04:39.930> us<00:04:41.389> right<00:04:42.389> now<00:04:42.419> is

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
there we have it us right now is

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.980 
there we have it us right now is
greening<00:04:45.330> this<00:04:45.539> and<00:04:45.990> it's<00:04:47.509> going<00:04:48.509> to<00:04:48.660> have

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
greening this and it's going to have

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.499 
greening this and it's going to have
it's<00:04:49.259> going<00:04:49.410> to<00:04:49.590> make<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.770> pass<00:04:50.069> if<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.240> start

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
it's going to make a pass if I start

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.210 
it's going to make a pass if I start
writing<00:04:51.660> zeros<00:04:52.110> on<00:04:52.259> the<00:04:52.289> hard<00:04:52.590> drive<00:04:52.919> so<00:04:53.190> you

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
writing zeros on the hard drive so you

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.520 
writing zeros on the hard drive so you
it<00:04:53.639> won't<00:04:53.789> have<00:04:53.970> no<00:04:54.210> information<00:04:54.990> on<00:04:55.169> they<00:04:55.380> had

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
a return to read it and after does that

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.589 
a return to read it and after does that
it's<00:05:01.440> going<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:03.180> have<00:05:03.419> to<00:05:03.569> reformat<00:05:04.169> it

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
it's going to you have to reformat it

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.570 
it's going to you have to reformat it
using<00:05:06.599> window<00:05:06.960> using<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.530> windows<00:05:07.979> program

you<00:05:09.539> have<00:05:09.720> to<00:05:09.810> reformat<00:05:10.500> it<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.919> the<00:05:11.039> soil<00:05:11.340> can

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
you have to reformat it to the soil can

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.050 
you have to reformat it to the soil can
boot<00:05:12.720> up<00:05:12.870> or<00:05:13.139> you<00:05:13.289> can<00:05:13.440> have<00:05:13.530> a<00:05:13.560> bootable<00:05:13.949> disk
