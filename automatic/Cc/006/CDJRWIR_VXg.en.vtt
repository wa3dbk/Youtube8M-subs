00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
mrs. Citadel castellón castellan cast a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.179 
mrs. Citadel castellón castellan cast a
and<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.310> hard<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> say<00:01:09.320> in<00:01:10.320> any<00:01:10.470> case<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.070> a

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
and it's hard to say in any case it is a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.310 
and it's hard to say in any case it is a
three<00:01:11.520> minute<00:01:11.700> 23<00:01:11.970> vigilance<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.750> when<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
three minute 23 vigilance and when it

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.340 
three minute 23 vigilance and when it
renowned<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:14.010> becomes<00:01:14.549> what<00:01:14.939> about<00:01:15.330> 45<00:01:15.990> so

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
renowned it becomes what about 45 so

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.130 
renowned it becomes what about 45 so
that's<00:01:16.530> pretty<00:01:16.770> good<00:01:16.979> um<00:01:17.450> yeah<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:19.020> can

deck shaping up I think that might be
really<00:01:34.500> awesome<00:01:34.650> actually<00:01:35.070> although<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:35.939> do

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
really awesome actually although we do

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.399 
really awesome actually although we do

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
its toughness or casting cost but we do

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.470 
its toughness or casting cost but we do

um we think it costs to agreement of
black<00:02:18.970> although<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.480> may<00:02:19.720> cost<00:02:20.020> just<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.470> one

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
black although it may cost just the one

four minutes 35 flying that's pretty

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.630 
four minutes 35 flying that's pretty
good<00:03:37.180> right<00:03:37.239> there<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.989> then<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.920> what<00:03:39.430> we

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
good right there and then the what we

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.759 
good right there and then the what we
call<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:39.850> propaganda<00:03:40.630> effect<00:03:41.170> that<00:03:41.470> where<00:03:41.680> they

remember<00:03:47.260> having<00:03:47.380> seen<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:48.010> second<00:03:48.580> ability

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
remember having seen that second ability

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.160 
remember having seen that second ability
the<00:03:49.000> other<00:03:49.150> version<00:03:49.300> of<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.660> on<00:03:49.750> car<00:03:49.989> before

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
the other version of it on car before

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.070 
the other version of it on car before
but<00:03:51.010> just<00:03:51.310> then<00:03:51.880> having<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.239> pay<00:03:52.450> 12<00:03:52.780> attack

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
but just then having to pay 12 attack

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.680 
but just then having to pay 12 attack
that<00:03:53.320> shuts<00:03:53.620> down<00:03:53.830> a<00:03:54.100> lot<00:03:54.670> of<00:03:54.700> aggro<00:03:55.150> decks<00:03:55.420> or

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
that shuts down a lot of aggro decks or

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.270 
that shuts down a lot of aggro decks or
at<00:03:55.750> least<00:03:55.930> shuts<00:03:56.140> down<00:03:56.290> their<00:03:56.470> combat<00:03:56.980> tricks

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
at least shuts down their combat tricks

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.540 
at least shuts down their combat tricks
even<00:03:57.550> if<00:03:57.640> they<00:03:57.760> do<00:03:57.820> get

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
even if they do get

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.280 
even if they do get
with<00:03:58.640> everything<00:03:58.850> so<00:03:59.270> all<00:03:59.510> things<00:04:00.080> considered

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
with everything so all things considered

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.520 
with everything so all things considered
I<00:04:00.860> do<00:04:00.920> really<00:04:01.730> like<00:04:02.150> this<00:04:02.450> car<00:04:02.750> although<00:04:03.320> I

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
I do really like this car although I

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.870 
I do really like this car although I
think<00:04:03.980> maybe<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.490> know<00:04:04.580> we<00:04:04.670> were<00:04:04.760> talking

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
think maybe you know we were talking

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.280 
think maybe you know we were talking
about<00:04:05.000> mono<00:04:05.270> white<00:04:05.480> soldiers<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.050> other<00:04:06.170> day

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
about mono white soldiers the other day

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.290 
about mono white soldiers the other day
this<00:04:06.440> week<00:04:06.500> it's<00:04:06.800> sideboard<00:04:07.250> card<00:04:07.490> it's<00:04:08.120> other

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
this week it's sideboard card it's other

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.020 
this week it's sideboard card it's other
aggro<00:04:08.780> whatever<00:04:09.140> but<00:04:09.380> I<00:04:09.650> do<00:04:10.100> other<00:04:10.670> than<00:04:10.940> that

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
aggro whatever but I do other than that

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.760 
aggro whatever but I do other than that
I<00:04:11.180> mean<00:04:11.390> that<00:04:11.510> that's<00:04:11.840> pretty<00:04:12.170> narrow<00:04:12.410> but<00:04:12.740> I

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
I mean that that's pretty narrow but I

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.200 
I mean that that's pretty narrow but I
do<00:04:12.920> other<00:04:13.160> than<00:04:13.340> that<00:04:13.430> thing<00:04:13.730> that<00:04:13.760> has

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
do other than that thing that has

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.150 
do other than that thing that has
applications<00:04:15.050> it<00:04:15.530> all<00:04:15.680> depends<00:04:16.040> on<00:04:16.100> the

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
applications it all depends on the

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.620 
applications it all depends on the
strength<00:04:16.400> of<00:04:16.580> mono<00:04:16.790> white<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:17.360> we're<00:04:17.510> not

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
strength of mono white and we're not

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.630 
strength of mono white and we're not
really<00:04:17.989> convinced<00:04:18.440> on<00:04:18.739> that<00:04:18.950> right<00:04:19.100> now<00:04:19.130> so

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
really convinced on that right now so

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.600 
really convinced on that right now so
all<00:04:19.910> together<00:04:20.450> I<00:04:20.750> think<00:04:20.870> it's<00:04:21.370> obviously<00:04:22.370> a

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
all together I think it's obviously a

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.150 
all together I think it's obviously a
really<00:04:22.790> interesting<00:04:23.090> card<00:04:23.510> but<00:04:24.010> kind<00:04:25.010> of<00:04:25.070> a

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
really interesting card but kind of a

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.950 
really interesting card but kind of a
degree<00:04:25.550> of<00:04:25.670> separation<00:04:26.390> we're<00:04:26.540> not<00:04:26.720> really

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
degree of separation we're not really

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.440 
degree of separation we're not really
sure<00:04:27.080> it's<00:04:27.800> going<00:04:27.980> to<00:04:28.040> be<00:04:28.160> really<00:04:28.940> good<00:04:29.060> or

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
sure it's going to be really good or

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.890 
sure it's going to be really good or
just<00:04:30.190> playable<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.940> know<00:04:32.090> so<00:04:32.600> let<00:04:32.720> me<00:04:32.810> know

here<00:04:35.090> because<00:04:35.480> I<00:04:35.690> think<00:04:35.750> a<00:04:35.900> couple<00:04:35.930> of<00:04:36.230> them

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
here because I think a couple of them

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.170 
here because I think a couple of them
are<00:04:36.440> really<00:04:36.830> interesting<00:04:37.250> if<00:04:37.340> not<00:04:37.550> three<00:04:38.090> or

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
are really interesting if not three or

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.470 
are really interesting if not three or
four<00:04:38.420> of<00:04:38.570> them<00:04:38.780> honestly<00:04:39.320> so<00:04:39.920> I<00:04:40.310> like<00:04:41.180> them<00:04:41.330> I

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
four of them honestly so I like them I

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.210 
four of them honestly so I like them I
