hatton's comeback fight I've already did
a<00:00:18.600> video<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:20.550> proposed<00:00:21.090> fight<00:00:21.510> he<00:00:21.660> had

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
a video on the proposed fight he had

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.679 
a video on the proposed fight he had
with<00:00:22.170> Michael<00:00:22.769> Katsidis<00:00:23.449> obviously<00:00:24.449> that's

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
with Michael Katsidis obviously that's

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.920 
with Michael Katsidis obviously that's
now<00:00:24.900> off<00:00:25.109> because<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.039> fighting<00:00:26.310> go<00:00:26.550> through

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
now off because I fighting go through

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.060 
now off because I fighting go through
but<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.990> think<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.410> probably<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.890> better

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
but I think this is probably a better

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.930 
but I think this is probably a better
fight<00:00:29.369> for<00:00:29.699> Ricky<00:00:30.029> Hatton<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.750> mean

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
fight for Ricky Hatton really I mean

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.360 
fight for Ricky Hatton really I mean
Senchenko<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> proper<00:00:33.750> welterweight<00:00:34.370> which

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
Senchenko is a proper welterweight which

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.830 
Senchenko is a proper welterweight which
is<00:00:35.520> where<00:00:35.730> Ricky<00:00:36.120> Hatton<00:00:36.450> will<00:00:36.570> now<00:00:36.690> be

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
is where Ricky Hatton will now be

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.709 
is where Ricky Hatton will now be
campaigning<00:00:37.879> Cassidy's<00:00:38.879> wasn't<00:00:39.329> although<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
campaigning Cassidy's wasn't although I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.450 
campaigning Cassidy's wasn't although I
thought<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.260> Casa<00:00:40.530> despite<00:00:41.010> would<00:00:41.160> be<00:00:41.250> more

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
thought the Casa despite would be more

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.310 
thought the Casa despite would be more
exciting<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:42.059> don't<00:00:42.300> think<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.780> fight<00:00:43.050> is

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
exciting I don't think this fight is

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.819 
exciting I don't think this fight is
going<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:44.070> fireworks<00:00:44.550> at<00:00:44.940> all<00:00:45.710> you<00:00:46.710> know

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
going to have fireworks at all you know

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.590 
going to have fireworks at all you know
because<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.520> clash<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.000> styles<00:00:48.239> are

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
because of the clash of styles are

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.470 
because of the clash of styles are
totally<00:00:48.899> different<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:50.640> other<00:00:50.820> fight<00:00:51.180> that

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
totally different the other fight that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.130 
totally different the other fight that
was<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> cards<00:00:52.230> was<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.460> against<00:00:54.210> love<00:00:54.930> on

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
was on the cards was one against love on

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.420 
was on the cards was one against love on
a<00:00:55.170> dowel<00:00:55.530> which<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.760> think<00:00:57.420> at<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:58.829> time<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.070> said

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
a dowel which I think at the time I said

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.560 
a dowel which I think at the time I said
that<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> thought<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.030> would<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> better

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that I thought it would be a better

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.569 
that I thought it would be a better
fight<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.140> Ricky<00:01:01.379> Hatton<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.340> hindsight

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
fight for Ricky Hatton but in hindsight

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.690 
fight for Ricky Hatton but in hindsight
I<00:01:03.149> think<00:01:03.359> perhaps<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:03.960> because<00:01:04.460> love<00:01:05.460> not

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
I think perhaps not because love not

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.370 
I think perhaps not because love not

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
fight is he's guaranteed to go to the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.190 
fight is he's guaranteed to go to the
distance<00:01:13.530> because<00:01:13.920> he<00:01:14.430> never<00:01:14.549> gets<00:01:14.820> stopped

and<00:01:16.200> also<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:17.130> somebody<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.360> Glen<00:01:18.689> Johnson

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
have been Ricky Hatton's best option

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.249 
have been Ricky Hatton's best option
after<00:01:26.610> all<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.840> would<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.140> given

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
after all because that would have given

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.929 
after all because that would have given
in<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.770> form<00:01:29.549> 10<00:01:30.060> or<00:01:30.299> 12<00:01:30.600> rounds<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.350> whether

going to be and it would have been

after<00:01:38.790> four<00:01:39.119> years<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.930> might<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.380> too<00:01:40.829> much

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
after four years that might be too much

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.230 
after four years that might be too much
in<00:01:41.490> my<00:01:41.700> opinion<00:01:41.880> where<00:01:42.180> Senchenko<00:01:42.899> um<00:01:44.240> he's

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
in my opinion where Senchenko um he's

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.300 
in my opinion where Senchenko um he's
never<00:01:45.479> been<00:01:45.659> stopped<00:01:46.079> he's<00:01:46.439> only<00:01:46.619> lost<00:01:46.829> once<00:01:47.159> I

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
never been stopped he's only lost once I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.630 
never been stopped he's only lost once I
to<00:01:47.909> pull<00:01:48.270> maji<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:51.479> know<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.740> don't<00:01:53.399> know

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
to pull maji but you know I I don't know

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.679 
to pull maji but you know I I don't know
whether<00:01:54.710> he's<00:01:55.710> too<00:01:56.340> good<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:57.030> not<00:01:57.149> be<00:01:57.329> stopped

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
whether he's too good to not be stopped

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.870 
whether he's too good to not be stopped
I<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.350> he<00:01:58.469> probably<00:01:58.680> isn't<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.520> think<00:01:59.820> he

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
I think he probably isn't I think he

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.359 
I think he probably isn't I think he
probably<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.540> stopped<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.530> also<00:02:02.070> don't

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
probably can be stopped I also don't

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.969 
probably can be stopped I also don't
think<00:02:02.549> he's<00:02:03.180> an<00:02:03.360> elite<00:02:03.630> fighter<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.409> think<00:02:04.860> he

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
think he's an elite fighter I think he

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.500 
think he's an elite fighter I think he
was<00:02:05.040> very<00:02:05.189> fortunate<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.240> get

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
was very fortunate to get

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.140 
was very fortunate to get
wva<00:02:06.900> top<00:02:07.350> shot<00:02:07.680> which<00:02:08.010> he<00:02:08.160> won<00:02:08.369> against<00:02:08.970> you

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.150 
wva top shot which he won against you

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.630 
wva top shot which he won against you
know<00:02:09.270> another<00:02:09.860> sort<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.950> European<00:02:11.490> level

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
know another sort of European level

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.150 
know another sort of European level
class<00:02:12.090> fighter<00:02:12.420> he's<00:02:13.230> only<00:02:13.500> ever<00:02:13.860> fought

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
class fighter he's only ever fought

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.830 
class fighter he's only ever fought
European<00:02:14.730> level<00:02:14.880> fighters<00:02:15.420> he's<00:02:15.630> never

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
European level fighters he's never

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.920 
European level fighters he's never
fought<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.320> world<00:02:16.740> caliber<00:02:17.400> fighter<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.780> I

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
fought a world caliber fighter and I

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.630 
fought a world caliber fighter and I
think<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.740> great<00:02:19.950> fight<00:02:20.280> for<00:02:20.490> both

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
think this is a great fight for both

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.790 
think this is a great fight for both
guys<00:02:20.910> because<00:02:21.360> for<00:02:21.600> Senchenko<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> think<00:02:22.620> it's

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
guys because for Senchenko I think it's

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.830 
guys because for Senchenko I think it's
a<00:02:22.920> chance<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.280> cash<00:02:23.490> out<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.940> think<00:02:24.660> there's<00:02:24.780> a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
a chance to cash out I think there's a

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.240 
a chance to cash out I think there's a
chance<00:02:25.020> for<00:02:25.200> him<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.380> get<00:02:25.560> some<00:02:25.860> big<00:02:26.070> money

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
chance for him to get some big money

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.660 
chance for him to get some big money
against<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.090> big<00:02:27.360> name<00:02:27.600> in<00:02:28.200> what<00:02:29.130> could<00:02:29.370> be<00:02:29.520> his

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
against a big name in what could be his

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.830 
against a big name in what could be his
last<00:02:29.730> fight<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.360> know<00:02:30.480> because<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.780> don't

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
last fight you know because I don't

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.020 
last fight you know because I don't
think<00:02:31.050> he'll<00:02:31.350> get<00:02:31.710> anybody<00:02:32.250> as<00:02:32.400> big<00:02:32.610> as<00:02:32.730> Ricky

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
think he'll get anybody as big as Ricky

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.870 
think he'll get anybody as big as Ricky
Hatton<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:34.800> know<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:34.950> don't<00:02:35.220> see<00:02:35.460> any<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
Hatton you know I don't see any of the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.300 
Hatton you know I don't see any of the
big<00:02:36.060> while<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.420> wait<00:02:36.570> wanted<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.990> fight<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:37.410> not

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
big while to wait wanted to fight in not

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.710 
big while to wait wanted to fight in not
because<00:02:38.610> they're<00:02:38.820> avoiding<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:39.570> just

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
because they're avoiding in but just

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.000 
because they're avoiding in but just
because<00:02:39.840> he<00:02:40.080> doesn't<00:02:40.260> bring<00:02:40.500> anything<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
because he doesn't bring anything to the

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.780 
because he doesn't bring anything to the
table<00:02:41.070> really<00:02:41.490> so<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.000> think<00:02:42.480> sim<00:02:43.080> genco<00:02:43.790> might

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
table really so I think sim genco might

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.690 
table really so I think sim genco might
become<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.120> bit<00:02:45.330> relevant<00:02:45.780> after<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:46.200> bite<00:02:46.700> by

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
become a bit relevant after this bite by

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.900 
become a bit relevant after this bite by
the<00:02:47.760> expect<00:02:48.420> Ricky<00:02:48.780> Hatton<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.170> win<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.910> can't

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
the expect Ricky Hatton to win I can't

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.670 
the expect Ricky Hatton to win I can't
imagine<00:02:51.090> they<00:02:51.540> would<00:02:51.690> put<00:02:51.870> him<00:02:51.990> in<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
imagine they would put him in the in the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.510 
imagine they would put him in the in the
ring<00:02:52.980> with<00:02:53.010> someone<00:02:53.550> who<00:02:53.910> had<00:02:54.150> more<00:02:54.510> than<00:02:54.840> a

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
ring with someone who had more than a

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.000 
ring with someone who had more than a
forty<00:02:56.520> percent<00:02:56.760> chance<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.240> peeking<00:02:57.570> in<00:02:57.750> and

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
forty percent chance and peeking in and

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.830 
forty percent chance and peeking in and
which<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.310> know<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.820> expect<00:03:00.180> most<00:03:00.420> fans<00:03:00.660> would

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
which you know I expect most fans would

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.530 
which you know I expect most fans would
think<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.260> mean<00:03:01.440> why<00:03:02.280> him<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.209> ring<00:03:03.390> to

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
think I mean why him in the ring to

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.960 
think I mean why him in the ring to
somebody<00:03:03.959> who<00:03:04.380> got<00:03:04.920> fifty<00:03:05.400> percent<00:03:05.610> chance<00:03:05.820> of

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
somebody who got fifty percent chance of

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.240 
somebody who got fifty percent chance of
beating<00:03:06.120> him<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.570> thought<00:03:07.560> Michael<00:03:08.070> Katsidis

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
beating him I thought Michael Katsidis

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.160 
beating him I thought Michael Katsidis
would<00:03:08.760> have<00:03:08.850> been<00:03:09.000> too<00:03:09.180> small<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.900> probably

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
would have been too small and probably

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.870 
would have been too small and probably
to<00:03:10.380> run<00:03:10.709> saw<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:12.290> battle<00:03:13.290> worn<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:14.670> think

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
to run saw a battle worn and I think

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.580 
to run saw a battle worn and I think
it's<00:03:15.060> insane<00:03:15.480> Cove<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.989> probably<00:03:16.260> just<00:03:16.410> not

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
it's insane Cove is probably just not

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.860 
it's insane Cove is probably just not
good<00:03:16.860> enough<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.340> someone<00:03:18.239> might<00:03:18.360> have<00:03:18.540> more

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
good enough and someone might have more

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.470 
good enough and someone might have more
natal<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.230> used<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.830> losing<00:03:20.120> but<00:03:21.120> he<00:03:21.330> would

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
natal is used to losing but he would

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.229 
natal is used to losing but he would
give<00:03:21.720> them<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.370> compared<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.489> fight<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:23.970> I

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
give them a compared to fight so I

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.030 
give them a compared to fight so I
thought<00:03:24.840> those<00:03:25.019> three<00:03:25.380> fights<00:03:25.650> which<00:03:25.920> were

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
thought those three fights which were

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.630 
thought those three fights which were
lined<00:03:26.250> up<00:03:26.489> were<00:03:27.090> all<00:03:27.450> really<00:03:28.050> good<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:29.430> they

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
lined up were all really good and they

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.699 
lined up were all really good and they
sell<00:03:29.850> for<00:03:30.090> this<00:03:30.239> one<00:03:30.390> so<00:03:30.420> anyway<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:30.810> think<00:03:31.380> it's

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
sell for this one so anyway I think it's

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.770 
sell for this one so anyway I think it's
a<00:03:31.980> good<00:03:32.100> fight<00:03:32.400> for<00:03:32.820> both<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.269> think<00:03:33.570> Ricky

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
a good fight for both I think Ricky

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.860 
a good fight for both I think Ricky
Hatton<00:03:34.140> will<00:03:34.350> probably<00:03:34.800> win<00:03:35.120> probably<00:03:36.120> via<00:03:36.420> a

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
Hatton will probably win probably via a

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.040 
Hatton will probably win probably via a
late<00:03:37.620> stoppage<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.400> would<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.180> wouldn't<00:03:39.690> be

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
late stoppage I would I wouldn't be

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.690 
late stoppage I would I wouldn't be
surprised<00:03:40.410> if<00:03:40.560> he<00:03:40.680> goes<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:41.040> distance<00:03:41.160> at<00:03:41.580> all

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
surprised if he goes the distance at all

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.400 
surprised if he goes the distance at all
because<00:03:41.880> his<00:03:42.300> first<00:03:42.540> bike<00:03:42.690> back<00:03:42.930> after<00:03:43.230> four

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
because his first bike back after four

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.490 
because his first bike back after four
years<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.860> Senchenko<00:03:44.820> that<00:03:45.030> has<00:03:45.209> over<00:03:45.840> 200

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
years and Senchenko that has over 200

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.920 
years and Senchenko that has over 200
rounds<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:46.980> his<00:03:47.100> name<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.550> you<00:03:47.790> know<00:03:48.420> he's<00:03:48.750> been

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
rounds to his name so you know he's been

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.590 
rounds to his name so you know he's been
to<00:03:49.110> under<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:49.590> albeit<00:03:50.160> against<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.970> mediocre

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
to under and albeit against a mediocre

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.050 
to under and albeit against a mediocre

Hatton lost his sky TV deal so I do

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
there again which i think is a bit silly

himself to be one of the best promoters
in<00:05:09.470> Britain<00:05:09.710> so<00:05:10.120> you<00:05:11.120> know<00:05:11.300> if<00:05:11.510> it<00:05:11.630> is<00:05:11.780> to

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
in Britain so you know if it is to

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.040 
in Britain so you know if it is to

advertise himself again to the viewing
public<00:05:15.320> I<00:05:15.830> think<00:05:16.550> that's<00:05:16.700> a<00:05:16.790> shame<00:05:16.970> because

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
public I think that's a shame because

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.850 
public I think that's a shame because
the<00:05:17.570> thing<00:05:17.840> you<00:05:17.960> need<00:05:18.110> to<00:05:18.139> do<00:05:18.350> really<00:05:18.530> um

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
the thing you need to do really um

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.190 
the thing you need to do really um
anyway<00:05:19.490> I<00:05:19.729> don't<00:05:20.030> think<00:05:20.630> he's<00:05:20.780> going<00:05:20.960> to<00:05:21.050> do

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
anyway I don't think he's going to do

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.770 
anyway I don't think he's going to do
much<00:05:21.440> with<00:05:21.860> his<00:05:21.979> comeback<00:05:22.370> but<00:05:23.030> you<00:05:23.419> know<00:05:23.540> as

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
much with his comeback but you know as

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.510 
much with his comeback but you know as
long<00:05:23.960> as<00:05:24.110> he's<00:05:24.229> fighting<00:05:24.560> guys<00:05:24.710> like<00:05:25.100> Nadal

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
long as he's fighting guys like Nadal

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.370 
long as he's fighting guys like Nadal
and<00:05:25.760> senchenko<00:05:26.450> and<00:05:26.540> all<00:05:26.600> that<00:05:26.780> it<00:05:27.080> shouldn't

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
and senchenko and all that it shouldn't

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.500 
and senchenko and all that it shouldn't
be<00:05:27.470> any<00:05:27.500> trouble<00:05:27.950> because<00:05:28.520> they're<00:05:29.060> not<00:05:29.180> elite

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
be any trouble because they're not elite

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.550 
be any trouble because they're not elite
fighters<00:05:29.540> and<00:05:30.200> so<00:05:30.979> those<00:05:31.100> muscles
