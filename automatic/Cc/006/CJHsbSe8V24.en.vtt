00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
okay so I'm mostly finished my

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.039 
okay so I'm mostly finished my
Frankenstein<00:00:02.820> project<00:00:03.449> I<00:00:03.540> hope<00:00:03.720> you<00:00:03.870> can

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
Frankenstein project I hope you can

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.889 
Frankenstein project I hope you can
actually<00:00:04.200> hear<00:00:05.160> me<00:00:05.339> over<00:00:05.460> top<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:06.150> but<00:00:06.779> I've

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
actually hear me over top of it but I've

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.669 
actually hear me over top of it but I've
got<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.710> cool<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.400> Boreas<00:00:09.150> tech<00:00:09.809> coolers<00:00:10.380> here

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
got to cool it Boreas tech coolers here

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.249 
got to cool it Boreas tech coolers here
so<00:00:10.920> these<00:00:11.040> are<00:00:11.219> using<00:00:11.400> Peltier's<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.870> chill

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
so these are using Peltier's to chill

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.560 
so these are using Peltier's to chill
the<00:00:13.440> water<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.040> then<00:00:14.580> I'm<00:00:14.820> using<00:00:15.089> some

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
the water and then I'm using some

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.300 
the water and then I'm using some
standard<00:00:16.049> water<00:00:16.230> cooling<00:00:16.710> stuff<00:00:16.949> hooked<00:00:17.100> up

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
standard water cooling stuff hooked up

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.609 
standard water cooling stuff hooked up
to<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.760> order<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.029> actually<00:00:18.330> get<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.410> most

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
to it in order to actually get the most

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.540 
to it in order to actually get the most
out<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.400> I've<00:00:20.520> got<00:00:21.230> an<00:00:22.230> MC<00:00:22.650> res<00:00:22.830> micro

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
out of it so I've got an MC res micro

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.420 
out of it so I've got an MC res micro

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
Swift tech MTP 350 I've got it connected

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.269 
Swift tech MTP 350 I've got it connected
via<00:00:26.910> some<00:00:27.240> quick<00:00:27.449> disconnects<00:00:27.990> up<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> swift

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279

via some quick disconnects up to a swift
Tec<00:00:29.519> Apogee<00:00:30.269> okay<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.650> quite<00:00:31.920> quite

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
Tec Apogee okay so this is quite quite

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.979 
Tec Apogee okay so this is quite quite
chilly<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.059> touch<00:00:33.270> I've<00:00:33.510> got<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> fan

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
chilly to the touch I've got a fan

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.080 
chilly to the touch I've got a fan
blowing<00:00:34.230> over<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.710> CPU<00:00:35.130> socket<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.760> make<00:00:35.940> it

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
blowing over the CPU socket to make it

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.540 
blowing over the CPU socket to make it
so<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.899> don't<00:00:37.410> get<00:00:37.530> any<00:00:37.590> condensation

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
so that I don't get any condensation

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.610 
so that I don't get any condensation
problems<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.390> water<00:00:39.840> dripping<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.469> my

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
problems and water dripping on my

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.770 
problems and water dripping on my
motherboard<00:00:40.950> here<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.969> way<00:00:42.149> I've<00:00:42.329> actually

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
motherboard here the way I've actually

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.799 
motherboard here the way I've actually
powered<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:44.239> totally<00:00:45.239> don't<00:00:45.450> do<00:00:45.629> this

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
powered it is just totally don't do this

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.250 
powered it is just totally don't do this
at<00:00:45.989> home<00:00:46.020> kids<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:46.950> I've<00:00:47.129> actually<00:00:47.309> taken<00:00:48.260> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
at home kids but I've actually taken the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.619 
at home kids but I've actually taken the
two<00:00:49.469> power<00:00:49.739> connectors<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.670> then<00:00:51.180> I've<00:00:51.300> used

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
two power connectors and then I've used

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
two power connectors and then I've used
I'm<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.469> kind<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.770> jam<00:00:53.070> them<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:53.670> this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
I'm just kind of jam them in there this

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.729 
I'm just kind of jam them in there this
is<00:00:54.000> an<00:00:54.120> 8<00:00:54.270> pin<00:00:54.480> connector<00:00:54.899> he's<00:00:55.079> even<00:00:55.379> actually

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
is an 8 pin connector he's even actually

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.250 
is an 8 pin connector he's even actually
get<00:00:55.890> quite<00:00:56.430> warm<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.120> touch<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:57.989> why<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
get quite warm to the touch that's why I

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.049 
get quite warm to the touch that's why I
have<00:00:58.530> them<00:00:58.739> positioned<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:59.399> around<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.850> fan

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
have them positioned all around the fan

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.900 
have them positioned all around the fan
here<00:01:00.390> every<00:01:01.050> one<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.230> these<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:02.219> Boris's

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
here every one of these the the Boris's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.670 
here every one of these the the Boris's
themselves<00:01:03.660> are<00:01:03.780> actually<00:01:03.930> pulling<00:01:04.589> about

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
themselves are actually pulling about

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.330 
themselves are actually pulling about
400<00:01:05.489> watts<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> Peltier's<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.070> I'm

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
400 watts just for the Peltier's so I'm

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670 
400 watts just for the Peltier's so I'm
using<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.880> 1200<00:01:09.479> watt<00:01:09.630> power<00:01:09.869> supply<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.409> cool

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
using a 1200 watt power supply to cool

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.840 
using a 1200 watt power supply to cool
this<00:01:10.830> whole<00:01:11.040> thing<00:01:11.220> anyway<00:01:11.490> I've<00:01:11.580> got<00:01:11.729> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
this whole thing anyway I've got it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.750 
this whole thing anyway I've got it
hooked<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.180> via<00:01:12.630> an<00:01:13.320> 8<00:01:13.619> pin<00:01:13.860> power<00:01:14.130> connectors

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
hooked up via an 8 pin power connectors

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.510 
hooked up via an 8 pin power connectors
then<00:01:15.270> I've<00:01:15.450> soldered<00:01:16.409> together<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.310> wrapped

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
then I've soldered together and wrapped

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.929 
then I've soldered together and wrapped
up<00:01:17.700> some<00:01:17.939> wires<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.450> then<00:01:19.700> Frankenstein<00:01:20.700> that

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
up some wires and then Frankenstein that

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.300 
up some wires and then Frankenstein that
together<00:01:21.270> I've<00:01:21.450> got<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.810> cool<00:01:22.770> ik<00:01:22.920> control

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
together I've got this cool ik control

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.649 
together I've got this cool ik control
center<00:01:23.640> hooked<00:01:23.850> up<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.450> can

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
center hooked up just so that I can

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.270 
center hooked up just so that I can
monitor<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.140> cool<00:01:25.409> intents<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.100> don't

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
monitor the cool intents but I don't

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.749 
monitor the cool intents but I don't
think<00:01:26.490> they're<00:01:26.670> right<00:01:26.850> anyway<00:01:27.240> um<00:01:28.520> let<00:01:29.520> me<00:01:29.610> see

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
think they're right anyway um let me see

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.640 
think they're right anyway um let me see
how<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.180> actually<00:01:30.329> show<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.560> know

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
how I can actually show you the you know

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.980 
how I can actually show you the you know
what<00:01:31.770> I'll<00:01:31.950> run<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> quick<00:01:32.640> benchmark<00:01:33.540> here<00:01:33.780> so

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
what I'll run a quick benchmark here so

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.859 
what I'll run a quick benchmark here so
I'm<00:01:34.110> running<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.189> Fen<00:01:35.400> em<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.729> 10<00:01:36.119> 9dt

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
I'm running the the Fen em to 10 9dt

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.420 
I'm running the the Fen em to 10 9dt
and<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.890> don't<00:01:37.950> actually<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.990> cpu-z<00:01:40.280> open<00:01:41.280> at

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and I don't actually have cpu-z open at

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.399 
and I don't actually have cpu-z open at
the<00:01:41.610> moment<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.240> I'll<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.420> fire<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.200> right

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
the moment but I'll just fire that right

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.550 
the moment but I'll just fire that right
up<00:01:43.590> here<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.329> look<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.259> I've<00:01:46.409> only

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
up here you can have a look so I've only

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.190 
up here you can have a look so I've only
got<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.979> running<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:47.399> 4.2<00:01:48.240> gigahertz<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
got it running at 4.2 gigahertz for the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.469 
got it running at 4.2 gigahertz for the
time<00:01:49.439> being<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.880> haven't<00:01:51.180> had<00:01:51.329> any

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
time being and I haven't had any

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.230 
time being and I haven't had any
problems<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.229> prime95<00:01:52.710> yet<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.000> I'm

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
problems of prime95 yet so I'm

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.910 
problems of prime95 yet so I'm
definitely<00:01:54.930> going<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> try<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.560> push<00:01:55.740> it

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
definitely going to try and push it

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.069 
definitely going to try and push it
further<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:56.969> think<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> most<00:01:57.659> impressive

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
further but I think the most impressive

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.630 
further but I think the most impressive
part<00:01:58.439> about<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.799> actually<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.310> here<00:01:59.460> let's

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
part about this actually is here let's

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880 
part about this actually is here let's
stop<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.969> torture<00:02:00.210> test<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.840> open<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.590> core

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
stop the torture test and open up core

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.860 
stop the torture test and open up core
temp<00:02:02.159> check<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.490> out<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
temp check this out the

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.750 
temp check this out the
cpu<00:02:04.350> temps<00:02:04.860> at<00:02:05.100> idle<00:02:05.850> oh<00:02:07.310> well<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.430> shouldn't

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
cpu temps at idle oh well that shouldn't

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.050 
cpu temps at idle oh well that shouldn't
be<00:02:08.820> right<00:02:09.110> yeah<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.320> going<00:02:10.530> down<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:11.130> think

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
be right yeah it's going down I think

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.490 
be right yeah it's going down I think
it's<00:02:12.300> actually<00:02:12.420> going<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.840> take<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.020> while<00:02:13.290> to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
it's actually going to take a while to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.890 
it's actually going to take a while to
go<00:02:13.650> back<00:02:13.860> down<00:02:14.100> after<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.520> start<00:02:14.820> core<00:02:15.060> temp<00:02:15.300> but

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
go back down after I start core temp but

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.350 
go back down after I start core temp but
oh<00:02:15.930> yeah<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.350> can<00:02:16.620> see<00:02:16.800> here<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.460> low<00:02:17.670> temp<00:02:18.060> so

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
oh yeah you can see here the low temp so

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.120 
oh yeah you can see here the low temp so
the<00:02:18.480> lowest<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:19.020> been<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.650> yeah<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:20.040> going

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
the lowest it's been and yeah it's going

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.470 
the lowest it's been and yeah it's going
to<00:02:20.220> creep<00:02:20.400> its<00:02:20.550> way<00:02:20.670> back<00:02:20.820> down<00:02:21.060> there<00:02:21.270> now<00:02:21.450> I

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
to creep its way back down there now I

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.630 
to creep its way back down there now I
think<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.960> takes<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.200> while<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.380> update<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.220> zero

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
think it takes a while to update is zero

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.580 
think it takes a while to update is zero
degrees<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.390> actually<00:02:24.540> idles<00:02:25.170> at<00:02:25.350> zero

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
degrees so it actually idles at zero

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.130 
degrees so it actually idles at zero
degrees<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.310> then<00:02:27.060> as<00:02:27.240> soon<00:02:27.390> as<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.660> fire<00:02:27.900> up

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
degrees and then as soon as I fire up

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.920 
degrees and then as soon as I fire up
the<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.800> torture<00:02:29.160> test<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:30.030> jumps<00:02:30.540> up<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.900> a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
the the torture test it jumps up to a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.280 
the the torture test it jumps up to a
whopping<00:02:33.980> blue<00:02:34.980> fifteen<00:02:35.670> degrees<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:37.170> that's

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
whopping blue fifteen degrees so that's

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.860 
whopping blue fifteen degrees so that's
at<00:02:37.530> 4.2<00:02:38.340> gigahertz<00:02:38.670> under<00:02:39.120> load<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.570> can<00:02:39.720> see

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
at 4.2 gigahertz under load you can see

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.570 
at 4.2 gigahertz under load you can see
the<00:02:40.020> actual<00:02:40.470> high<00:02:40.710> once<00:02:41.070> it's<00:02:41.220> been<00:02:41.370> running

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
the actual high once it's been running

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.120 
the actual high once it's been running
for<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.880> while<00:02:42.060> I've<00:02:42.420> had<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.780> running<00:02:42.960> is<00:02:43.200> 22

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
for a while I've had it running is 22

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.220 
for a while I've had it running is 22
degrees<00:02:44.240> so<00:02:45.240> that's<00:02:45.360> running<00:02:45.780> with<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.050> two

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
degrees so that's running with the two

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.970 
degrees so that's running with the two
Boris's<00:02:46.980> on<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.570> swift<00:02:48.570> tech<00:02:48.780> Apogee<00:02:49.470> block<00:02:49.830> so

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
Boris's on a swift tech Apogee block so

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.260 
Boris's on a swift tech Apogee block so
that's<00:02:50.160> an<00:02:50.280> ancient<00:02:50.460> Apogee<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.150> is

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
that's an ancient Apogee this is

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.540 
that's an ancient Apogee this is
actually<00:02:51.660> my<00:02:51.810> first<00:02:52.080> waterblock<00:02:52.620> ever<00:02:53.010> it

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
actually my first waterblock ever it

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.270 
actually my first waterblock ever it
just<00:02:53.850> has<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> new<00:02:54.600> mounting<00:02:55.380> plate<00:02:55.620> on<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.980> so

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
just has a new mounting plate on it so

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.520 
just has a new mounting plate on it so
it's<00:02:56.430> been<00:02:56.940> updated<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.930> little<00:02:58.110> bit<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.290> also

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
it's been updated a little bit I also

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.350 
it's been updated a little bit I also
put<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> bow<00:02:59.310> on<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.760> as<00:02:59.880> well

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
put a bow on it as well

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.120 
put a bow on it as well
here<00:03:00.630> into<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.080> Apogee<00:03:01.590> you'll<00:03:01.770> know<00:03:01.890> what<00:03:02.100> a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
here into the Apogee you'll know what a

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.000 
here into the Apogee you'll know what a
bow<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.750> anyway<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:03.780> guess<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.470> pretty

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
bow is anyway I guess that that pretty

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.620 
bow is anyway I guess that that pretty
much<00:03:05.190> covers<00:03:05.640> my<00:03:05.790> little<00:03:06.060> Frankenstein

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
much covers my little Frankenstein

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.180 
much covers my little Frankenstein
project<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.350> I'm<00:03:07.440> gonna<00:03:07.560> give<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.920> some

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
project and I'm gonna give you some

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.130 
project and I'm gonna give you some
overclocking<00:03:08.910> updates<00:03:09.270> as<00:03:09.480> soon<00:03:09.540> as<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.930> have

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
overclocking updates as soon as I have

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.350 
overclocking updates as soon as I have
some<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.860> can<00:03:11.010> see<00:03:11.220> how<00:03:11.370> high<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:11.640> can<00:03:11.880> push

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
some you can see how high I can push

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.300 
some you can see how high I can push
this<00:03:14.090> 10.10<00:03:15.090> oh<00:03:15.300> it's<00:03:15.750> calling<00:03:16.020> it<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.200> 1095<00:03:17.010> T

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
this 10.10 oh it's calling it a 1095 T

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.280 
this 10.10 oh it's calling it a 1095 T
that's<00:03:18.180> interesting<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.810> wonder<00:03:18.930> if<00:03:19.110> that's

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
that's interesting I wonder if that's

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.180 
that's interesting I wonder if that's
some<00:03:19.560> kind<00:03:19.830> of<00:03:20.300> omen<00:03:21.360> anyway<00:03:22.050> it's<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.290> 10-9<00:03:22.770> DT

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
some kind of omen anyway it's a 10-9 DT

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.840 
some kind of omen anyway it's a 10-9 DT
let's<00:03:23.520> see<00:03:23.640> how<00:03:23.850> high<00:03:24.060> we<00:03:24.270> can<00:03:24.450> push<00:03:24.690> it
