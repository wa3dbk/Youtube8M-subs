hello everybody this is mr. DSi review

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.330 
hello everybody this is mr. DSi review
today<00:00:07.379> I'm<00:00:07.470> bringing<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:07.919> another<00:00:08.040> review

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
today I'm bringing you another review

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.660 
today I'm bringing you another review
this<00:00:09.150> one<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.200> only<00:00:10.860> art<00:00:11.099> style<00:00:11.400> game<00:00:11.639> I

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
this one is of the only art style game I

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.220 
this one is of the only art style game I
have<00:00:11.940> not<00:00:12.179> reviewed<00:00:12.540> yet<00:00:12.750> unless<00:00:13.080> I'm

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
have not reviewed yet unless I'm

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.200 
have not reviewed yet unless I'm
mistaken<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.969> art<00:00:15.420> styles<00:00:15.839> then<00:00:16.080> gauge

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
mistaken and it is art styles then gauge

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.429 
mistaken and it is art styles then gauge
Zen<00:00:18.210> gauge<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.600> also<00:00:18.960> one<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.260> more

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
Zen gauge is also one of the more

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.200 
Zen gauge is also one of the more
challenging<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:20.250> art<00:00:20.400> style<00:00:20.640> games<00:00:20.970> out

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
challenging the art style games out

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.710 
challenging the art style games out
there<00:00:21.769> it<00:00:22.769> has<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> whole<00:00:23.430> bunch<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:24.090> levels<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
there it has a whole bunch of levels and

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.009 
there it has a whole bunch of levels and
the<00:00:25.019> idea<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:26.000> that<00:00:27.000> there<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:27.330> these<00:00:27.420> tiles

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the idea is that there are these tiles

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.220 
the idea is that there are these tiles
and<00:00:28.320> these<00:00:28.560> cores<00:00:29.189> or<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:30.689> think<00:00:30.960> they're

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
and these cores or I think they're

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.840 
and these cores or I think they're
called<00:00:31.470> cells<00:00:32.250> yeah

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
called cells yeah

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.060 
called cells yeah
and<00:00:32.940> these<00:00:33.930> ball<00:00:34.320> things<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:34.800> are<00:00:34.920> called

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
and these ball things here are called

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.670 
and these ball things here are called
cores<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.910> slide<00:00:36.210> those<00:00:36.510> cells<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
cores and you slide those cells with the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.010 
cores and you slide those cells with the
stylus<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.239> make<00:00:39.420> them<00:00:39.629> match

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
stylus and you have to make them match

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.410 
stylus and you have to make them match
up<00:00:40.320> match<00:00:41.219> up<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> cores<00:00:43.969> so<00:00:44.969> first<00:00:45.239> you

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
up match up to the cores so first you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.690 
up match up to the cores so first you
start<00:00:45.450> out<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.620> guess<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.520> could<00:00:47.670> call

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
start out in this I guess you could call

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.910 
start out in this I guess you could call
it<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.000> world<00:00:48.350> sky<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:51.379> it's<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> first<00:00:52.739> level

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
it a world sky and it's the first level

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.740 
it a world sky and it's the first level
right<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.440> slide<00:00:55.739> these<00:00:56.750> to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
right here so you can slide these to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.319 
right here so you can slide these to
match<00:00:57.899> up<00:00:58.170> onto<00:00:58.559> these<00:00:58.969> cores<00:00:59.969> or

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
match up onto these cores or

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.570 
match up onto these cores or
right<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.930> course<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.850> then<00:01:03.110> like<00:01:04.110> so

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
right here of course and then like so

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.580 
right here of course and then like so
level<00:01:05.580> completed

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.560 

now<00:01:09.130> in<00:01:09.280> each<00:01:09.399> I<00:01:09.820> guess<00:01:10.860> level<00:01:12.030> stage<00:01:13.030> I<00:01:13.420> don't

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
now in each I guess level stage I don't

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.609 
now in each I guess level stage I don't
know<00:01:13.659> what<00:01:13.840> you'd<00:01:13.990> call<00:01:14.020> I'm<00:01:14.259> just<00:01:14.320> going<00:01:14.590> to

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
know what you'd call I'm just going to

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.440 
know what you'd call I'm just going to
call<00:01:14.770> it<00:01:14.890> a<00:01:14.950> world<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:16.930> beat<00:01:17.110> five<00:01:17.470> stages

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
call it a world if you beat five stages

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.990 
call it a world if you beat five stages
then<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:19.539> get<00:01:19.689> to<00:01:19.810> move<00:01:19.960> on<00:01:20.049> to<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.350> next<00:01:20.500> one

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
then you get to move on to the next one

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.789 
then you get to move on to the next one
now<00:01:22.000> orange<00:01:22.509> means<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:23.049> beat<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.350> under<00:01:23.680> the

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
now orange means you beat it under the

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.770 
now orange means you beat it under the
average<00:01:23.950> moves<00:01:24.670> which<00:01:25.000> is<00:01:25.149> pretty<00:01:25.360> much<00:01:25.479> like

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
average moves which is pretty much like

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.010 
average moves which is pretty much like
a<00:01:25.840> par<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.549> blue<00:01:27.549> means<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.210> did<00:01:28.390> not<00:01:28.420> get

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
a par and blue means you did not get

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.580 
a par and blue means you did not get
under<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.590> average<00:01:30.869> white<00:01:31.869> means<00:01:32.079> you<00:01:32.350> didn't

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
under the average white means you didn't

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.770 
under the average white means you didn't
complete<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:32.979> at<00:01:33.189> all<00:01:33.369> in<00:01:33.729> my<00:01:34.329> case<00:01:34.570> because

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
complete it at all in my case because

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.819 
complete it at all in my case because
you're<00:01:35.110> lazy<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:37.500> there<00:01:38.500> are<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.649> whole<00:01:38.799> bunch

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
you're lazy and there are a whole bunch

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.130 
you're lazy and there are a whole bunch
of<00:01:39.280> worlds<00:01:39.670> now<00:01:39.850> at<00:01:40.030> first<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:40.420> just<00:01:40.630> starts

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
of worlds now at first it just starts

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.889 
of worlds now at first it just starts
out<00:01:41.319> with<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.670> know<00:01:42.789> kind<00:01:43.330> of<00:01:43.390> simple<00:01:43.690> stuff

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
out with you know kind of simple stuff

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.050 
out with you know kind of simple stuff
and<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.170> introduces<00:01:44.830> having<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:45.880> deal<00:01:46.030> with

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
and it introduces having to deal with

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.559 
and it introduces having to deal with
more<00:01:46.509> like<00:01:47.049> different<00:01:47.470> colored<00:01:48.209> cells<00:01:49.209> and

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
more like different colored cells and

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:56.279 
more like different colored cells and
cores<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:53.069> here<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:55.420> brings<00:01:55.990> in

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
cores and then here it brings in

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.130 
cores and then here it brings in
unmovable<00:01:57.000> cells<00:01:58.000> see<00:01:58.420> these<00:01:58.599> these<00:01:58.810> are<00:01:58.990> like

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
unmovable cells see these these are like

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.210 
unmovable cells see these these are like
screwed<00:01:59.470> in<00:02:00.209> then<00:02:01.209> you<00:02:01.330> gotta<00:02:01.539> go<00:02:01.750> you<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:03.130> to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
screwed in then you gotta go you have to

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:10.139 
screwed in then you gotta go you have to
do<00:02:03.340> something<00:02:03.670> like<00:02:03.759> lit<00:02:04.030> like<00:02:04.330> this<00:02:09.149> well

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
do something like lit like this well

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.070 
do something like lit like this well
that<00:02:10.330> was<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.479> dumb<00:02:10.720> idea

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
that was a dumb idea

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.390 
that was a dumb idea
you<00:02:11.440> can<00:02:11.560> also<00:02:11.709> undo<00:02:12.160> moves<00:02:12.400> here<00:02:14.250> sounds<00:02:15.250> also

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
you can also undo moves here sounds also

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.800 
you can also undo moves here sounds also
a<00:02:15.549> dumb<00:02:15.730> idea<00:02:18.180> whatever<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.269> think<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.600> get<00:02:19.780> the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
a dumb idea whatever I think you get the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.310 
a dumb idea whatever I think you get the
idea

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
idea

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.490 
idea
um<00:02:21.420> you'd<00:02:22.420> have<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.660> do<00:02:22.750> something<00:02:23.109> like<00:02:23.230> that

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
um you'd have to do something like that

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.780 
um you'd have to do something like that
and<00:02:24.420> then<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.569> can<00:02:26.069> beat<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.190> level<00:02:27.459> because

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
and then you can beat the level because

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.960 
and then you can beat the level because
of<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.329> can't<00:02:28.569> move<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:29.049> just<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:30.190> like

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
of you can't move it just the like

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.710 
of you can't move it just the like
direct<00:02:31.690> way<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:33.030> then<00:02:34.030> later<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.569> get

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
direct way and then later you get

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.720 
direct way and then later you get
something<00:02:35.170> even<00:02:35.290> more<00:02:35.620> kind<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.250> complicated

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
something even more kind of complicated

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.870 
something even more kind of complicated
you<00:02:36.910> get<00:02:37.030> these<00:02:37.150> like<00:02:37.420> arrow<00:02:37.690> tiles

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.520 

that's<00:02:41.880> pretty<00:02:42.120> simple<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.570> basically<00:02:42.870> these

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
that's pretty simple and basically these

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.030 
that's pretty simple and basically these
gray<00:02:43.830> arrows<00:02:44.190> just<00:02:44.610> make<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.620> core<00:02:46.620> itself

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
gray arrows just make the core itself

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.070 
gray arrows just make the core itself
move<00:02:47.540> in<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.860> world<00:02:50.010> after<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.960> you<00:02:51.960> get

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
move in the world after that you get

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.130 
move in the world after that you get
something<00:02:52.470> similar<00:02:53.120> it's<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.510> same<00:02:54.720> idea

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
something similar it's the same idea

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.010 
something similar it's the same idea
except<00:02:56.070> there<00:02:56.280> this<00:02:56.670> time<00:02:56.910> they're<00:02:57.120> white<00:02:57.360> and

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
except there this time they're white and

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.080 
except there this time they're white and
what<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.380> means<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.430> once<00:02:59.850> they've

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
what that means is that once they've

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.620 
what that means is that once they've
been<00:03:00.300> used<00:03:00.570> they've<00:03:01.320> been<00:03:01.590> used<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:03.150> can't

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
been used they've been used you can't

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.150 
been used they've been used you can't
use<00:03:03.780> him<00:03:03.960> again<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.840> let's<00:03:07.440> see<00:03:07.680> here<00:03:07.950> so

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
use him again and let's see here so

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.550 
use him again and let's see here so
you'd<00:03:08.280> have<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.490> do<00:03:08.840> like<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.110> or<00:03:10.320> something

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
you'd have to do like this or something

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:19.160 
you'd have to do like this or something
and<00:03:14.120> there<00:03:15.120> we<00:03:15.240> go<00:03:15.390> like<00:03:16.020> so<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:18.660> this

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
and there we go like so and so this

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.540 
and there we go like so and so this
stuff<00:03:19.380> just<00:03:19.410> keeps<00:03:19.740> getting<00:03:20.130> more<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.460> more

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
stuff just keeps getting more and more

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.430 
stuff just keeps getting more and more
complicated<00:03:21.390> now<00:03:21.540> I've<00:03:21.750> seen<00:03:22.020> like<00:03:22.200> for

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
complicated now I've seen like for

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.800 
complicated now I've seen like for
example<00:03:22.500> IGN's<00:03:23.250> review<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.940> believe<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.750> or

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
example IGN's review and believe it or

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.270 
example IGN's review and believe it or
not<00:03:24.930> they<00:03:25.110> gave<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.410> kind<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.710> low<00:03:25.890> score

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
not they gave it a kind of low score

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.520 
not they gave it a kind of low score
because<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:26.940> was<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.210> a<00:03:27.390> slider<00:03:27.750> puzzle<00:03:28.290> and

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
because it was like a slider puzzle and

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.560 
because it was like a slider puzzle and
some<00:03:29.220> other<00:03:29.370> reviewers<00:03:29.730> -<00:03:29.970> actually<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.360> bunch

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
some other reviewers - actually a bunch

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.440 
some other reviewers - actually a bunch
of<00:03:30.720> reviews<00:03:31.050> gave<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.530> like<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> low<00:03:31.890> score<00:03:32.450> just

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
of reviews gave it like a low score just

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.230 
of reviews gave it like a low score just
because<00:03:33.720> they<00:03:33.840> didn't<00:03:34.110> like<00:03:34.200> slider<00:03:34.650> puzzles

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
because they didn't like slider puzzles

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.490 
because they didn't like slider puzzles
but<00:03:36.240> this<00:03:36.600> game<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:36.990> don't<00:03:37.140> like<00:03:37.260> slider

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
but this game I don't like slider

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.650 
but this game I don't like slider
puzzles<00:03:37.920> either<00:03:38.130> but<00:03:38.460> this<00:03:38.640> game<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.150> awesome

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
puzzles either but this game is awesome

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.290 
puzzles either but this game is awesome
I<00:03:40.320> mean<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:40.830> brilliant

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
I mean it is brilliant

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.970 
I mean it is brilliant
you're<00:03:42.750> really<00:03:42.930> gonna<00:03:43.140> have<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.380> think<00:03:43.680> but

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
you're really gonna have to think but

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.550 
you're really gonna have to think but
like<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.430> said<00:03:44.640> it's<00:03:44.850> brilliant<00:03:45.420> like<00:03:46.380> for

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
like I said it's brilliant like for

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.050 
like I said it's brilliant like for
example<00:03:46.620> here<00:03:47.250> you've<00:03:47.370> got<00:03:47.550> these<00:03:47.700> white

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
example here you've got these white

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.120 
example here you've got these white
cores<00:03:48.450> which<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.320> can<00:03:49.500> completely<00:03:49.890> get<00:03:50.070> rid

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
cores which you can completely get rid

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.440 
cores which you can completely get rid
of<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.610> later<00:03:50.790> you're<00:03:50.970> gonna<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.210> to<00:03:51.330> like

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
of and later you're gonna have to like

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.200 
of and later you're gonna have to like
push<00:03:51.750> cores<00:03:52.110> into<00:03:52.410> cores<00:03:52.830> to<00:03:53.700> get<00:03:53.850> them<00:03:54.030> onto

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
push cores into cores to get them onto

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.710 
push cores into cores to get them onto
the<00:03:54.480> cells<00:03:55.700> and<00:03:56.700> all<00:03:56.790> sorts<00:03:57.180> of<00:03:57.240> stuff<00:03:57.360> like

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
the cells and all sorts of stuff like

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.420 
the cells and all sorts of stuff like
blocks<00:03:58.110> and<00:03:58.440> stuff<00:03:58.650> or<00:03:58.980> bombs<00:03:59.490> and<00:04:00.740> as<00:04:01.740> far<00:04:02.280> as

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
blocks and stuff or bombs and as far as

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.070 
blocks and stuff or bombs and as far as
I<00:04:02.520> know<00:04:02.580> there<00:04:03.000> are<00:04:03.090> eight<00:04:03.240> worlds<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:03.840> don't

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
I know there are eight worlds I don't

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.590 
I know there are eight worlds I don't
think<00:04:04.230> there's<00:04:04.380> anything<00:04:04.620> beyond<00:04:05.100> gloom<00:04:05.850> but

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
think there's anything beyond gloom but

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.530 
think there's anything beyond gloom but
there<00:04:06.870> might<00:04:07.020> be<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:08.190> it's<00:04:08.340> nine<00:04:08.670> levels<00:04:08.910> per

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
there might be so it's nine levels per

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.840 
there might be so it's nine levels per
and<00:04:10.490> that<00:04:11.490> would<00:04:11.640> be<00:04:11.790> 72<00:04:12.980> levels<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.610> it's

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
and that would be 72 levels so it's

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.390 
and that would be 72 levels so it's
it'll<00:04:15.510> take<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.810> quite<00:04:15.990> a<00:04:16.049> while<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:17.280> go

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
it'll take you quite a while to go

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.950 
it'll take you quite a while to go
through<00:04:17.700> all<00:04:17.760> of<00:04:17.790> those<00:04:18.090> it's<00:04:18.540> got<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> lot<00:04:18.930> of

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960 
through all of those it's got a lot of

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.520 
through all of those it's got a lot of
playtime<00:04:19.620> um<00:04:20.780> you<00:04:21.780> could<00:04:21.900> probably<00:04:22.109> just<00:04:22.350> go

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
playtime um you could probably just go

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.680 
playtime um you could probably just go
and<00:04:22.740> beat<00:04:23.220> like<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.700> mean<00:04:23.910> beating<00:04:24.240> just<00:04:24.540> one

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
and beat like I mean beating just one

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.650 
and beat like I mean beating just one
world<00:04:24.930> is<00:04:25.260> pretty<00:04:25.500> easy<00:04:25.770> just<00:04:26.700> five<00:04:27.030> stages<00:04:27.330> if

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
world is pretty easy just five stages if

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.020 
world is pretty easy just five stages if
you're<00:04:27.750> gonna<00:04:27.930> be<00:04:28.110> kind<00:04:28.320> of<00:04:28.380> minimalistic<00:04:29.070> but

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
you're gonna be kind of minimalistic but

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.900 
you're gonna be kind of minimalistic but
um<00:04:30.920> beating<00:04:31.920> all<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.070> levels<00:04:32.460> it's<00:04:32.640> gonna<00:04:32.760> be

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
um beating all the levels it's gonna be

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.210 
um beating all the levels it's gonna be
tough<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.420> it's<00:04:34.140> definitely<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.800> good<00:04:34.830> game<00:04:35.190> I

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
tough and it's definitely a good game I

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.370 
tough and it's definitely a good game I
recommend<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.150> you're<00:04:36.690> gonna<00:04:36.870> have<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.140> think

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
recommend it you're gonna have to think

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.730 
recommend it you're gonna have to think
a<00:04:37.470> lot<00:04:37.620> it's<00:04:37.860> not<00:04:38.250> like<00:04:39.050> kind<00:04:40.050> of<00:04:40.080> one<00:04:40.260> of<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.440> I

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
a lot it's not like kind of one of the I

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.180 
a lot it's not like kind of one of the I
mean<00:04:41.550> like<00:04:41.850> for<00:04:42.300> example<00:04:42.390> picked<00:04:42.990> obits<00:04:43.320> was

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
mean like for example picked obits was

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.490 
mean like for example picked obits was
really<00:04:44.460> kind<00:04:44.670> of<00:04:44.730> a<00:04:44.820> brainless<00:04:45.210> art<00:04:45.480> style<00:04:45.840> it

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
really kind of a brainless art style it

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.080 
really kind of a brainless art style it
was<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.710> lot<00:04:46.950> of<00:04:46.980> fun<00:04:47.310> but<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:47.610> didn't<00:04:47.880> have<00:04:47.940> to

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
was a lot of fun but you didn't have to

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.370 
was a lot of fun but you didn't have to
think<00:04:48.270> all<00:04:48.450> that<00:04:48.570> hard<00:04:48.780> for<00:04:48.960> this<00:04:49.050> you<00:04:49.229> really

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
think all that hard for this you really

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.469 
think all that hard for this you really
have<00:04:49.470> to<00:04:49.680> think<00:04:49.860> it's<00:04:50.130> you<00:04:51.030> probably<00:04:51.270> have<00:04:51.390> to

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
have to think it's you probably have to

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.360 
have to think it's you probably have to
think<00:04:51.690> more<00:04:51.900> than<00:04:52.110> any<00:04:52.290> other<00:04:52.500> art<00:04:52.740> style<00:04:53.040> but

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
think more than any other art style but

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.410 
think more than any other art style but
