very moisturized if I didn't know any
better<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.630> would<00:02:21.840> think<00:02:21.870> they<00:02:22.170> liked<00:02:22.350> all<00:02:22.530> my

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
better I would think they liked all my

better I would think they liked all my
little<00:02:22.800> blemishes<00:02:23.430> we're<00:02:23.670> going<00:02:23.970> but<00:02:24.240> they're

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
little blemishes we're going but they're

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.990 
little blemishes we're going but they're
still<00:02:24.750> there<00:02:24.900> but<00:02:25.830> hopefully<00:02:25.980> within<00:02:26.610> you

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
still there but hopefully within you

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.310 
still there but hopefully within you
know<00:02:27.120> after<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.540> couple<00:02:27.570> times<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.080> doing<00:02:28.230> this

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
know after a couple times of doing this

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.170 
know after a couple times of doing this
mask<00:02:28.560> I'll<00:02:28.830> seem<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> really<00:02:29.550> remarkable

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
mask I'll seem like a really remarkable

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.730 
mask I'll seem like a really remarkable
difference<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.690> know<00:02:30.750> my<00:02:31.560> skin<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:34.020> camera<00:02:34.560> may

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
difference I know my skin the camera may

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.520 
difference I know my skin the camera may
not<00:02:34.950> capture<00:02:35.420> adequately<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.230> does<00:02:37.350> have

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
not capture adequately but it does have

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.890 
not capture adequately but it does have

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
face is a hundred percent dry but it has

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.900 
face is a hundred percent dry but it has
it's<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.290> feels<00:02:46.770> great<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.400> really<00:02:47.490> like

more<00:02:52.200> I'll<00:02:52.470> probably<00:02:52.709> do<00:02:53.100> one<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.090> these<00:02:54.209> masks

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
more I'll probably do one of these masks

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.590 
more I'll probably do one of these masks
like<00:02:55.290> every<00:02:55.800> other<00:02:55.980> day<00:02:56.340> for<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:57.209> next<00:02:57.420> week

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
or so just to see how it works out for

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.000
