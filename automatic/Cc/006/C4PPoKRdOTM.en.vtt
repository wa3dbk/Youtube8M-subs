00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
been trying this out it's sort of going

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.000 
been trying this out it's sort of going
through<00:00:21.539> your<00:00:21.990> contour<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.590> highlighting

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
through your contour and highlighting

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.859 
through your contour and highlighting
but<00:00:23.880> doing<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:25.529> know<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> tiger<00:00:26.189> or<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.510> sugar

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
but doing you know a tiger or a sugar

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.509 
but doing you know a tiger or a sugar
skull<00:00:28.199> or<00:00:28.500> something<00:00:28.529> with<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.130> contour

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
skull or something with the contour

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.849 
skull or something with the contour
patterns<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.510> thought<00:00:30.900> why<00:00:31.170> not<00:00:31.199> instead<00:00:31.800> of

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
patterns so I thought why not instead of

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.729 
patterns so I thought why not instead of
doing<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.219> boring<00:00:32.399> highlight<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.120> contour

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
doing a boring highlight and contour

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.750 
doing a boring highlight and contour
tutorial<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.860> could<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> bit<00:00:35.610> more

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
tutorial I could do one a bit more

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.299 
tutorial I could do one a bit more
interesting<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.559> see<00:00:37.559> if<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.800> blends<00:00:38.070> out

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
interesting and see if it blends out

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.459
