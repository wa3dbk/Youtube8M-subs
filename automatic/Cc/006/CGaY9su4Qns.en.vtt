year me and Jed and just we've went

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.569 
year me and Jed and just we've went
through<00:00:59.020> about<00:00:59.170> five<00:00:59.620> boards<00:01:00.039> before<00:01:00.340> we<00:01:00.430> got

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
through about five boards before we got

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.490 
through about five boards before we got
it<00:01:00.730> right<00:01:00.879> actually<00:01:01.180> just<00:01:01.570> getting<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.260> kick

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
it right actually just getting the kick

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.359 
it right actually just getting the kick
rides<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:03.219> deep<00:01:03.760> enough<00:01:04.030> concave<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:06.070> it's

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
rides and deep enough concave it's it's

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.279 
rides and deep enough concave it's it's
been<00:01:06.549> a<00:01:06.579> fun<00:01:06.850> journey<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.359> now<00:01:07.689> it's<00:01:07.899> you<00:01:08.170> know

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
been a fun journey and now it's you know

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:10.980 
been a fun journey and now it's you know
it's<00:01:08.619> become<00:01:09.069> one<00:01:09.579> of<00:01:10.270> my<00:01:10.450> favorite<00:01:10.840> boards

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
it's become one of my favorite boards

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.520 
it's become one of my favorite boards
ever<00:01:11.289> now<00:01:11.499> some<00:01:11.920> stuff

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.110 

this<00:01:17.530> is<00:01:17.680> actually<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.190> fin<00:01:18.430> that<00:01:18.610> goes<00:01:18.790> with

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
this is actually the fin that goes with

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.510 
this is actually the fin that goes with
the<00:01:19.330> models<00:01:19.780> it's<00:01:20.500> actually<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.160> mean<00:01:21.400> the

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
the models it's actually I mean the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.370 
the models it's actually I mean the
board<00:01:21.760> does<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.120> lot<00:01:22.390> of<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.660> but<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.930> fin<00:01:23.170> is

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
board does a lot of it but the fin is

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.260 
board does a lot of it but the fin is
definitely<00:01:23.950> a<00:01:23.980> good<00:01:24.220> part<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.640> why<00:01:24.850> it<00:01:24.910> works

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
definitely a good part of why it works

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.200 
definitely a good part of why it works
so<00:01:25.540> good<00:01:25.780> is<00:01:25.960> because<00:01:26.200> of<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.800> flex<00:01:27.160> in<00:01:27.430> it<00:01:27.550> it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
so good is because of the flex in it it

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.510 
so good is because of the flex in it it
gives<00:01:28.420> you<00:01:28.570> a<00:01:28.660> major<00:01:29.080> amount<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.740> spring<00:01:30.130> and

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
gives you a major amount of spring and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.980 
gives you a major amount of spring and
speed<00:01:31.330> with<00:01:31.690> this<00:01:31.870> flex<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.430> and<00:01:33.910> but<00:01:34.720> most

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
speed with this flex so and but most

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.560 
speed with this flex so and but most
nose<00:01:35.320> riders<00:01:35.740> fins<00:01:35.980> are<00:01:36.220> usually<00:01:36.760> you<00:01:37.450> know

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
nose riders fins are usually you know

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.810 
nose riders fins are usually you know
they<00:01:37.750> have<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.900> lot<00:01:38.110> of<00:01:38.290> bass<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:39.220> this<00:01:39.610> one

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
they have a lot of bass and and this one

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.570 
they have a lot of bass and and this one
is<00:01:40.030> it's<00:01:40.300> it's<00:01:40.930> really<00:01:41.260> AM<00:01:41.530> narrower<00:01:42.310> right

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
is it's it's really AM narrower right

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.730 
is it's it's really AM narrower right
here<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.000> rake<00:01:43.270> back<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:43.960> there's<00:01:44.140> no<00:01:44.350> dragon

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
here and rake back so there's no dragon

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.950 
here and rake back so there's no dragon
it's<00:01:45.700> a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.810 

this<00:01:53.410> one<00:01:53.620> I've<00:01:53.740> hit<00:01:53.890> it<00:01:53.980> on<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.130> reef<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.760> I'd

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
this one I've hit it on the reef and I'd

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.120 
this one I've hit it on the reef and I'd
off<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.120> reshape<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.810> it<00:01:55.990> stays<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.590> know<00:01:56.620> the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
off to reshape it it stays you know the

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.060 
off to reshape it it stays you know the
template<00:01:57.550> stays<00:01:57.760> nice<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:59.290> it's<00:01:59.890> a<00:01:59.920> good

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
template stays nice so it's a good

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.730 
template stays nice so it's a good
finisher
