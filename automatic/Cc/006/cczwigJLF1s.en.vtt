by dre solo two headphones compared to
the<00:00:29.460> monster<00:00:30.029> DNA<00:00:30.300> both<00:00:31.230> on-ear<00:00:31.920> versions<00:00:32.430> of

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the monster DNA both on-ear versions of

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.560 
the monster DNA both on-ear versions of
this<00:00:32.640> headphones<00:00:33.000> now<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.270> course<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
this headphones now of course the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.510 
this headphones now of course the
monster<00:00:33.840> DNA<00:00:34.140> are<00:00:34.260> not<00:00:34.469> as<00:00:34.739> brand<00:00:35.040> new<00:00:35.190> as<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
monster DNA are not as brand new as the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.600 
monster DNA are not as brand new as the
solo<00:00:35.790> twos<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.980> would<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.399> solo

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
solo twos so you would think the solo

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.799 
solo twos so you would think the solo
twos<00:00:38.879> would<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> little<00:00:39.300> bit<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.540> an<00:00:39.629> edge

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
twos would have a little bit of an edge

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.720 
twos would have a little bit of an edge
on<00:00:40.020> them<00:00:40.170> but<00:00:40.590> we'll<00:00:40.770> discuss<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.640> a

these two and give you my thoughts on

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.119 
these two and give you my thoughts on
which<00:00:57.149> one<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.360> think<00:00:57.420> reigned<00:00:58.320> supreme<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.890> all

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
which one I think reigned supreme in all

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.400 
which one I think reigned supreme in all
those<00:00:59.340> areas<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.149> first<00:01:00.719> off<00:01:00.989> when<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.260> comes

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
those areas so first off when it comes

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.979 
those areas so first off when it comes
to<00:01:01.559> build<00:01:01.890> quality<00:01:02.840> actually<00:01:03.840> guys

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
to build quality actually guys

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.719 
to build quality actually guys
surprisingly<00:01:04.589> enough<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.040> build<00:01:05.309> quality<00:01:05.489> on

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
surprisingly enough the build quality on

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.420 
surprisingly enough the build quality on
both<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.119> these<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.450> pretty<00:01:06.810> solid<00:01:07.049> now<00:01:07.619> don't

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
both of these is pretty solid now don't

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
both of these is pretty solid now don't
get<00:01:08.490> me<00:01:08.580> wrong<00:01:08.640> they're<00:01:08.939> both<00:01:09.119> made<00:01:09.330> of

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
get me wrong they're both made of

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.060 
get me wrong they're both made of
plastic<00:01:09.960> predominant<00:01:10.439> plastic<00:01:10.799> they<00:01:10.920> have

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
plastic predominant plastic they have

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.520 
plastic predominant plastic they have
nice<00:01:11.280> soft<00:01:11.549> soft<00:01:12.150> leather<00:01:12.240> edge<00:01:12.689> style<00:01:12.960> ear

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
nice soft soft leather edge style ear

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.350 
nice soft soft leather edge style ear
cushions<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.220> very<00:01:14.400> comfortable<00:01:14.700> but

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
cushions that are very comfortable but

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.399 
cushions that are very comfortable but
we're<00:01:15.509> talking<00:01:15.689> about<00:01:15.750> build<00:01:15.960> core<00:01:16.110> not<00:01:16.290> talk

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
we're talking about build core not talk

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.300 
we're talking about build core not talk
about<00:01:16.560> comfort<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:17.009> yet

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
about comfort just yet

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.710 
about comfort just yet
so<00:01:17.580> build<00:01:17.790> quality<00:01:17.970> as<00:01:18.150> far<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.479> goes<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
so build quality as far as that goes I

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.600 
so build quality as far as that goes I
think<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.200> they're<00:01:19.320> pretty<00:01:19.619> even<00:01:19.890> okay<00:01:20.400> they

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
think that they're pretty even okay they

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.670 
think that they're pretty even okay they
both<00:01:20.640> fold<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.180> very<00:01:21.360> nicely<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.960> kind<00:01:22.650> of

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
both fold up very nicely I kind of

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.890 
both fold up very nicely I kind of
prefer<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> way<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:24.000> dnase<00:01:24.450> fold<00:01:24.720> up<00:01:24.840> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
prefer the way the the dnase fold up a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.130 
prefer the way the the dnase fold up a
little<00:01:25.020> bit<00:01:25.140> easier<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.580> solo<00:01:27.030> twos<00:01:27.360> do

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
little bit easier the the solo twos do

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.469 
little bit easier the the solo twos do
come<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> larger<00:01:28.950> pouch<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
come with a larger pouch and and the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.880 
come with a larger pouch and and the
DNA's<00:01:30.810> do<00:01:30.960> come<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> pouch<00:01:31.500> as<00:01:31.619> well<00:01:31.770> but

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
DNA's do come with the pouch as well but

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.380 
DNA's do come with the pouch as well but
it<00:01:32.040> does<00:01:32.369> take<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:32.880> less<00:01:33.090> space<00:01:33.360> and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
it does take up a little less space and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.910 
it does take up a little less space and
every<00:01:33.689> thrown<00:01:33.900> into<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:34.229> bag<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.619> kind<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
every thrown into your bag I kind of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.190 
every thrown into your bag I kind of
just<00:01:35.220> look<00:01:35.880> how<00:01:36.000> cool<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.329> looks<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.020> just

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
just look how cool it looks it just

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.870 
just look how cool it looks it just
looks<00:01:37.380> cool<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> way<00:01:37.770> they<00:01:37.890> fold<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.220> but

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
looks cool the way they fold up but

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.340 
looks cool the way they fold up but
overall<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.390> far<00:01:39.570> as<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.750> build<00:01:39.930> quality<00:01:40.049> goes

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
overall as far as the build quality goes

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.899 
overall as far as the build quality goes
they're<00:01:40.680> both<00:01:40.890> very<00:01:41.040> solid<00:01:41.460> okay<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.880> said

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
they're both very solid okay like I said

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:42.889 
they're both very solid okay like I said
they're<00:01:42.119> both<00:01:42.210> predominately<00:01:42.630> made<00:01:42.780> of

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
they're both predominately made of

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.139 
they're both predominately made of
plastic<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.500> they<00:01:43.799> vary<00:01:44.280> they<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.820> some<00:01:44.970> very

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
plastic so they vary they have some very

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.120 
plastic so they vary they have some very
good<00:01:45.210> durability<00:01:46.170> two<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.590> them<00:01:46.710> they<00:01:46.890> stretch

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
good durability two of them they stretch

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.730 
good durability two of them they stretch
out<00:01:47.310> very<00:01:47.490> well<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:48.200> don't<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:49.439> there's<00:01:49.590> any

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
out very well I don't think there's any

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.020 
out very well I don't think there's any
kind<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:49.979> issues<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:50.369> far<00:01:50.399> as<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.729> maybe

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
kind of issues as far as I can maybe

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.730 
kind of issues as far as I can maybe
accidentally<00:01:51.750> breaking<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.380> things<00:01:52.590> like

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
accidentally breaking or things like

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.920 
accidentally breaking or things like
that<00:01:52.920> they're<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:53.880> very<00:01:54.180> robust<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.720> when<00:01:54.840> it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
that they're just very robust so when it

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.020 
that they're just very robust so when it
comes<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.259> build<00:01:55.470> quality<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.009> will<00:01:56.490> just<00:01:56.850> do<00:01:56.939> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
comes to build quality I will just do it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.910 
comes to build quality I will just do it
up<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.180> tie<00:01:57.390> okay<00:01:57.570> when<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.110> comes<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.500> so

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
up a tie okay when it comes to that so

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.260 
up a tie okay when it comes to that so
let's<00:01:59.070> talk<00:01:59.159> about<00:01:59.340> comfort<00:01:59.520> overall<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> think

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
let's talk about comfort overall I think

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.359 
let's talk about comfort overall I think
comfort<00:02:00.630> wise<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.619> kind<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.009> preferred

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
comfort wise that I kind of preferred

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.429 
comfort wise that I kind of preferred
the<00:02:02.850> DNA<00:02:03.210> headphones<00:02:03.390> they<00:02:03.930> didn't<00:02:04.200> seem<00:02:04.409> to

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the DNA headphones they didn't seem to

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.289 
the DNA headphones they didn't seem to
pinch<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> enemy<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.939> see<00:02:06.149> right<00:02:06.240> now

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
pinch on the enemy you can see right now

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.570 
pinch on the enemy you can see right now
look<00:02:06.600> how<00:02:06.719> how<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.439> way<00:02:07.590> these<00:02:07.740> come<00:02:08.069> close

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
look how how the way these come close

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.219 
look how how the way these come close
together<00:02:08.970> right<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.780> there<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> little

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
together right here so there is a little

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.260 
together right here so there is a little
bit<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.470> flex<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.099> them<00:02:11.250> I'm<00:02:11.790> not<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.180> say

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
bit of flex to them I'm not going to say

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.300 
bit of flex to them I'm not going to say
that<00:02:12.300> these<00:02:12.480> are<00:02:12.540> completely

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
that these are completely

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.670 
that these are completely
comfortable<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.910> solo<00:02:14.450> choose<00:02:14.750> but<00:02:15.319> between

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
comfortable the solo choose but between

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.260 
comfortable the solo choose but between
the<00:02:15.800> two<00:02:15.950> whom<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.190> found<00:02:16.459> that<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.760> DNA's<00:02:17.120> are

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
the two whom I found that the DNA's are

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.850 
the two whom I found that the DNA's are
a<00:02:17.300> little<00:02:17.420> more<00:02:17.630> comfortable<00:02:17.870> on<00:02:18.290> my<00:02:18.440> ears<00:02:18.680> I

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
a little more comfortable on my ears I

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.530 
a little more comfortable on my ears I
have<00:02:19.099> a<00:02:19.130> larger<00:02:19.550> head<00:02:19.670> probably<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:20.270> for<00:02:20.420> those

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
have a larger head probably so for those

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.760 
have a larger head probably so for those
of<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.690> that<00:02:20.750> have<00:02:20.900> large<00:02:21.080> heads<00:02:21.230> like<00:02:21.380> me<00:02:21.590> I

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
of you that have large heads like me I

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.440 
of you that have large heads like me I
think<00:02:22.069> you'll<00:02:22.370> probably<00:02:22.400> have<00:02:22.760> an<00:02:22.880> ask<00:02:23.239> your

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
think you'll probably have an ask your

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.150 
think you'll probably have an ask your
time<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.900> more<00:02:24.260> comfortable<00:02:24.470> feel<00:02:24.890> when<00:02:25.069> it

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
time a more comfortable feel when it

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.040 
time a more comfortable feel when it
comes<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.580> dnas<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.480> also<00:02:26.630> did<00:02:26.840> notice

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
comes to the dnas and I also did notice

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.479 
comes to the dnas and I also did notice
too<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.410> ear<00:02:27.530> cups<00:02:27.800> on<00:02:27.920> these<00:02:28.040> are<00:02:28.430> a

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
too that the ear cups on these are a

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.949 
too that the ear cups on these are a
little<00:02:28.640> bit<00:02:28.730> softer<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:29.540> feel<00:02:29.780> like<00:02:29.810> a

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
little bit softer and this feel like a

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.690 
little bit softer and this feel like a
little<00:02:30.110> more<00:02:30.290> breathable<00:02:30.680> than<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:31.370> solo

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
little more breathable than the solo

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.000 
little more breathable than the solo
twos<00:02:31.940> when<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.209> wear<00:02:32.450> these<00:02:32.599> at<00:02:33.140> work<00:02:33.380> for<00:02:33.890> eight

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
twos when I wear these at work for eight

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.309 
twos when I wear these at work for eight
hours<00:02:34.160> on<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.519> day<00:02:34.730> testing<00:02:35.720> both<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:36.019> these<00:02:36.110> out

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
hours on a day testing both of these out

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.170 
hours on a day testing both of these out
I<00:02:36.530> keep<00:02:37.069> these<00:02:37.190> on<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.400> lot<00:02:37.760> longer<00:02:37.880> than<00:02:38.120> I

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
I keep these on a lot longer than I

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.339 
I keep these on a lot longer than I
could<00:02:38.330> keep<00:02:38.420> these<00:02:38.599> these<00:02:38.810> tend<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.200> get<00:02:39.290> a

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
could keep these these tend to get a

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.229 
could keep these these tend to get a
little<00:02:39.500> bit<00:02:39.680> harder<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.250> little<00:02:40.730> bit<00:02:40.819> warmer

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
little bit harder a little bit warmer

little bit harder a little bit warmer
these<00:02:41.780> kind<00:02:42.019> of<00:02:42.080> pinch<00:02:42.290> on<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.560> ears<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:42.860> little

these kind of pinch on the ears a little
bit<00:02:43.190> more<00:02:43.370> than<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.989> DNA's<00:02:44.989> that<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.500> that's

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
bit more than the DNA's that and that's

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.990 
bit more than the DNA's that and that's
kind<00:02:45.830> of<00:02:45.920> thing<00:02:46.069> that<00:02:46.100> comes<00:02:46.489> with<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.819> on

nicely<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.819> between<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.209> two<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.390> think<00:02:53.630> I

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
nicely so between the two I think I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.509 
nicely so between the two I think I
would<00:02:54.049> give<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.500> DNA<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.130> be<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.370> more

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
would give it the DNA is to be the more

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.699 
would give it the DNA is to be the more
comfortable<00:02:55.760> fit<00:02:56.209> okay<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.260> now<00:02:57.380> let's<00:02:57.620> get

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
comfortable fit okay so now let's get

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:58.990 
comfortable fit okay so now let's get
down<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:57.920> brass<00:02:58.130> tacks<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.640> let's<00:02:58.760> talk<00:02:58.849> about

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
down to brass tacks and let's talk about

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.370 
down to brass tacks and let's talk about
the<00:02:59.180> most<00:02:59.360> important<00:02:59.840> feature<00:02:59.959> of<00:03:00.200> any

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
the most important feature of any

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.530 
the most important feature of any
headphone<00:03:01.120> whenever<00:03:02.120> you're<00:03:02.269> making<00:03:02.480> a

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
headphone whenever you're making a

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.390 
headphone whenever you're making a
purchase<00:03:02.690> in<00:03:03.080> my<00:03:03.230> opinion<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.799> that<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.160> the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
purchase in my opinion and that is the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.130 
purchase in my opinion and that is the
sound<00:03:04.670> quality<00:03:05.060> now<00:03:05.209> which<00:03:05.480> of<00:03:05.510> these<00:03:05.750> is

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
sound quality now which of these is

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.900 
sound quality now which of these is
better<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.500> sound<00:03:06.680> quality<00:03:06.769> so<00:03:07.099> for<00:03:07.580> most<00:03:07.730> of

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
better and sound quality so for most of

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.250 
better and sound quality so for most of
you<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.330> maybe<00:03:08.540> some<00:03:08.780> of<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.049> don't

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260

another and the beats line of headphones

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.740 
another and the beats line of headphones
was<00:03:16.489> produced<00:03:16.849> by<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.030> monster<00:03:17.420> they<00:03:17.540> used<00:03:17.690> to

was produced by a monster they used to

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.229 
was produced by a monster they used to
be<00:03:17.840> called<00:03:18.019> monster<00:03:18.470> beats<00:03:18.709> by<00:03:18.890> dre<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:19.310> course

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
be called monster beats by dre of course

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.690 
be called monster beats by dre of course
beats<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.930> monster<00:03:21.920> broke<00:03:22.130> up<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:22.489> they<00:03:22.549> had

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
beats and monster broke up and they had

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
beats and monster broke up and they had
a<00:03:22.730> little<00:03:22.850> bit<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.120> break<00:03:23.329> up<00:03:23.359> and<00:03:23.660> they

a little bit of break up and they

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.920 
a little bit of break up and they
separated<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.410> so<00:03:25.070> this<00:03:25.609> is<00:03:25.820> a<00:03:25.850> this<00:03:26.780> is

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
separated and so this is a this is

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.960 
separated and so this is a this is
monstrous<00:03:27.380> version<00:03:27.890> of<00:03:28.010> basically<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.459> the

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.960 
blew my mind when it came to sound
quality<00:03:44.900> but<00:03:45.410> they<00:03:45.590> were<00:03:45.650> very<00:03:45.739> good<00:03:46.400> good

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970

four pair of headphones it's under $200

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.809 
four pair of headphones it's under $200
very<00:03:50.810> good<00:03:51.019> keep<00:03:51.470> in<00:03:51.560> mind<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:52.069> solo<00:03:52.310> twos<00:03:52.609> are

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
very good keep in mind the solo twos are

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.970 
very good keep in mind the solo twos are
$200<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:53.989> although<00:03:54.380> this<00:03:54.590> is<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.769> nice

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
$200 and although this is a nice

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.970 
$200 and although this is a nice
improvement<00:03:55.340> over<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.910> solo<00:03:56.209> HDS<00:03:56.829> with<00:03:57.829> and

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
improvement over the solo HDS with and

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.740 
improvement over the solo HDS with and
they<00:03:58.040> have<00:03:58.220> much<00:03:58.459> less<00:03:58.700> bass<00:03:59.000> or<00:03:59.239> not<00:03:59.359> muddled

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
they have much less bass or not muddled

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.970 
they have much less bass or not muddled
sounding<00:04:00.170> with<00:04:00.319> high<00:04:00.440> volumes

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
sounding with high volumes

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.500 
sounding with high volumes
I<00:04:01.010> still<00:04:01.489> think<00:04:01.609> between<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.030> two<00:04:02.180> that<00:04:02.329> the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
I still think between the two that the

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.479 
I still think between the two that the
monsters<00:04:02.959> had<00:04:03.170> better<00:04:03.380> quality<00:04:03.829> audio<00:04:04.160> when

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
monsters had better quality audio when

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.520 
monsters had better quality audio when
it<00:04:04.579> came<00:04:04.700> to<00:04:04.910> multiple<00:04:05.690> genres<00:04:05.750> of<00:04:06.049> music<00:04:06.170> if

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
it came to multiple genres of music if

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.349 
it came to multiple genres of music if
you<00:04:06.620> just<00:04:06.769> listen<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.100> hip-hop<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.670> dubstep

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
you just listen to hip-hop and dubstep

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:09.940 
you just listen to hip-hop and dubstep
and<00:04:08.720> things<00:04:08.930> I<00:04:09.019> have<00:04:09.109> a<00:04:09.139> lot<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.290> bass<00:04:09.530> you'll

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
and things I have a lot of bass you'll

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.979 
and things I have a lot of bass you'll
probably<00:04:10.100> enjoy<00:04:10.340> using<00:04:10.609> the<00:04:10.790> beats<00:04:10.970> okay<00:04:11.389> but

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
probably enjoy using the beats okay but

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.270 
probably enjoy using the beats okay but
if<00:04:12.049> you're<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.500> person<00:04:12.650> that<00:04:12.920> listens<00:04:13.100> to

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
if you're the person that listens to

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.789 
if you're the person that listens to
more<00:04:13.489> rail<00:04:13.700> well-rounded<00:04:14.480> music<00:04:14.780> a<00:04:14.900> bigger

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
more rail well-rounded music a bigger

that's<00:04:45.050> pretty<00:04:45.230> subjective<00:04:45.710> of<00:04:45.830> course

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
different between me I prefer the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.080 
different between me I prefer the
monsters<00:04:49.040> of<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:49.250> I<00:04:49.370> just<00:04:49.430> think<00:04:49.670> that<00:04:49.820> kind<00:04:50.060> of

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
monsters of it I just think that kind of

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.790 
monsters of it I just think that kind of
triangular<00:04:50.810> look<00:04:51.170> is<00:04:51.320> just<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.560> little<00:04:51.710> bit

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
triangular look is just a little bit

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.130 
triangular look is just a little bit
cooler<00:04:52.010> than<00:04:52.490> just<00:04:52.700> the<00:04:52.820> rounder<00:04:53.180> look<00:04:54.020> that

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
cooler than just the rounder look that

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.750 
cooler than just the rounder look that

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
the beats have here but that's pretty

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.340 
the beats have here but that's pretty
much<00:04:55.850> it<00:04:56.000> guys<00:04:56.150> so<00:04:56.300> in<00:04:56.510> my<00:04:56.660> book<00:04:56.930> I<00:04:57.080> would<00:04:57.230> give

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
between the beats by dre solo - so
