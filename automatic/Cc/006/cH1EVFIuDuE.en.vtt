00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.810
 kevin you're 25th is out of luck 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.430
 of podium and yet you leave 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.299
 tomorrow in the individual final 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.910
 for what purpose but it's true that I have 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.530
 missed a lot of things in the championship 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.389
 whether it's the first day hunting or 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.269
 the second round of the Team 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.160
 I have a lot of frustration with dreamer 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.920
 not just lately but 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.750
 since the beginning of my career with him 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.700
 it is a horse that I love 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.040
 which is enormously of quality despite 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.100
 all these factors there I have trouble to 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.600
 really have some regularity even though 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.760
 it's been three years three seasons that 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.600
 the world it's true that I still have 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.420
 need to find landmarks I never 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.800
 constantly repeating that done 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.590
 unfortunately every time I 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.440
 the impression of having a serious step 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.660
 and here I come back after I 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.430
 still been super disappointed with my service 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.780
 with him 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.710
 this week because even the meaning 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.570
 time I did in the first 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.910
 it was a painless flawless 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.020
 whether it's hunting or the second 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.010
 sleeve I felt like we had 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.880
 more fluid courses but in 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.770
 but there are mistakes 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.440
 here it is imperative that I arrive at 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.180
 find to find some harmony 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.229
 and especially a regularity in 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.300
 results and sees the arrival at 14 years 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.369
 but it's great this is in full 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.340
 form but I hope one day power 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.200
 Rises to the height of his talent you 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.850
 are the only one among the French tomorrow to 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.130
 take the start and have already had this 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.820
 individual crown in 2009 with 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.700
 kraque boom 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.040
 what is the advice how are you 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.630
 help those who can win you this is 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.070
 to say in any case get on a podium 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.600
 obviously so good to be and especially 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.610
 Penelope Leprévost What's Needed 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.410
 to win an individual medal and 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.930
 win this final which seems very 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.009
 difficult 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.509
 there are a lot of elements that plays into 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.160
 their favor the first thing that's 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.110
 that they are in a very good period 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.460
 with their other horses where we 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.050
 see if moire is not a cleric of 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.399
 climb up the world rankings one 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.140
 speaks that the world ranking has 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.080
 it's still not significant enough 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.760
 on the regularity of the riders and that 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.260
 this is simon pénélope they rather 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.620
 in a good time so it plays 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.500
 in their favor they are both 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.240
 very competitive with a super mind that 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.560
 it is a general way and jadot they 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.120
 are both very frustrated with the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.790
 fault they paid a defect of 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.930
 different it is penelope the hoist 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.600
 simon the release of thrips and faults 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.250
 really they make them rage and I 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.710
 think that it can have a big 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.840
 impact tomorrow on their motivation even 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.690
 if there was no need for that 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.160
 it is, but then last 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.840
 thing they are rather in a position 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.800
 favorable i.e. if they come 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.450
 the no- fault they will put the 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.300
 pressure on others was developing a 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.470
 now place ten podiums and I 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.850
 think it got pinned too a bit 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.980
 like that for the World Cup final 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.360
 she's going she'll be able to very easily 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.190
 put pressure on others and 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.510
 as everyone stands in one 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.180
 bar I think they really 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.870
 really a big chance tomorrow the 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.340
 coronation in 2009 changed a lot there your 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.590
 career it was a very, very moment 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.460
 it's not a victory like the 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.510
 others that of the european championships 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.650
 so does not it crush 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.970
 just a little bit sometimes 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.590
 some riders what can it do 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.900
 scared a little bit to both french there is 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:14.510
 also another element is that the 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.620
 title grown and inevitably attracts 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.880
 a lot of people it's something 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.470
 who is shining I was lucky enough to 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.970
 do it in a configuration that 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.590
 was pretty special it was really my 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.690
 first year at the highest level so 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.010
 I played a little luck factor is 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.360
 and everything went well for me but 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.500
 I think for canaries who 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.760
 had a lot of experience or a 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.930
 sister was particular because there 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.400
 was not a big mood it was a 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.459
 contest anyway with an atmosphere 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.170
 a little a little sad while there we are 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.909
 we are in a cauldron 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.920
 it's something that will wear that goes 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.750
 stimulate the riders for them for the 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.400
 two french for pénélope and simon 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.319
 it's a chance to have a champion 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.519
 of Europe so you who will pass well 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.659
 before you go to them 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.579
 bring in and bring them a lot 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.010
 information it serves as well and that your 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.000
 tomorrow's course yes I think that 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.470
 it's not so much the fact that I'm 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.810
 european champion because tomorrow we go 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.030
 not to have really changes 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.140
 metaphysical or psychological 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.629
 but is this something it's 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.470
 important to have someone who can 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.450
 to be a bit of an opener 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.269
 I know their horses very well because 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.799
 that we try whatever we say is 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.660
 a soul enough team and to share 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.789
 many have done every weekend the 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.470
 contest together and we try to 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:25.030
 watch what happens on the other side 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.500
 at the neighbors and suddenly I think 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.479
 only after the feelings that I'm going 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.039
 have on both runs tomorrow in 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.690
 hoping for a second home I 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.060
 will be able to enlighten them and in any case 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.190
 give them my perspective on the 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.660
 course and try to help them in 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.280
 maximum technically but for the rest 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.490
 I think that psychologically they are 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.490
 strong enough
