00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.260
 hello to all my lovers of recipes 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.260
 cooking 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.970
 I'm literally getting hot and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.910
 is that we already have some temperatures 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.279
 close to 40 degrees so today 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.440
 I'm going to prepare a merengada milk that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.360
 it's a very refreshing drink and very 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.550
 easy to do that personally to me 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.309
 I love it and the ingredients that we go 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.340
 to need then are the following a 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:49.890
 liter of whole milk the shell of a 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:54.600
 lemon a cinnamon stick 250 grams of 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.330
 white sugar 4 egg whites and cinnamon 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.010
 ground and with all this we can already 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.129
 start preparing our milk 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.129
 meringue 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.430
 The first thing we are going to do is take it 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.650
 the skin to our lemon with the help of a 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.570
 peeler always avoiding in the middle of what 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.610
 possible to remove the white part that is 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.530
 the part that bitter 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.530
 then we will throw the liter of 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.930
 whole milk in a saucepan we 're going to put 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.120
 to warm up slowly we're going to 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.390
 incorporate the lemon skins the 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.580
 cinnamon stick and 200 grams of sugar 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.460
 white and we will leave it heating up 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.110
 until we see that it starts to boil 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.300
 when we see that milk has started 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.250
 to boil , we'll let it warm up 5 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.280
 minutes more while stirring 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.260
 no time after 5 minutes 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.410
 we are going to withdraw our case from the fire and 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.420
 let's let the milk cool once 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.890
 I went to the milk we are going to strain the well with 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.770
 the help of a colander to remove him 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.869
 all pieces of lemon and cinnamon 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.820
 next I will use a separator 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.290
 to separate the whites from the yolks of 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.390
 our eggs 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.100
 we will think of a bowl in our clear 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.350
 of egg being important that they are 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.130
 We are going to add the 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.930
 50 grams of white sugar remain 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.880
 then we are going to beat everything very 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.900
 quick with a blender until the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.900
 clear at the point of snow 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.010
 and 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.090
 once assembled the egg whites to 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.860
 point of snow we will have obtained a 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.200
 merengue and what we are going to do now is 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.120
 go incorporating milk little by little 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.480
 with lemon while stirring with help 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.580
 of a tongue or spoon 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.080
 once we have mixed the milk well 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.060
 with the meringue we are going to put the 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.709
 container in the fridge and we 're going to 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.739
 let cool for at least three 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.450
 hours once cold let's say watching 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.450
 our meringue milk in a glass 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.990
 we'll add a little ground cinnamon 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.120
 above 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.550
 and in my case I will also decorate it 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.320
 with a couple of ice cream waffles 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.000
 and a mind prepares our milk 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.600
 merengada and the only thing that remains is 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.600
 take her 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.020
 also 100 is with the coolness that 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.670
 It's good, I'm going to leave 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.500
