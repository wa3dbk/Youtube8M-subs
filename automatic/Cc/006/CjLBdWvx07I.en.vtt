00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:14.780
 I think that I want to the immediately the ingredients sound quality customers by I mean entered 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:17.900
 Though it is something to compare well, it is a condenser tech microphone made by zoom technica covering this first 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:23.150
 with atb 035 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:25.599
 Large dick raw sound dynamic microphone support 5 I would like to compare this one 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.599
 Please 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:37.430
 Oh A This sound is the head of on the back 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.430
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:49.600
 Oh this sound is the sound of at 2035 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.600
 Oh 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.930
 Oh, how did it happen? I heard it now , but it feels like I'm concerned about it now 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.790
 It became a kick 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:05.440
 Well, I'm comparing it with the condenser microphone dynamic 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:10.360
 Kedomo comparison is like not subject 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.340
 And Well wonder if is in the mouth in here Dyna Well Well direction a little can compare Nde say 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:19.110
 I think though was thought that 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:21.970
 I wonder why maybe this year's microphone produced a better sound 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.570
 The number of pop noise sounds 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.840
 Well, in I think that was not a Well few here video overwhelmingly 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.610
 Dynamic splash 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.310
 Speaking of features, it is an idea 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:40.860
 Close just in a thing to use this as close to the mouth this 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.860
 I breath here for Kedomo I'm likely to occur is the Tteyuu pop noise by using the clay figures are 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:50.320
 If you only have difficulties , there are 10 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.870
 15 to 30 cm I talk and if I put on a pop guard during this time 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.190
 Happens when Well 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.220
 All manner I pop noise is reduced 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.700
 As a result, it becomes clear and good sound 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.240
 Yes yes 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.009
 Well this say I path condenser make you feel I like the sound 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.950
 It Kedomo you Yes have this in 13,000 as high of 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.090
 High 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.890
 I think this is enough 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:23.260
 It is now out game attitude but with this I condenser microphone 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:27.849
 I think that I want to live in the other direction, I can say that this time the video in this area 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:34.319
 This time I want to end the person Condenser microphone made by Audio Technica 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:34.319
 at was opened and the sound quality comparison of 2035 goodbye in it
