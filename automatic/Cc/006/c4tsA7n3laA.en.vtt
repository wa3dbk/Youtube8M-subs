that let's get started
for<00:01:07.979> each<00:01:08.100> rosette<00:01:08.790> you're<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> need

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
for each rosette you're going to need

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.010 
for each rosette you're going to need
four<00:01:10.560> jump<00:01:10.920> rings<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:12.030> always<00:01:12.420> easier<00:01:12.780> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
four jump rings it's always easier to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690 
four jump rings it's always easier to
open<00:01:13.200> your<00:01:13.530> jump<00:01:13.710> rings<00:01:14.040> at<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> beginning<00:01:14.640> of

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
open your jump rings at the beginning of

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.070 
open your jump rings at the beginning of
your<00:01:14.850> project<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.650> opened<00:01:17.009> three<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
your project so I have opened three and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.999 
your project so I have opened three and
one<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.350> closed<00:01:20.930> 12<00:01:21.930> millimeter<00:01:22.439> jump<00:01:22.740> rings

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
one is closed 12 millimeter jump rings

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.609 
one is closed 12 millimeter jump rings
are<00:01:23.189> fairly<00:01:23.549> easy<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.150> work<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.439> your

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619

I<00:02:20.620> suggest<00:02:21.620> if<00:02:21.769> you're<00:02:21.920> going<00:02:22.099> to<00:02:22.280> be<00:02:22.430> making<00:02:22.660> a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
I suggest if you're going to be making a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.979 
I suggest if you're going to be making a
long<00:02:24.349> necklace<00:02:24.920> earrings<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:26.450> might<00:02:26.629> want<00:02:26.870> to

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
just spend some time and make as many

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.789 
just spend some time and make as many
rosettes<00:02:30.080> as<00:02:30.379> you<00:02:30.560> think<00:02:30.830> you'll<00:02:31.010> be<00:02:31.040> needing

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
connect it to the other rosette so you

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.140 
connect it to the other rosette so you
want<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.069> again<00:03:16.400> make<00:03:17.359> sure<00:03:17.389> all<00:03:17.900> four<00:03:19.150> connect

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:35.719 
and close your jump ring and there you

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:40.750 
and close your jump ring and there you
can<00:03:35.900> see<00:03:36.170> it's<00:03:36.379> connected<00:03:38.049> and<00:03:39.370> now<00:03:40.370> we<00:03:40.430> want

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
can see it's connected and now we want

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.119 
can see it's connected and now we want
to<00:03:40.879> do<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.269> same<00:03:41.569> thing<00:03:42.019> with<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.650> second

to do the same thing with the second
jump<00:03:43.400> ring<00:03:44.290> so<00:03:45.290> we're<00:03:45.439> going<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.650> hold<00:03:45.950> on<00:03:46.280> to

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
jump ring so we're going to hold on to

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.920 
jump ring so we're going to hold on to
the<00:03:46.670> open<00:03:47.090> jump<00:03:47.389> ring<00:03:47.659> with<00:03:47.989> a<00:03:48.019> tool<00:03:49.719> we<00:03:50.719> want

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
the open jump ring with a tool we want

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.500 
the open jump ring with a tool we want
to<00:03:50.989> make<00:03:51.170> sure<00:03:51.200> all<00:03:51.590> four<00:03:52.189> of<00:03:53.000> that<00:03:53.989> rosette

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
to make sure all four of that rosette

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.410 
to make sure all four of that rosette
get<00:03:56.510> inside<00:03:57.079> that<00:03:57.319> jump<00:03:57.709> ring<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.400> then<00:03:58.459> we

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
get inside that jump ring and then we

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.899 
get inside that jump ring and then we
want<00:03:59.599> to<00:03:59.629> grab<00:03:59.840> the<00:04:00.109> other<00:04:00.319> rosette<00:04:03.730> make<00:04:04.730> sure

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
want to grab the other rosette make sure

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.240 
want to grab the other rosette make sure
all<00:04:05.180> four<00:04:06.459> if<00:04:07.459> that<00:04:07.730> rosette<00:04:08.239> go<00:04:08.450> in<00:04:08.750> and<00:04:09.250> again

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
all four if that rosette go in and again

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:22.770 
all four if that rosette go in and again
take<00:04:10.849> your<00:04:10.879> tools<00:04:13.599> and<00:04:15.639> close<00:04:16.639> that<00:04:16.669> jump<00:04:17.389> ring
