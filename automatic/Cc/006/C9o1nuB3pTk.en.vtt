00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.040 
BPA free I think it says that somewhere
on<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.950> box<00:02:53.460> I<00:02:54.740> can't<00:02:55.740> find<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.160> well<00:02:57.050> let's

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
on the box I can't find it well let's

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.060

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
see it's BPA free but I can't get it in

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.390 
see it's BPA free but I can't get it in
focus<00:03:02.340> but<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.180> will<00:03:03.450> show<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.260> online<00:03:04.530> how<00:03:05.250> it

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
focus but I will show you online how it

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.290 
focus but I will show you online how it
is<00:03:06.770> BPA<00:03:07.770> free<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.550> course<00:03:08.790> these<00:03:08.970> are<00:03:09.030> baby

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
is BPA free and of course these are baby

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.630 
is BPA free and of course these are baby
cubes<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.750> bought<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.140> two<00:03:10.350> outside<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.310> think

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
cubes I bought the two outside I think

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.250 
cubes I bought the two outside I think
they<00:03:11.790> do<00:03:11.850> sell<00:03:12.240> them<00:03:12.330> in<00:03:12.480> one<00:03:12.690> ounce<00:03:12.840> but<00:03:13.110> that

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
they do sell them in one ounce but that

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.800 
they do sell them in one ounce but that
seems<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.590> be<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:14.010> little<00:03:14.280> tiny<00:03:15.000> amount<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.570> food

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
seems to be a little tiny amount of food

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.250 
seems to be a little tiny amount of food
in<00:03:16.050> my<00:03:16.260> opinion<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.570> again<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:18.840> can<00:03:18.959> just<00:03:19.050> lick

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
in my opinion so again you can just lick

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.230 
in my opinion so again you can just lick
the<00:03:19.380> lid<00:03:19.560> up<00:03:20.090> pour<00:03:21.090> as<00:03:21.240> much<00:03:22.459> baby<00:03:23.459> food<00:03:23.730> in<00:03:23.970> as
