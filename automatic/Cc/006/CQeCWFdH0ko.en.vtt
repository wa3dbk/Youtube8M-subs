is a 750 gig hitachi drive or you can

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.760 
is a 750 gig hitachi drive or you can
use<00:01:03.909> SSDs<00:01:04.570> we<00:01:04.750> have<00:01:04.870> a<00:01:04.900> long<00:01:05.409> list<00:01:05.650> of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
use SSDs we have a long list of

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.260 
use SSDs we have a long list of
recommended<00:01:06.130> drives<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:06.640> you<00:01:06.700> can<00:01:06.909> use<00:01:07.090> and

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
they basically take take that disk and

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.760 
they basically take take that disk and
they<00:01:10.000> put<00:01:10.479> it<00:01:10.600> into<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.900> side<00:01:11.080> of<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.260> ninja

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
exactly like so so this is the ninja 2

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.969 
exactly like so so this is the ninja 2
this<00:01:18.549> is<00:01:18.700> a<00:01:18.729> touchscreen<00:01:19.119> interface<00:01:19.829> you<00:01:20.829> can

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
this is a touchscreen interface you can

if I change the format recording then

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.470
