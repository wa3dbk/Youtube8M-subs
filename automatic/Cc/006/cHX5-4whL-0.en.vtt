door it drops down slightly you can see
right<00:00:53.129> there<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.910> there<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:55.010> shortened

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
right there that there is a shortened

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.860 
right there that there is a shortened
gap<00:00:56.219> there<00:00:56.550> when<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.940> push<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.149> closed<00:00:57.510> it

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
gap there when you push it closed it

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.330 
gap there when you push it closed it
lifts<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.260> back<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.680> when<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> hits<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
lifts it back up when it hits the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.200 
lifts it back up when it hits the
striker<00:00:59.730> on<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:01.190> inside<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> frame<00:01:02.789> here

striker on the inside of the frame here

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.800 
striker on the inside of the frame here
so<00:01:03.589> this<00:01:04.589> door<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.250> starting<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> sag<00:01:06.060> now

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
so this door is just starting to sag now

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.660 
so this door is just starting to sag now
if<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.500> let<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.189> don't<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.460> anything

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
if we let it go and don't do anything

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.350 
if we let it go and don't do anything
about<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
about it

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.020 
about it
most<00:01:09.659> people<00:01:09.990> would<00:01:10.140> replace<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.920> hinge<00:01:11.640> pins

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
most people would replace the hinge pins

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.330 
most people would replace the hinge pins
and<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.630> bushings<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.010> hinges

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
and the bushings or the hinges

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.910 
and the bushings or the hinges
themselves<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.659> started<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.259> say<00:01:16.350> before<00:01:16.380> if

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
themselves as I started to say before if

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.499 
themselves as I started to say before if
we<00:01:17.040> don't<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:17.430> anything<00:01:17.670> about<00:01:17.970> it

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
we don't do anything about it

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.560 
we don't do anything about it
this<00:01:19.080> door<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:20.850> weak

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
this door will get more and more weak

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.929 
this door will get more and more weak
and<00:01:21.810> more<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.740> more<00:01:22.860> damage<00:01:23.250> done<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.729> it

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
and more and more damage done to it

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.480 
and more and more damage done to it
especially<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.290> striker<00:01:25.680> area<00:01:26.250> right

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
especially to that striker area right

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.219 
especially to that striker area right
there<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.360> don't<00:01:27.540> want<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.049> happen

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
there and you don't want that to happen

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.109 
there and you don't want that to happen
because<00:01:28.619> that's<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.950> very<00:01:29.100> hard<00:01:29.610> part<00:01:29.939> to

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
because that's a very hard part to

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.870 
because that's a very hard part to
replace<00:01:30.619> especially<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.950> striker<00:01:32.310> self<00:01:32.670> but

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
replace especially that striker self but

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.109 
replace especially that striker self but

easy these are the shim Easy's they come

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.160 
easy these are the shim Easy's they come
in<00:01:40.380> three<00:01:40.650> sizes<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.790> are<00:01:41.820> thickness<00:01:42.630> sizes

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
in three sizes they are thickness sizes

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.960 
in three sizes they are thickness sizes
you<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.920> thinnest<00:01:44.310> one<00:01:44.520> which<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
you have the thinnest one which is the
