hello<00:00:00.390> everyone<00:00:00.780> and<00:00:00.810> welcome<00:00:01.110> in<00:00:01.620> this<00:00:01.709> video

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
hello everyone and welcome in this video

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.110 
hello everyone and welcome in this video
we're<00:00:02.100> going<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.250> be<00:00:02.340> checking<00:00:02.580> out<00:00:02.790> why<00:00:03.060> the

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
we're going to be checking out why the

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.110 
we're going to be checking out why the
Nissan<00:00:03.780> GTR<00:00:04.230> LM<00:00:04.770> Nismo<00:00:05.190> is<00:00:05.400> front-wheel<00:00:05.970> drive

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
Nissan GTR LM Nismo is front-wheel drive

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.629 
Nissan GTR LM Nismo is front-wheel drive
with<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.720> front-mounted<00:00:07.170> engine<00:00:07.620> now<00:00:08.340> when<00:00:08.610> I

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
with a front-mounted engine now when I

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.730 
with a front-mounted engine now when I
first<00:00:08.970> heard<00:00:09.150> about<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.510> Nissan<00:00:09.870> lmp1<00:00:10.380> car

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
first heard about the Nissan lmp1 car

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.320 
first heard about the Nissan lmp1 car
being<00:00:10.950> front-engine<00:00:11.610> front-wheel-drive

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
being front-engine front-wheel-drive

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.580 
being front-engine front-wheel-drive
I<00:00:12.540> thought<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.960> was<00:00:13.080> kind<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.290> just<00:00:13.500> this

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
I thought it was kind of just this

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.410 
I thought it was kind of just this
marketing<00:00:14.160> stunt<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.670> build<00:00:14.849> hype<00:00:15.030> around<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
marketing stunt to build hype around the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.120 
marketing stunt to build hype around the
project<00:00:15.839> but<00:00:16.230> actually<00:00:16.529> there's<00:00:16.710> some<00:00:16.859> very

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
project but actually there's some very

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.920 
project but actually there's some very
good<00:00:17.220> reasons<00:00:17.520> for<00:00:17.760> why<00:00:17.970> they<00:00:18.150> did<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.630> so

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
good reasons for why they did it and so

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.970 
good reasons for why they did it and so
we're<00:00:19.020> going<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.199> be<00:00:19.289> kind<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.560> looking<00:00:19.680> at

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
we're going to be kind of looking at

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.220 
we're going to be kind of looking at
four<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> reasons<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:21.270> about<00:00:21.930> why<00:00:22.170> this

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
four of the reasons here about why this

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.410 
four of the reasons here about why this
might<00:00:22.740> be<00:00:22.859> advantageous<00:00:23.269> versus<00:00:24.269> their

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
might be advantageous versus their

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.870 
might be advantageous versus their
competition<00:00:25.130> so<00:00:26.130> starting<00:00:26.609> with<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.849> first

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
competition so starting with the first

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.700 
competition so starting with the first
one<00:00:27.300> center<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.689> gravity<00:00:28.019> versus<00:00:28.380> center<00:00:28.619> of

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
one center of gravity versus center of

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.500 
one center of gravity versus center of
pressure<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.550> kind<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.849> comes<00:00:29.910> down<00:00:30.330> to

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
pressure and this kind of comes down to

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.299 
pressure and this kind of comes down to
the<00:00:30.630> rule<00:00:30.810> books<00:00:31.080> because<00:00:31.800> basically<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the rule books because basically the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.459 
the rule books because basically the
rear<00:00:32.520> wing<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.239> rear<00:00:33.420> diffuser<00:00:33.840> are<00:00:34.110> very

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
rear wing and the rear diffuser are very

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.380 
rear wing and the rear diffuser are very
much<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:34.890> restricted<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.880> everyone's<00:00:36.239> going

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
much so restricted so everyone's going

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.910 
much so restricted so everyone's going
to<00:00:36.420> be<00:00:36.480> running<00:00:36.809> something<00:00:37.079> very<00:00:37.530> similar

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
to be running something very similar

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.860 
to be running something very similar
whereas<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.850> front<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.270> car<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.629> much

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
whereas the front of the car is much

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.069 
whereas the front of the car is much
more<00:00:40.079> open<00:00:40.290> for<00:00:41.280> aerodynamic<00:00:42.000> changes<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.750> so

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
more open for aerodynamic changes and so

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.869 
more open for aerodynamic changes and so
because<00:00:43.379> everyone<00:00:43.770> has<00:00:44.040> basically<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> same

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
because everyone has basically the same

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.910 
because everyone has basically the same
thing<00:00:45.239> going<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.600> at<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> rear<00:00:46.020> maximum

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
thing going on at the rear maximum

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.470 
thing going on at the rear maximum
downforce<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> most<00:00:47.940> efficient<00:00:48.390> way

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
downforce at the most efficient way

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
downforce at the most efficient way
possible

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
possible

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.680 
possible
it's<00:00:50.010> difficult<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.940> move<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.270> center<00:00:51.570> of

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
it's difficult to move the center of

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.200 
it's difficult to move the center of
pressure<00:00:51.960> back<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.309> when<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> car

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
pressure back and so when you have a car

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.939 
pressure back and so when you have a car
that's<00:00:54.390> rear-wheel<00:00:54.960> drive<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.860> have

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
that's rear-wheel drive and you have

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.740 
that's rear-wheel drive and you have
your<00:00:56.100> center<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> gravity<00:00:56.520> back<00:00:57.000> here<00:00:57.390> what

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
your center of gravity back here what

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.209 
your center of gravity back here what
you<00:00:57.870> want<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.530> put<00:00:58.739> your<00:00:58.859> center<00:00:59.129> of

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
you want to do is put your center of

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.430 
you want to do is put your center of
pressure<00:00:59.430> over<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.840> car<00:01:01.050> steers

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
pressure over that so the car steers

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.619 
pressure over that so the car steers
neutrally<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.940> center<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.390> pressure

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
neutrally now if your center of pressure

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.810 
neutrally now if your center of pressure
is<00:01:03.960> behind<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:04.680> center<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.979> gravity<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.790> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
is behind your center of gravity for a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.120 
is behind your center of gravity for a
front-wheel<00:01:06.330> drive<00:01:06.360> car<00:01:06.659> your<00:01:07.439> car<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.830> going

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
front-wheel drive car your car is going

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.789 
front-wheel drive car your car is going
to<00:01:08.340> be<00:01:08.520> under<00:01:09.479> steering<00:01:09.960> because<00:01:10.290> you've<00:01:10.590> got

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
to be under steering because you've got

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.000 
to be under steering because you've got
more<00:01:11.360> load<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> rear<00:01:13.020> tires<00:01:13.320> than<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
more load on the rear tires than on the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.660 
more load on the rear tires than on the
front<00:01:14.280> tires

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
front tires

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.310 
front tires
so<00:01:15.000> those<00:01:15.150> front<00:01:15.540> won't<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.869> able<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.110> hold

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
so those front won't be able to hold

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.310 
so those front won't be able to hold
versus<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.189> your<00:01:17.310> center<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.580> pressure<00:01:17.820> is

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
versus if your center of pressure is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.480 
versus if your center of pressure is
above<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> center<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.830> gravity<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.340> you're

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
above the center of gravity then you're

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.130 
above the center of gravity then you're
going<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.790> oversteer<00:01:21.540> because<00:01:22.020> you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
going to have oversteer because you

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.480 
going to have oversteer because you
don't<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.439> enough<00:01:22.650> traction<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.189> your<00:01:23.340> rear

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
don't have enough traction on your rear

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.780 
don't have enough traction on your rear
tires<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.990> what<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.409> does<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> Nissan

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
tires so what this does with the Nissan

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.210 
tires so what this does with the Nissan
lmp1<00:01:27.210> car<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.780> they're<00:01:28.259> able<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.619> move<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
lmp1 car is they're able to move the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.069 
lmp1 car is they're able to move the
center<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.579> pressure<00:01:29.790> up<00:01:30.119> towards<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> center

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
center of pressure up towards the center

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.660 
center of pressure up towards the center
of<00:01:31.229> gravity<00:01:31.560> which<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.829> closer<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> front

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
of gravity which is closer to the front

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.580 
of gravity which is closer to the front
and<00:01:33.390> they're<00:01:33.630> able<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.930> do<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.259> efficiently

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
and they're able to do this efficiently

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.160 
and they're able to do this efficiently
because<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.759> front<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> car<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.900> more

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
because the front of the car is more

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.990 
because the front of the car is more
open<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:38.310> aerodynamic<00:01:39.320> features<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
open for aerodynamic features and so the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.639 
open for aerodynamic features and so the
cars<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.390> are<00:01:42.479> rear-wheel<00:01:42.960> drive<00:01:42.990> are

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
cars that are rear-wheel drive are

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.160 
cars that are rear-wheel drive are
trying<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> pull<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.520> back<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:45.630> basically

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
trying to pull this back and basically

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.690 
trying to pull this back and basically
the<00:01:46.380> rulebook<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.920> trying<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.220> prevent<00:01:47.460> them

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the rulebook is trying to prevent them

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.889 
the rulebook is trying to prevent them
from<00:01:47.729> doing<00:01:48.090> that

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
from doing that

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.289 
from doing that
whereas<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.799> Nissan's<00:01:50.280> case<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.820> rulebook<00:01:51.000> is

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
whereas in Nissan's case the rulebook is

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.639 
whereas in Nissan's case the rulebook is
kind<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.540> allowing<00:01:51.990> them<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.350> bring<00:01:52.470> that

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
kind of allowing them to bring that

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.319 
kind of allowing them to bring that
center<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.920> pressure<00:01:53.070> forward<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.060> they<00:01:54.180> can

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
center of pressure forward so they can

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.810 
center of pressure forward so they can
have<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> very<00:01:54.810> neutrally<00:01:55.470> handling<00:01:55.920> car<00:01:56.130> even

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
have a very neutrally handling car even

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.770 
have a very neutrally handling car even
though<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.149> front-engine

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
though it's front-engine

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.359 
though it's front-engine
front-wheel-drive<00:01:58.229> which<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.159> might<00:01:59.310> think

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
front-wheel-drive which you might think

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.580 
front-wheel-drive which you might think
would<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.790> be<00:02:00.060> tons<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.689> understeer<00:02:01.170> so

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
would just be tons of understeer so

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.990 
would just be tons of understeer so
they're<00:02:01.710> able<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.950> set<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.369> up<00:02:02.430> really<00:02:02.759> well

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
they're able to set that up really well

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.080 
they're able to set that up really well
the<00:02:03.450> other<00:02:03.630> thing<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.229> energy<00:02:04.890> recovery<00:02:05.729> so

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
the other thing is energy recovery so

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.839 
the other thing is energy recovery so
one<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.540> other<00:02:06.600> things<00:02:07.020> they've<00:02:07.380> done

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
one of the other things they've done

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.760 
one of the other things they've done
because<00:02:08.849> they<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:10.050> center<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.649> gravity

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
because they have the center of gravity

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.650 
because they have the center of gravity
closer<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> front<00:02:11.730> let's<00:02:12.090> just<00:02:12.360> say<00:02:12.510> it's

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
closer to the front let's just say it's

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.410 
closer to the front let's just say it's
a<00:02:12.720> 70/30

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
a 70/30

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.990 
a 70/30
split<00:02:13.720> weight<00:02:14.260> distribution<00:02:14.700> not<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:15.880> this

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
split weight distribution not that this

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.610 
split weight distribution not that this
is<00:02:16.150> coming<00:02:16.360> from<00:02:16.480> Nissan<00:02:16.990> this<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.290> just<00:02:17.470> kind

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
is coming from Nissan this is just kind

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.920 
is coming from Nissan this is just kind
of<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.770> guess<00:02:17.980> 70/30<00:02:18.880> split<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.330> let's<00:02:19.750> say

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
of a guess 70/30 split and let's say

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.470 
of a guess 70/30 split and let's say
under<00:02:20.140> braking<00:02:20.880> twenty<00:02:21.880> percent<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.360> load

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
under braking twenty percent of the load

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.199 
under braking twenty percent of the load
transfers<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.170> front<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:23.590> it's<00:02:23.739> a<00:02:24.209> 90/10

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
transfers to the front so it's a 90/10

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.240 
transfers to the front so it's a 90/10
split<00:02:25.239> so<00:02:25.840> 90<00:02:26.319> percent<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.770> braking<00:02:27.069> done

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
split so 90 percent of the braking done

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.610 
split so 90 percent of the braking done
by<00:02:27.400> these<00:02:27.459> front<00:02:27.940> tires<00:02:28.209> well<00:02:28.780> if<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.260> front

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
by these front tires well if the front

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.900 
by these front tires well if the front
wheels<00:02:29.890> are<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.280> ones<00:02:30.489> that<00:02:30.580> have<00:02:30.790> the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
wheels are the ones that have the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.880 
wheels are the ones that have the
kinetic<00:02:31.180> energy<00:02:31.600> recovery<00:02:31.900> system<00:02:32.470> hooked<00:02:32.680> up

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
kinetic energy recovery system hooked up

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.740 
kinetic energy recovery system hooked up
they're<00:02:33.700> going<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:33.910> be<00:02:34.000> getting<00:02:34.239> ninety

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
they're going to be getting ninety

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.720 
they're going to be getting ninety
percent<00:02:34.989> of<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.470> load<00:02:35.950> ninety<00:02:36.370> percent<00:02:36.520> of

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
percent of that load ninety percent of

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.030 
percent of that load ninety percent of
the<00:02:36.790> way<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.090> car<00:02:37.270> available<00:02:37.959> for<00:02:38.530> use<00:02:38.770> in

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
the way to the car available for use in

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.090 
the way to the car available for use in
kinetic<00:02:39.970> energy<00:02:40.269> recovery<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:41.260> if<00:02:41.620> our<00:02:41.830> car

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
kinetic energy recovery so if our car

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.550 
kinetic energy recovery so if our car
was<00:02:42.400> let's<00:02:42.970> just<00:02:43.239> pull<00:02:43.480> out<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.630> simple<00:02:44.410> number

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
was let's just pull out a simple number

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.770 
was let's just pull out a simple number
a<00:02:44.709> thousand<00:02:45.190> kilograms<00:02:45.459> then<00:02:46.180> we'd<00:02:46.360> have<00:02:46.540> nine

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
a thousand kilograms then we'd have nine

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.390 
a thousand kilograms then we'd have nine
hundred<00:02:46.810> kilograms<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.650> we<00:02:47.800> could<00:02:47.980> use<00:02:48.160> for

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
hundred kilograms that we could use for

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.430 
hundred kilograms that we could use for
kinetic<00:02:48.730> energy<00:02:49.030> recovery<00:02:49.300> now<00:02:50.140> if<00:02:50.230> we<00:02:50.319> look

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
kinetic energy recovery now if we look

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.490 
kinetic energy recovery now if we look
at<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.650> competition<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.720> say<00:02:52.720> they<00:02:52.989> have<00:02:53.260> a

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
at the competition and say they have a

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.590 
at the competition and say they have a
4060<00:02:54.430> split<00:02:54.459> because<00:02:55.060> it's<00:02:55.209> rear-wheel<00:02:55.569> drive

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
4060 split because it's rear-wheel drive

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.750 
4060 split because it's rear-wheel drive
and<00:02:55.989> they've<00:02:56.080> got<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.410> slight<00:02:56.920> rear<00:02:57.130> bias<00:02:57.400> and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
and they've got a slight rear bias and

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.430 
and they've got a slight rear bias and
then<00:02:57.850> on<00:02:57.970> your<00:02:58.060> braking<00:02:58.510> they<00:02:58.870> have<00:02:59.019> sixty

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
then on your braking they have sixty

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.289 
then on your braking they have sixty
percent<00:02:59.590> load<00:02:59.950> transfer<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.610> front<00:03:00.880> well

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
percent load transfer to the front well

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.550 
percent load transfer to the front well
that's<00:03:01.480> going<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.690> give<00:03:01.810> them<00:03:01.930> six<00:03:02.260> hundred

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
that's going to give them six hundred

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.350 
that's going to give them six hundred
kilograms<00:03:02.950> if<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.400> car<00:03:03.610> weighed<00:03:03.819> a<00:03:03.850> thousand

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
kilograms if the car weighed a thousand

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.660 
kilograms if the car weighed a thousand
kilograms<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:05.080> so<00:03:05.709> as<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:06.310> can<00:03:06.430> see<00:03:06.549> the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
kilograms and so as you can see the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.370 
kilograms and so as you can see the
Nissan<00:03:07.000> here<00:03:07.180> at<00:03:07.269> nine<00:03:07.480> hundred<00:03:07.690> versus<00:03:08.170> six

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
Nissan here at nine hundred versus six

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.030 
Nissan here at nine hundred versus six
hundred<00:03:08.620> fifty<00:03:09.130> percent<00:03:09.730> more<00:03:10.290> mass<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.890> use

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
hundred fifty percent more mass to use

hundred fifty percent more mass to use
for<00:03:12.250> kinetic<00:03:12.580> energy<00:03:12.880> recovery<00:03:13.000> so

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
for kinetic energy recovery so

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.050 
for kinetic energy recovery so
potentially<00:03:14.230> because<00:03:14.799> kinetic<00:03:15.489> energy<00:03:15.940> is<00:03:16.030> a

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
potentially because kinetic energy is a

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.550 
potentially because kinetic energy is a
function<00:03:16.269> of<00:03:16.510> mass<00:03:16.750> times<00:03:17.049> velocity<00:03:17.200> squared

they<00:03:18.340> have<00:03:18.519> a<00:03:18.670> potential<00:03:19.359> of<00:03:19.450> fifty<00:03:19.810> percent

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
they have a potential of fifty percent

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.229 
they have a potential of fifty percent
more<00:03:20.320> energy<00:03:20.350> that<00:03:20.859> they<00:03:20.950> could<00:03:21.100> recover<00:03:21.400> now

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
more energy that they could recover now

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.380 
more energy that they could recover now
yes<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:23.230> other<00:03:23.380> team<00:03:23.650> could<00:03:24.180> recover<00:03:25.180> energy

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
yes the other team could recover energy

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.630 
yes the other team could recover energy
from<00:03:25.600> both<00:03:25.989> axles<00:03:26.500> but<00:03:26.709> speaking<00:03:27.130> with<00:03:27.310> Nissan

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
from both axles but speaking with Nissan

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.039 
from both axles but speaking with Nissan
they<00:03:27.790> said<00:03:28.000> no<00:03:28.120> one<00:03:28.209> currently<00:03:28.420> did<00:03:28.750> this<00:03:28.900> they

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
they said no one currently did this they

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.050 
they said no one currently did this they
just<00:03:29.260> did<00:03:29.380> it<00:03:29.410> from<00:03:29.650> one<00:03:29.829> axle<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.880> there's

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
just did it from one axle and there's

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.729 
just did it from one axle and there's
kind<00:03:31.269> of<00:03:31.329> some<00:03:31.480> strange<00:03:31.810> restrictions<00:03:32.410> around

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
kind of some strange restrictions around

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.670 
kind of some strange restrictions around
that<00:03:32.950> but<00:03:33.370> basically<00:03:34.030> if<00:03:34.690> you<00:03:34.959> do<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:35.440> if<00:03:35.590> you

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
that but basically if you do that if you

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.590 
that but basically if you do that if you
do<00:03:35.859> recover<00:03:36.220> from<00:03:36.400> both<00:03:36.640> axles<00:03:37.060> you're<00:03:37.450> going

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
do recover from both axles you're going

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.090 
do recover from both axles you're going
to<00:03:37.660> be<00:03:37.720> adding<00:03:38.049> weight<00:03:38.320> to<00:03:38.350> your<00:03:38.650> vehicle<00:03:39.010> and

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
to be adding weight to your vehicle and

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.530 
to be adding weight to your vehicle and
you're<00:03:39.489> going<00:03:39.609> to<00:03:39.640> be<00:03:39.730> adding<00:03:39.850> complexity

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
you're going to be adding complexity

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.479 
you're going to be adding complexity
neither<00:03:41.290> of<00:03:41.470> those<00:03:41.590> are<00:03:41.769> desirable<00:03:42.310> so

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
neither of those are desirable so

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.160 
neither of those are desirable so
basically<00:03:42.850> this<00:03:43.060> comes<00:03:43.269> out<00:03:43.480> as<00:03:43.630> a<00:03:43.690> big

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
basically this comes out as a big

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.449 
basically this comes out as a big
advantage<00:03:44.440> for<00:03:44.709> Nissan<00:03:45.010> because<00:03:45.310> they're

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
advantage for Nissan because they're

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.460 
advantage for Nissan because they're
able<00:03:45.579> to<00:03:45.730> recover<00:03:46.090> more<00:03:46.420> energy<00:03:46.810> under

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
able to recover more energy under

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.610 
able to recover more energy under
braking<00:03:48.359> another<00:03:49.359> thing<00:03:49.660> to<00:03:49.930> talk<00:03:50.140> about<00:03:50.170> is

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
braking another thing to talk about is

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.860 
braking another thing to talk about is
the<00:03:50.859> frontal<00:03:51.370> area<00:03:51.640> of<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.910> vehicle<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.450> this

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
the frontal area of the vehicle and this

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.930 
the frontal area of the vehicle and this
comes<00:03:53.079> down<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.560> Nissan's<00:03:54.160> engine<00:03:54.670> placement

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
comes down to Nissan's engine placement

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.240 
comes down to Nissan's engine placement
because<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.989> engine<00:03:56.350> is<00:03:56.440> placed<00:03:56.620> up<00:03:56.950> front

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
because the engine is placed up front

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.160 
because the engine is placed up front
and<00:03:57.370> all<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.579> drivetrain<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.420> complexities

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
and all the drivetrain and complexities

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.319 
and all the drivetrain and complexities
are<00:03:59.350> up<00:03:59.709> front<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.340> back<00:04:00.579> of<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.850> vehicle<00:04:01.239> is

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
are up front the back of the vehicle is

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.569 
are up front the back of the vehicle is
very<00:04:01.420> open<00:04:02.049> and<00:04:02.260> what<00:04:02.650> this<00:04:02.769> allows<00:04:03.160> for<00:04:03.190> them

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
very open and what this allows for them

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.150 
very open and what this allows for them
to<00:04:03.730> do<00:04:03.970> is<00:04:04.239> to<00:04:04.660> have<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:05.019> diffuser<00:04:05.470> exit

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
to do is to have the diffuser exit

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.009 
to do is to have the diffuser exit
through<00:04:06.609> the<00:04:06.640> rear<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.150> vehicle<00:04:07.329> rather

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
through the rear of the vehicle rather

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.720 
through the rear of the vehicle rather
than<00:04:08.260> out<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.590> sides<00:04:08.920> of<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.250> vehicle<00:04:09.340> which

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
than out the sides of the vehicle which

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.039 
than out the sides of the vehicle which
is<00:04:09.760> more<00:04:10.000> traditionally<00:04:10.510> done<00:04:10.690> by<00:04:10.720> some<00:04:10.989> of

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
is more traditionally done by some of

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.080 
is more traditionally done by some of
the<00:04:11.139> other<00:04:11.170> teams<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:12.280> what<00:04:12.549> this<00:04:12.700> looks<00:04:12.910> like

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
the other teams so what this looks like

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.430 
the other teams so what this looks like
when<00:04:13.389> you're<00:04:13.510> looking<00:04:13.750> at<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.019> vehicle<00:04:14.350> is

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
when you're looking at the vehicle is

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.870 
when you're looking at the vehicle is
you've<00:04:14.560> got<00:04:14.769> your<00:04:14.889> air<00:04:15.010> coming<00:04:15.400> in<00:04:15.489> up<00:04:15.609> front

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
you've got your air coming in up front

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.940 
you've got your air coming in up front
it's<00:04:16.120> going<00:04:16.539> underneath<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.109> vehicle<00:04:17.229> going

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
it's going underneath the vehicle going

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.529 
it's going underneath the vehicle going
up<00:04:18.160> into<00:04:18.340> that<00:04:18.459> front<00:04:18.850> diffuser<00:04:19.299> and

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
up into that front diffuser and

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.080 
up into that front diffuser and
traveling<00:04:20.289> out<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.650> exit<00:04:21.039> of<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.669> vehicle

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
traveling out the exit of the vehicle

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.120 
traveling out the exit of the vehicle
now<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:22.960> other<00:04:23.260> cars<00:04:23.620> are<00:04:23.860> going<00:04:23.979> to<00:04:24.039> have

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
now the other cars are going to have

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.589 
now the other cars are going to have
that<00:04:24.280> air<00:04:24.460> coming<00:04:24.700> in<00:04:24.909> underneath<00:04:25.450> the

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
that air coming in underneath the

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.129 
that air coming in underneath the
vehicle<00:04:25.840> going<00:04:26.349> up<00:04:26.560> that<00:04:26.710> front

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
vehicle going up that front

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.050 
vehicle going up that front
user<00:04:27.319> and<00:04:27.560> then<00:04:27.860> exiting<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.490> sides<00:04:28.759> of<00:04:28.969> the

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
user and then exiting the sides of the

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.179 
user and then exiting the sides of the
vehicle<00:04:29.389> so<00:04:29.810> you<00:04:29.840> can<00:04:29.930> see<00:04:30.259> as<00:04:30.439> this<00:04:30.740> car<00:04:31.039> is

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:31.189 
vehicle so you can see as this car is

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:33.610 
vehicle so you can see as this car is
traveling<00:04:31.819> through<00:04:31.849> the<00:04:32.120> air<00:04:32.270> its<00:04:32.840> profile<00:04:33.469> is

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
traveling through the air its profile is

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.929 
traveling through the air its profile is
much<00:04:33.830> smaller<00:04:34.129> because<00:04:34.400> it<00:04:34.550> doesn't<00:04:34.819> have

00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:34.939 
much smaller because it doesn't have

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:36.580 
much smaller because it doesn't have
this<00:04:35.060> air<00:04:35.300> spilling<00:04:35.810> out<00:04:35.960> where<00:04:36.439> you're

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
this air spilling out where you're

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.559 
this air spilling out where you're
essentially<00:04:37.069> decreasing<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:38.090> frontal<00:04:38.449> area

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 
essentially decreasing the frontal area

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.059 
essentially decreasing the frontal area
because<00:04:39.229> you're<00:04:39.379> allowing<00:04:39.590> that<00:04:39.770> air<00:04:40.039> that's

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
because you're allowing that air that's

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:42.040 
because you're allowing that air that's
hitting<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.669> car<00:04:40.879> to<00:04:41.270> exit<00:04:41.599> out<00:04:41.659> the<00:04:41.719> rear

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
hitting the car to exit out the rear

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.100 
hitting the car to exit out the rear
rather<00:04:42.710> than<00:04:42.979> to<00:04:43.219> the<00:04:43.400> sides<00:04:43.699> and<00:04:44.210> so<00:04:44.930> that's

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
rather than to the sides and so that's

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.420 
rather than to the sides and so that's
another<00:04:45.289> advantage<00:04:45.590> that<00:04:46.009> they've<00:04:46.129> got<00:04:46.310> going

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
another advantage that they've got going

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.429 
another advantage that they've got going
for<00:04:46.879> them<00:04:47.029> as<00:04:47.210> far<00:04:47.659> as<00:04:47.810> aerodynamic

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:48.439 
for them as far as aerodynamic

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.760 
for them as far as aerodynamic
efficiency<00:04:48.740> now<00:04:49.639> getting<00:04:50.360> on<00:04:50.479> to<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:50.930> rear

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
efficiency now getting on to the rear

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.800 
efficiency now getting on to the rear
diffuser<00:04:52.159> and<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.370> rear<00:04:52.520> tires<00:04:52.849> because

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
diffuser and the rear tires because

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.290 
diffuser and the rear tires because
their<00:04:54.139> car<00:04:54.499> is<00:04:55.189> heavier<00:04:55.550> in<00:04:55.669> the<00:04:55.759> front<00:04:56.090> and

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
their car is heavier in the front and

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.909 
their car is heavier in the front and
the<00:04:56.629> front<00:04:56.659> wheels<00:04:57.080> are<00:04:57.289> doing<00:04:57.469> the<00:04:57.529> driving

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
the front wheels are doing the driving

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.980 
the front wheels are doing the driving
they've<00:04:58.219> used<00:04:58.249> the<00:04:58.639> largest<00:04:59.090> tires<00:04:59.300> possible

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
they've used the largest tires possible

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.899 
they've used the largest tires possible
at<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.259> front<00:05:00.590> but<00:05:01.039> because<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.460> rear<00:05:01.610> tires

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
at the front but because the rear tires

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:03.999 
at the front but because the rear tires
don't<00:05:02.270> need<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.659> be<00:05:02.779> that<00:05:02.930> large<00:05:03.379> they've

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
don't need to be that large they've

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.700 
don't need to be that large they've
actually<00:05:04.250> used<00:05:04.430> a<00:05:04.909> smaller<00:05:05.449> width<00:05:05.689> 9<00:05:06.020> inch<00:05:06.319> vs.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
actually used a smaller width 9 inch vs.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.519 
actually used a smaller width 9 inch vs.
14<00:05:07.279> in<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.969> rear<00:05:08.210> and<00:05:08.449> this<00:05:09.020> gives<00:05:09.259> them<00:05:09.469> a

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:09.529 
14 in the rear and this gives them a

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.010 
14 in the rear and this gives them a
pretty<00:05:09.830> specific<00:05:10.370> advantage<00:05:10.909> so<00:05:11.479> because

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
pretty specific advantage so because

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.379 
pretty specific advantage so because
their<00:05:12.259> tires<00:05:12.740> are<00:05:12.979> more<00:05:13.219> narrow<00:05:13.430> two<00:05:14.090> things

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
their tires are more narrow two things

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.260 
their tires are more narrow two things
can<00:05:14.599> happen<00:05:14.949> one<00:05:15.949> you<00:05:16.430> can<00:05:16.610> actually<00:05:16.759> increase

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
can happen one you can actually increase

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.149 
can happen one you can actually increase
the<00:05:17.539> range<00:05:17.779> of<00:05:18.050> your<00:05:18.229> diffuser<00:05:18.560> so<00:05:18.830> you<00:05:18.860> could

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 
the range of your diffuser so you could

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.519 
the range of your diffuser so you could
use<00:05:19.339> a<00:05:19.370> larger<00:05:19.789> diffuser<00:05:20.210> than<00:05:21.110> if<00:05:21.289> you<00:05:21.439> were

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:21.529 
use a larger diffuser than if you were

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.980 
use a larger diffuser than if you were
using<00:05:21.800> wider<00:05:22.250> tires<00:05:22.699> which<00:05:23.240> everyone<00:05:23.689> else<00:05:23.839> is

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
using wider tires which everyone else is

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.290 
using wider tires which everyone else is

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
14-inch tires in the rear because their

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.829 
14-inch tires in the rear because their

rear wheel drive and it makes sense from

of the vehicle the other thing this does

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.379 
of the vehicle the other thing this does
is<00:05:38.839> it<00:05:39.469> gives<00:05:39.589> them<00:05:39.830> a<00:05:39.949> gap<00:05:40.250> and<00:05:41.029> they<00:05:41.180> can

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
is it gives them a gap and they can

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:42.820 
is it gives them a gap and they can
manipulate<00:05:41.659> this<00:05:42.110> gap<00:05:42.379> you<00:05:42.409> know<00:05:42.710> with

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
manipulate this gap you know with

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.649 
manipulate this gap you know with
aerodynamic<00:05:43.370> features<00:05:43.759> so<00:05:44.300> that<00:05:44.330> they<00:05:44.539> don't

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:51.439 
spillover this diffuser is going to be

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:53.019 
spillover this diffuser is going to be
much<00:05:51.620> more<00:05:51.830> efficient<00:05:52.279> whereas<00:05:52.759> the<00:05:52.909> other

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:53.029 
much more efficient whereas the other

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:54.189 
much more efficient whereas the other
teams<00:05:53.300> are<00:05:53.449> going<00:05:53.569> to<00:05:53.629> have<00:05:53.779> to<00:05:53.899> choose

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
teams are going to have to choose

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.159 
teams are going to have to choose
between<00:05:54.710> using<00:05:55.279> a<00:05:55.759> large<00:05:56.360> diffuser<00:05:56.870> with<00:05:57.139> a

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
between using a large diffuser with a

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.570 
between using a large diffuser with a
lot<00:05:57.409> of<00:05:57.439> spillover<00:05:57.740> which<00:05:58.159> is<00:05:58.310> what<00:05:58.430> they'll

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
lot of spillover which is what they'll

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.929 
lot of spillover which is what they'll
end<00:05:58.759> up<00:05:58.879> choosing<00:05:59.180> or<00:05:59.479> a<00:05:59.539> smaller<00:06:00.379> diffuser

00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:00.939 
end up choosing or a smaller diffuser

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:03.189 
end up choosing or a smaller diffuser
where<00:06:01.939> they<00:06:02.089> have<00:06:02.270> spillover<00:06:02.569> from<00:06:02.839> these

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
where they have spillover from these

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.920 
where they have spillover from these
tires<00:06:03.500> creating<00:06:04.009> turbulent<00:06:04.430> air<00:06:04.610> and

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
tires creating turbulent air and

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.450 
tires creating turbulent air and
decreasing<00:06:05.930> the<00:06:05.960> efficiency<00:06:06.620> of<00:06:06.649> the

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
decreasing the efficiency of the

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.850 
decreasing the efficiency of the
diffuser<00:06:07.969> so<00:06:08.659> overall<00:06:08.960> there<00:06:09.199> definitely<00:06:09.500> are

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
diffuser so overall there definitely are

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.399 
diffuser so overall there definitely are
some<00:06:09.889> very<00:06:10.520> distinct<00:06:11.419> reasons<00:06:11.839> why<00:06:11.960> Nissan

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409 
some very distinct reasons why Nissan

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:14.920 
some very distinct reasons why Nissan
went<00:06:12.680> with<00:06:12.800> this<00:06:13.300> sort<00:06:14.300> of<00:06:14.360> drivetrain

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
went with this sort of drivetrain

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.320 
went with this sort of drivetrain
front-engine<00:06:15.560> front-wheel-drive<00:06:15.949> and<00:06:16.520> so<00:06:17.120> if
