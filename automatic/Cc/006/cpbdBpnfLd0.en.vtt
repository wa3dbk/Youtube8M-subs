00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:14.360
 to remind that today is the 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.900
 closing ceremony of the 19th day 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.420
 African prevention 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.860
 which is part of the 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.750
 celebration of the day against 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.439
 occupational risks retained by the oit 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.660
 and but also I did not hold back either by a 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.300
 coordinating body that's called 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.280
 the inter-African prevention of 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.440
 occupational hazards 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.900
 the ever-increasing complexity 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.190
 work processes 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.980
 changing conditions and environment 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.320
 of work and the variation of types of 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.049
 resulting risks give rise to 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.100
 accidents at work which our 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:56.979
 services will register 2462 cadic the 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.989
 shore in 2014 with four sectors 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:02.710
 activities considered the most 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.019
 accidentogenic ie industries 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.330
 agribusiness buildings and 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.549
 public works chemical industries 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.470
 and mines and quarries for the nail 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.689
 of the day 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.680
 it was marked by the adoption of a 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.800
 Cougar called the recommendations 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.840
 these recommendations are interesting to 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.810
 more than one title because being the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.570
 fruit of a concertation that brings together 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.670
 some of them convince the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.100
 actors from the world of work to 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.510
 employers of workers and doctors 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.700
 of occupational physicians 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.640
 but also of actors of society 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.590
 like orange and prevention 500 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.660
 borders but also the technicians of the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.369
 Ministry of Labor we have a kind 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.770
 brainstorming that allowed 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.790
 to lead to series of 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.009
 recommendations 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.530
 so as you see it was the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.810
 participation therefore seems these 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.450
 documents his recommendations owns 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.550
 an excellent tool to be able to do 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.649
 to do with the issue of health safety 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.660
 at work is not extremely 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.420
 important in our country passes like 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.030
 you know the question of security 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.370
 health at work the pluri is a 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.080
 small app question that does not have 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.970
 of interest is known but to look at 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.560
 closer it is eminently economical 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.270
 and as we said today 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.489
 it is a truism moreover she 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.590
 very strongly conditions 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.880
 economic and social performance 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.600
 obviously banks companies 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.030
 from the country 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.220
 overall we have him several 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.060
 recommendations beyond 11 but we 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.650
 have chosen 11 fabre recommendations to 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.019
 implement the fastest 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.030
 possible if you followed the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.890
 presentation 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.980
 these eleven recommendations will be made 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.739
 made by long by October 2015 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.660
 so the implementation can be done 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:53.519
 very quickly and most relevant to 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.950
 our eyes are not that others do not 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.440
 are no less the most relevant it's 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.100
 synergy of actions at the level of 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.680
 structures mostly state structures 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.540
 for really taking care of 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.190
 health issues security we in 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.050
 will have a lot of problems for 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.300
 work with everyone else 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.040
 state structures to be able to 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.800
 take charge of these issues there so 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.540
 this point is fundamental to the 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.760
 recommendation is for all actors 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.800
 so they were unanimous to validate 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.380
 this point there and we will put in 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.330
 work of the best we can in 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.090
 as soon as possible this 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.080
 recommendation to take charge 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.290
 these questions another we have 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.590
 communication we planned to do 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.140
 advocacy and put in place 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.210
 actions to better communicate on 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.700
 prevention activities that we lead 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.830
 that 's not just happening during 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.510
 of April of each year it is 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.370
 goes from day to day it's so 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.560
 permanent that we do the 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.780
 prevention and we will make more 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.780
 visible his actions on the ground
