00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
certain number of pages I select fit two

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.799 
certain number of pages I select fit two
and<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.670> tells<00:00:53.940> us<00:00:54.149> how<00:00:54.329> many<00:00:54.390> pages

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
and this is this tells us how many pages

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.319 
and this is this tells us how many pages
wide<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.649> should<00:00:55.829> fit<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.760> how<00:00:56.910> many<00:00:57.090> pages

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
wide it should fit and how many pages

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.959 
wide it should fit and how many pages
tall<00:00:57.809> okay<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.430> mess<00:00:59.609> with<00:00:59.640> these

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
tall okay so you can mess with these

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.180 
tall okay so you can mess with these
things<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> squeeze<00:01:01.710> down<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
things and get it to squeeze down to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.119 
things and get it to squeeze down to
what<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.520> need<00:01:02.699> sometimes<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:04.920> would<00:01:05.100> be

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
what you need sometimes it would be

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.100 
what you need sometimes it would be
convenient<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.090> everything<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.840> page

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
convenient to get everything on one page

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.830 
convenient to get everything on one page
but<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.890> does<00:01:08.369> not<00:01:08.580> look<00:01:09.000> right<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.570> way

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
but it just does not look right it's way

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.230 
but it just does not look right it's way
too<00:01:09.900> big<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.590> fit<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.860> one<00:01:10.979> page<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.700> it'll<00:01:12.090> be

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
too big to fit on one page so it'll be

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.899 
too big to fit on one page so it'll be
super<00:01:12.960> tiny<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.439> won't<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.770> legible<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.790> you

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
super tiny it won't be legible so you

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.570 
super tiny it won't be legible so you
just<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.420> see<00:01:16.200> what's<00:01:16.500> possible<00:01:17.340> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
just have to see what's possible and

just have to see what's possible and
tinker<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.780> tall<00:01:19.140> usually<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> mess<00:01:20.009> with
