00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.209 
because quite honestly quite often women
we're<00:06:14.309> not<00:06:14.489> thinking<00:06:14.669> about<00:06:14.909> anything<00:06:16.219> it's

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
we're not thinking about anything it's

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:22.279 
we're not thinking about anything it's
just<00:06:17.549> quiet<00:06:17.789> and<00:06:20.269> I<00:06:21.269> was<00:06:21.689> thinking<00:06:22.139> of

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
just quiet and I was thinking of

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.229 
just quiet and I was thinking of
continuing<00:06:22.679> this<00:06:23.009> job<00:06:23.249> but<00:06:23.609> I<00:06:23.789> can't<00:06:23.999> do<00:06:24.119> it

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:24.239 
continuing this job but I can't do it

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:28.669 
continuing this job but I can't do it
when<00:06:24.419> the<00:06:24.989> ship<00:06:25.199> is<00:06:25.229> here<00:06:25.559> it's<00:06:25.799> a<00:06:27.529> sham<00:06:28.529> we'll

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:28.679 
when the ship is here it's a sham we'll

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:30.049 
when the ship is here it's a sham we'll
have<00:06:28.799> everything

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:30.059 
have everything

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:33.919 
have everything
which<00:06:30.929> I<00:06:31.049> even<00:06:31.079> attended<00:06:31.559> but<00:06:32.269> I'll<00:06:33.269> cross<00:06:33.899> it

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:33.929 
which I even attended but I'll cross it

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:37.009 
which I even attended but I'll cross it
out<00:06:34.139> here<00:06:34.409> just<00:06:34.559> a<00:06:34.679> second
