00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.679
 favorite recipe for this for these 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.619
 technicians we need half a kilo yard 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.930

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.960

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.029
 and low fat cottage cheese delicious day 2 this 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.279
 2 tablespoons of semolina instead of sugar I 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.689
 I usually use just cinnamon but now 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.780
 i don't have just caribbean give it 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.489

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.079
 also i will add your flour but i wont 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.340
 show me how I will quench the flour and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.340
 then whether to communicate in general all this 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.110
 mix then add flour I already 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.989
 show you directly what is mine 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.210
 turned out the dough and what do I do next 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:58.170
 so I mixed all the components of cottage cheese 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:59.879
 I semolina vanilla measles extinguished soda and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.219
 added makey makey truth me not 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.170
 quite enough so I do not know there that 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.250
 may be afraid that they will 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.729
 a little sticky 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.040
 Here is such a mess I got now 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.909
 all this should stand for 30 minutes 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.900
 brew and in half an hour I will put 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.680
 now the timer i will start baking them and so 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.330
 Here are all the bridges to the courtyard on the bridge 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.840
 I got the test 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.619
 the number of glaciers that is 1 2 3 6 8 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.479
 pieces my eye problems rush 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.780
 in the eyes 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:40.610
 there is nothing low for you all at all I will say 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.479
 what do these horizontal bars do 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.689
 parchment paper but I have it 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.820
 ended so I took the pan 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.300
 which is the easiest to wash it made on 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.660
 her because I don't like them 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.110
 wash the dishes here in general now I'm all 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.740
 this 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.140
 I put in the oven and take out in 40 minutes 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.770
 I hope that despite the fact that they 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:09.530
 just on the matrix will be baked 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:17.090
 everything went well 18 minutes went by and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:19.970
 not even 18-19 probably know how you are there 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.130
 visible but cheesecakes look but they are not 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.410
 yellow they teach under two very great 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.330
 very swollen turned out some 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.280
 chamomile i have variegated through 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.470
 twelve minutes I'll get them and show 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.070
 you what they are of course option 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.890
 I made such cheesecakes of course 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.870
 Forms I have problems as always but in 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.820
 In general, it is not the form that the main thing is small 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.240
 from colored mya soft such cool 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.490
 nicer box sprinkled on top of coconut 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.890
 I donâ€™t really like chips 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.530
 even tastier than usual as I will 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.580
 worried that without permanent paper 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.290
 they are about parchment paper they are some 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.760
 there will be no sticking there 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.850
 beautiful cast I tried everything 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:15.140
 I hope that someone inspired me 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:18.290
 to create something like that and someone 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.690
 30 seems interesting well here in general 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.810

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.620
