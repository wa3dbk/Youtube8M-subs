it<00:00:22.859> was<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.039> worst<00:00:23.189> pistol<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:24.119> after

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
it was the worst pistol but after

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.849

XP just using your pistols now this does

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.420 
XP just using your pistols now this does
seem<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> ton<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.110> XP<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.129> using

seem like a ton of XP to get just using

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.639 
seem like a ton of XP to get just using
a<00:00:53.489> pistol<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.480> used<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.780> bunch<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.079> XP<00:00:55.410> boost

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
a pistol so I used a bunch of XP boost

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.799 
a pistol so I used a bunch of XP boost
and<00:00:55.860> plate<00:00:56.010> CQC<00:00:56.640> matches<00:00:57.030> until<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.420> finally

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and plate CQC matches until I finally

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.689 
and plate CQC matches until I finally
got<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.140> now<00:00:58.739> keep<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.039> mind<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.309> will<00:00:59.489> take<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
got it now keep in mind this will take a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.369 
got it now keep in mind this will take a
very<00:00:59.969> long<00:01:00.180> time<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.570> unlock<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.050> don't<00:01:01.289> expect

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
very long time to unlock so don't expect

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.900 
very long time to unlock so don't expect
to<00:01:01.739> get<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:01.980> within<00:01:02.129> an<00:01:02.340> hour<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.579> playing

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
to get it within an hour of playing

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.450 
to get it within an hour of playing
because<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.570> most<00:01:03.840> likely<00:01:04.110> won't<00:01:04.460> let's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
because you most likely won't let's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.010 
because you most likely won't let's
start<00:01:05.670> getting<00:01:05.939> into<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> stats<00:01:06.479> portion<00:01:06.900> of

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
start getting into the stats portion of

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.929 
start getting into the stats portion of
the<00:01:07.140> 44<00:01:07.590> Magnum<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:08.130> start<00:01:08.369> off<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.640> weapon

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the 44 Magnum to start off this weapon

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.730 
the 44 Magnum to start off this weapon
is<00:01:09.060> semi-automatic<00:01:09.390> which<00:01:10.049> explains<00:01:10.530> why<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
is semi-automatic which explains why the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.740 
is semi-automatic which explains why the
rate<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.130> fire<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.340> 150<00:01:12.210> rounds<00:01:12.510> per<00:01:12.630> minute

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
rate of fire is 150 rounds per minute

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.440 
rate of fire is 150 rounds per minute
this<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.680> very<00:01:13.890> very<00:01:14.130> slow<00:01:14.460> even<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> pistol

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
this is very very slow even for a pistol

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.149 
this is very very slow even for a pistol
from<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:15.990> experience<00:01:16.409> using<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.770> weapon<00:01:17.100> I

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
from my experience using this weapon I

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.830 
from my experience using this weapon I
know<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> time<00:01:17.820> between<00:01:17.970> firing<00:01:18.570> shots

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
know that the time between firing shots

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.780 
know that the time between firing shots
is<00:01:19.049> extremely<00:01:19.650> slow<00:01:19.799> compared<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> other

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
is extremely slow compared to the other

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.789 
is extremely slow compared to the other
pistols<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.509> don't<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:21.900> why<00:01:22.049> guys<00:01:22.259> decided<00:01:22.680> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
pistols I don't know why guys decided to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.080 
pistols I don't know why guys decided to
mess<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.580> does<00:01:23.729> give<00:01:23.939> this

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
mess with it but it does give this

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.609 
mess with it but it does give this
weapon<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.420> huge<00:01:24.689> disadvantage<00:01:25.049> against

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
weapon a huge disadvantage against

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.770 
weapon a huge disadvantage against
Infantry's<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.430> fully<00:01:26.670> auto<00:01:26.880> weapons<00:01:27.299> if

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
Infantry's and fully auto weapons if

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.240 
Infantry's and fully auto weapons if
you're<00:01:27.960> planning<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.350> using<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.799> weapon<00:01:29.009> I

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
you're planning on using this weapon I

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.710 
you're planning on using this weapon I
suggest<00:01:29.640> doing<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.090> only<00:01:30.360> when<00:01:30.570> you're

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
suggest doing so only when you're

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.390 
suggest doing so only when you're
sniping<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.590> reason<00:01:31.860> for<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.250> because

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
sniping the reason for this is because

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.280 
sniping the reason for this is because
it<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.000> very<00:01:33.270> good<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.750> finishing<00:01:34.079> off

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
it is very good for finishing off

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.170 
it is very good for finishing off
enemies<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.860> got<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> hit<00:01:35.189> marker<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.970> will

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
enemies you got a hit marker on it will

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.910 
enemies you got a hit marker on it will
kill<00:01:36.390> every<00:01:36.659> time<00:01:36.900> if<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> enemy<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.530> damaged

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
kill every time if the enemy is damaged

kill every time if the enemy is damaged
and<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.250> increases<00:01:38.850> your<00:01:39.000> chances<00:01:39.360> of

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540

is<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.570> attach<00:02:00.840> flashlights<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:01.920> you

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
is to attach flashlights to it so you

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.830 
is to attach flashlights to it so you

can blind your enemies this makes it

can blind your enemies this makes it
really<00:02:03.960> difficult<00:02:04.200> for<00:02:04.500> them<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.740> hit<00:02:04.979> you

really difficult for them to hit you
accurately<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:06.030> enough<00:02:06.270> time<00:02:06.479> for<00:02:06.540> you

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.270 
accurately in just enough time for you
to<00:02:06.930> fire<00:02:07.079> off<00:02:07.320> two<00:02:07.530> rounds<00:02:07.560> at<00:02:07.979> them

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
to fire off two rounds at them

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.130 
to fire off two rounds at them

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
attaching a compensator to this gun will

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.050 
attaching a compensator to this gun will
reduce<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.709> recoil<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.640> isn't<00:02:11.940> really

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
reduce the recoil but it isn't really

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.270 
reduce the recoil but it isn't really
necessary<00:02:12.690> if<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.410> don't<00:02:13.620> like<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.920> Magnum

iron<00:02:14.520> sights<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.060> recommend<00:02:15.600> using<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.080> ghost

iron sights I recommend using the ghost

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.990 
iron sights I recommend using the ghost
ring<00:02:16.620> because<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.130> really<00:02:17.400> clean<00:02:17.670> looking
