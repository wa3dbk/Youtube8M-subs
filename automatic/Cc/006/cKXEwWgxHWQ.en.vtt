enough credit for the fish I was

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.000 
enough credit for the fish I was
catching<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.269> well<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.080> got<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.710> actually

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
catching but well I got this I actually

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.750 
catching but well I got this I actually
compared<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.550> some<00:00:26.699> cheap<00:00:27.539> repla<00:00:28.550> they<00:00:29.550> came

compared it some cheap repla they came
out<00:00:29.880> exactly<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> same<00:00:30.750> but<00:00:31.170> with<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.560> said

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
digital scale is dead so this one I can

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.080 
digital scale is dead so this one I can
test<00:00:55.770> out<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> morning<00:00:56.280> before<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.610> go<00:00:56.699> make

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
test out the morning before I go make

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.420 
test out the morning before I go make
sure<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.390> good<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:58.800> won't<00:00:58.949> miss<00:00:59.129> out<00:00:59.309> on

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
so no more trying to figure it out in

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.289 
so no more trying to figure it out in
the<00:01:09.659> head<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:11.280> catch<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.640> fish<00:01:11.820> add<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
the head so you can catch a fish add it

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.810 
the head so you can catch a fish add it
in<00:01:12.799> you<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:13.979> take<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.250> all<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.369> way<00:01:14.460> up<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.790> a

heavy-duty<00:01:31.170> spring<00:01:31.979> activated<00:01:32.400> clamp<00:01:33.270> that

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
heavy-duty spring activated clamp that

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.850 
heavy-duty spring activated clamp that
you<00:01:33.750> would<00:01:33.869> think<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.380> thing<00:01:34.560> when

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
hold a big fish but I've caught up to

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.280 
hold a big fish but I've caught up to
almost<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.909> six<00:01:39.119> pound<00:01:39.270> fish<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.960> held<00:01:40.110> it

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
with no problem so that's fine the only

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.060 
with no problem so that's fine the only
thing<00:01:45.270> that's<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.630> little<00:01:45.899> confusing<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.500> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
thing that's a little confusing on it
