our dinner last you about nine hours ish
unlisted<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.930> wouldn't<00:00:58.260> running<00:00:58.500> Android<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
unlisted it wouldn't running Android it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.939 
unlisted it wouldn't running Android it
would<00:00:59.609> run<00:00:59.940> about<00:01:00.059> 40<00:01:00.480> right<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.530> obviously

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
would run about 40 right so obviously

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.740 
would run about 40 right so obviously
you<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.250> see<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.820> people<00:01:03.210> who<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.660> on

other thing that I kind of like about
this<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:08.430> sweet<00:01:08.729> development<00:01:09.270> board<00:01:09.479> here

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
this this sweet development board here

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.070 
this this sweet development board here
so<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.979> running<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.790> TI<00:01:12.330> omap

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
so this is running on the TI omap

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.340 
so this is running on the TI omap
processor<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.729> GI<00:01:15.210> own<00:01:15.450> map<00:01:15.689> shows<00:01:15.960> up<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.229> a

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
processor so GI own map shows up in a

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.350 
processor so GI own map shows up in a
variety<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:17.100> different<00:01:17.369> type<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.850> devices

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
variety of different type of devices

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.330 
variety of different type of devices
that<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.630> were<00:01:18.720> all<00:01:18.840> very<00:01:18.869> excited<00:01:19.229> about<00:01:19.590> like

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that we were all very excited about like

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.039 
that we were all very excited about like
say<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> playbook<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.290> nook<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:24.020> well<00:01:25.020> I

say the playbook and the nook and well I
was<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.350> at<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> Mego<00:01:25.830> conference<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.049> I'm

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
was just at the Mego conference so I'm

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.310 
was just at the Mego conference so I'm
not<00:01:28.979> I'm<00:01:29.159> not<00:01:29.189> excited<00:01:30.030> about<00:01:30.240> me<00:01:30.630> go<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.229> I'm

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
not I'm not excited about me go but I'm

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.440 
not I'm not excited about me go but I'm
interested<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.369> fact<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.880> they're

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
interested in the fact that they're

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.539 
interested in the fact that they're
looking<00:01:33.540> at<00:01:33.780> porting<00:01:34.200> me<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.979> TI<00:01:35.159> OMAP

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
looking at porting me going to TI OMAP

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.310 
looking at porting me going to TI OMAP
right<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.180> then<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:36.659> thinking<00:01:36.930> about<00:01:36.990> all

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
right and then I was thinking about all

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.170 
right and then I was thinking about all
the<00:01:37.439> different<00:01:37.560> other<00:01:38.220> TI<00:01:38.430> OMAP<00:01:38.700> parts<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the different other TI OMAP parts you

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.819 
the different other TI OMAP parts you
could<00:01:39.329> port<00:01:39.659> four<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.350> Two<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.560> then<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.770> was

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
could port four on Two and then I was

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.140 
could port four on Two and then I was
kind<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.040> thinking<00:01:41.100> well<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.790> sub<00:01:41.939> 200

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
kind of thinking well this is sub 200

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.200 
kind of thinking well this is sub 200
right<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.470> dev<00:01:43.680> kit<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.250> TI<00:01:44.399> OMAP<00:01:44.729> would<00:01:45.090> be

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
right and a dev kit for TI OMAP would be

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.090 
right and a dev kit for TI OMAP would be
like<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.630> don't<00:01:45.780> know<00:01:45.840> thousands<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.799> dollars

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
like I don't know thousands of dollars

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.230 
like I don't know thousands of dollars
so<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:48.090> has<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.930> know

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
so this has like a you know

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.060 
so this has like a you know
side<00:01:49.479> for<00:01:49.750> anyone<00:01:50.049> who's<00:01:50.200> who's<00:01:50.439> you<00:01:50.950> know

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
about eight weeks and it's pretty cool

so<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.900> can<00:02:17.019> see<00:02:18.630> let's<00:02:19.630> just<00:02:19.690> do<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:19.989> little

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
so you can see let's just do a little

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.559 
so you can see let's just do a little
little<00:02:21.370> swapping<00:02:21.940> so<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.239> see<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:22.510> is

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
little swapping so you see this is

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.820 
little swapping so you see this is
actually<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.110> working<00:02:23.470> copy<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.459> windows

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.560

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
so if you actually have honeycomb you

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.170 
so if you actually have honeycomb you
can<00:02:28.690> put<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:28.960> on<00:02:29.050> if<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.620> have<00:02:30.690> web<00:02:32.190> play<00:02:33.190> up<00:02:33.400> or
