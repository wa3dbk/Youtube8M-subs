00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.759
 so on and on with the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.490
 gold medals from gta 5 in the six 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.590
 mission is called marriage counseling and there is 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.280
 Three mission goals to be met 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:18.109
 to make the 100 percent and there 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.080
 just to hold the gold medal 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.359
 the first and most important thing 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.789
 whole spix is we have to watch that 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.519
 our vehicle does not hurt 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.800
 no harm but only little harm 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.390
 are as you see then in the further 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.130
 course of the video 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.020
 do several things with it and become too 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.430
 more often argued but I never 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.620
 things really hard so you have to 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.360
 watch out so you are not too fast and 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.800
 which is the same as the first pictures 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.550
 can you start at the beginning? 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.469
 you just follow the red dot now 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.020
 In the tennis teacher, the one with you 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.739
 cheated on your wife has been watching there 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.680
 in front of the cars house or a car one 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:03.539
 quite normal that you lose the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.820
 you just follow the orange one 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.240
 track the navi i still call it 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.320
 I'm sorry if I do not do it all 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.570
 exactly that the first one must 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.570
 watch that 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.119
 the dare to harm as little as possible 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.070
 and secondly, you have to be extreme 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.240
 so that you and the five and a half years 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.640
 here the car brakes automatically 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.430
 also continues without tennis teaching and stands 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.490
 they had kept blabla and that 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.549
 third is the beer of three opponents 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.909
 Killing a vehicle would then have to happen sooner 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.649
 So just end up here 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.810
 get off the train, mika pulls 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.649
 and you're pulling the house now with you 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:56.600
 the car gets off again there is gas 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:59.530
 Gives gas and tries the house 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.530
 tear 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.509
 May 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.020
 I think he has my vehicle almost 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.190
 no harm done 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.019
 but later on there are still some opponents 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.140
 then shoot in and then be 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.890
 the discs hit and yes 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.410
 it still counts as a minimal apple 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.920
 minimal as a minimum damage 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.640
 Now the house is falling cats have 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.860
 I skipped 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:37.660
 was and yes it is expecting their 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:38.519
 continue to surprise track to what 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.260
 seen 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:46.630
 Ideally, it's quick as it goes with it 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.910
 you also in the magazine very much 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.590
 watch out here I see I have the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.280
 rammed frontal but only slightly because of that 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.280
 is not so bad 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.060
 which in turn installed 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.549
 and there is time everywhere 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.049
 ten is enough for me even though i am 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.049
 now really long smoke 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.670
 sees the two points 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.380
 Altogether, there are four people sitting in the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.239
 vehicle or in the two 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.950
 vehicles in it 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.680
 I take I 'm already the directions 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.910
 to shoot out of the car 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.810
 I have to turn off three people like that 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.810
 also strengthened politically 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.829
 that was the number 13 people must now 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.810
 I'm currently in hurry and then 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.180
 I have to be careful that they are not me 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.250
 frame or me somehow too much dead 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:52.189
 shoot because then the gold medal 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:53.859
 also gone yes I do not care about your singing 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:57.590
 is the number two 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:59.120
 Now I've done it but it works 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.670
 I was still around too 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.489
 generally relative to lee relatively ins 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:08.659
 Now I have three, I have to live 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.250
 fourth from now no longer so 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.730
 I can switch now from rising to 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.160
 Shoot or have the samba I have it 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.109
 I'm just done on this crossroads 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.949
 I stayed here then 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.620
 driving home knows how to save time 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:27.740
 I do not know how long I needed 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.849
 I have you just get out 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.820
 then comes a cutscene that will 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:33.740
 skipped and then you will 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.169
 hopefully like me with one 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.970
 gold medal rewards four minutes 20 only 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.889
 takes a minute ten seconds because 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.419
 I too fast 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.900
 all three mission goals accomplished 100 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.880
 done gold medal received 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.530
 I hope that helped by the 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.530
 next time until the seventh video
