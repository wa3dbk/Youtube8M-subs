00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 well it him everyone knows his 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.460
 belt today we end up 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.589
 like a new unpacking so the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.050
 unpacking the samsung galaxy s 4 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.290
 we will unpack it right away so 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.570
 here is the box with a very voice effect 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.730
 nice to touch and then to the eye a 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.869
 very pretty to watch 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.039
 I just opened the small steps 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.720
 little papers that's all to facilitate 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.869
 the opening because it with thin 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.760
 it's not very easy so on the side 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.109
 we have the inscription samsung galaxy s 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.500
 4 with the spike recycle logo here it is 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.059
 see that it's 100% recycled certified 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.270
 from above or nothing special 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.050
 and from under pareos the product I the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.340
 chosen in white white fake 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.960
 so in the back we go all 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.210
 device capabilities 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.670
 it's good that it's the cjga model that 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.640
 I love and I took and after we see 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.520
 all its features 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:01.980
 here it is compared to an iphone box 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.660
 4s white as cold as the box of 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.159
 garaf 6 4 a little bit higher 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.740
 it's normal we have a 5 inch screen 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.540
 and on the iphone 4s we have a screen a 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.420
 3.5 inch screen 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.860
 so she's barely bigger but we 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.380
 has a much bigger smartphone 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.360
 level length level length it's 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.610
 almost the same 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.590
 so here I order them on pixmania 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.299
 I received them in about 4 to 5 days 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.630
 it's pretty fast free shipping 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.079
 with a follow-up is taken there was a 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.570
 pretty good price -30% so bah I 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.009
 pray them these are these camps if you 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.009
 order on pixmania you will receive it 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.570
 in a package like his voice in there 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.190
 so it's a little light protection 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.360
 but 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.950
 it's still well protected 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.710
 so we'll see that now the most 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.740
 interesting is the device 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.600
 this is what shocks us all 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.090
 right away it's this 5 inch screen 1 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.920
 which is really huge that's it 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.050
 that he will be interesting about the device 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.050
 so there when we pull the camera itself 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.830
 lips the very light in hand it's 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:14.570
 normal is not the battery is very 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:18.100
 good white but I like no after 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.600
 do we have when we notice 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.560
 notice is recycling a samsung 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.220
 they are really about recycling 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.620
 Protect the planet 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.450
 that's really on it so we have a 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.790
 little guarantee road and then all 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.170
 the small no 10 has for use 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.250
 do not know how to use it 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.520
 nothing special after the inside we go 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.650
 so find the micro usb cable for 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.830
 connect to the computer or block 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.830
 sector 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:53.120
 the sector block to do that in order 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.520
 if I can remove it here is the blog 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.290
 sector small blocks trith bygone 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:03.830
 white that is good that it would go 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:05.750
 with the device and so deus of 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.300
 Replacement for intra headphones 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.620
 auricular for the shapes of your 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.260
 ears there are some of the smallest 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.209
 fat that's fine though we can 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.290
 choose the right size so there the kit 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:21.350
 hands free headphones it seems to me 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.900
 also it will be intra intra 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.160
 auricular on the other hand it's not bad 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.340
 depends on people is an ace and supports 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.080
 not and then of course ben the battery of 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.120
 the 1600 battery big camera 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.100
 thousands loses so it's a pretty 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.350
 good battery 1 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.480
 that's all for the interior of 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.739
 this box 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.140
 So here is the unpacking of samsung 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.940
 galaxy s 4g would be shortly so a test 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.670
 then I'll switch it on myself 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.460
 and tulio getting started 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.600
 it is useless 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.370
 constrained world is experiencing a setting 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.660
 road and then if not I tell you a 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.660
