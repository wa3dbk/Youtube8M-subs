00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
wonder does it have BPA in it because

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.630 
wonder does it have BPA in it because
there's<00:00:30.289> been<00:00:30.410> a<00:00:30.439> lot<00:00:30.590> of<00:00:30.619> talk<00:00:30.830> about<00:00:30.859> BPA<00:00:31.369> and

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
there's been a lot of talk about BPA and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.209 
there's been a lot of talk about BPA and
what<00:00:32.359> I<00:00:32.390> want<00:00:32.719> to<00:00:32.809> say<00:00:32.960> is<00:00:33.109> I<00:00:33.289> would<00:00:33.710> content<00:00:34.039> it

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
what I want to say is I would content it

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.360 
what I want to say is I would content it
doesn't<00:00:34.640> really<00:00:34.789> matter<00:00:35.679> and<00:00:36.679> the<00:00:36.829> reason<00:00:37.249> it

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
doesn't really matter and the reason it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.819 
doesn't really matter and the reason it
doesn't<00:00:37.550> matter<00:00:37.879> is<00:00:38.120> because<00:00:38.539> this<00:00:39.440> one<00:00:39.649> was

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
doesn't matter is because this one was

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.160 
doesn't matter is because this one was
made<00:00:39.889> by<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:40.550> know<00:00:40.639> obviously<00:00:40.999> when<00:00:41.870> I<00:00:41.899> got

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
home they'll obviously never use this

home they'll obviously never use this
again<00:00:43.850> but<00:00:44.420> when<00:00:45.050> when<00:00:45.620> I<00:00:45.649> got<00:00:45.889> home<00:00:46.069> I<00:00:46.129> looked

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
tell you that they were not quick to fix

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.220 
tell you that they were not quick to fix
the<00:01:06.560> problem<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.040> so<00:01:07.850> when<00:01:08.210> I<00:01:08.240> saw<00:01:08.630> them<00:01:08.930> the

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
the problem and so when I saw them the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.520 
the problem and so when I saw them the
manufacturer<00:01:09.980> it<00:01:10.720> made<00:01:11.720> me<00:01:11.840> think<00:01:12.080> well<00:01:12.290> it's

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
manufacturer it made me think well it's

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.950 
manufacturer it made me think well it's
more<00:01:13.040> likely<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.460> have<00:01:13.520> BPA<00:01:13.910> in<00:01:14.120> it<00:01:14.270> than<00:01:14.810> the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
more likely to have BPA in it than the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.660 
more likely to have BPA in it than the
identical<00:01:15.500> thing<00:01:15.710> that<00:01:15.950> made<00:01:16.160> by<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:16.340> different

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
identical thing that made by a different

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.340 
identical thing that made by a different
company<00:01:16.700> but<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.570> reason<00:01:17.750> I<00:01:17.960> would<00:01:18.020> say<00:01:18.260> it

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
company but the reason I would say it

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.010 
company but the reason I would say it
doesn't<00:01:18.530> really<00:01:18.770> matter<00:01:19.040> is<00:01:19.340> because<00:01:20.150> if<00:01:20.360> they

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
doesn't really matter is because if they

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.130 
doesn't really matter is because if they
don't<00:01:21.980> have<00:01:22.220> BPA<00:01:22.580> in<00:01:22.790> it<00:01:22.910> what<00:01:23.480> that<00:01:23.660> means<00:01:23.960> is

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
don't have BPA in it what that means is

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.990 
don't have BPA in it what that means is
that<00:01:24.200> they<00:01:24.470> have<00:01:24.620> taken<00:01:25.010> the<00:01:25.100> BPA<00:01:25.460> out<00:01:25.700> and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
that they have taken the BPA out and

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.940 
that they have taken the BPA out and
they<00:01:26.720> have<00:01:26.750> replaced<00:01:27.320> it<00:01:27.530> with<00:01:27.560> something

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
they have replaced it with something

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.010 
they have replaced it with something
else<00:01:28.190> and<00:01:28.520> why<00:01:29.480> did<00:01:29.690> they<00:01:29.810> make<00:01:29.990> that

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
else and why did they make that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.860 
else and why did they make that
replacement<00:01:30.470> whether<00:01:31.220> it's<00:01:31.430> BPA<00:01:31.820> or<00:01:32.240> LED<00:01:32.630> or

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
replacement whether it's BPA or LED or

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.420 
replacement whether it's BPA or LED or
something<00:01:33.170> else<00:01:33.320> they<00:01:33.740> took<00:01:33.950> out<00:01:34.160> some

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
something else they took out some

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.550 
something else they took out some
chemical<00:01:35.360> constituent<00:01:35.930> of<00:01:35.990> their<00:01:36.170> product

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
chemical constituent of their product

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.080 
chemical constituent of their product
and<00:01:36.620> they<00:01:37.130> replaced<00:01:37.460> it<00:01:37.580> because<00:01:37.880> either

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
and they replaced it because either

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.930 
and they replaced it because either
there<00:01:38.720> was<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.870> regulator<00:01:39.470> or<00:01:39.710> there<00:01:40.370> was<00:01:40.520> media

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
there was a regulator or there was media

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.720 
there was a regulator or there was media
that<00:01:41.540> resulted<00:01:42.050> in<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:42.260> then<00:01:42.590> thinking<00:01:43.010> we

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
that resulted in that then thinking we

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.730 
that resulted in that then thinking we
will<00:01:43.909> sell<00:01:44.180> more<00:01:44.510> of<00:01:44.570> these<00:01:44.870> cute<00:01:45.710> little

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
will sell more of these cute little

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.850 
will sell more of these cute little
balloon<00:01:46.540> infested<00:01:47.540> cups<00:01:49.180> with<00:01:50.710> without<00:01:51.710> the

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
balloon infested cups with without the

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.390 
balloon infested cups with without the
BPA<00:01:52.190> in<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:53.350> so<00:01:54.350> they're<00:01:54.770> taking<00:01:55.070> out

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
BPA in it and so they're taking out

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.520 
BPA in it and so they're taking out
something<00:01:56.060> that's<00:01:56.210> been<00:01:56.360> tested<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:56.930> we<00:01:57.350> know

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
something that's been tested and we know

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.899

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.969 
something about the science and
replacing<00:01:59.570> it<00:01:59.659> with<00:01:59.870> something<00:02:00.260> that<00:02:00.800> they

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
replacing it with something that they

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.040 
replacing it with something that they
don't<00:02:01.280> know<00:02:01.610> because<00:02:02.150> we<00:02:02.450> haven't<00:02:02.810> done<00:02:02.930> the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
don't know because we haven't done the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.830 
don't know because we haven't done the
science<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:03.620> it's<00:02:04.370> actually<00:02:04.880> quite<00:02:05.180> possible

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
science and it's actually quite possible

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.240 
science and it's actually quite possible
they<00:02:06.290> don't<00:02:06.500> even<00:02:06.560> know<00:02:06.710> what<00:02:07.010> it's<00:02:07.130> being

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
they don't even know what it's being

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.449 
they don't even know what it's being
replaced<00:02:07.580> by<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:09.709> what's<00:02:09.920> happening<00:02:10.280> is

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
replaced by so so what's happening is

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.890 
replaced by so so what's happening is
that<00:02:11.260> there's<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.349> shell<00:02:12.709> game<00:02:12.889> going<00:02:13.219> on<00:02:13.340> here

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
that there's a shell game going on here

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.229 
that there's a shell game going on here
it's<00:02:14.379> a<00:02:14.530> toxic<00:02:14.829> shell<00:02:15.370> game<00:02:15.610> let's<00:02:15.970> say<00:02:16.090> they

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
it's a toxic shell game let's say they

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.030 
it's a toxic shell game let's say they
find<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:16.840> replacement<00:02:17.560> chemical<00:02:17.920> the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
find that the replacement chemical the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.479 
find that the replacement chemical the
chemical<00:02:18.489> cousin<00:02:18.670> also<00:02:19.659> mimics<00:02:20.319> estrogen

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
chemical cousin also mimics estrogen

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.559 
chemical cousin also mimics estrogen
well<00:02:21.489> then<00:02:21.610> what<00:02:21.760> they'll<00:02:21.909> do<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.150> do<00:02:22.390> is

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
well then what they'll do is do is

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.039 
well then what they'll do is do is
they'll<00:02:22.870> switch<00:02:23.110> again<00:02:23.459> that's<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.790> plan<00:02:25.060> the

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
they'll switch again that's the plan the

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.170 
they'll switch again that's the plan the
plan<00:02:26.079> is<00:02:26.590> if<00:02:26.829> we<00:02:27.340> find<00:02:27.610> it's<00:02:27.849> making<00:02:28.150> people

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
plan is if we find it's making people

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.420 
plan is if we find it's making people
sick<00:02:28.629> we'll<00:02:28.989> switch<00:02:29.290> again<00:02:29.500> after<00:02:30.069> we<00:02:30.189> find

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
sick we'll switch again after we find

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.809 
sick we'll switch again after we find
out<00:02:31.680> that's<00:02:32.680> nuts<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.379> what<00:02:36.220> we<00:02:36.370> need<00:02:36.579> to<00:02:36.700> be

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
out that's nuts so so what we need to be

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.559 
out that's nuts so so what we need to be
doing<00:02:36.849> is<00:02:38.189> creating<00:02:39.189> a<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:41.140> set<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:41.890> rules<00:02:42.129> that

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
doing is creating a a set of rules that

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.809 
doing is creating a a set of rules that
incentivize<00:02:43.569> companies<00:02:43.599> to<00:02:44.290> not<00:02:44.530> expose<00:02:45.040> GG

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
incentivize companies to not expose GG

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.099 
incentivize companies to not expose GG
to<00:02:47.159> either<00:02:48.159> vpa<00:02:48.819> or<00:02:49.150> some<00:02:49.420> other<00:02:49.569> chemical

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
to either vpa or some other chemical

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.339 
to either vpa or some other chemical
cousin<00:02:50.319> that<00:02:50.950> has<00:02:51.659> similar<00:02:52.659> estrogen

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
cousin that has similar estrogen

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.569 
cousin that has similar estrogen
mimicking<00:02:53.709> effects<00:02:54.129> and<00:02:54.310> then<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.489> last

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
mimicking effects and then the last

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:55.619 
mimicking effects and then the last
thing<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:54.819> just<00:02:54.849> want<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.150> say<00:02:55.299> about<00:02:55.389> this

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
thing I just want to say about this

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.800 
thing I just want to say about this
example<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.819> we<00:02:57.819> tested<00:02:58.269> a<00:02:58.329> whole<00:02:58.540> bunch

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
example is that we tested a whole bunch

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.860 
example is that we tested a whole bunch
of<00:02:58.989> sippy<00:02:59.709> cups<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.069> baby<00:03:00.189> bottles<00:03:00.870> for

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
of sippy cups and baby bottles for

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.920 
of sippy cups and baby bottles for
estrogenic<00:03:02.470> effects<00:03:03.129> so<00:03:03.819> notice<00:03:04.540> we<00:03:04.720> didn't

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
estrogenic effects so notice we didn't

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.929 
estrogenic effects so notice we didn't
test<00:03:05.049> for<00:03:05.139> BPA<00:03:05.620> or<00:03:05.950> some<00:03:06.430> other<00:03:06.519> chemical

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
test for BPA or some other chemical

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.520 
test for BPA or some other chemical
because<00:03:07.420> we<00:03:07.599> wouldn't<00:03:07.900> know<00:03:08.019> what<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.230> test

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
because we wouldn't know what to test

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.830 
because we wouldn't know what to test
for<00:03:08.799> we<00:03:09.670> wouldn't<00:03:09.909> know<00:03:09.970> what<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.120> test<00:03:10.329> for<00:03:10.450> so

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
for we wouldn't know what to test for so

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.449 
for we wouldn't know what to test for so
instead<00:03:11.170> we<00:03:11.470> just<00:03:11.739> tested<00:03:12.099> for<00:03:12.310> that

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
instead we just tested for that

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.030 
instead we just tested for that
potential<00:03:13.120> health<00:03:13.329> outcome<00:03:13.720> so<00:03:14.530> we<00:03:14.680> tested

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
potential health outcome so we tested

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.420 
potential health outcome so we tested
does<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.459> mimic<00:03:15.700> estrogen<00:03:15.879> and<00:03:16.530> we<00:03:17.530> found<00:03:17.799> that

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
does it mimic estrogen and we found that

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.509 
does it mimic estrogen and we found that
the<00:03:18.760> majority<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.329> them<00:03:19.599> were<00:03:20.370> just<00:03:21.370> as

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
the majority of them were just as

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.089 
the majority of them were just as
estrogenic<00:03:21.819> as<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.359> ones<00:03:22.569> that<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:23.379> had<00:03:23.680> BPA

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
estrogenic as the ones that that had BPA

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.539 
estrogenic as the ones that that had BPA
the<00:03:24.549> bpa<00:03:24.940> free<00:03:25.030> won't<00:03:25.449> bpa-free<00:03:26.340> sippy<00:03:27.340> cups

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
the bpa free won't bpa-free sippy cups

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.849 
the bpa free won't bpa-free sippy cups
and<00:03:27.730> baby<00:03:27.879> bottles<00:03:28.299> were<00:03:29.019> just<00:03:29.409> as<00:03:29.530> estrogenic

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
and baby bottles were just as estrogenic

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.900 
and baby bottles were just as estrogenic
as<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.730> BPA<00:03:31.060> containing<00:03:31.720> ones
