00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.919
 the dreams illusions and hopes that 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.450
 there is in a house of their own they are 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.370
 sinking the neighbors of the population 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.290
 Lookout 5 in Arica suffer this in meat 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.540
 own day to day when they see their 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.849
 departments are hitting because of 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.200
 that sinks from one side this 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.150
 generates more problems in the 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.320
 buildings the biggest concern 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.150
 the collapse of the blog has us 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.950
 extremely worried and some neighbors 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.170
 who are 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.810
 they are already collapsing they do not want to get to 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.270
 sleep the other day tremor day sunday 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.790
 in the afternoon and they do not want to enter 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.200
 want to stay outside there are neighbors who 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.050
 we really do not have where to stay 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.930
 they have to come by obligation 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.330
 my case I have son worries me 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.520
 because the is has dilated too much 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.140
 the neighbors see how day after day the 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.150
 buildings are separated from the stairs 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.800
 the windows close us and others 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.360
 problems they claim are from when they 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.830
 delivered the housing complex the 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.750
 problem like you're leaning the 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.210
 department of the side the truth not 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.920
 we know which of the two opened but 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.380
 we have problem with the structure of the 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.950
 window the walls are falling as 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.270
 you saw and broken and white is that the 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.340
 movement is so broken because the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.219
 window and 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.689
 and the fear that neighbors lived with me 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.520
 ensure that the land would not be the 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.350
 adequate than before construction 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.509
 it was a landfill and that the company only 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.189
 worried about finishing and delivering the 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.859
 departments all a friend water that 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.590
 brought gas and says that when it was built 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:29.630
 this department there is a landfill 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.719
 a pit and they threw trash 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.479
 built over and he says that the 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.069
 company as it was without bankruptcy they threw 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.329
 no more material says readers the 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.000
 last since they threw him not for 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.590
 finish them guanche gas then that was 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.420
 what happened after it was badly built 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.590
 the situation does not have peace for the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.509
 inhabitants of this housing complex 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.399
 even if the problems continue 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.420
 that the company makes arrangements but that 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.759
 these are not a definitive solution 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.409
 meanwhile they must fight their fears 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.750
 before an earthquake and with the crime that 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.939
 the threat awaits a solution to this 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.920
 problem that transformed the dream of the 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.920
 own house in a real nightmare
