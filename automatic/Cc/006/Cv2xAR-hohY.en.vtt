00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hello guys gamerscore Bridger and today

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.840 
hello guys gamerscore Bridger and today
i<00:00:03.300> will<00:00:03.540> be<00:00:03.659> showing<00:00:03.780> you<00:00:04.170> how<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.710> install<00:00:05.339> the

i will be showing you how to install the
challenge<00:00:06.540> map<00:00:06.690> called<00:00:06.960> solar<00:00:07.410> survival

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
challenge map called solar survival

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.540 
challenge map called solar survival
version<00:00:09.210> 2<00:00:09.650> so<00:00:10.650> basically<00:00:10.920> we<00:00:11.040> could<00:00:11.219> go<00:00:11.370> with

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
version 2 so basically we could go with

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.999 
version 2 so basically we could go with
a<00:00:11.580> little<00:00:12.000> overview<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.599> what<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.290> what

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
a little overview of what this is what

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.279 
a little overview of what this is what
the<00:00:14.190> solar<00:00:14.400> survival<00:00:14.759> map<00:00:14.940> actually<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.570> so

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
the solar survival map actually is so

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.519 
the solar survival map actually is so
basically<00:00:16.890> what<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:18.720> there<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
basically what it is is it is there a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.189 
basically what it is is it is there a
solar<00:00:19.949> system<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:21.359> start<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.750> earth<00:00:21.930> and

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
solar system so you start on earth and

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.410 
solar system so you start on earth and
then<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.830> go<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.490> could<00:00:23.670> well<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.300> could

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
then you go you could well you could

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.000 
then you go you could well you could
really<00:00:24.660> go<00:00:24.750> anywhere<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.230> that's<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.650> moon<00:00:25.830> I

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
really go anywhere but that's the moon I

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.890 
really go anywhere but that's the moon I
think<00:00:26.220> right<00:00:26.340> there<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.789> then<00:00:27.420> there's<00:00:27.660> Mars

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
think right there and then there's Mars

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.390 
think right there and then there's Mars
and<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.410> goes<00:00:28.529> all<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.710> way<00:00:28.800> up<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.920> Pluto<00:00:29.369> i

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
and it goes all the way up to Pluto i

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.669 
and it goes all the way up to Pluto i
believe<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.000> i<00:00:30.410> think<00:00:31.410> there's<00:00:31.470> also

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
believe and i think there's also

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.790 
believe and i think there's also
alternate<00:00:32.279> are<00:00:32.460> alternative<00:00:33.469> dimensions<00:00:34.469> and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
alternate are alternative dimensions and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.190 
alternate are alternative dimensions and
the<00:00:34.829> nether<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.340> stuff<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.660> really<00:00:36.930> in

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the nether and stuff so it's really in

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.799 
the nether and stuff so it's really in
depth<00:00:37.469> i<00:00:37.739> was<00:00:38.070> thinking<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.430> doing<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:39.000> let's

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
depth i was thinking of doing a let's
