00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
let's try it out with the Glock goes on

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.889 
let's try it out with the Glock goes on
your<00:00:01.949> middle<00:00:02.639> finger<00:00:02.730> as<00:00:03.270> opposed<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.750> your

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
your middle finger as opposed to your

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.680 
your middle finger as opposed to your
index<00:00:04.140> finger<00:00:04.410> like<00:00:04.560> other<00:00:04.740> Cabot's<00:00:05.660> so<00:00:06.660> I

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
index finger like other Cabot's so I

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.370 
index finger like other Cabot's so I
mean<00:00:07.080> it's<00:00:07.950> kind<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.490> sketchy<00:00:08.929> if<00:00:09.929> I'm<00:00:10.080> going

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
mean it's kind of sketchy if I'm going

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.919 
mean it's kind of sketchy if I'm going
in<00:00:10.500> for<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.740> reload<00:00:11.099> I'm<00:00:11.910> probably<00:00:12.269> gonna<00:00:12.599> stab

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
in for a reload I'm probably gonna stab

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.589 
in for a reload I'm probably gonna stab
my<00:00:13.139> hand<00:00:13.410> right<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.160> palm<00:00:14.450> probably<00:00:15.450> not

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
my hand right in the palm probably not

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.019 
my hand right in the palm probably not
for<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.139> probably<00:00:17.010> not<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> pistol

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
for that so probably not for a pistol

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.370 
for that so probably not for a pistol

let's try that

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.560 
let's try that
so<00:00:52.440> pistol<00:00:53.250> one<00:00:53.399> hand<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.969> bet<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.329> other

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.500 

would<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.829> uncomfortable<00:00:58.829> actually<00:00:59.489> too

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
would be uncomfortable actually too

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.619 
would be uncomfortable actually too
to<00:01:00.929> get<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> good<00:01:01.379> grip<00:01:02.269> not<00:01:03.269> liking<00:01:03.600> that

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
to get a good grip not liking that

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.410 
to get a good grip not liking that
either<00:01:04.309> alright<00:01:05.309> let's<00:01:05.489> try<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
either alright let's try this with a

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.300 
either alright let's try this with a
couple<00:01:06.900> other<00:01:06.930> weapon<00:01:07.409> platforms<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.070> see<00:01:08.220> if

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
couple other weapon platforms to see if

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.560

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
you're still getting kind of close with

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.710 
you're still getting kind of close with
your<00:01:43.500> hand<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.550> fumble<00:01:44.850> your<00:01:44.909> mag<00:01:45.149> change

I mean there's a possibility that you

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.830 
I mean there's a possibility that you
could<00:01:47.729> cut<00:01:47.940> yourself<00:01:49.429> still<00:01:50.429> not<00:01:50.840> convinced

could cut yourself still not convinced

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.969 
could cut yourself still not convinced
on<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.590> personally<00:01:54.170> but<00:01:55.170> maybe<00:01:55.409> maybe

your only a chance up here this seems a
little<00:02:00.770> bit<00:02:01.770> better

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
little bit better

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.460 
little bit better

weapon can do mag changes grab it maybe
this<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> way<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.800> got<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.129> do<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.840> pretty

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
this is the way you got to do it pretty

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.050 
this is the way you got to do it pretty
comfortable<00:02:13.379> with<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:14.129> magpul<00:02:14.520> afg<00:02:14.550> that

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
comfortable with the the magpul afg that

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.400 
comfortable with the the magpul afg that
I<00:02:15.150> have<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.450> here<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:17.599> don't<00:02:18.599> know<00:02:18.660> maybe<00:02:18.959> maybe

I have on here I don't know maybe maybe

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.540 
I have on here I don't know maybe maybe
that's<00:02:19.620> how<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.890> got<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.160> do<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.340> with<00:02:20.400> an

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
that's how you got to do it with an

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.589 
that's how you got to do it with an
ar-15<00:02:20.879> yeah<00:02:21.390> we<00:02:21.870> have<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.080> shotgun<00:02:22.560> here<00:02:23.599> same

ar-15 yeah we have a shotgun here same

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:31.300 
ar-15 yeah we have a shotgun here same
idea<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:24.989> I<00:02:25.170> guess<00:02:25.519> only<00:02:26.519> with<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.760> pump

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.910 

still<00:02:32.310> able<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.720> work<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.840> pump<00:02:34.050> no<00:02:34.230> problem

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
still able to work the pump no problem

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.850 
still able to work the pump no problem
it<00:02:35.489> doesn't<00:02:35.819> affect<00:02:35.879> it<00:02:36.239> at<00:02:36.360> all<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.379> what

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
it doesn't affect it at all so what

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.199 
it doesn't affect it at all so what
about<00:02:37.950> loading<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.519> what<00:02:38.670> if<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.849> were<00:02:38.970> to

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
about loading that what if you were to

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.170 
about loading that what if you were to
reload<00:02:39.510> by<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.989> reload<00:02:40.410> by<00:02:41.370> its<00:02:41.519> rotate<00:02:42.060> it

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
reload by it's a reload by its rotate it

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.949 
reload by it's a reload by its rotate it
down<00:02:44.269> yeah<00:02:45.269> I<00:02:45.300> might<00:02:45.599> get<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.930> way<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:47.959> try

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
down yeah I might get in the way and try

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.740 
down yeah I might get in the way and try
it<00:02:49.019> with<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.230> other<00:02:49.290> hand<00:02:49.530> maybe<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.159> was

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
it with the other hand maybe that was

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.530 
it with the other hand maybe that was
a<00:02:51.780> little<00:02:51.930> bit<00:02:52.020> better<00:02:52.970> that's<00:02:53.970> not<00:02:54.150> too<00:02:54.330> bad

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
a little bit better that's not too bad

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.370 
a little bit better that's not too bad
because<00:02:54.870> you're<00:02:55.140> not<00:02:56.750> not<00:02:57.750> near<00:02:58.020> when<00:02:58.230> you're

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
because you're not not near when you're

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.610 
because you're not not near when you're
reloading<00:02:58.770> with<00:02:58.800> this<00:02:59.130> so<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:01.500> shotgun<00:03:03.620> yes

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
reloading with this so for shotgun yes

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.770 
reloading with this so for shotgun yes
maybe<00:03:04.890> maybe<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:05.820> an<00:03:05.910> effective<00:03:06.360> tool<00:03:06.510> with

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
maybe maybe it's an effective tool with

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.160 
maybe maybe it's an effective tool with
shotguns<00:03:07.490> alright<00:03:08.490> guys<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:09.030> uh<00:03:09.060> let<00:03:09.959> me<00:03:09.990> know

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
shotguns alright guys so uh let me know

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.140 
shotguns alright guys so uh let me know
what<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.410> think<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.770> this<00:03:10.860> little<00:03:11.040> guy<00:03:11.250> if<00:03:11.910> you

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
what you think of this little guy if you

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.320 
what you think of this little guy if you
think<00:03:12.360> it's<00:03:12.480> even<00:03:12.780> combat<00:03:13.410> effective<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:14.330> think

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
think it's even combat effective I think

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.030 
think it's even combat effective I think
it'd<00:03:15.630> be<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.780> good<00:03:15.990> little<00:03:16.140> slashing<00:03:16.800> tool

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
it'd be a good little slashing tool

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.180 
it'd be a good little slashing tool
maybe<00:03:17.370> for<00:03:18.170> manipulation<00:03:19.170> pressure<00:03:19.830> point

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
maybe for manipulation pressure point

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.680 
maybe for manipulation pressure point
stuff<00:03:20.459> like<00:03:20.610> that<00:03:20.840> similar<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.900> like<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:23.690> coup

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
stuff like that similar to like a coup

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.800 
stuff like that similar to like a coup

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.080 
baton but I mean yeah one of the nice
things<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.530> making<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.370> can<00:03:29.580> bit<00:03:29.820> style

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
things of making it a can bit style

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.449 
things of making it a can bit style
knife<00:03:30.300> is<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.720> ring<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.290> being<00:03:31.920> such<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.160> small

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
smaller neck NIH's stuff like that you

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.370 
smaller neck NIH's stuff like that you
have<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.100> grip<00:03:38.310> them<00:03:38.459> so<00:03:38.670> tight<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.239> it's<00:03:40.230> easy

have to grip them so tight and it's easy
to<00:03:40.500> lose<00:03:40.620> them<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.280> mean<00:03:41.489> this<00:03:41.820> one<00:03:42.030> Duffy

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
to lose them so I mean this one Duffy

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.270 
to lose them so I mean this one Duffy
has<00:03:42.870> some<00:03:43.050> good<00:03:43.200> retention<00:03:43.470> as<00:03:43.770> well<00:03:43.800> which<00:03:44.250> is

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
has some good retention as well which is

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.699 
has some good retention as well which is
a<00:03:44.400> nice<00:03:44.580> feature<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.150> knife<00:03:45.650> what<00:03:46.650> about

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
a nice feature of this knife what about

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.680 
a nice feature of this knife what about
concealability<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.610> think<00:03:47.940> Mayfield<00:03:48.330> ability

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
concealability I think Mayfield ability

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.090 
concealability I think Mayfield ability
this<00:03:48.840> is<00:03:48.900> really<00:03:49.230> small<00:03:49.500> right<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:49.920> comes

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
this is really small right and it comes

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.590 
this is really small right and it comes
