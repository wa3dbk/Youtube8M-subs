same animation but one of the benefits

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.100 
same animation but one of the benefits
is<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.940> his<00:00:33.059> second<00:00:33.450> hit<00:00:33.540> hits<00:00:33.750> four<00:00:33.899> twenty

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
is that his second hit hits four twenty

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.450 
is that his second hit hits four twenty
percent<00:00:34.380> faster<00:00:34.500> than<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.890> did<00:00:35.010> previously
