00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 The guy who was there, the recruiting officer, he tells me, 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.600
 "It's obvious you do not like the army." 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.220
 I do not like the army; I'm interested in firearms. 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.920
 because, you know, it can be useful. And I wore my hunting vest, 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.899
 with bullets of all calibers. It was something I would wear going out in Brussels. 

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:24.279
 And I was hot with girls, because, you know, firearms are virile. 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.130
 Fire at will! 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.380
 And ... I ... I say ... Listen ... 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.760
 Look, I'm a GUN NUT, and ... 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.260
 and ... I love the army. I love the army ... He looks at me ... 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.480
 "But, the army ..." 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.920
 "we consider putting you in a non-armed branch of the army." 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.320
 I said, "no way". Listen ... 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.130
 Let's be brief, let's be clear ... 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.220
 Let me explain. 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.530
 The army's purpose is to kill. That's clear! He says, "yeah, but ..." 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.120
 I said, goddamnit, the purpose of the army is to KILL! 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.140
 Killing is what it's for. That's how you defend yourself. * * KWICK 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.350
 So listen, I'm interested. Because I want to become a killer. 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.820
 A professional. I want to kill. Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.160
 I LOVE to KILL! 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.360
 And I want you to teach me how to kill. 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.710
 I want to drop dead by staring at them. 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.160
 And you can give me any job you want. Any mission. 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.420
 Anything. Any action. But give me some action, please! 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.230
 Because if I'm not getting any action, I kill. 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.650
 I hate authority ... 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.540
 I want to be the killer. The # 1 killer. The best killer. 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.540
 And I want to kill all the time. 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.540
 Send me anywhere; I'M KILLING EVERYONE! 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.270
 But, give me the means to kill. Teach me how to kill, please. 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.390
 This guy ... 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.650
 He's like ... 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.950
 "Listen" 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.000
 "Well-well-well ..." 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.300
 I did 15 days at the mental mental hospital ... 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.100
 Because apparently ... 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.540
 The purpose of the army is not to kill. It's to peel potatoes. 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.999
 It's to waste your time. Collect garbage. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.500
 So ... 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.229
 They declared ... 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.779
 And I had to sign an agreement saying 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.469
 They did that to me. 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.060
 Saying ... 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.520
 even in time of war ... 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.920
 I was not allowed to use firearms 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.540
 To defend my country. And that's disgusting! 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.140
 Because if there's one guy who's gonna defend his country 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.640
 If it's a German, a Russian or an American 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.420
 If he sets foot on my lawn ... 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.120
 HE'S DEAD!
