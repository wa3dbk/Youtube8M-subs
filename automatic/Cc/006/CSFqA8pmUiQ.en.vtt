ridiculous<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.210> here's<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.599> new<00:00:30.689> one<00:00:30.840> check

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
ridiculous and here's the new one check

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.420 
ridiculous and here's the new one check
it<00:00:31.050> out<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:31.230> really<00:00:31.470> really<00:00:31.650> cool<00:00:31.800> it's

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
it out it's really really cool it's

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.040 
it out it's really really cool it's
basically<00:00:32.790> kind<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> same<00:00:33.690> thing<00:00:34.020> but

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
basically kind of the same thing but

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.990 
basically kind of the same thing but
they<00:00:34.260> redesigned<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.219> got<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.610> couple

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
they redesigned it and it's got a couple

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.370 
they redesigned it and it's got a couple
really<00:00:36.450> new<00:00:36.630> important<00:00:36.960> features<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.290> I'll

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
really new important features and I'll

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.959 
really new important features and I'll
tell<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.530> those<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.860> second<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:38.280> let's<00:00:38.460> go

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
tell you those just second but let's go

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.819 
tell you those just second but let's go
through<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.210> specs<00:00:39.480> now<00:00:40.200> first<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.530> all<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.770> is

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
through the specs now first of all it is

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.130 
through the specs now first of all it is
still<00:00:41.219> 10.1<00:00:41.730> inch<00:00:41.910> 1024<00:00:42.149> x<00:00:42.629> 600<00:00:42.840> lines

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
still 10.1 inch 1024 x 600 lines

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.869 
still 10.1 inch 1024 x 600 lines
resolution<00:00:43.680> but<00:00:43.950> here's<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
resolution but here's one of the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.459 
resolution but here's one of the
differences<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.360> an<00:00:45.450> LED<00:00:45.840> backed<00:00:46.079> LCD

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
differences it's an LED backed LCD

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.750 
differences it's an LED backed LCD
screen<00:00:46.739> instead<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.010> being<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> straight<00:00:47.370> LCD

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
screen instead of being a straight LCD

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.819 
screen instead of being a straight LCD
so<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.450> does<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.629> do<00:00:48.840> well<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
so what does that do well it's going to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.319 
so what does that do well it's going to
give<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.039> great<00:00:50.280> image<00:00:50.489> quality<00:00:50.670> obviously

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
give you great image quality obviously

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.549 
give you great image quality obviously
but<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.719> top<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.199> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.379> save

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
but on top of that it's going to save

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.990 
but on top of that it's going to save
you<00:00:52.680> some<00:00:52.920> power<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.460> you're<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
you some power so you're going to get a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.240 
you some power so you're going to get a
longer<00:00:54.510> battery<00:00:55.320> life<00:00:55.559> out<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.070> little

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
longer battery life out of this little

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.170 
longer battery life out of this little
netbook<00:00:56.399> which<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.760> really<00:00:56.940> cool<00:00:57.090> because

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
netbook which is really cool because

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.580 
netbook which is really cool because
they're<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.510> portable<00:00:57.840> they're<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.230> small<00:00:58.440> you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
they're so portable they're so small you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.450 
they're so portable they're so small you
want<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> taking<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.129> everywhere<00:00:59.340> you

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
want to taking with you everywhere you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
don't be taking the charger with you you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.660 
don't be taking the charger with you you
wanted<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.770> extremely<00:01:02.100> portable<00:01:02.370> so

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
wanted to be extremely portable so

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.729 
wanted to be extremely portable so
that's<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.629> really<00:01:03.660> good<00:01:04.199> advantage<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
that's a really good advantage on the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.219 
that's a really good advantage on the
new<00:01:04.920> ones<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.880> has<00:01:06.000> an<00:01:06.150> n<00:01:06.299> 450<00:01:06.810> atom

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
new ones now it has an n 450 atom

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.570 
new ones now it has an n 450 atom
processor<00:01:07.619> which<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.220> about<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> same

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
processor which is just about the same

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.070 
processor which is just about the same
as<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.760> n270<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.869> next

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
as the n270 but it is the next

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.929 
as the n270 but it is the next
generation<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.130> also<00:01:11.430> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.760> save

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
generation that is also going to save

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:12.950 
generation that is also going to save
you<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> little<00:01:12.119> bit<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.390> power<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
you a little bit of power and it's a

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.420 
you a little bit of power and it's a
little<00:01:13.320> tiny<00:01:13.470> bit<00:01:13.590> faster<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.280> one

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
little tiny bit faster so to be one

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.399 
little tiny bit faster so to be one
point<00:01:14.610> six<00:01:14.760> years<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.270> actually<00:01:15.540> 1.66

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
point six years it's actually 1.66

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.260 
point six years it's actually 1.66
gigahertz<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.549> much<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.880> frequency

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
gigahertz so not much of a frequency

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.609 
gigahertz so not much of a frequency
increase<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.140> little<00:01:19.409> bit

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
increase but you do get a little bit

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.770 
increase but you do get a little bit
more<00:01:19.740> speed<00:01:19.979> alsos<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.000> gigabyte<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.450> ddr2

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
now let's get to the part that makes

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.310 
now let's get to the part that makes
this<00:01:26.369> thing<00:01:26.549> impressive<00:01:27.360> before<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.049> take<00:01:28.229> it

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
this thing impressive before I take it

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.450 
this thing impressive before I take it
for<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> real<00:01:28.619> tour<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.070> right<00:01:29.220> here<00:01:29.340> on

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
for the real tour and it's right here on

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.240 
for the real tour and it's right here on
the<00:01:29.549> back<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.900> battery<00:01:31.320> incredible

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
the back it's this battery incredible

the back it's this battery incredible
sick<00:01:32.520> cell<00:01:32.729> battery<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.240> these<00:01:33.390> things<00:01:33.600> are

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
sick cell battery now these things are

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.660 
sick cell battery now these things are
still<00:01:33.960> basically<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.439> same<00:01:34.619> price<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.460> they

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
still basically the same price that they

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.429 
still basically the same price that they
were<00:01:35.729> before<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:36.990> they<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.170> this

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
were before but now they have this

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.170 
were before but now they have this
slightly<00:01:37.890> larger<00:01:38.310> six-hour<00:01:38.700> battery<00:01:38.850> when

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
slightly larger six-hour battery when

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.730 
slightly larger six-hour battery when
you're<00:01:39.270> looking<00:01:39.479> at<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.930> little<00:01:40.350> netbook<00:01:40.619> like

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
you're looking at a little netbook like

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.530 
you're looking at a little netbook like
this<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.100> literally<00:01:41.460> has<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> four<00:01:42.329> wat

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
this that literally has a four wat

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.690 
this that literally has a four wat
processor<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.409> weights<00:01:43.860> very<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.579> power

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
processor and weights very little power

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.789 
processor and weights very little power
to<00:01:44.820> begin<00:01:45.149> with<00:01:45.329> when<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:45.990> throw<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.229> big<00:01:46.500> six

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
to begin with when you throw a big six

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.260 
to begin with when you throw a big six
cell<00:01:46.950> battery<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.340> there<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.579> get<00:01:47.729> over<00:01:48.000> eight

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
cell battery on there you get over eight

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.990 
cell battery on there you get over eight
hours<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:49.310> computing<00:01:50.310> time<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.640> imagine

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
hours of computing time so imagine

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.580 
hours of computing time so imagine

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
hours of battery life that's very very

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.850 
hours of battery life that's very very
impressive<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.079> it's<00:01:58.229> really<00:01:58.619> cool<00:01:58.799> really

1024 x 600 very nice keyboard is

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.140 
1024 x 600 very nice keyboard is
actually<00:02:09.959> 93%<00:02:10.500> keyboard<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.250> if<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.970> more<00:02:12.090> of

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
actually 93% keyboard so if you more of

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.890 
actually 93% keyboard so if you more of
those<00:02:12.209> old<00:02:12.450> keyboard

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
those old keyboard

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.240 
those old keyboard
didn't<00:02:13.200> have<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.379> flat<00:02:13.590> keys<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.069> keys

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
didn't have the flat keys that the keys

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.740 
didn't have the flat keys that the keys
that<00:02:14.400> kind<00:02:14.519> of<00:02:14.579> like<00:02:14.670> rose<00:02:15.209> up<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.510> then<00:02:15.659> have

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
that kind of like rose up and then have

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.089 
that kind of like rose up and then have
a<00:02:15.780> little<00:02:15.900> platform<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.409> top<00:02:16.620> those<00:02:16.829> were

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
a little platform the top those were

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.649 
a little platform the top those were
awful<00:02:17.549> I<00:02:17.730> don't<00:02:18.030> know<00:02:18.090> why<00:02:18.180> people<00:02:18.209> that<00:02:18.540> do

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
awful I don't know why people that do

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.229 
awful I don't know why people that do
this<00:02:18.780> from<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.049> beginning<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:19.709> very<00:02:20.610> big<00:02:21.030> key

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
this from the beginning but very big key

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.339 
this from the beginning but very big key
where<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.599> actually<00:02:21.720> type<00:02:22.019> on<00:02:22.200> these

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
where you can actually type on these

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.259 
where you can actually type on these
it's<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.620> lot<00:02:22.799> easier<00:02:22.829> to<00:02:23.129> use<00:02:23.340> than<00:02:23.519> a<00:02:23.970> regular

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
it's a lot easier to use than a regular

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.539 
it's a lot easier to use than a regular
netbook<00:02:24.750> they<00:02:24.870> do<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.470> pretty<00:02:26.040> good<00:02:26.159> cesky

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
netbook they do have a pretty good cesky

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.319 
netbook they do have a pretty good cesky
where<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.790> ninety-three<00:02:27.180> percent

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
where it's a ninety-three percent

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.119 
where it's a ninety-three percent
another<00:02:28.170> cool<00:02:28.379> little<00:02:28.530> feature<00:02:28.620> they<00:02:28.890> have<00:02:29.010> on

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
another cool little feature they have on

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.059 
another cool little feature they have on
here<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:31.470> trackpad<00:02:32.010> is

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
here is that the the trackpad is

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.849 
here is that the the trackpad is
actually<00:02:32.609> seamless<00:02:33.060> there<00:02:33.269> is<00:02:33.390> no<00:02:33.650> border<00:02:34.650> or

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
actually seamless there is no border or

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.460 
actually seamless there is no border or
drop<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:35.609> it's<00:02:35.879> a<00:02:36.090> very<00:02:36.120> rough<00:02:36.720> design<00:02:37.019> it's

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
drop but it's a very rough design it's

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.020 
drop but it's a very rough design it's
very<00:02:37.709> rough<00:02:37.890> finish<00:02:38.069> there<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.849> then<00:02:38.939> when

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
very rough finish there and then when

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.369 
very rough finish there and then when
you<00:02:39.090> get<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.359> edge<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.569> it<00:02:39.689> it<00:02:39.870> goes<00:02:40.049> smooth

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
you get to the edge of it it goes smooth

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.690 
you get to the edge of it it goes smooth
so<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.650> know<00:02:40.829> that<00:02:41.040> that's<00:02:41.430> where<00:02:41.640> the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
so you know that that's where the

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.520 
so you know that that's where the
trackpad<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.420> also<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.780> multi-touch<00:02:43.349> or

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
trackpad is it's also a multi-touch or
