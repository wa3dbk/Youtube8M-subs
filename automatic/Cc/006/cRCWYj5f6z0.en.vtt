Sauvignon<00:02:34.460> dominated<00:02:38.920> first<00:02:39.920> thing<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.220> get<00:02:40.430> is

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
Sauvignon dominated first thing I get is

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.890 
Sauvignon dominated first thing I get is
that<00:02:40.610> lovely<00:02:40.940> black<00:02:41.360> currant<00:02:41.840> aroma<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:43.900> little

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
that lovely black currant aroma a little

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.050 
that lovely black currant aroma a little
touch<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.350> cedar<00:02:45.740> wood<00:02:45.860> as<00:02:46.250> well<00:02:46.460> which<00:02:46.820> is

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
touch of cedar wood as well which is

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.660 
touch of cedar wood as well which is
something<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:48.080> often<00:02:48.230> find<00:02:48.650> especially<00:02:49.550> on

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
something you often find especially on

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.840 
something you often find especially on
left-bank<00:02:50.330> no<00:02:52.750> more<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.990> that<00:02:54.020> lovely<00:02:54.850> cedar

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
left-bank no more of that lovely cedar

and<00:02:56.120> black<00:02:56.330> currant<00:02:56.690> character<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.560> really

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
and black currant character and really

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.550 
and black currant character and really
quite<00:02:58.130> drying<00:02:58.730> on<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.150> palate<00:02:59.570> that's<00:03:00.200> the

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
quite drying on the palate that's the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.940 
quite drying on the palate that's the
high<00:03:01.040> tannins<00:03:01.730> coming<00:03:02.150> through<00:03:02.450> there<00:03:02.950> which

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
high tannins coming through there which

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.400 
high tannins coming through there which
is<00:03:04.280> from<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.760> thick<00:03:05.000> skins<00:03:05.390> of<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.810> Cabernet

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
is from the thick skins of the Cabernet

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.140 
is from the thick skins of the Cabernet
Sauvignon<00:03:06.920> so<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.400> think<00:03:07.550> this<00:03:07.790> one<00:03:08.090> could<00:03:08.330> edge

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
Sauvignon so I think this one could edge

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.820 
Sauvignon so I think this one could edge
just<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.270> compare<00:03:11.690> that<00:03:11.870> now<00:03:12.080> with<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.410> Sante

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
just to compare that now with the Sante

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.630 
just to compare that now with the Sante
medium<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:15.410> this<00:03:15.440> wine<00:03:15.770> is<00:03:15.950> dominated<00:03:16.610> by

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
medium so this wine is dominated by

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.210 
medium so this wine is dominated by
Merlot<00:03:20.260> certainly<00:03:21.260> on<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.500> nose<00:03:21.680> I'm<00:03:21.950> getting

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
Merlot certainly on the nose I'm getting

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.470 
Merlot certainly on the nose I'm getting
much<00:03:22.460> more<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.200> plummy<00:03:24.200> character<00:03:25.480> even

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
much more of that plummy character even

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.420 
much more of that plummy character even
a<00:03:26.540> hint<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.930> fruitcake<00:03:27.380> about<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.220> wine<00:03:30.430> and

a hint of fruitcake about this wine and
I<00:03:31.550> would<00:03:31.700> expect<00:03:32.210> to<00:03:32.300> find<00:03:32.420> that<00:03:32.810> on<00:03:32.990> the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
I would expect to find that on the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.390 
I would expect to find that on the
palate<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:33.860> will<00:03:34.130> be<00:03:34.220> slightly<00:03:34.520> less<00:03:34.760> drying

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
palate it will be slightly less drying

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.700 
palate it will be slightly less drying
