elevated the track considerably far back

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.010 
elevated the track considerably far back
which<00:02:50.040> creates<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:51.650> only<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.680> 1%<00:02:53.130> grade<00:02:54.020> from

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
which creates a only a 1% grade from

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.190 
which creates a only a 1% grade from
this<00:02:55.830> point<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:59.090> those<00:03:00.090> double<00:03:00.570> bridges<00:03:01.020> down

see<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.110> actually<00:03:55.980> that's<00:03:56.760> going<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.090> be<00:03:57.239> a

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
see that actually that's going to be a

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.580 
see that actually that's going to be a

here I have the backing in which is
basically<00:04:33.960> formed<00:04:34.350> foam<00:04:34.650> core<00:04:34.919> board<00:04:34.949> I<00:04:35.550> have

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
basically formed foam core board I have

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.240 
basically formed foam core board I have
some<00:04:36.449> tunnel<00:04:36.840> portals<00:04:37.259> that<00:04:37.620> are<00:04:37.680> just<00:04:38.009> cut

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
some tunnel portals that are just cut

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.760 
some tunnel portals that are just cut
out<00:04:38.400> of<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:39.030> foam<00:04:39.240> core<00:04:39.509> board<00:04:39.620> because<00:04:40.620> they

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
out of the foam core board because they

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.379 
out of the foam core board because they
will<00:04:40.919> eventually<00:04:41.130> be<00:04:41.520> covered<00:04:41.850> with<00:04:42.060> other

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
will eventually be covered with other

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.180 
will eventually be covered with other
types<00:04:42.660> of<00:04:42.810> scenery<00:04:43.080> this<00:04:43.620> one<00:04:43.860> here<00:04:44.160> that

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
types of scenery this one here that

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.710 
types of scenery this one here that
you're<00:04:44.460> looking<00:04:44.789> at<00:04:44.940> now<00:04:45.120> will<00:04:45.509> have<00:04:45.690> a

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
you're looking at now will have a

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.080 
you're looking at now will have a
building<00:04:46.139> in<00:04:46.289> front<00:04:46.500> of<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:46.889> an<00:04:47.520> overpass

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
building in front of it and an overpass

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.760 
building in front of it and an overpass
in<00:04:48.389> front<00:04:48.599> of<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.750> building<00:04:49.169> so<00:04:49.199> it<00:04:49.560> will

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
in front of the building so it will

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.710 
in front of the building so it will
appear<00:04:50.070> that<00:04:50.099> the<00:04:50.460> railroad<00:04:51.030> is<00:04:51.150> going<00:04:51.389> under

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
appear that the railroad is going under

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.420 
appear that the railroad is going under
and<00:04:51.870> over<00:04:52.139> pass<00:04:52.380> it<00:04:52.590> around<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.949> back<00:04:53.160> side<00:04:53.370> of

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
and over pass it around the back side of

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.980 
and over pass it around the back side of
the<00:04:53.580> building<00:04:53.729> which<00:04:54.120> it<00:04:54.300> won't

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
the building which it won't

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.339 
the building which it won't
but<00:04:55.199> that's<00:04:55.380> hopefully<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:56.220> idea<00:04:57.139> the<00:04:58.139> back

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
but that's hopefully the idea the back

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.890 
but that's hopefully the idea the back
side<00:04:58.650> will<00:04:58.919> just<00:04:58.949> have<00:04:59.310> Hill<00:05:00.060> with<00:05:00.389> buildings

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
side will just have Hill with buildings

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.189 
side will just have Hill with buildings
up<00:05:01.400> elevated<00:05:02.400> up<00:05:02.550> on<00:05:02.759> it<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.780> in-between

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
up elevated up on it and the in-between

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.790 
up elevated up on it and the in-between
section<00:05:05.160> will<00:05:05.340> have<00:05:05.520> a<00:05:05.940> slope<00:05:06.870> going<00:05:07.320> up<00:05:07.470> to<00:05:07.680> it

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
section will have a slope going up to it

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.080 
section will have a slope going up to it
and<00:05:07.919> will<00:05:08.009> have<00:05:08.130> building<00:05:08.520> sitting<00:05:08.759> up<00:05:08.910> on<00:05:09.030> top

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
and will have building sitting up on top

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.520 
and will have building sitting up on top
of<00:05:09.449> it<00:05:09.570> to<00:05:09.690> give<00:05:09.810> you<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.020> impression<00:05:10.110> that

of it to give you the impression that

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.379 
of it to give you the impression that
it's<00:05:10.830> going<00:05:11.160> up<00:05:11.310> a<00:05:11.430> hill<00:05:11.610> and<00:05:12.000> that<00:05:12.300> the

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
the overpass that I used to have over

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.879 
the overpass that I used to have over
the<00:05:32.460> yard<00:05:32.849> on<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.240> old<00:05:33.419> layout<00:05:33.750> and<00:05:34.260> down<00:05:34.590> back

down<00:05:35.099> into<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.490> middle<00:05:35.699> here<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.300> then<00:05:36.539> the

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
down into the middle here and then the

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.930 
down into the middle here and then the
road<00:05:36.780> will<00:05:36.990> continue<00:05:37.380> up<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.650> hill<00:05:38.159> that<00:05:38.789> I'm

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
road will continue up the hill that I'm

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.399 
road will continue up the hill that I'm
planning<00:05:39.180> on<00:05:39.389> building<00:05:39.810> against<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.229> foam

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
planning on building against the foam

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.020 
planning on building against the foam
core<00:05:40.680> board<00:05:40.710> there<00:05:41.190> and<00:05:41.220> disappear<00:05:41.820> into<00:05:41.940> the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
core board there and disappear into the

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.490 
core board there and disappear into the
backdrop<00:05:42.510> I<00:05:44.060> was<00:05:45.060> hoping<00:05:45.419> maybe<00:05:45.599> to<00:05:45.930> put<00:05:46.349> the

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
backdrop I was hoping maybe to put the

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.710 
backdrop I was hoping maybe to put the
river<00:05:46.710> along<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.430> edge<00:05:47.669> of<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.120> layout<00:05:48.300> here

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
river along the edge of the layout here

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.339 
river along the edge of the layout here
just<00:05:49.110> a<00:05:49.259> slight<00:05:50.090> just<00:05:51.090> a<00:05:51.180> slight<00:05:51.449> your<00:05:51.930> regular

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
just a slight just a slight your regular

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:53.600 
just a slight just a slight your regular
edge<00:05:52.560> of<00:05:52.800> it<00:05:52.919> and<00:05:53.070> just<00:05:53.159> to<00:05:53.280> give<00:05:53.490> the

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
edge of it and just to give the

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.279 
edge of it and just to give the
impression<00:05:53.880> that<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.389> river<00:05:54.599> was<00:05:54.840> following

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
impression that the river was following

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.080 
impression that the river was following
along<00:05:55.380> the<00:05:55.740> yard<00:05:55.979> here<00:05:56.280> and<00:05:56.430> at<00:05:56.550> some<00:05:56.849> point

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
along the yard here and at some point

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.839 
along the yard here and at some point
come<00:05:57.270> off<00:05:57.479> a<00:05:57.509> layout<00:05:58.020> if<00:05:58.949> I<00:05:59.130> back<00:05:59.370> up<00:05:59.400> here

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
come off a layout if I back up here

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.820 
come off a layout if I back up here
slightly<00:06:02.240> this<00:06:03.240> area<00:06:03.659> approximately<00:06:04.620> right

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
slightly this area approximately right

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.100 
slightly this area approximately right
here<00:06:05.250> is<00:06:05.430> going<00:06:06.210> to<00:06:06.389> be<00:06:06.509> where<00:06:06.659> the<00:06:06.780> control

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
here is going to be where the control

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.469 
here is going to be where the control
panel<00:06:07.500> is<00:06:07.650> and<00:06:07.949> of<00:06:08.039> course<00:06:08.250> on<00:06:08.759> the<00:06:08.940> next<00:06:09.180> video
