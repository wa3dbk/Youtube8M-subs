is<00:03:04.750> definitely<00:03:05.170> have<00:03:05.319> an<00:03:05.410> obstacle<00:03:05.709> with<00:03:05.890> that

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
is definitely have an obstacle with that

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.800 
is definitely have an obstacle with that
you<00:03:06.220> know<00:03:06.310> as<00:03:06.430> far<00:03:06.459> as<00:03:06.760> as<00:03:07.299> far<00:03:07.360> as<00:03:07.629> that<00:03:07.750> goes

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
you know as far as as far as that goes

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.569 
you know as far as as far as that goes
but<00:03:08.019> I<00:03:08.290> mean<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.590> have<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.920> lot<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:09.069> respect<00:03:09.430> for

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.690 
there wasn't the best mother will be and
I<00:03:26.560> just<00:03:26.709> want<00:03:26.889> to<00:03:26.980> know<00:03:27.040> if<00:03:27.069> he<00:03:27.220> comes<00:03:27.400> out<00:03:27.579> on

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
I just want to know if he comes out on

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.099 
I just want to know if he comes out on
top<00:03:27.850> against<00:03:28.150> Vince<00:03:28.389> McMahon<00:03:28.750> that's<00:03:28.989> the

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
top against Vince McMahon that's the

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.300 
top against Vince McMahon that's the
last<00:03:29.260> question<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.739> know<00:03:29.829> you're<00:03:29.980> part<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.220> the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
last question I know you're part of the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.129 
last question I know you're part of the
family<00:03:30.519> so<00:03:30.730> I<00:03:31.030> guess<00:03:31.299> you<00:03:31.420> gotta<00:03:31.569> say<00:03:31.810> Brett

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
family so I guess you gotta say Brett

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.199 
family so I guess you gotta say Brett
but<00:03:32.380> everyone<00:03:33.220> in<00:03:33.370> this<00:03:33.489> country<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.970> know<00:03:34.090> was

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
but everyone in this country I know was

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.420 
but everyone in this country I know was
pulling<00:03:34.510> for<00:03:34.540> Brett<00:03:34.840> yeah<00:03:35.470> certainly<00:03:35.769> not

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
pulling for Brett yeah certainly not

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.309 
pulling for Brett yeah certainly not
only<00:03:36.639> Canadians<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:37.269> I<00:03:37.299> think<00:03:37.540> fans<00:03:38.049> around

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
only Canadians but I think fans around

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.900 
only Canadians but I think fans around
the<00:03:38.440> world<00:03:38.500> are<00:03:38.799> probably<00:03:39.099> going<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.819> be

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
the world are probably going to be

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.089 
the world are probably going to be
pulling<00:03:40.120> for<00:03:40.239> Brett<00:03:40.630> whether<00:03:41.470> he'll<00:03:41.980> be

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
pulling for Brett whether he'll be

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.300 
pulling for Brett whether he'll be
victorious<00:03:42.670> or<00:03:42.819> not<00:03:42.940> I<00:03:43.180> would<00:03:43.359> assume<00:03:43.480> so<00:03:43.690> but

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
victorious or not I would assume so but

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.640 
victorious or not I would assume so but
mr.<00:03:45.310> McMahon's<00:03:45.639> no<00:03:45.880> dummy<00:03:46.180> he's<00:03:46.750> sneaky<00:03:47.230> and

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
mr. McMahon's no dummy he's sneaky and

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.170 
mr. McMahon's no dummy he's sneaky and
he's<00:03:47.950> probably<00:03:48.160> got<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.430> lot<00:03:48.579> of<00:03:48.609> tricks<00:03:48.880> up<00:03:49.060> his

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
he's probably got a lot of tricks up his

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.360 
he's probably got a lot of tricks up his
sleeve<00:03:49.510> so<00:03:49.870> yeah<00:03:50.200> he<00:03:50.590> might<00:03:50.950> have<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.250> watch

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370
