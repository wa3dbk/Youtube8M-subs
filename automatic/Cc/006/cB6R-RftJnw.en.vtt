wanted<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.700> give<00:00:02.820> everyone<00:00:03.030> a<00:00:03.149> shot<00:00:03.210> on<00:00:03.540> my<00:00:03.629> new

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
wanted to give everyone a shot on my new

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.920 
wanted to give everyone a shot on my new
IBC<00:00:04.200> tank<00:00:04.529> setup<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.509> so<00:00:06.509> my<00:00:06.629> new<00:00:06.750> water

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
IBC tank setup and so my new water

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.299 
IBC tank setup and so my new water
harvesting<00:00:07.170> setup<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:07.919> recently

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
harvesting setup that I recently

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.660 
harvesting setup that I recently
designed<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.530> I<00:00:10.530> had<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.070> couple<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.370> design

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
designed and I had a couple of design

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.390 
designed and I had a couple of design
goals<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.240> wanted<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.540> do<00:00:12.750> one<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:14.130> needed

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
goals that I wanted to do one you needed

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.330 
goals that I wanted to do one you needed
to<00:00:14.460> be<00:00:14.580> kind<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.940> really<00:00:15.089> simple<00:00:15.450> design

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
to be kind of a really simple design

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.950 
to be kind of a really simple design
didn't<00:00:17.340> require<00:00:17.550> much<00:00:17.789> maintenance<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.900> I'm

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
didn't require much maintenance so I'm

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.679 
didn't require much maintenance so I'm
pretty<00:00:19.170> lazy<00:00:20.270> secondly<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.300> didn't<00:00:21.510> really

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
pretty lazy secondly I didn't really

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.370 
pretty lazy secondly I didn't really
want<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.900> cut<00:00:22.260> many<00:00:22.439> holes<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> IBC<00:00:23.400> tanks

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
want to cut many holes in the IBC tanks

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.480 
want to cut many holes in the IBC tanks
with<00:00:25.380> all<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.619> pressure<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.949> heard<00:00:26.099> people

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
with all the pressure I heard people

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.859 
with all the pressure I heard people
having<00:00:26.789> problems<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.330> things<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:27.570> leaks

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
having problems with things like leaks

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.620 
having problems with things like leaks
etc<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.490> third<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.910> really<00:00:30.090> wanted<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.390> make<00:00:30.599> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
etc and third I really wanted to make a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.510 
etc and third I really wanted to make a
simple<00:00:31.289> design<00:00:31.560> something<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.340> wouldn't

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
simple design something that wouldn't

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.549 
simple design something that wouldn't
require<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:33.090> ton<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.660> parts<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.200> where<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> could

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
require a ton of parts and where I could

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.840 
require a ton of parts and where I could
effectively<00:00:35.070> get<00:00:35.190> things<00:00:35.399> done<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
effectively get things done with the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.080 
effectively get things done with the
least<00:00:36.030> amount<00:00:37.489> and<00:00:38.489> really<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.700> needed<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.000> be

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
least amount and really I needed to be

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.639 
least amount and really I needed to be
you<00:00:39.300> know<00:00:39.420> able<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.930> taken<00:00:40.200> apart<00:00:40.290> quite

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
you know able to be taken apart quite

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.740 
you know able to be taken apart quite
easily<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.190> I'll<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.090> go<00:00:42.210> over<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> couple<00:00:42.540> of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
easily so I'll just go over a couple of

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.060 
easily so I'll just go over a couple of
things<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.230> there<00:00:43.320> could<00:00:43.469> be<00:00:43.500> some<00:00:43.590> simpler

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
things and there could be some simpler

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.069 
things and there could be some simpler
ways<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.570> kind<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.840> design

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
ways to do this but this kind of design

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.729 
ways to do this but this kind of design
I<00:00:46.140> came<00:00:46.469> up<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:47.719> was<00:00:48.719> lucky<00:00:48.899> enough<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.170> not

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
I came up with I was lucky enough to not

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.139 
I came up with I was lucky enough to not
have<00:00:49.920> gutters<00:00:50.250> before<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.789> know<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.030> that's

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
have gutters before I know if that's

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.990 
have gutters before I know if that's
lucky<00:00:51.420> or<00:00:51.539> not<00:00:51.690> but<00:00:52.530> uh<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:53.039> was<00:00:53.610> able<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.820> have

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
lucky or not but uh I was able to have

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.729 
lucky or not but uh I was able to have
them<00:00:54.120> installed<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.629> downspout<00:00:55.350> kind<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.649> in

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
them installed the downspout kind of in

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.010 
them installed the downspout kind of in
the<00:00:55.829> center<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.629> garage<00:00:58.620> here<00:01:00.020> see

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the center of the on the garage here see

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.209 
the center of the on the garage here see
the<00:01:01.199> downspouts<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.859> center<00:01:02.100> which

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the downspouts in the center which

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.590 
the downspouts in the center which
really<00:01:02.460> allowed<00:01:02.640> me<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.789> mount<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.270> screen

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
really allowed me to mount the screen

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.010 
really allowed me to mount the screen
trap<00:01:04.489> right<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> downspout<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.900> have

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
trap right to the downspout but you have

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.620 
trap right to the downspout but you have
eliminated<00:01:07.229> some<00:01:07.650> plumbing<00:01:07.979> there<00:01:08.630> that

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
eliminated some plumbing there that

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.200 
eliminated some plumbing there that
screen<00:01:09.900> trap<00:01:10.140> operates<00:01:10.729> kind<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.820> screen<00:01:12.090> out

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
screen trap operates kind of screen out

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.030 
screen trap operates kind of screen out
any<00:01:12.390> particulate<00:01:12.930> coming<00:01:13.200> off<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.439> roof<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
any particulate coming off the roof and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.420 
any particulate coming off the roof and
also<00:01:14.820> doubles<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.420> mosquito<00:01:16.100> barrier<00:01:17.100> so

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
also doubles as a mosquito barrier so

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.850 
also doubles as a mosquito barrier so
the<00:01:17.520> mosquitoes<00:01:17.670> can't<00:01:18.150> get<00:01:18.299> into<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.540> tank

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
the mosquitoes can't get into the tank

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.539 
the mosquitoes can't get into the tank
so<00:01:20.540> ideas<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.689> water<00:01:21.900> comes<00:01:22.140> down<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:22.560> feeds

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
so ideas the water comes down here feeds

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.570 
so ideas the water comes down here feeds
in<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.729> tank<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:25.009> comes<00:01:26.009> down<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> first

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
in the tank and comes down to the first

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.950 
in the tank and comes down to the first
tank<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.900> when<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.140> fills<00:01:29.720> once<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> water

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
tank and when it fills once the water

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.569 
tank and when it fills once the water
level<00:01:31.049> hits<00:01:31.409> kind<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.950> couple<00:01:32.310> inches<00:01:32.430> on

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
level hits kind of a couple inches on

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.859 
level hits kind of a couple inches on
the<00:01:32.670> bottom<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> actually<00:01:33.360> starts<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.659> fill

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
the bottom it actually starts to fill

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.740 
the bottom it actually starts to fill
these<00:01:33.990> other<00:01:34.170> tanks<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.329> water<00:01:36.540> all

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
these other tanks and the water all

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.780 
these other tanks and the water all
fills<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.560> drains<00:01:37.829> at<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.070> same<00:01:38.280> time<00:01:38.549> and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
fills and drains at the same time and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.399 
fills and drains at the same time and
the<00:01:39.090> three<00:01:39.299> vessels<00:01:39.450> act<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.990> kind<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.229> one

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the three vessels act is kind of one

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.950 
the three vessels act is kind of one
vessel<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.360> kind<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.630> simply

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
vessel so this is just kind of simply

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.660 
vessel so this is just kind of simply
plumbed<00:01:43.320> down<00:01:43.439> here<00:01:43.680> sort<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.340> all<00:01:44.430> plug

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
plumbed down here sort of all plug

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.720 
plumbed down here sort of all plug
together<00:01:45.000> and

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.750 

this<00:01:48.480> is<00:01:48.630> actually<00:01:49.050> a<00:01:49.400> spout<00:01:50.400> to<00:01:50.550> another

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
this is actually a spout to another

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.920 
this is actually a spout to another
garden<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.300> haven't<00:01:51.480> hooked<00:01:51.570> up<00:01:51.780> yet

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
garden that we haven't hooked up yet

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.530 
garden that we haven't hooked up yet
that's<00:01:52.740> turned<00:01:53.010> off<00:01:53.160> so<00:01:53.550> all<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.210> tangs<00:01:54.360> are

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
that's turned off so all the tangs are

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.080 
that's turned off so all the tangs are
linked<00:01:54.720> together<00:01:54.870> and<00:01:55.490> there's<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.610> downspout

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
linked together and there's a downspout

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.540 
linked together and there's a downspout
for<00:01:58.460> some<00:01:59.460> water<00:01:59.670> for<00:02:01.160> watering<00:02:02.160> and<00:02:02.280> garden

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
for some water for watering and garden

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.600 
for some water for watering and garden
here<00:02:02.730> and<00:02:03.380> then<00:02:04.380> there's<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.010> spout<00:02:05.340> which

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
here and then there's a spout which

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.410 
here and then there's a spout which
actually<00:02:06.000> runs<00:02:06.150> down<00:02:06.510> into<00:02:07.700> some<00:02:08.700> poly<00:02:08.910> tube

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
actually runs down into some poly tube

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.440 
actually runs down into some poly tube
out<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.290> soil<00:02:10.500> system<00:02:11.300> which<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.450> out<00:02:12.600> here

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
out to the soil system which is out here

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.750 
out to the soil system which is out here
so<00:02:15.530> that's<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.620> idea<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.100> I'll<00:02:17.310> deal<00:02:17.520> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
so that's the idea that I'll deal the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.610 
so that's the idea that I'll deal the
other<00:02:17.790> thing<00:02:18.210> is<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.540> overflow<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.290> once<00:02:19.500> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
other thing is the overflow so once the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.490 
other thing is the overflow so once the
tanks<00:02:19.980> since<00:02:20.220> got<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> key<00:02:21.180> point<00:02:21.480> here<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.020> once

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
tanks since got a key point here so once

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.130 
tanks since got a key point here so once
the<00:02:22.590> tanks<00:02:22.830> get<00:02:22.980> full<00:02:23.690> I've<00:02:24.690> seen<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.870> lot<00:02:25.050> of

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
the tanks get full I've seen a lot of

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.690 
the tanks get full I've seen a lot of
design<00:02:25.380> actually<00:02:25.710> link<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.040> three<00:02:26.160> tanks

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
design actually link the three tanks

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.850 
design actually link the three tanks
together<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.350> was<00:02:28.470> kind<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.710> questioning

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
together and I was kind of questioning

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.350 
together and I was kind of questioning
why<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.430> was<00:02:29.550> done<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:29.940> still<00:02:30.180> haven't

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
why that was done and I still haven't

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.640 
why that was done and I still haven't
seen<00:02:30.540> what's<00:02:30.780> going<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.930> happen<00:02:31.260> once<00:02:31.440> this

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
seen what's going to happen once this

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.620 
seen what's going to happen once this
fills<00:02:31.860> up<00:02:32.040> but<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.490> think<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:33.300> going<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.450> work

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
fills up but I think it's going to work

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.950 
fills up but I think it's going to work
okay<00:02:33.990> what<00:02:34.560> we<00:02:34.650> do<00:02:34.740> is<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:34.980> design<00:02:35.130> these<00:02:35.520> a

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
okay what we do is we design these a

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.800 
okay what we do is we design these a
little<00:02:36.960> higher<00:02:37.200> than<00:02:37.560> than<00:02:38.220> what<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:39.630> actual

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
little higher than than what the actual

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.050 
little higher than than what the actual
overflow<00:02:40.410> would<00:02:40.560> be<00:02:40.710> so<00:02:41.250> as<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.580> water<00:02:41.790> level

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
overflow would be so as the water level

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.730 
overflow would be so as the water level
came<00:02:42.210> up<00:02:42.360> they'd<00:02:43.170> actually<00:02:43.350> hit<00:02:43.620> this

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
came up they'd actually hit this

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.390 
came up they'd actually hit this
overflow<00:02:44.070> first<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:45.120> then<00:02:45.960> drain<00:02:46.350> drain<00:02:47.250> the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
overflow first and then drain drain the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.720 
overflow first and then drain drain the
liquid<00:02:47.580> down<00:02:47.910> into<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.110> Swale<00:02:49.610> into<00:02:50.610> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
liquid down into the Swale into the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.750 
liquid down into the Swale into the
overflow<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.200> rubber<00:02:52.380> couplers<00:02:52.800> here<00:02:53.040> so

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
overflow so the rubber couplers here so

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.980 
overflow so the rubber couplers here so
the<00:02:53.880> system<00:02:54.150> can<00:02:54.300> be<00:02:54.330> taken<00:02:54.630> apart<00:02:54.750> in

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
the system can be taken apart in

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.840 
the system can be taken apart in
maintenance<00:02:55.470> if<00:02:55.590> we<00:02:55.680> need<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.730> just

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
maintenance if we need to so you just

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.890 
maintenance if we need to so you just
remove<00:02:57.390> these<00:02:57.540> two<00:02:57.750> rubber<00:02:57.930> components<00:02:58.350> and

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
remove these two rubber components and

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.620 
remove these two rubber components and
the<00:03:00.900> whole<00:03:01.050> piece<00:03:01.230> comes<00:03:01.440> apart<00:03:01.800> so<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.910> nice

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
the whole piece comes apart so a nice

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.780 
the whole piece comes apart so a nice
idea<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.050> what<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.290> can<00:03:04.380> do<00:03:07.370> we<00:03:08.370> can<00:03:08.489> dump<00:03:08.670> this

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
idea is what it can do we can dump this

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.130 
idea is what it can do we can dump this
and<00:03:09.000> I'll<00:03:09.060> tell<00:03:09.209> show<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.450> what<00:03:09.600> happens<00:03:09.959> here

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
and I'll tell show you what happens here

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.690 
and I'll tell show you what happens here
so<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.520> all<00:03:11.670> traveling<00:03:12.120> underneath<00:03:13.700> down

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
so this is all traveling underneath down

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.920 
so this is all traveling underneath down
down<00:03:15.000> down<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.570> actually<00:03:15.660> haven't

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
down down and I actually haven't

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.600 
down down and I actually haven't
finished<00:03:16.230> digging<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:16.590> in<00:03:16.770> yet<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:17.459> is

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
finished digging this in yet so this is

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.440 
finished digging this in yet so this is
going<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.820> happen<00:03:18.410> tonight<00:03:19.410> or<00:03:19.709> tomorrow<00:03:20.450> and

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
going to happen tonight or tomorrow and

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.030 
going to happen tonight or tomorrow and
this<00:03:21.720> will<00:03:21.870> actually<00:03:22.020> feed<00:03:22.380> into<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.800> Swale

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
this will actually feed into the Swale

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.460 
this will actually feed into the Swale
system<00:03:23.630> if<00:03:24.630> you're<00:03:24.810> actually<00:03:25.050> feeding<00:03:25.260> the

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
system if you're actually feeding the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.140 
system if you're actually feeding the
vehicle<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.010> beds<00:03:26.190> that<00:03:26.370> are<00:03:26.489> in<00:03:26.820> front<00:03:27.090> of

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
vehicle to beds that are in front of

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.470 
vehicle to beds that are in front of
them<00:03:27.290> which<00:03:28.290> ultimately<00:03:28.500> will<00:03:29.010> feed<00:03:29.239> water<00:03:30.239> to

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
them which ultimately will feed water to

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.210 
them which ultimately will feed water to
the<00:03:30.570> whole<00:03:30.720> food<00:03:30.989> forest<00:03:31.350> below<00:03:31.620> or<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.070> other

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
the whole food forest below or the other

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.740 
the whole food forest below or the other
set<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.430> soils<00:03:32.790> down<00:03:32.940> below<00:03:33.150> with<00:03:33.300> cabins<00:03:33.630> I'll

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
set of soils down below with cabins I'll

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.780 
set of soils down below with cabins I'll
get<00:03:33.959> which<00:03:34.590> will<00:03:34.739> act<00:03:34.890> as<00:03:35.040> an<00:03:35.160> overflow<00:03:35.400> for

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
get which will act as an overflow for

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.510 
get which will act as an overflow for
this<00:03:35.910> one<00:03:36.560> so<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.680> idea<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.070> here<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.400> the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
this one so the idea is here is the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.460 
this one so the idea is here is the
water<00:03:38.670> all<00:03:39.360> comes<00:03:39.660> into<00:03:39.870> here<00:03:40.020> we<00:03:40.140> can<00:03:40.290> target

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
water all comes into here we can target

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.650 
water all comes into here we can target
water<00:03:40.800> and<00:03:41.610> we<00:03:41.730> can<00:03:41.850> basically<00:03:42.000> water<00:03:42.480> the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
water and we can basically water the

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.699 
water and we can basically water the
entire<00:03:42.780> food<00:03:43.230> forest

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
entire food forest

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.390 
entire food forest
I<00:03:44.989> just<00:03:45.989> opening<00:03:46.320> this<00:03:46.410> one<00:03:46.560> valve<00:03:46.800> here

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
I just opening this one valve here
