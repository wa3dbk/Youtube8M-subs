head out and die so i can mow it and it

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.530 
head out and die so i can mow it and it
will<00:02:39.829> receive<00:02:40.250> for<00:02:40.430> next<00:02:40.670> year<00:02:40.849> and<00:02:41.030> also

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
we've got a big standard ryegrass you

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.369 
we've got a big standard ryegrass you
probably<00:02:43.579> can<00:02:43.879> see<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.569> i<00:02:44.840> want<00:02:45.019> to<00:02:45.079> wait<00:02:45.200> for

probably can see and i want to wait for

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.770 
probably can see and i want to wait for
that<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.920> die<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.340> head<00:02:46.670> out<00:02:46.879> so<00:02:47.120> i<00:02:47.150> can<00:02:47.420> mow<00:02:47.599> it

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
that to die and head out so i can mow it

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.220 
that to die and head out so i can mow it
and<00:02:48.049> have<00:02:49.000> rye<00:02:50.000> grass<00:02:50.209> again<00:02:50.540> next<00:02:50.780> year<00:02:50.900> so

and have rye grass again next year so

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.750 
and have rye grass again next year so
that's<00:02:51.769> why<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.040> kind<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:52.370> looks<00:02:52.549> a<00:02:52.609> little

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
that's why it kind of looks a little

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.069 
that's why it kind of looks a little
shabby<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.269> these<00:02:53.359> looks<00:02:53.810> like<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.049> needs

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
shabby and these looks like it needs
