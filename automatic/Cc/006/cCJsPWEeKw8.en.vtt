00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
there's been a transition and what's

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.490 
there's been a transition and what's
important<00:03:08.629> on<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.840> priority<00:03:09.230> list<00:03:09.260> for

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
recruiting kids out of Oklahoma and kids

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.640 
recruiting kids out of Oklahoma and kids
from<00:03:16.819> Texas<00:03:17.540> now<00:03:17.840> they're<00:03:18.019> having<00:03:18.259> to<00:03:18.349> go<00:03:18.470> out

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
from Texas now they're having to go out

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.619 
from Texas now they're having to go out
and<00:03:18.859> get<00:03:19.189> kids<00:03:19.549> from<00:03:19.639> the<00:03:19.970> east<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.359> the<00:03:20.449> west

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:21.909 
and get kids from the east and the west
coast<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.079> they<00:03:21.199> don't<00:03:21.349> have<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.530> same

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
coast so they don't have that same

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.179

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
ownership value in the program so they

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.009 
ownership value in the program so they
need<00:03:25.459> depth<00:03:25.699> on<00:03:25.819> offensive<00:03:26.180> line<00:03:26.479> defensive
