00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.189 

it's<00:00:14.999> typical<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.629> way<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.839> world<00:00:15.870> works

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
it's typical of the way the world works

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.660 
it's typical of the way the world works
that<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.890> coming<00:00:17.160> under<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> radar

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
that this is coming under the radar

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.130 
that this is coming under the radar
because<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.150> course<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> really<00:00:18.630> important

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
because of course the really important

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.810 
because of course the really important
things<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.439> really<00:00:19.710> change<00:00:20.130> things<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
things that really change things in the

things that really change things in the
world<00:00:21.000> always<00:00:21.960> happen<00:00:22.380> like<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.529> as<00:00:22.800> you

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
world always happen like that as you

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.760 
world always happen like that as you
know<00:00:23.130> yeah<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.730> don't<00:00:23.939> happen<00:00:24.239> in<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:25.230> telegraph

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
know yeah it don't happen in a telegraph

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.950 
know yeah it don't happen in a telegraph
long<00:00:26.250> lead-time<00:00:26.550> way<00:00:27.090> what<00:00:27.509> happens<00:00:27.840> if

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
long lead-time way what happens if

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.540 
long lead-time way what happens if
something<00:00:28.169> comes<00:00:28.529> along<00:00:28.680> which<00:00:29.070> people<00:00:29.340> just

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
something comes along which people just

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.069 
something comes along which people just
weren't<00:00:29.669> expecting<00:00:30.239> yeah<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.960> will

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
weren't expecting yeah and it will

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.749 
weren't expecting yeah and it will
change<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.590> genuine<00:00:32.040> dynamic<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.550> how<00:00:32.700> it

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
change the genuine dynamic so how it

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.350 
change the genuine dynamic so how it
works<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.239> reason<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.719> think

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
works and for that reason I think

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.850 
works and for that reason I think
certainly<00:00:36.360> presuming<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> time<00:00:37.530> frame

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
certainly presuming that the time frame

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.670 
certainly presuming that the time frame
is<00:00:38.219> isn't<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.329> met<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.750> let's<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.559> clear

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
is isn't is met and let's be clear

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.069 
is isn't is met and let's be clear
setting<00:00:41.039> up<00:00:41.450> an<00:00:42.450> exchange<00:00:42.719> letters<00:00:42.960> from

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
scratch is it is a technical exercise

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.790 
scratch is it is a technical exercise
and<00:00:45.750> they've<00:00:45.840> got<00:00:45.989> really<00:00:46.170> good<00:00:46.320> people<00:00:46.560> doing

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
ultimately James something like this is

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:52.160 
ultimately James something like this is
about<00:01:51.029> supply<00:01:51.359> and<00:01:51.389> demand<00:01:51.509> isn't<00:01:51.929> it<00:01:52.079> you

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
about supply and demand isn't it you

about supply and demand isn't it you
know<00:01:52.289> if<00:01:52.409> if<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.189> demand<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.639> there<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209 
see the flow and they can see how the

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:00.190 
see the flow and they can see how the

dynamics are changing yeah and certainly

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.209 
dynamics are changing yeah and certainly
assuming<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.259> demand<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.679> there<00:02:01.740> they're

interested on international it's that's

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.190 
interested on international it's that's
how<00:02:49.849> I<00:02:49.879> got<00:02:50.120> involved<00:02:50.359> they<00:02:50.599> asked<00:02:50.750> me<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:50.959> sort

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
how I got involved they asked me to sort

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.860 
how I got involved they asked me to sort
of<00:02:51.290> consult<00:02:51.650> on<00:02:51.829> it<00:02:51.980> yeah<00:02:52.310> but<00:02:53.180> but<00:02:53.510> by<00:02:53.689> all

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
of consult on it yeah but but by all

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.360 
of consult on it yeah but but by all
accounts<00:02:53.900> everybody<00:02:54.470> has<00:02:54.590> beat<00:02:54.769> you<00:02:54.920> want<00:02:55.159> in

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
accounts everybody has beat you want in

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.179 
accounts everybody has beat you want in
so<00:02:55.700> in<00:02:56.510> my<00:02:56.750> opinion<00:02:56.870> what<00:02:57.470> will<00:02:57.620> happen<00:02:57.980> is

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189 
so in my opinion what will happen is

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.420 
so in my opinion what will happen is
we'll<00:02:58.370> see<00:02:58.609> an<00:02:58.879> initial<00:02:59.920> initial<00:03:00.920> interest

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
we'll see an initial initial interest

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.099 
we'll see an initial initial interest
and<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:01.730> actually<00:03:01.879> do<00:03:02.239> think<00:03:02.269> it<00:03:02.690> will<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:03.049> will

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
and I actually do think it will it will

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.339 
and I actually do think it will it will
spiral<00:03:03.680> quite<00:03:04.069> quickly<00:03:04.280> because<00:03:05.319> given<00:03:06.319> the

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
spiral quite quickly because given the

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.020 
spiral quite quickly because given the
choice<00:03:06.620> reverse<00:03:07.040> Gresham's<00:03:07.489> law<00:03:07.549> you're

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
choice reverse Gresham's law you're

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.640 
choice reverse Gresham's law you're
going<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.239> want<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.450> hang<00:03:08.599> on<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.049> the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
going to want to hang on to the the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.000 
going to want to hang on to the the
dubious<00:03:10.099> contract<00:03:10.579> or<00:03:11.420> are<00:03:11.629> you<00:03:11.780> gonna<00:03:12.019> say

it yeah you know given the given the

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.240 
it yeah you know given the given the
choice<00:03:49.310> between<00:03:50.680> sticking<00:03:51.680> with<00:03:51.829> that<00:03:52.010> system

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
choice between sticking with that system

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.479

unsecured creditor status and being
fully<00:03:57.560> backed<00:03:57.829> I<00:03:58.790> don't<00:03:59.329> think<00:03:59.359> it'll<00:03:59.540> take

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
fully backed I don't think it'll take

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.289 
fully backed I don't think it'll take
long<00:03:59.810> for<00:04:00.019> people<00:04:00.530> to<00:04:00.949> to<00:04:01.849> want<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.180> move

a<00:04:47.060> good<00:04:47.600> example<00:04:47.750> is<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:48.380> fact<00:04:48.560> that<00:04:48.650> if<00:04:48.860> you

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
a good example is the fact that if you

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.330
