00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
to try putting a little first and then

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.330 
to try putting a little first and then
if<00:02:33.459> we<00:02:33.610> need<00:02:33.790> more<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.860> about<00:02:35.860> three

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
if we need more so about three

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
if we need more so about three
tablespoons<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:37.390> start<00:02:37.689> off<00:02:37.900> with<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.700> water

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
tablespoons to start off with of water

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.570 
tablespoons to start off with of water
there<00:02:42.360> we<00:02:42.480> go<00:02:42.930> mix<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.409> ready<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.980> I'm<00:02:44.400> gonna

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
there we go mix this ready and I'm gonna

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.809 
there we go mix this ready and I'm gonna
let<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:48.920> we're<00:02:49.920> just<00:02:50.069> gonna<00:02:50.220> check<00:02:50.580> the

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
let that we're just gonna check the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:58.309 
let that we're just gonna check the
texture<00:02:51.330> now<00:02:54.950> as<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.190> can<00:02:56.370> see<00:02:56.720> quite<00:02:57.720> thick

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
texture now as you can see quite thick

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.210 
texture now as you can see quite thick
yet<00:02:59.239> and<00:03:00.239> at<00:03:00.750> this<00:03:00.989> stage<00:03:01.049> we<00:03:01.319> will<00:03:01.590> add<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> bit

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
yet and at this stage we will add a bit

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:12.559 
yet and at this stage we will add a bit
more<00:03:02.250> water<00:03:02.599> so<00:03:06.110> two<00:03:08.480> three<00:03:10.760> four<00:03:11.760> tablespoons

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
more water so two three four tablespoons

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.750 
more water so two three four tablespoons
okay<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.260> reason<00:03:13.470> we<00:03:13.799> haven't<00:03:14.040> added<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.579> lot

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
okay the reason we haven't added a lot

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.630 
okay the reason we haven't added a lot
of<00:03:14.879> water<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.480> start<00:03:15.780> with<00:03:16.049> is<00:03:16.349> that<00:03:17.069> we<00:03:17.340> didn't

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
of water to start with is that we didn't

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.569 
of water to start with is that we didn't
want<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.879> get<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.209> really<00:03:18.650> runny<00:03:19.650> okay

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
want to get it really runny okay

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.270 
want to get it really runny okay
so<00:03:23.720> right<00:03:24.720> when<00:03:25.319> you<00:03:25.440> look<00:03:25.530> at<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.829> texture

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
so right when you look at the texture

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.960 
so right when you look at the texture
again<00:03:28.069> okay

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
again okay

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.110 
again okay
most<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:31.069> grounded<00:03:32.069> but<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.670> paste<00:03:32.910> is

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
most of it is grounded but the paste is

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.390 
most of it is grounded but the paste is
