00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
the lightweight class like team

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.169 
the lightweight class like team
lightnings<00:01:41.420> guido<00:01:41.979> are<00:01:42.979> slower<00:01:43.429> than<00:01:43.759> the

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
lightnings guido are slower than the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.340 
lightnings guido are slower than the
other<00:01:44.329> guys<00:01:44.509> that<00:01:44.840> have<00:01:44.899> a<00:01:45.020> harder<00:01:45.319> time

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
other guys that have a harder time

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.590 
other guys that have a harder time
catching<00:01:45.920> up<00:01:46.009> but<00:01:46.610> it's<00:01:46.789> easier<00:01:47.240> for<00:01:47.299> them<00:01:47.539> to

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
catching up but it's easier for them to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.469 
catching up but it's easier for them to
access<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:48.530> lot<00:01:48.770> of<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:49.069> secret<00:01:50.030> shortcuts

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
access a lot of the secret shortcuts

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.149 
access a lot of the secret shortcuts
because<00:01:50.869> they<00:01:50.960> can<00:01:51.110> turn<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.710> lot<00:01:51.950> quicker

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
because they can turn a lot quicker

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.669 
because they can turn a lot quicker
without<00:01:52.549> flying<00:01:52.969> off<00:01:53.179> the<00:01:53.210> track<00:01:53.539> the<00:01:54.350> weapons

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
without flying off the track the weapons

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.320 
without flying off the track the weapons
are<00:01:54.890> another<00:01:55.069> good<00:01:55.250> equalizer<00:01:55.789> in<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.119> game

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
are another good equalizer in the game

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.929 
are another good equalizer in the game
it's<00:01:57.170> good<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.500> keep<00:01:57.649> a<00:01:57.799> weapon<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.520> ensure

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
if someone sneaks up ahead of you you

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.679 
if someone sneaks up ahead of you you
can<00:02:03.259> take<00:02:03.380> them<00:02:03.530> out<00:02:03.880> using<00:02:04.880> weapons<00:02:05.090> earlier

can take them out using weapons earlier
in<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.899> race<00:02:06.049> before<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.920> last<00:02:07.459> lap<00:02:07.759> doesn't

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
in the race before the last lap doesn't

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.839

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
I thought was very colorful it showed

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.840 
I thought was very colorful it showed
the<00:04:51.090> quality<00:04:51.480> the<00:04:51.570> graphics<00:04:51.990> in<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.170> game<00:04:52.200> and

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
to show you how to win with a heavy

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.860 
to show you how to win with a heavy
weight<00:04:55.740> class

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.820 

when<00:05:01.870> you're<00:05:01.990> playing<00:05:02.199> with<00:05:02.379> the<00:05:02.439> heavyweight

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
when you're playing with the heavyweight

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.439 
when you're playing with the heavyweight
class<00:05:03.129> you'll<00:05:03.610> have<00:05:03.789> to<00:05:03.909> learn<00:05:04.029> how<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.270> use

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
class you'll have to learn how to use

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.540 
class you'll have to learn how to use
the<00:05:04.599> drift<00:05:04.900> because<00:05:05.499> turning<00:05:05.979> is<00:05:06.189> a<00:05:06.219> little

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
the drift because turning is a little

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.409 
the drift because turning is a little
more<00:05:06.639> difficult<00:05:06.819> for<00:05:07.240> these<00:05:07.389> big<00:05:07.599> guys<00:05:08.099> and

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
more difficult for these big guys and

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.579 
more difficult for these big guys and
every<00:05:10.419> turn<00:05:10.659> you<00:05:10.900> should<00:05:11.050> try<00:05:11.199> to<00:05:11.259> drift

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:11.589 
every turn you should try to drift

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:14.100 
every turn you should try to drift
around<00:05:11.740> it<00:05:12.099> that<00:05:12.969> fills<00:05:13.270> up<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.509> turbo<00:05:13.870> meter

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
around it that fills up the turbo meter

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.749 
around it that fills up the turbo meter
and<00:05:14.409> you'll<00:05:14.979> actually<00:05:15.189> gain<00:05:15.520> some<00:05:15.729> ground

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 
and you'll actually gain some ground

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.269 
and you'll actually gain some ground
when<00:05:16.419> turning<00:05:16.689> that<00:05:16.870> corner<00:05:17.169> you<00:05:17.860> won't<00:05:18.039> slow

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:18.279 
when turning that corner you won't slow

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:24.570 
when turning that corner you won't slow
down<00:05:18.490> when<00:05:18.789> you're<00:05:18.879> drifting<00:05:23.279> use<00:05:24.279> some<00:05:24.460> other

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
down when you're drifting use some other

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.489 
down when you're drifting use some other
tricks<00:05:24.909> when<00:05:25.150> you<00:05:25.180> can<00:05:25.479> you'll<00:05:26.110> see<00:05:26.319> it<00:05:26.409> at

00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:26.499 
tricks when you can you'll see it at

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:28.529 
tricks when you can you'll see it at
there<00:05:26.650> are<00:05:26.680> some<00:05:26.800> jumps<00:05:27.240> when<00:05:28.240> you're<00:05:28.389> in<00:05:28.479> the

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
there are some jumps when you're in the

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.110 
there are some jumps when you're in the
air<00:05:28.689> use<00:05:29.139> that<00:05:29.379> control<00:05:29.650> stick<00:05:30.009> to<00:05:30.819> flip

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
air use that control stick to flip

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.950 
air use that control stick to flip
forwards<00:05:31.509> backwards<00:05:31.719> or<00:05:32.199> sideways<00:05:36.809> make<00:05:37.809> sure

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
forwards backwards or sideways make sure

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.329 
forwards backwards or sideways make sure
you<00:05:38.050> do<00:05:38.169> it<00:05:38.289> high<00:05:38.439> up<00:05:38.469> in<00:05:38.710> the<00:05:38.740> air<00:05:38.800> so<00:05:39.129> when<00:05:39.219> you

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:39.339 
you do it high up in the air so when you

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:47.309 
you do it high up in the air so when you
land<00:05:39.610> you<00:05:39.939> land<00:05:40.809> on<00:05:40.899> those<00:05:41.050> tires<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.990> driving

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
land you land on those tires the driving

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.719 
land you land on those tires the driving
backwards<00:05:47.740> trick<00:05:48.009> will<00:05:48.249> give<00:05:48.370> you<00:05:48.460> the<00:05:48.550> most

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.740 
because you're going to drift through
each<00:06:48.800> one<00:06:49.120> as<00:06:50.120> soon<00:06:50.300> as<00:06:50.390> you're<00:06:50.510> done<00:06:50.600> with

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
each one as soon as you're done with

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.540 
each one as soon as you're done with
that<00:06:50.780> turn<00:06:51.110> you<00:06:51.530> hit<00:06:51.710> that<00:06:51.830> turbo<00:06:52.190> button

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
that turn you hit that turbo button

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.460 
that turn you hit that turbo button
because<00:06:52.910> you've<00:06:53.030> built<00:06:53.300> turbo<00:06:53.720> because<00:06:54.140> you

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
because you've built turbo because you

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:01.380 
because you've built turbo because you
drifted

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.390 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.920 

hey<00:07:02.390> take<00:07:02.990> it<00:07:03.020> easy

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.360 

here's<00:07:06.930> a<00:07:07.020> shortcut<00:07:07.290> the<00:07:07.650> first<00:07:07.890> time<00:07:08.070> you<00:07:08.220> saw

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
here's a shortcut the first time you saw

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.100 
here's a shortcut the first time you saw
this<00:07:08.550> shortcut<00:07:09.000> there's<00:07:09.330> a<00:07:09.360> big<00:07:09.540> exploding

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
this shortcut there's a big exploding

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.140 
this shortcut there's a big exploding
barrel<00:07:10.470> in<00:07:10.590> the<00:07:10.680> way<00:07:10.800> well<00:07:11.100> I<00:07:11.130> hit<00:07:11.490> that<00:07:11.730> so<00:07:11.970> now

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
barrel in the way well I hit that so now

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.300 
barrel in the way well I hit that so now
I<00:07:12.420> have<00:07:12.540> a<00:07:12.600> clear<00:07:12.780> way<00:07:13.020> through<00:07:13.320> you<00:07:14.130> might

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
I have a clear way through you might

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.440 
I have a clear way through you might
want<00:07:14.460> to<00:07:14.490> try<00:07:14.640> to<00:07:14.700> avoid<00:07:14.910> those<00:07:15.120> barrels

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:15.450 
want to try to avoid those barrels

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.530 
want to try to avoid those barrels
though<00:07:16.670> there's<00:07:17.670> a<00:07:17.760> shortcut<00:07:18.180> around<00:07:18.270> this

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:18.540 
though there's a shortcut around this

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.840 
though there's a shortcut around this
turn<00:07:18.810> but<00:07:19.410> in<00:07:19.500> this<00:07:19.620> case<00:07:19.920> I<00:07:20.190> skipped<00:07:20.700> it

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:20.850 
turn but in this case I skipped it

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.670 
turn but in this case I skipped it
because<00:07:21.390> drifting<00:07:21.780> around<00:07:22.020> the<00:07:22.110> track<00:07:22.320> itself

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 
because drifting around the track itself

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.620 
because drifting around the track itself
is<00:07:22.980> actually<00:07:23.430> a<00:07:23.460> better<00:07:23.700> idea<00:07:24.060> because<00:07:24.300> it

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630 
is actually a better idea because it

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.360 
is actually a better idea because it
builds<00:07:24.810> you<00:07:24.930> more<00:07:25.110> turbo<00:07:25.500> and<00:07:25.890> you<00:07:26.040> don't<00:07:26.220> lose

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.370 
builds you more turbo and you don't lose

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.250 
builds you more turbo and you don't lose
that<00:07:26.520> much<00:07:26.700> speed<00:07:26.940> so<00:07:27.510> sometimes<00:07:27.930> you'll<00:07:28.080> see

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:28.260 
that much speed so sometimes you'll see

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.440 
that much speed so sometimes you'll see
that<00:07:28.650> taking<00:07:29.010> a<00:07:29.070> shortcut<00:07:29.400> isn't<00:07:29.940> always<00:07:30.120> the

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.450 
that taking a shortcut isn't always the

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.510 
that taking a shortcut isn't always the
best<00:07:30.480> idea<00:07:30.780> if<00:07:31.560> you<00:07:31.770> can<00:07:31.920> build<00:07:32.100> turbo

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 
best idea if you can build turbo

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.860 
best idea if you can build turbo
overtaking<00:07:33.150> a<00:07:33.240> shortcut

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:33.870 
overtaking a shortcut

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:41.010 
overtaking a shortcut
build<00:07:34.230> that<00:07:34.350> turbo

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.020 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.810 

and<00:07:42.020> always<00:07:42.199> have<00:07:42.350> a<00:07:42.380> victory<00:07:42.800> trick<00:07:43.130> I<00:07:43.400> like

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:43.820 
and always have a victory trick I like

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.960 
and always have a victory trick I like
to<00:07:43.970> jump<00:07:44.180> up<00:07:44.360> at<00:07:44.510> the<00:07:44.600> end<00:07:44.750> and<00:07:44.990> flip<00:07:45.470> around

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:45.970 
to jump up at the end and flip around
