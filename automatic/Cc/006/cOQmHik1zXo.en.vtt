00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.690
 you say you finally have a structure 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.799
 hello for a little more character 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:11.689
 but this time with this 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:14.689
 German 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.039
 if marc pichette h nicolas to pass on the big pond 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.960
 aoc once these failures it's too far 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.009
 beat 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.550
 she tries everything for the whole with that of the late evening 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.999
 three elements 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.999
 everyone was possible on appeal in the book 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.660
 so figure so much so believe to the block 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.920
 how much this tendinitis alalala 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.600
 with time 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.870
 then in the turns of this side of the Alps 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.590
 but no-one 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.630
 the fact that the president should not be there 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.630
 thanks to the merger between anpe that reflect the season 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.880
 Not that easy 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.880
 It is easy 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.840
 when it's difficult for her because m 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.950
 ask if it goes to end up big movements and the beast with 5 6 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.820
 billion euros anyway 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.820
 but the go to it is in the world finals 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.100
 no doubt difficult for her 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 nantes 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.470
 there too the city 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.380
 very big success for the clubs of very big risk taking for the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.440
 adults with that 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.080
 the british 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.280
 but one thing is sure that there will be ok me 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.229
 a medal 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.350
 % and afp ethnic groups 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.770
 who was then in the lead elsewhere and that is why the leonetti law is 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.010
 really far 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.900
 on the fact that this figure the one that allowed us to win the gold 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.900
 the only Olympic title in the history of modern French gymnastics finally 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.900

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.280
 the team of France which maintained a record of 7-2 a French victory 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.940
 French 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.730
 not on what worries me it's tense 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.920
 because little earlier 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 but they also have 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.020
 the first world finals that are not going terribly well for the 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.910
 inhabitants and very attentive to the ears of all 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.729
 remember 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.590
 because of that
