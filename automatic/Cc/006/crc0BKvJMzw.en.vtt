00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.680 
tea bars
cuz<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.309> think<00:00:11.580> they're<00:00:11.880> pretty<00:00:12.030> rad<00:00:12.330> and

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
cuz I think they're pretty rad and

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.039 
cuz I think they're pretty rad and
they're<00:00:13.440> super<00:00:13.650> good<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.670> threw<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.330> ODI<00:00:15.660> grips

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049

and<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.590> put<00:00:16.770> them<00:00:16.830> on<00:00:16.920> backwards<00:00:17.160> because<00:00:17.820> I've

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
and I put them on backwards because I've

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.310 
and I put them on backwards because I've
been<00:00:18.180> running<00:00:18.359> them<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.750> way<00:00:18.869> forever<00:00:19.109> I

been running them that way forever I

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.779 
been running them that way forever I

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.349 
hands I put a little pink bar end on
them<00:00:23.070> because<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.519> always<00:00:23.699> used<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
tomahawk tilt fork um Tom K is the man

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.630 
tomahawk tilt fork um Tom K is the man
and<00:00:41.719> he<00:00:42.719> helped<00:00:43.230> actually<00:00:43.800> design<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.309> Nimbus

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and he helped actually design the Nimbus

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.810 
and he helped actually design the Nimbus
Fork<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.989> he<00:00:46.980> ended<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.340> completely

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
Fork and then he ended up completely

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.880 
Fork and then he ended up completely
designing<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.539> pretty<00:00:48.780> much<00:00:48.960> himself<00:00:49.350> he

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
designing this pretty much himself he

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.860 
designing this pretty much himself he
told<00:00:50.129> me<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.520> he<00:00:50.789> made<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.239> files<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.780> his

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
told me that he made the files on his

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.540 
told me that he made the files on his
computer<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.739> took<00:00:52.860> him<00:00:53.010> right<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.309> tilt

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
computer and just took him right to tilt

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.069 
computer and just took him right to tilt
and<00:00:53.789> ran<00:00:54.000> him<00:00:54.120> through<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.360> machine<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.989> then

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and ran him through the machine and then

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.810 
and ran him through the machine and then
this<00:00:55.230> was<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.469> outcome<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.579> cool<00:00:56.760> that

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
this was the outcome so it's cool that

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.540 
this was the outcome so it's cool that
he<00:00:57.120> fully<00:00:57.510> made<00:00:57.840> his<00:00:58.050> custom<00:00:58.440> fork<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.460> I'm

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
he fully made his custom fork so I'm

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.520 
he fully made his custom fork so I'm
going<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> do<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.719> then<00:01:00.899> I'm<00:01:01.020> running<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
going to do that and then I'm running a

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.620 
going to do that and then I'm running a

that I'm building this scooter kind of
to<00:01:55.439> reminisce<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.100> scooter<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.460> had<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.939> like

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
to reminisce on a scooter I had in like

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.410 
to reminisce on a scooter I had in like
probably<00:01:58.530> early<00:01:59.310> 2012

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
probably early 2012

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.990 
probably early 2012
I<00:02:00.540> ran<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> same<00:02:01.170> bars<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.040> ran<00:02:02.310> an<00:02:02.610> earlier

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
I ran the same bars and I ran an earlier

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.209 
I ran the same bars and I ran an earlier
version<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.750> TSI<00:02:04.200> deck<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.770> was<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.009> same

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
version of a TSI deck that was the same

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.160 
version of a TSI deck that was the same
size<00:02:05.520> as<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.939> one

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
size as this one

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.249 
size as this one
and<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.830> was<00:02:07.950> running<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:09.030> think<00:02:09.539> until<00:02:09.750> legacy

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
and I was running I think until legacy

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.479 
and I was running I think until legacy
fork<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.800> don't<00:02:10.890> think<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.190> Nimbus

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
fork on it I don't think the Nimbus

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.420 
fork on it I don't think the Nimbus
Forks<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.880> came<00:02:12.030> out<00:02:12.180> yet<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.920> I<00:02:13.920> think<00:02:14.250> that

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
Forks it came out yet and I think that

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.760 
Forks it came out yet and I think that
it's<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.730> good<00:02:14.910> size<00:02:15.180> with<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.170> bars<00:02:16.380> for<00:02:16.709> a

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
it's a good size with the bars for a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.010 
it's a good size with the bars for a
rider<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.190> little<00:02:17.489> bit<00:02:17.610> younger<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.300> somebody

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
rider a little bit younger and somebody

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.770 
rider a little bit younger and somebody
who<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.709> just<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.580> bit<00:02:20.730> smaller<00:02:21.090> shouts

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
who is just a little bit smaller shouts

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.580 
who is just a little bit smaller shouts
out<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:21.989> Nathan<00:02:22.440> ten<00:02:22.709> cuz<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:24.080> kid<00:02:25.080> rips<00:02:25.350> and

I've<00:02:27.870> ridden<00:02:28.200> proto<00:02:28.680> bars<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.790> TSI<00:02:30.270> deck

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
I've ridden proto bars and a TSI deck

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.620 
I've ridden proto bars and a TSI deck
into<00:02:30.870> tilt<00:02:31.260> fork<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:32.580> like<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.120> last<00:02:33.269> four

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
into tilt fork for like the last four

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.360 
into tilt fork for like the last four
years<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:35.150> I'm<00:02:36.150> pretty<00:02:36.510> hyped<00:02:36.840> on<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:38.040> setup

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
years so I'm pretty hyped on that setup

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.120 
years so I'm pretty hyped on that setup
I<00:02:38.580> think<00:02:38.760> it's<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.030> best<00:02:39.209> setup<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:40.319> yeah<00:02:40.890> I

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
I think it's the best setup so yeah I

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.009 
I think it's the best setup so yeah I
guess<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.489> should<00:02:41.640> get<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:41.970> first<00:02:42.690> things

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
guess we should get to it first things

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.259 
guess we should get to it first things
first<00:02:43.140> we're<00:02:43.950> gonna<00:02:44.010> throw<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.580> grip<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
first we're gonna throw the grip on the

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.809 
first we're gonna throw the grip on the
deck<00:02:45.510> but<00:02:46.410> unfortunately<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.459> vault<00:02:47.670> has

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
deck but unfortunately the vault has

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.430 
deck but unfortunately the vault has
banned<00:02:48.120> me<00:02:48.269> from<00:02:48.480> gripping<00:02:48.780> decks<00:02:49.170> because

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
banned me from gripping decks because

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.960 
banned me from gripping decks because
I'm<00:02:49.590> not<00:02:49.769> very<00:02:50.010> good<00:02:50.130> at<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.549> so<00:02:50.760> I'm<00:02:50.850> gonna

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
I'm not very good at it so I'm gonna

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.229

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
I don't know why I just feel like it

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.210 
I don't know why I just feel like it
makes<00:04:21.359> more<00:04:21.570> sense<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.900> way<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.470> then<00:04:23.130> I

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
makes more sense that way and then I

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.740 
makes more sense that way and then I
always<00:04:23.400> have<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.700> writing<00:04:23.910> on<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.210> wheels<00:04:24.419> to

the<00:04:24.780> right<00:04:24.870> side<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.290> think<00:04:25.530> it's<00:04:25.740> because<00:04:25.950> I'm

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
the right side I think it's because I'm

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.950 
the right side I think it's because I'm
regular<00:04:26.460> footed<00:04:26.730> so<00:04:27.030> my<00:04:27.150> toes<00:04:27.389> are<00:04:27.600> pointing

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
regular footed so my toes are pointing

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.390 
regular footed so my toes are pointing
out<00:04:28.020> so<00:04:28.290> I<00:04:28.320> just<00:04:28.560> want<00:04:28.770> everything<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.250> be

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
out so I just want everything to be

out so I just want everything to be
going<00:04:29.850> like<00:04:30.240> pointed<00:04:30.690> right<00:04:31.100> that's<00:04:32.100> just<00:04:32.280> a

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
going like pointed right that's just a

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.360 
going like pointed right that's just a
little<00:04:32.729> detail<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.330> always<00:04:33.600> do<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:34.310> now<00:04:35.310> we're

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
little detail I always do and now we're

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
stretch the clamp a little bit to allow

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.350 
stretch the clamp a little bit to allow
the<00:04:42.090> bars<00:04:42.450> to<00:04:42.750> fit<00:04:42.960> in<00:04:43.080> easier<00:04:44.090> we<00:04:45.090> should<00:04:45.270> be

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
the bars to fit in easier we should be

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.740 
the bars to fit in easier we should be
good

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.540
