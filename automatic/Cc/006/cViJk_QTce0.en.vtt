00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.809
 I think it is clear yes here it is I will not I 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.989
 paste over the whole thing so that you can see that 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.239
 stuck on the website film makers you 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.730
 can watch videos so they 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.000
 withstand direct blows chisels hammers 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.460
 in various heavy objects I am almost 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.430
 I am sure that now the film will protect your 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:57.449
 mechanical damage gadget 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:59.370
 let me try to start running even 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:05.060
 if you hit a little bit closer edge she 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:10.290
 will save your iphone if stronger 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.830
 as you can see i already if you film here is not 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.340
 It was 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.290
 the phone has long since crashed as we 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:23.670
 see in the film and everything is in order 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.689
 before almost more than that it seems to me that 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.350
 I can try 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.299
 turn the device and film even protection 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.470
 on the other hand 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:37.640
 let's try how it works by 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.710
 I note on protective equipment 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.780
 which each user must have 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.700
 To protect the device, freeze cut 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.079
 the apparatus is almost intact despite 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.079
 what i'm pretty strong and kill 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.979
 even now he still continues 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:02.049
 give signs of life 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.149
 Roman button I almost see how there 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.560
 shows weather forecast 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.939
 let's remove the battery because 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.069
 the battery still does not protect 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:17.000
 no film and all electronic 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:19.280
 just then I will tell you more this film 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.280
 is able to protect the device by hand 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.880
 any damage and generally any 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.489
 technology 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.540
 see how the film even works 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.540
 neighboring device 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:36.170
