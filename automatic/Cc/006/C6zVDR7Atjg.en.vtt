the first slide of this lab is a section
of<00:00:07.379> rabbit<00:00:08.370> liver<00:00:08.900> that<00:00:09.900> has<00:00:10.429> come<00:00:11.429> from<00:00:11.670> a

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.320 
rabbit infected with a Miria sty de and
this<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> rather<00:00:16.560> confusing<00:00:16.949> slide<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.880> a

a very large degree and this is

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.030 
a very large degree and this is
presumably<00:02:42.110> in<00:02:42.769> response<00:02:43.579> to<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:43.970> parasites

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
presumably in response to the parasites

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.039 
presumably in response to the parasites
need<00:02:46.040> for<00:02:46.400> additional<00:02:46.670> cells<00:02:47.299> to<00:02:47.569> infect

so and so at this at this magnification

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.479 
so and so at this at this magnification
you<00:02:54.530> can<00:02:54.560> see<00:02:55.450> how<00:02:56.450> extensive<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:57.890> bile<00:02:58.190> duct

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
you can see how extensive that bile duct

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.020 
you can see how extensive that bile duct
has<00:02:58.730> become<00:03:00.459> inside<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:02.239> in<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:03.079> in<00:03:03.500> the
