00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the things i think is going to be a moot

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.109 
the things i think is going to be a moot
you<00:00:25.109> pair<00:00:25.320> now<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:26.160> doesn't<00:00:26.490> even<00:00:26.609> seem<00:00:26.939> that

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
you pair now it doesn't even seem that

you pair now it doesn't even seem that
I'm<00:00:27.269> realistic<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.019> new<00:00:28.380> ecology<00:00:28.830> because

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
I'm realistic in the new ecology because

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.609 
I'm realistic in the new ecology because
of<00:00:29.250> course<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.660> 2054<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.050> because<00:00:31.500> it's

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
of course it is 2054 and because it's

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.229 
of course it is 2054 and because it's
not<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> full<00:00:32.009> invincibility<00:00:32.460> invisibility

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
not a full invincibility invisibility

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.840 
not a full invincibility invisibility
soo<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.989> only<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.290> camouflage<00:00:34.800> soup<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.309> can

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
soo it is only a camouflage soup I can

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.670 
soo it is only a camouflage soup I can
actually<00:00:36.000> kind<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.450> see<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.899> happening<00:00:37.469> just

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
actually kind of see it happening just

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.590 
actually kind of see it happening just
simply<00:00:38.070> because<00:00:38.190> there's<00:00:38.879> basically<00:00:39.059> an

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
simply because there's basically an

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.060 
simply because there's basically an
outline<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.379> know<00:00:40.469> you're<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.710> completely

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
that looks bit off and of course the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
that looks bit off and of course the
next<00:00:54.180> thing<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.420> wanted<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.690> talk<00:00:54.870> about

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.969 
kind of see that I can kind of see that
happening<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.439> know<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.560> don't<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:28.829> know

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
happening you know I don't really know

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.859 
happening you know I don't really know
about<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.310> guys<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> knife<00:01:30.689> is

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
about you guys but I think the knife is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.450 
about you guys but I think the knife is
going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.170> gone<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.619> personally<00:01:32.250> think

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
going to be gone and I personally think

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.380 
going to be gone and I personally think
that<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:33.630> kind<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.430> your<00:01:35.430> backhand<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.240> is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
that this kind of your backhand it is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.240 
that this kind of your backhand it is
definite<00:01:36.720> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.439> replace<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:38.009> that

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
definite going to be in replace of that

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.700 
definite going to be in replace of that
so<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> next<00:01:39.390> thing<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.470> kind<00:01:40.650> of

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
so the next thing is this kind of

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.109 
so the next thing is this kind of
tactical<00:01:41.280> grenade<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.790> kind<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:41.970> like<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
tactical grenade it's kind of like a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.060 
tactical grenade it's kind of like a
motion<00:01:42.600> sensor<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.290> saw<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.560> modern

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
motion sensor that we saw in modern

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.920 
motion sensor that we saw in modern
warfare<00:01:44.100> 3<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:45.180> could<00:01:45.360> throw<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.840> can

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
warfare 3 we could throw it and you can

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.270 
warfare 3 we could throw it and you can
actually<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.229> people<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> mini-map

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
actually see people on the mini-map

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.910 
actually see people on the mini-map
whereas<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.110> kind<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.649> them

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
whereas in this we can kind of see them

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.370 
whereas in this we can kind of see them
you<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.549> actually<00:01:50.759> actually<00:01:51.659> around<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you know actually actually around the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.749 
you know actually actually around the
map<00:01:52.619> through<00:01:52.950> walls<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.460> things<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.700> that

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
map through walls and things like that

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.010 
map through walls and things like that
so<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.060> kind<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.360> motion<00:01:54.840> sensor

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
so it's kind of like a motion sensor

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.230 
so it's kind of like a motion sensor
type<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.500> thing<00:01:55.680> which<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.130> think<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.090> comes

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
type of thing which I think if it comes

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.670 
type of thing which I think if it comes
into<00:01:57.420> multiplayer<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:58.259> going<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.439> have<00:01:58.649> to

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
into multiplayer it's going to have to

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.429 
into multiplayer it's going to have to
be<00:01:58.860> kind<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.430> nerf<00:01:59.729> maybe<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.390> possibly<00:02:00.719> but

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
be kind of nerf maybe just possibly but

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.870 
be kind of nerf maybe just possibly but
it<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.649> actually<00:02:01.770> pretty<00:02:02.040> difficult<00:02:02.250> she

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
it is actually pretty difficult she

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.130 
it is actually pretty difficult she
obviously<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.390> able<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.600> see<00:02:03.810> people

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
obviously to be able to see people

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.319 
obviously to be able to see people
through<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> walls<00:02:05.009> simply<00:02:05.340> because<00:02:05.820> there's

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
through the walls simply because there's

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.940 
through the walls simply because there's
so<00:02:06.540> much<00:02:06.719> other<00:02:06.869> things<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.439> are<00:02:07.619> going<00:02:07.770> on

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
so much other things that are going on

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.430 
so much other things that are going on
around<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.369> map<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.849> that's<00:02:09.840> one<00:02:10.050> thing<00:02:10.229> and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
around the map so that's one thing and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.550 
around the map so that's one thing and
then<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.619> course<00:02:10.879> there's<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.000> crazy<00:02:12.440> crazy

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
then of course there's this crazy crazy

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.080 
then of course there's this crazy crazy
the<00:02:13.620> armor<00:02:14.069> now<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.700> probably<00:02:14.849> gonna<00:02:15.030> be

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
the armor now this is probably gonna be

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.330 
the armor now this is probably gonna be
the<00:02:15.209> juggernaut<00:02:15.780> suit<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.170> know<00:02:16.319> we<00:02:16.980> seem<00:02:17.190> to

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
the juggernaut suit you know we seem to

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.890 
the juggernaut suit you know we seem to
see<00:02:17.520> juggernaut<00:02:17.970> in<00:02:18.120> pretty<00:02:18.330> much<00:02:18.390> every

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
see juggernaut in pretty much every

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.890 
see juggernaut in pretty much every
single<00:02:19.260> game<00:02:19.440> now<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.760> think<00:02:21.120> if<00:02:21.599> there<00:02:21.780> was

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
single game now and I think if there was

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.180 
single game now and I think if there was
going<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.110> be<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.230> juggernaut<00:02:22.560> soon<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:23.040> is

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
going to be a juggernaut soon this is

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.130 
going to be a juggernaut soon this is
definitely<00:02:23.459> what<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:23.910> would<00:02:24.030> be<00:02:24.140> because

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
definitely what it would be because

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.170 
definitely what it would be because
obviously<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:26.160> could<00:02:26.280> easily<00:02:26.400> switch<00:02:27.000> out

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
obviously you could easily switch out

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.670 
obviously you could easily switch out
his<00:02:27.300> weapon<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.870> know<00:02:28.050> haven't<00:02:28.410> bring<00:02:28.560> out

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
his weapon you know haven't bring out

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.110 
his weapon you know haven't bring out
our<00:02:28.709> right<00:02:29.010> shoulder<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.430> if<00:02:29.580> anything<00:02:29.970> like

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
our right shoulder and if anything like

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.089 
our right shoulder and if anything like
that<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.450> maybe<00:02:30.599> even<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.900> pistol<00:02:31.319> I<00:02:31.440> said<00:02:31.980> that

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
that it maybe even a pistol I said that

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.960 
that it maybe even a pistol I said that
is<00:02:32.190> definitely<00:02:32.489> what's<00:02:32.670> going<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:32.880> be<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
is definitely what's going to be the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.610 
is definitely what's going to be the
riot<00:02:33.209> shield<00:02:33.510> now<00:02:34.050> there<00:02:34.170> are<00:02:34.200> also<00:02:34.380> these

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
riot shield now there are also these

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.589 
riot shield now there are also these
crazy<00:02:35.190> looking<00:02:35.819> things<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.209> look<00:02:36.300> very<00:02:36.540> very

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
crazy looking things that look very very

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.690 
crazy looking things that look very very
similar<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.290> vulture<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.099> call<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.580> duty

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
similar to the vulture in call of duty

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.130 
similar to the vulture in call of duty
ghosts<00:02:39.120> because<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.510> course<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:39.840> modern

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
ghosts because of course in modern

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.229 
ghosts because of course in modern
warfare<00:02:40.260> 3<00:02:40.470> we<00:02:41.310> saw<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.489> recon<00:02:41.910> drone<00:02:42.120> in

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
warfare 3 we saw the recon drone in

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.089 
warfare 3 we saw the recon drone in
black<00:02:42.420> ops<00:02:42.540> 2<00:02:42.780> we<00:02:42.900> saw<00:02:42.930> thee<00:02:43.230> at<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.860> quad

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
black ops 2 we saw thee at the quad

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.530 
black ops 2 we saw thee at the quad
Rochin<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.670> course<00:02:44.849> in<00:02:44.970> college<00:02:45.090> if<00:02:45.300> he<00:02:45.360> goes

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
Rochin of course in college if he goes

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.360 
Rochin of course in college if he goes
we<00:02:45.690> got<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> Griffin<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.590> vulture<00:02:47.190> and

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
we got the Griffin and the vulture and

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.789 
we got the Griffin and the vulture and
they<00:02:48.000> look<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.690> similar<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.260> think<00:02:49.500> we're

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
they look so so similar so I think we're

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.410 
they look so so similar so I think we're
basically<00:02:50.040> going<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.370> see<00:02:50.519> these<00:02:50.670> out<00:02:50.970> or<00:02:51.269> this

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
basically going to see these out or this

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.449

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
riot shield which is kind of lit looks

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.610 
riot shield which is kind of lit looks
pretty<00:03:24.780> awesome<00:03:24.900> it's<00:03:25.200> very<00:03:25.350> easy<00:03:25.470> to

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
pretty awesome it's very easy to

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.349 
pretty awesome it's very easy to
obviously<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.250> walk<00:03:26.730> around<00:03:26.910> with<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.269> because

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
obviously I walk around with it because

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.819 
obviously I walk around with it because
you<00:03:27.540> can<00:03:27.660> just<00:03:27.690> place<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:28.049> into<00:03:28.470> this<00:03:28.620> very

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
you can just place it into this very

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.699 
you can just place it into this very
small<00:03:29.130> tube<00:03:29.430> which<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.989> looks<00:03:31.230> pretty<00:03:31.410> good

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
small tube which is it looks pretty good

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.199 
small tube which is it looks pretty good
it<00:03:32.040> really<00:03:32.280> looks<00:03:32.489> pretty<00:03:32.670> good<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.000> think

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
it really looks pretty good and I think

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.819 
it really looks pretty good and I think
if<00:03:33.299> this<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.959> course<00:03:33.989> in<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.440> multiplayer

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
if this is of course in the multiplayer

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.440 
if this is of course in the multiplayer
it's<00:03:35.609> only<00:03:35.730> going<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:35.910> be<00:03:35.970> able<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.209> stretch<00:03:36.420> a

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
it's only going to be able to stretch a

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.759 
it's only going to be able to stretch a
certain<00:03:36.840> amount<00:03:36.989> because<00:03:37.200> obviously<00:03:37.410> if<00:03:37.680> it

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
certain amount because obviously if it

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.280 
certain amount because obviously if it
stretches<00:03:37.980> for<00:03:38.910> like<00:03:39.030> 10<00:03:39.450> yards<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.109> that's

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
stretches for like 10 yards and that's

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.690 
stretches for like 10 yards and that's
pretty<00:03:40.560> it's<00:03:40.799> pretty<00:03:40.829> overpowered<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.549> could

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
pretty it's pretty overpowered you could

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.550 
pretty it's pretty overpowered you could
basically<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:42.660> know<00:03:42.780> fill<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.290> whole<00:03:43.530> room

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
basically you know fill a whole room

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.250 
basically you know fill a whole room
full<00:03:43.859> of<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.400> but<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.630> is<00:03:45.720> pretty<00:03:45.930> much<00:03:46.049> it

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
full of it but that is pretty much it

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.289 
full of it but that is pretty much it
for<00:03:46.319> this<00:03:46.530> for<00:03:46.889> this<00:03:46.920> video<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:48.090> there

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
for this for this video you and there

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.170 
for this for this video you and there
was<00:03:48.450> one<00:03:48.480> more<00:03:48.750> thing<00:03:48.989> out<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.920> do<00:03:50.069> with<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.489> gun

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
was one more thing out to do with a gun

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.000 
was one more thing out to do with a gun
it<00:03:51.329> was<00:03:51.420> actually<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.750> site<00:03:52.109> and<00:03:52.410> it<00:03:52.530> looks<00:03:52.739> kind

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
it was actually a site and it looks kind

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.550 
it was actually a site and it looks kind
of<00:03:53.040> like<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.430> an<00:03:53.549> infrared<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.239> thermal<00:03:55.049> or<00:03:55.170> heat

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
of like it an infrared a thermal or heat

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.620 
of like it an infrared a thermal or heat
signature<00:03:56.100> kind<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.519> site<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.269> look<00:03:57.389> so<00:03:57.510> it

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
signature kind of site and look so it

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.940 
signature kind of site and look so it
has<00:03:57.750> some<00:03:57.900> kind<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.109> red<00:03:58.290> dot<00:03:58.500> on<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.739> as<00:03:58.799> well

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
has some kind of red dot on it as well

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.349 
has some kind of red dot on it as well
which<00:03:59.190> i<00:03:59.340> think<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.760> obviously<00:04:00.090> going<00:04:00.239> to<00:04:00.299> be

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
which i think is obviously going to be

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.300 
which i think is obviously going to be
an<00:04:00.450> attachment<00:04:00.720> for<00:04:01.109> for<00:04:01.560> most<00:04:01.739> of<00:04:01.889> for<00:04:02.160> most

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
an attachment for for most of for most

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.800 
an attachment for for most of for most
of<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.489> weapons<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:03.090> looks<00:04:03.269> like<00:04:03.420> there's<00:04:03.569> two

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
of the weapons it looks like there's two

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.289 
of the weapons it looks like there's two
sides<00:04:04.079> that<00:04:04.680> basically<00:04:05.040> merge<00:04:05.519> into<00:04:05.819> one<00:04:05.940> so<00:04:06.269> I

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
sides that basically merge into one so I

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.940 
sides that basically merge into one so I
you<00:04:06.420> know<00:04:06.540> I<00:04:06.569> don't<00:04:06.660> know<00:04:06.959> if<00:04:07.109> one<00:04:07.620> is<00:04:07.769> the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
you know I don't know if one is the

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.349 
you know I don't know if one is the
standard<00:04:08.430> red<00:04:08.609> dot<00:04:08.790> sight<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.090> then<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.239> can

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
standard red dot sight and then you can

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.670 
standard red dot sight and then you can
also<00:04:09.480> have<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:09.780> know<00:04:09.959> another<00:04:10.350> attachment

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
also have you know another attachment

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.830 
also have you know another attachment
that<00:04:11.400> basically<00:04:11.819> pops<00:04:12.150> up<00:04:12.299> in<00:04:12.389> front<00:04:12.569> of<00:04:12.690> it

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
that basically pops up in front of it

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.360 
that basically pops up in front of it
that<00:04:13.109> you<00:04:13.139> can<00:04:13.260> switch<00:04:13.590> on<00:04:13.739> and<00:04:13.920> off<00:04:14.010> kind<00:04:14.310> of

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
that you can switch on and off kind of

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.400 
that you can switch on and off kind of
like<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.609> Ripper<00:04:14.970> which<00:04:15.510> makes<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:15.900> into<00:04:16.139> two

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
like the Ripper which makes it into two

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.319 
like the Ripper which makes it into two
more<00:04:16.560> like<00:04:16.739> an<00:04:16.859> acog<00:04:17.280> site<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.669> can<00:04:17.760> you

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329
