00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.580
 Hi there, this video on the site Kedar com 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.849
 my name is seeds we are at computex 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.240
 We are at the presentation asus rog it 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.539
 asus lesson 2014 computer with conference and 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.660
 today we showed a lot of new products 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.330
 some generally interesting they are 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.980
 will be interesting to those who know how 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.380
 use volt meters and everything 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.240
 the rest is who is him and therefore 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.430
 look at all that we will 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.200
 interesting here are 2 new 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.640
 computer to stop and now by the way not 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.670
 introduce myself hefty presented 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.379
 only two of them have this one called g20 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.120
 it's gr8 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.890
 I'll tell you the difference between them right now 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.809
 they call it console bye 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.270
 that is, in principle, you put the x-box 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.860
 put on exhausted put here such 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.629
 computer at my TV and 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.579
 now actually i can't remember 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.590
 many computers that would be nice 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.960
 looked at you near the TV and these 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.040
 here will look though I would have this 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.200
 called the console for now because 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.059
 xbox one or playstation 4 they look 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.250
 they are about the same size 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.170
 the difference between the following 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.610
 core i7 is used here and here 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.100
 speed m but here in the mobile solution 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.200
 i.e. low voltage processor i.e. 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.030
 it is for certain only for 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.090
 a certain set of hyper this one here 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.110
 hardcore full of both they have a lot of system 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.479
 talked about what system 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.580
 cooling use takes cold 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.800
 the air and from here goes hot here 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.950
 even a little bit warm here is this model 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.650
 has three zones and glow times then two 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.580
 here on the floor and another zone on different 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.050
 friend on two sides have a special 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.810
 software that can allow you 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.970
 configure your computer's glow like 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.550
 you like it cool What I like 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.590
 your keyboard color 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.650
 I have lights here 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.440
 slim optical drive that is, and can here 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.009
 still cd-disks puts here naturally them 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.930
 no there are all necessary ports on 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.600
 front of this hut and headphones and 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.060
 microphone and here too from that side in 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.100
 principle, too, everything that is needed yet 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.830
 one feature of both models 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.519
 power supplies are not externally internal what 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.140
 allows you to reduce the noise from the computer and 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.780
 lower the temperature as we were told 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.610
 product manager and they don't advise 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.190
 nothing to change here except the following 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.590
 and there and there you can replace or 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.230
 add a hard disk there is here 2 and 5 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.120
 inch standard and you can 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.709
 replace RAM or add or all 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.380
 the rest includes jack you 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.850
 first of all you are not recommended to you 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.190
 change because special 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.990
 cooling engineering solutions exactly 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.970
 This video of this video card was 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.580
 applied and therefore no one guarantees 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.200
 that she will be just as cool as 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.850
 same work you since it is after all 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.850
 gaming computers naturally here 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.560
 the most modern lan is supported 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.390
 port from intel also said that 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.830
 already installed miracast chip which 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.000
 will go wifi adapter which 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.550
 supports miracast 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.580
 all technology as for a bunch of software 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.100
 Susus from asus new all to 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.860
 you could play and not bathe it 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.620
 such a complete solution bought put 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.570
 and play and this monitor is finally asus 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.120
 released as I suspected asus 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.410
 released a monitor with juicing am you if 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.170
 did not look take a look what it is 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.120
 technology is this new flagship 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.900
 republic of gamer sleep is very easy 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.840
 spinning moves right away that despite 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.440
 the fact that asos got carried away 4k in this 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.550
 this spring-summer season 2014 or something 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.690
 so this 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.420
 it is correct it is not 4k monitor it is 2560 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.250
 1440 gamers no longer need him 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.530
 the most important feature is all his 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.270
 design naturally it is made in style 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.720
 there are black reds and 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:55.150
 and everything shines everything as it likes to do 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.150
 product class let me go too 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.770
 let's go on why am I too 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.930
 normally it turns out 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.530
 You can basically put it like this 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.720
 monitor if you for example blew your neck 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.240
 you can play like that 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.600
 moves along this axis moves along this 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.330
 axis and here is the whole stand it moves 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.049
 I must say that all the hinges are all very 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.609
 very cool that is 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.039
 it does not seem that she is so flimsy she 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.379
 very cool and for those who like to play 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.659
 players then watch see how I play 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:29.520
 warm yeah come on and so forth here it will be 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.569
 very cool monitor of the connectors 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.240
 principle 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:36.330
 sadness but this is the minimum that you need 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.220
 Anyone is driving a hub for 2 yusb 30 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.800
 and displayport 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.849
 that is, not riding the money divine in his to 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.970
 sorry when you have 2560 by 1440 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:58.800
 need benefits and power jack principle 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:05:00.330
 nothing else there are no commands also 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.000
 asus introduced mechanical keyboard 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.590
 here is an old has such a design of course 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.620
 they said that they have a unique one too 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.840
 here are these mechanisms but they are the principle of all 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.180
 very much every manufacturer and very 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.870
 says a lot to go through the mechanism in general I 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.419
 I will break 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:19.949
 now you have a premium line 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:21.690
 laptops labeled 500 have rx500 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.719
 and which we have already shown you now 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.270
 we look at the gx500 is rogovsky 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:29.130
 computer up to 300 republic of games he 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.050
 very similar to n and 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.639
 but he has naturally big 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.770
 the difference is primarily design and 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.050
 coloring according to estimates what he is awesome 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.469
 yesterday we have not seen him so I 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.590
 called 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:41.490
 nx100 what i want but i i understand that 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.139
 jetix 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.250
 that's what i want minutes backlight 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:49.500
 the keyboard is red 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.800
 Diamond had which is called means 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.229
 diamond or before the diamond cut 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.629
 he is red here is very beautiful 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.849
 the screen here unlike nx is not touch 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:02.819
 that's good but too 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.889
 4k is not a disadvantage, it's just 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:07.590
 oddity because it's gaming 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:10.520
 laptop for gamers and play on it 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.520
 resolution 3840 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:17.460
 over in 2160 it is well it is interesting who in 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.600
 what games can you play now 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.830
 this laptop 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.650
 interesting is because here in 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.280
 principle on the one hand top iron 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:28.680
 geforce gtx 860m natural fourth 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.870
 generation intel core i7 processors 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.390
 RAM up to 16 gigabytes 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.760
 let me remind you that the previous robot notebooks 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.920
 it was up to 32 but naturally and create 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.650
 the solution is here in the raid so there will be more 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.600
 and speed is the internal speed of the system 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.520
 will just roll off on the presentation 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.500
 it seemed he was plastic but no 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.300
 it looks like it is completely metal 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.100
 this part of this part and this part 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.450
 not metal accordingly i'm here 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.480
 I tried to rub my fat 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:58.560
 dirty fingers don't think thats from here 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.940
 there will be such constant friction here 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.230
 some spots don't think it will 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:06.090
 so there is a big touchpad which is very 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:09.030
 tightly pressed all cool keyboard 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.770
 By the way, too, I will not say that she 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.720
 she bends she does not bend 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.060
 note that the backlight 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.280
 keyboard and there but w 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.110
 sd is highlighted more they 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.510
 connect on the sides too this 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.010
 a trifle but really looks very cool 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:26.430
 mini on the left side 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:29.130
 displayport full hdmi and usb and 30 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.990
 on the other hand paired 35 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.270
 millimeter headset jack 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.670
 card reader and two Józef this year 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.830
 asus rog was just mega cool you 

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.170
 want these laptops do you want these 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.390
 monitors you want these and mice and 

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.220
 keyboards and so on and of course like 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.350
 Do you want your Xbox and 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.860
 playstation and put also console 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.450

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.130
 thanks for watching subscribe 

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:53.360
 channel and soon there will be more videos with 

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.360
 computer statistic
