and<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:48.960> left<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.980> new<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.730> don't<00:00:51.090> like

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
and they left but this new I don't like

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.630 
and they left but this new I don't like
the<00:00:51.390> smell<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.600> water<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:53.010> couple<00:00:53.489> of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the smell of water and a couple of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.939 
the smell of water and a couple of
things<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.940> has<00:00:54.120> too<00:00:54.719> much<00:00:54.899> customization<00:00:55.410> for

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
things it has too much customization for

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.560 
things it has too much customization for
one<00:00:56.100> thing<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.489> know<00:00:56.550> that's<00:00:56.940> weird<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.390> bitch

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
one thing I know that's weird to bitch

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.689 
one thing I know that's weird to bitch
about<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.410> think<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.129> last<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.430> had

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
about but I think the last one had

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.160 
about but I think the last one had
enough<00:01:00.030> maybe<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.539> could<00:01:00.629> use<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.840> little<00:01:00.989> more

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
enough maybe you could use a little more

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.630 
enough maybe you could use a little more
but<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.469> one<00:01:01.620> went<00:01:01.770> over<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> top<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.550> I

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
but this one went over the top and I

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.740 
but this one went over the top and I
think<00:01:02.850> where<00:01:02.969> they<00:01:03.059> added<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.629> much

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
think where they added so much

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.050 
think where they added so much
customization<00:01:04.220> they<00:01:05.220> kind<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.489> hurt<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> game

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
customization they kind of hurt the game

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.600 
customization they kind of hurt the game
plan<00:01:06.299> aspect<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.020> now<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.010> fun<00:01:08.340> don't

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
plan aspect of it now it is fun don't

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.160 
plan aspect of it now it is fun don't
get<00:01:08.700> me<00:01:08.820> wrong<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.180> think<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.630> game<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.840> fun

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
get me wrong I think this game is fun

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.429 
get me wrong I think this game is fun
but<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.560> doesn't<00:01:10.920> play<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:12.360> me<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:12.960> good<00:01:13.080> as<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
but it doesn't play to me as good as the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.350 
but it doesn't play to me as good as the
last<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.979> console<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:14.700> I've<00:01:14.880> played<00:01:15.180> this

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
last one on console now I've played this

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.240 
last one on console now I've played this
on<00:01:15.540> PC<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> lot<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.470> people<00:01:16.590> haven't<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.159> was

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
on PC a lot of people haven't but it was

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.789 
on PC a lot of people haven't but it was
at<00:01:17.400> events<00:01:17.850> played<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.990> pc<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.530> they<00:01:19.590> played

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
at events played on pc and they played

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.469 
at events played on pc and they played
better<00:01:20.070> than<00:01:20.189> call<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.549> duty<00:01:20.909> or<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.210> good<00:01:21.360> as

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
better than call of duty or as good as

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.149 
better than call of duty or as good as
call<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> duty<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.990> was<00:01:22.080> very<00:01:22.290> fluid<00:01:22.680> now

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
call of duty it was very fluid now

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.340 
call of duty it was very fluid now
obviously<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> console<00:01:24.990> game<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.259> they

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
obviously this is a console game so they

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.440 
obviously this is a console game so they
drop<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> down<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> 30fps<00:01:26.310> why<00:01:27.090> they<00:01:27.270> couldn't

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
drop it down to 30fps why they couldn't

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.740 
drop it down to 30fps why they couldn't
do<00:01:27.600> 60<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> don't<00:01:28.409> know<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.280> all

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
do 60 I don't know this is for like all

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.630 
do 60 I don't know this is for like all
battlefield<00:01:30.750> related<00:01:31.049> games<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:32.549> a

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
battlefield related games so that's a

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.190 
battlefield related games so that's a
big<00:01:32.790> problem<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.299> feels<00:01:33.570> really<00:01:33.689> heavy<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
big problem it feels really heavy and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.679 
big problem it feels really heavy and
clunky<00:01:34.579> sometimes<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.790> fluid<00:01:36.060> dynamics<00:01:36.570> of

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
clunky sometimes the fluid dynamics of

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.969 
clunky sometimes the fluid dynamics of
your<00:01:36.720> character<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.350> really<00:01:37.650> good<00:01:37.829> your

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
your character is really good your

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.190 
your character is really good your
mantling<00:01:38.490> over<00:01:38.790> objects<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> cool<00:01:39.689> way<00:01:39.720> it's

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
mantling over objects in a cool way it's

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.080 
mantling over objects in a cool way it's
all<00:01:40.350> fluid<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:40.979> like<00:01:41.130> when<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.340> go<00:01:41.460> prone<00:01:41.790> and

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
all fluid but like when you go prone and

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.060 
all fluid but like when you go prone and
lift<00:01:42.270> yourself<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:43.200> all<00:01:43.350> heavy<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.860> it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
lift yourself up it's all heavy and it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.499 
lift yourself up it's all heavy and it
takes<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.340> while<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.549> get<00:01:44.640> your<00:01:44.790> gun<00:01:44.970> set<00:01:45.240> where

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
takes a while to get your gun set where

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.690 
takes a while to get your gun set where
you<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.840> shoot<00:01:46.049> whatnot<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> don't

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you can shoot whatnot so then I don't

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.969 
you can shoot whatnot so then I don't
like<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.329> killstreaks<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.079> me<00:01:49.229> are<00:01:49.290> confusing

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
like the killstreaks to me are confusing

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.260 
like the killstreaks to me are confusing
compared<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.490> last<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:50.970> seen<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
top left that bar that fills up that's

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.520 
top left that bar that fills up that's
like<00:01:53.909> an<00:01:54.030> arbitrary<00:01:54.630> thing<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.380> don't

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530

killstreak because you get two options

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.110 
killstreak because you get two options
it<00:02:09.629> increased<00:02:10.259> your<00:02:10.379> point<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.890> lot<00:02:11.039> more<00:02:11.340> but

it increased your point a lot more but
you<00:02:12.180> didn't<00:02:12.450> kill<00:02:12.690> anyone<00:02:12.900> really

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
for this but they changed how they do it

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.039 
for this but they changed how they do it
like<00:02:17.579> it's<00:02:17.879> that<00:02:18.030> bar<00:02:18.299> and<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.599> really<00:02:18.870> don't

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
like it's that bar and I really don't

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.130 
like it's that bar and I really don't
like<00:02:19.109> that<00:02:19.909> and<00:02:20.909> see<00:02:21.269> like<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.540> fills<00:02:21.750> up<00:02:21.989> if

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
like that and see like it fills up if

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.020 
like that and see like it fills up if
they<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:22.439> gave<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.620> number<00:02:23.189> there<00:02:23.459> with<00:02:23.819> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
they just gave a number there with the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.030 
they just gave a number there with the
bar<00:02:24.209> I'd<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:24.569> cool<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:24.989> it's<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.379> random<00:02:25.709> you

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
bar I'd be cool but it's so random you

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.500 
bar I'd be cool but it's so random you
have<00:02:26.159> no<00:02:26.310> idea<00:02:26.549> if<00:02:26.609> you're<00:02:26.730> closer<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.359> you're

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
have no idea if you're closer if you're

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.080 
have no idea if you're closer if you're
far<00:02:27.750> too<00:02:28.709> getting<00:02:29.069> a<00:02:29.189> kill<00:02:29.400> streak<00:02:29.489> or<00:02:29.730> what<00:02:29.879> is

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090

first medal of honor you could do that
as<00:02:58.349> well<00:02:58.879> that<00:02:59.879> was<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.030> perk<00:03:00.329> of<00:03:00.510> each<00:03:00.810> class

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
you could throw it out mo or he'll could

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.250 
you could throw it out mo or he'll could
be<00:03:03.269> wrong<00:03:03.419> on<00:03:03.569> that<00:03:03.629> but<00:03:03.750> that's<00:03:03.989> just<00:03:04.079> how<00:03:04.230> I

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
be wrong on that but that's just how I

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.750 
be wrong on that but that's just how I
vaguely<00:03:04.560> remember<00:03:04.829> it<00:03:06.470> who<00:03:07.470> just<00:03:08.250> ranted<00:03:08.669> on

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.240 
just ranted on so I think it's fun if
you<00:03:11.819> want<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.060> play<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.450> um<00:03:12.659> I'm<00:03:13.590> gonna<00:03:13.709> do<00:03:13.919> this
