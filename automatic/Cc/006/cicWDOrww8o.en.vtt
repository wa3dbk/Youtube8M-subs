00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.620
 we continue with the crafts 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.510
 Christmas to decorate our house and 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.429
 we continue with the ideas to do 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.279
 Christmas trees in this case the only thing 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:21.960
 what we are going to need is a magazine that 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.960
 sure we have some at home 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.460
 The first thing we have to do to 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.600
 to make this Christmas tree is to take it 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.600
 the covers to the magazine 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.809
 and let's start to elaborate the tree is 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.210
 very simple we simply have the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.550
 magazine that had to double all these 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.010
 leaves like the good magazine doubles 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.149
 Well in three steps 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.149
 the first step 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.100
 the second step 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.250
 the third step 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.190
 so we have to talk about it all 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.590
 the party 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.330
 I already tell you that it is entertaining and that 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.520
 you have a realist like my father has 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.520
 many pages are going to be a little while 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.030
 the challenge we have achieved 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.090
 make a Christmas tree with a 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.500
 old magazine that we had at home 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.630
 advice use a magazine that has 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.080
 many pages so that it is better 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.540
 the tree and second council finalize 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.450
 putting a star or something in the part 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.910
 from above a wool pompom or a 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.740
 star made of magazine well then 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.300
 this is already the tree that has cost me 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.120
 zero euros because the time also 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.790
 gave away so I here I have a 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.219
 Christmas tree for the room 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.019
 for very little money I hope it serves you 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:42.879
 the idea and put it into practice if 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.879
 you want to save a few euros this Christmas
