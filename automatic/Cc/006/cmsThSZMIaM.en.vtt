you want to do is you want to mark your
pliers<00:01:26.070> with<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> texture<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.200> little

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
pliers with a texture it's a little

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.649 
pliers with a texture it's a little
black<00:01:28.680> mark<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.420> make

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
black mark it's so that you can make

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.350 
black mark it's so that you can make
exactly<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.770> same<00:01:31.979> size<00:01:33.590> loop<00:01:34.590> every<00:01:35.369> time<00:01:35.610> so

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
exactly the same size loop every time so

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.600 
exactly the same size loop every time so
we're<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.540> going<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.200> grab<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.189> end<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
we're just going to grab the end of the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.120 
we're just going to grab the end of the
wire<00:01:41.060> curl<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.240> tight<00:01:42.600> against<00:01:43.049> your<00:01:43.110> finger

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.870 

let<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.280> slip<00:01:47.549> back

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
let it slip back

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.010 
let it slip back
and<00:01:49.799> curl<00:01:50.799> it<00:01:50.950> so<00:01:51.219> that<00:01:51.369> there's<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.939> D<00:01:52.299> so<00:01:52.810> that

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
and curl it so that there's a D so that

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.100 
and curl it so that there's a D so that
this<00:01:53.170> bit<00:01:53.469> touches<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.369> wire<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.960> we're

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
this bit touches the wire then we're

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.429 
this bit touches the wire then we're
going<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.439> just<00:01:56.680> slip<00:01:58.829> these<00:01:59.829> pliers<00:02:00.189> down

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
going to just slip these pliers down

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.889 
going to just slip these pliers down
Center<00:02:02.439> that<00:02:02.679> loop<00:02:04.259> we're<00:02:05.259> going<00:02:05.289> to<00:02:06.899> decide

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
Center that loop we're going to decide

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.540 
Center that loop we're going to decide
where<00:02:08.769> on<00:02:09.130> these<00:02:09.399> pliers<00:02:09.789> we<00:02:10.660> want<00:02:11.040> to<00:02:12.040> use<00:02:12.250> for

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
where on these pliers we want to use for

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.160 
where on these pliers we want to use for
the<00:02:12.640> next<00:02:12.790> bit<00:02:13.120> because<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.690> will<00:02:13.810> determine

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
the next bit because that will determine

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.990 
the next bit because that will determine
the<00:02:14.349> length<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.099> drop<00:02:15.400> for<00:02:15.819> these

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
the length of the drop for these

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.880 
the length of the drop for these
earrings<00:02:16.769> so<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:19.360> loop<00:02:19.569> is<00:02:19.959> up<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:22.890> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
earrings so the loop is up the the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.809 
earrings so the loop is up the the
opening<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.519> up<00:02:25.349> so<00:02:26.349> we're<00:02:26.500> going<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.769> on<00:02:27.459> these

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
opening is up so we're going to on these

now by marking your pliers you should be
able<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.209> duplicate<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:05.019> exactly<00:03:05.829> every

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
able to duplicate this exactly every

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.390 
able to duplicate this exactly every
time<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.959> 50<00:03:08.440> ml<00:03:08.620> long<00:03:08.859> piece<00:03:09.160> if

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
time so this is a 50 ml long piece if

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.039 
time so this is a 50 ml long piece if
you<00:03:09.519> want<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.730> longer<00:03:10.090> tail<00:03:10.329> make<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.930> little

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
you want a longer tail make it a little

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.819 
you want a longer tail make it a little
bit<00:03:11.260> longer<00:03:13.139> now<00:03:14.139> we're<00:03:14.260> going<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.500> make<00:03:14.799> a

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
bit longer now we're going to make a

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:21.379 
bit longer now we're going to make a
spiral<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:16.120> for<00:03:16.840> this<00:03:16.989> we're<00:03:17.230> going<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.530> use<00:03:17.650> a

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:27.690 

60<00:03:23.579> 60<00:03:24.579> millimeter<00:03:25.030> long<00:03:25.239> piece<00:03:25.569> of<00:03:25.750> wire<00:03:26.700> we

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
60 60 millimeter long piece of wire we

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.550 
60 60 millimeter long piece of wire we
don't<00:03:27.880> have<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.359> worry<00:03:28.569> too<00:03:28.840> much<00:03:28.870> about<00:03:29.079> the

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
don't have to worry too much about the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.920 
don't have to worry too much about the
end<00:03:29.799> of<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.010> wire<00:03:30.250> on<00:03:30.519> this<00:03:30.700> one<00:03:30.970> because<00:03:31.540> it's

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
end of the wire on this one because it's

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.009 
end of the wire on this one because it's
going<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.170> be<00:03:32.290> inside<00:03:32.950> our<00:03:33.220> spiral<00:03:33.720> but<00:03:34.720> still

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
going to be inside our spiral but still

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.800 
going to be inside our spiral but still
like<00:03:35.350> take<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.100> sanding<00:03:36.549> stick<00:03:36.819> and<00:03:37.600> just

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
like take the sanding stick and just

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.340 
like take the sanding stick and just
lock<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.319> rough<00:03:38.500> edge<00:03:38.769> off<00:03:39.060> both<00:03:40.060> ends<00:03:42.780> now<00:03:43.780> to

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
lock the rough edge off both ends now to

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.379 
lock the rough edge off both ends now to
do<00:03:44.500> your<00:03:44.739> spiral<00:03:45.099> what<00:03:45.489> you<00:03:45.760> want<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.090> do<00:03:46.239> is

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
do your spiral what you want to do is

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.699 
do your spiral what you want to do is
you<00:03:46.540> want<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.780> grab<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.769> end<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:50.049> just

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
you want to grab the end so that it just

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.190 
you want to grab the end so that it just
a<00:03:50.859> little<00:03:51.099> bit<00:03:51.220> hanging<00:03:51.459> out<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:52.780> we're<00:03:52.989> just

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
a little bit hanging out and we're just

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.600 
a little bit hanging out and we're just
going<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.880> pull<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.030> wire<00:03:55.269> around

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:08.000 

using<00:04:00.610> just<00:04:01.210> our<00:04:01.420> fingers

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.940 

yeah<00:04:08.690> and<00:04:09.690> now<00:04:09.840> when<00:04:10.290> we<00:04:10.319> get<00:04:10.560> this<00:04:10.739> whole

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
yeah and now when we get this whole

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.580 
yeah and now when we get this whole
thing<00:04:11.010> spiraled<00:04:11.790> up<00:04:11.970> so<00:04:12.299> that<00:04:12.480> all<00:04:13.140> there<00:04:13.440> is

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
thing spiraled up so that all there is

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.619 
thing spiraled up so that all there is
left<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.430> very<00:04:14.790> little<00:04:15.120> bit<00:04:15.360> of<00:04:15.480> the

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
left is the very little bit of the

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.000 
left is the very little bit of the
straight<00:04:15.959> end<00:04:16.139> we're<00:04:16.410> going<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.769> turn<00:04:16.949> that

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
straight end we're going to turn that

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:29.860 
straight end we're going to turn that
into<00:04:17.220> our<00:04:17.549> loop<00:04:23.120> this<00:04:24.120> is<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.389> little<00:04:24.750> bit<00:04:25.250> funky

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.510 

so<00:04:30.870> continue<00:04:31.500> making<00:04:31.740> your<00:04:32.520> spiral<00:04:33.889> now<00:04:34.889> we

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
so continue making your spiral now we

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.460 
so continue making your spiral now we
want<00:04:35.760> this<00:04:36.030> bit<00:04:36.330> to<00:04:36.870> be<00:04:37.020> straight<00:04:37.410> up<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.710> down

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
want this bit to be straight up and down

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.110 
want this bit to be straight up and down
so<00:04:40.470> here<00:04:40.710> we<00:04:40.830> have<00:04:41.010> our<00:04:41.190> spiral<00:04:41.699> and<00:04:41.789> you<00:04:41.910> just

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
so here we have our spiral and you just

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.570 
so here we have our spiral and you just
need<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.330> determine<00:04:42.810> which<00:04:43.229> way<00:04:43.500> you<00:04:44.280> want<00:04:44.460> the

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
need to determine which way you want the

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.210 
need to determine which way you want the
spiral<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.000> go<00:04:45.270> right<00:04:45.539> or<00:04:45.750> left<00:04:46.010> because<00:04:47.010> when

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
spiral to go right or left because when

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.150 
spiral to go right or left because when
you<00:04:47.340> make<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.760> loop<00:04:48.260> it<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.800> would<00:04:49.979> just

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
you make the loop it it would just

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.060 
you make the loop it it would just
depend<00:04:50.310> on<00:04:50.610> which<00:04:50.820> way<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.090> turn<00:04:51.449> it<00:04:51.919> so<00:04:52.919> when

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
depend on which way you turn it so when

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.560 
depend on which way you turn it so when
we<00:04:53.220> have<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.520> spiral<00:04:53.970> what<00:04:54.180> we're<00:04:54.300> going<00:04:54.479> to

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
we have the spiral what we're going to

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.520 
we have the spiral what we're going to
do<00:04:54.780> now<00:04:54.990> is<00:04:55.260> hammer<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:57.110> we'll<00:04:58.110> just<00:04:58.139> use<00:04:58.500> a

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
do now is hammer it we'll just use a

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.800 
do now is hammer it we'll just use a
bench<00:04:58.919> block<00:04:59.250> for<00:04:59.550> this<00:05:02.000> which<00:05:03.000> is<00:05:03.030> just<00:05:03.210> a

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
bench block for this which is just a

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.129 
bench block for this which is just a
nice<00:05:04.229> steel<00:05:04.620> block<00:05:05.210> we're<00:05:06.210> going<00:05:06.449> to<00:05:06.600> use<00:05:06.840> a

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
nice steel block we're going to use a

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.800 
nice steel block we're going to use a
plena<00:05:07.919> Shing<00:05:08.250> hammer<00:05:11.090> which<00:05:12.090> is<00:05:12.270> just<00:05:12.510> a<00:05:12.599> nice

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
plena Shing hammer which is just a nice

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.510 
plena Shing hammer which is just a nice
shiny<00:05:13.200> hammer<00:05:13.560> and<00:05:13.800> we're<00:05:13.950> just<00:05:14.099> going<00:05:14.400> to

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
shiny hammer and we're just going to

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.690 
shiny hammer and we're just going to
hammer<00:05:15.210> this<00:05:18.680> to<00:05:19.680> give<00:05:19.860> it<00:05:19.889> a<00:05:20.130> little<00:05:20.430> bit<00:05:20.550> of

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
hammer this to give it a little bit of

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:28.430 
hammer this to give it a little bit of
strength<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:23.300> a<00:05:24.300> little<00:05:24.539> decoration<00:05:27.440> now

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
strength and a little decoration now

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.400 
strength and a little decoration now
what<00:05:28.650> we<00:05:28.830> want<00:05:29.010> to<00:05:29.160> do<00:05:29.690> is<00:05:30.950> I<00:05:32.720> want<00:05:33.720> this<00:05:34.050> spiral

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
what we want to do is I want this spiral

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.129 
what we want to do is I want this spiral
to<00:05:35.310> spiral<00:05:35.760> right<00:05:36.030> so<00:05:36.360> I'll<00:05:36.479> put<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:36.960> loop

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
to spiral right so I'll put the loop

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.430 
to spiral right so I'll put the loop
over<00:05:37.440> towards<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:37.860> back<00:05:38.099> so<00:05:38.130> we're<00:05:38.490> going<00:05:38.639> to

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
over towards the back so we're going to

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.750 
over towards the back so we're going to
just<00:05:41.360> once<00:05:42.360> again<00:05:42.919> grab<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:44.099> end<00:05:44.250> of<00:05:44.370> this<00:05:44.460> and

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
just once again grab the end of this and

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.020 
just once again grab the end of this and
we<00:05:44.910> want<00:05:45.120> just<00:05:45.330> a<00:05:45.450> small<00:05:45.780> loop<00:05:49.729> so<00:05:50.729> turn<00:05:51.000> it

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
we want just a small loop so turn it

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.060 
we want just a small loop so turn it
until<00:05:51.750> it<00:05:51.900> touches<00:05:52.200> the<00:05:52.440> wire

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.150 

because<00:05:58.000> it<00:05:58.360> if<00:05:58.630> we<00:05:58.990> want<00:05:59.200> it<00:05:59.320> to<00:05:59.350> touch<00:05:59.680> so

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
because it if we want it to touch so

won't open up we do the same thing with

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.430 
won't open up we do the same thing with
the<00:07:08.920> planishing<00:07:09.280> hammer<00:07:09.900> we<00:07:10.900> just<00:07:11.110> put<00:07:11.320> the

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 
the planishing hammer we just put the

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:20.790 
the planishing hammer we just put the
curve<00:07:15.210> on<00:07:16.500> our<00:07:17.910> bench<00:07:18.910> block<00:07:19.330> and<00:07:19.690> just<00:07:20.500> hammer

curve on our bench block and just hammer
it<00:07:20.890> gently<00:07:21.340> on<00:07:21.520> this<00:07:21.760> curve<00:07:22.090> and<00:07:22.480> that<00:07:22.510> way

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.320 
it gently on this curve and that way

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.960 
it gently on this curve and that way
it'll<00:07:23.740> have<00:07:24.190> plenty<00:07:24.550> of<00:07:24.700> tension<00:07:26.730> so<00:07:27.730> there

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:27.970 
it'll have plenty of tension so there

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:32.310 
it'll have plenty of tension so there
you<00:07:28.120> go<00:07:28.590> five<00:07:29.590> minute<00:07:29.980> earrings
