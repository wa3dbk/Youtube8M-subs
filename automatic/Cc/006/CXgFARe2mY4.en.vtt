00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:04.210
 and a very good afternoon with a new episode of limburg today it is 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.000
 Wednesday, February 10, Limburg advised us of the carnival activities 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.960
 they can also enjoy it in italy and the one that is the most sporting in samsung 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.759
 masqat 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.939
 but of course I didn't stay behind a whole week 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.519
 Corrie Bushes to guest them that you make in one of the most insane 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.169
 masks that humanity are with 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.080
 there we had masks 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.100
 the campaign, therefore, varied some people and not just put others 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.650
 even a mask off and limburg 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.110
 via a parking space 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.629
 but if i have i have you 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.190
 do you stay nice all afternoon there can now if and make masks come 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.249
 I have you watch 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:42.639
 how it goes and maybe nice to see how you praise what 

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:45.150
 period their children will soon be so flashy 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.060
 to help them 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.440
 van t drumming points crazy 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.210
 prepare for this others topic creating the moskouse 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.800
 cooling 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.860
 jj you've all started already 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.860
 yes and you have already made a whole book here is everything 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.060
 I did indeed have to wait a while for them to be naked with them 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.060
 I also have a second master's study attainment level as a chemist 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.070
 and good stones in fashion colors from this year's other club 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.160
 traditional hall small 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.430
 he is not to other options are 9 that this is true his decoration mesh 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.210
 castricum naturally two types of masks make march and ter 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.220
 decoration and years to wait to use it yourself 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.770
 and yes that depends on these decorations masks on it are also excellent 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.130
 I can also use it that way but I also like to have them in front of the window 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.840
 to hang 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.000
 and if you see that masts, for example, the course owner has it 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.410
 The masquerade with the can make it a walk so people everyone who does it 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.250
 not to know later that would be better in my opinion 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.660
 rsca anne flies your veghel 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.260
 I'm kind of sick a bit 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.050
 that was also the intention yes then I would like things 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.620
 yes I dare to pull something like that organized from you 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.630
 I think I understand in Iica Meath that he did not sound very much indeed 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.810
 dressed for a long time requires an epidemic but I doubt closing it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.960
 he makes you the beginning he is incredibly creative 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.819
 and 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.359
 but of course how do you go with such a mask what is the basis 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:12.519
 well i have two still on the base this is the ecoshape the kind of paper 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:13.389
 maché 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.209
 after you have and plastic 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.819
 I have downstairs and some plastics are on it seems 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.700
 but this is that of the paper file with the polder job that is 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.010
 with a lot of verve set up you want to have put a fresh color the first white 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.989
 drape on now completely 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.810
 and agree that your other color than that much stress when you 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.230
 dark color that is a lot less important and yes you can tackle that 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.969
 decorated the way she wants 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:40.349
 and this I have a harlequin plan and then the kind of entertainment you would also 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.369
 Harlequin is the message will be 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:46.039
 and this is really a harlequin time I used for that 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:50.789
 so it is the cia i actually knew and i see where none 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:52.559
 where I come from 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.429
 I always have that very nice girl who has that to grow 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:59.589
 and Limburg traffic and you immediately get a camera 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.579
 but and the use of masks is not one 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.509
 so not very much in demand, for example if you compare it with 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:07.939
 would rather not see the carnival in italy 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.680
 that also depends on where you go i think in the pubs 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.829
 Masters are indeed used less often than in the occasions 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.489
 maybe older people come or debate 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.499
 what more chic occasions become mast there is of course to go further 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:24.480
 hence the mast is therefore very lucky to have a distinct appearance 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.059
 yes nice and easy to adjust 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:28.489
 but 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.549
 with each other it made each other yes those 8 years is certainly not always like 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.900
 it is not possible to cook on your own face 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.349
 so the rest of his work that is weird after that we'll see what you all 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.990
 what you all no longer the band 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.399
 as I have done at this time is not set up the line the wind is 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:48.799
 there was velzen that mention 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.049
 and then he does not want the second album so you have to be and of course 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.849
 just yes and have them swallow it because bit symmetrical 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.849
 so i think it is this way 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.059
 When making a mask, the rules are the first place 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:06.929
 no I think I think you were bast at all clubs, she suggested one 

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:09.269
 kind of painting from light to dark colored 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.510
 what is easiest that is first light color setup another dark one 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.289
 colors 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:17.079
 I think there are no real benefits to me 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.370
 and if you then mask 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.070
 want to make it for someone because and I want all this all different 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.490
 Faces how do you make sure you fit well and completely wrong 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.470
 but we are quite a models anyway the weather forecast quotes fit what 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.370
 what passion is yours and what is broad what is too narrow and even 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.370
 nor to make it angry at all with papier-mâché itself 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.169
 and how is that no longer possible 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.650
 she received a theme to do who make it there 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.449
 david the aa stories like is that he no no you do not directly 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.990
 the face in front of you can fall a mesh and that is almost dry for it 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.750
 company is over and then you can still shape that 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.450
 but I don't get wet on the face because it's an interesting idea 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.410
 The newspaper sold with Leon were scared of being used and yes that could be one 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.880
 folder blessing that the regional sometimes has to say he did not serve 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.499
 to win and I didn't notice 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:11.499
 that is the most a strong mask that you have and may make 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.240
 all i once made a mask it was 0 the scene on a whole 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.389
 landscape 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.349
 when i could get together i thought of you and you should like the nai and get visitors off 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.050
 of construction tactics 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.930
 japan is really a very nice idea that and from the details of it fixed either 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.350
 to the clouds then just above the survey yes that goes from them landscape 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:38.099
 and but it is sad that says that they themselves made up that did not necessarily mean 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.290
 I have to say years instead 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.610
 very special very beautiful Limburg landscape of the tactics mascagni young attacker 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.820
 JJ also indicates that they even want people to have more information they can 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.240
 at the competition in china 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.430
 creative www.twitter com onttroont reported with a series 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:57.180
 jakarta anp with the attempts that have been made 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.059
