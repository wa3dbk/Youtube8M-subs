structures<00:01:35.360> I<00:01:35.840> think<00:01:36.140> my<00:01:36.259> favorite<00:01:36.560> part<00:01:36.590> of

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
structures I think my favorite part of

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.650 
structures I think my favorite part of
the<00:01:36.920> moon<00:01:37.130> map<00:01:37.369> in<00:01:37.610> terms<00:01:37.790> of<00:01:37.940> sound<00:01:38.119> design<00:01:38.270> is

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
the moon map in terms of sound design is

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.870 
the moon map in terms of sound design is
the<00:01:38.960> airless<00:01:39.320> environment<00:01:39.890> it<00:01:40.040> significantly

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
the airless environment it significantly

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.460 
the airless environment it significantly
changes<00:01:41.330> how<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.509> game<00:01:41.720> sounds<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.289> that's

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
changes how the game sounds and that's

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.960 
changes how the game sounds and that's
gonna<00:01:42.680> force<00:01:42.979> people<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.340> play<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.550> different

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
gonna force people to play a different

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.520 
gonna force people to play a different
way<00:01:46.210> we<00:01:47.210> thought<00:01:47.479> originally<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:48.259> it<00:01:48.410> would

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
way we thought originally that it would

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.410 
way we thought originally that it would
make<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.890> easy<00:01:49.160> that<00:01:49.700> things<00:01:50.030> would<00:01:50.180> slow<00:01:50.390> down

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
make it easy that things would slow down

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.630 
make it easy that things would slow down
and<00:01:51.110> you'd<00:01:51.229> have<00:01:51.350> time<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.740> shoot<00:01:51.890> zombies<00:01:51.950> and

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
and you'd have time to shoot zombies and

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.889 
and you'd have time to shoot zombies and
actually<00:01:53.090> quite<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.360> opposite<00:01:53.660> Street

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
actually quite the opposite Street

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.540 
actually quite the opposite Street
because<00:01:54.229> everybody's<00:01:54.710> floating<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:55.340> have<00:01:55.430> no

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
because everybody's floating you have no

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.249 
because everybody's floating you have no
control<00:01:55.850> some<00:01:56.119> kind<00:01:56.300> of<00:01:56.330> sail<00:01:56.720> past<00:01:56.990> your
