piece and there's a finished eyelid with
little<00:01:32.759> effort<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.869> matter<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.229> seconds<00:01:34.829> as

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
little effort in a matter of seconds as

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.240 
little effort in a matter of seconds as
you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:36.000> see<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.560> vise<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:38.070> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you can see we now have the vise in a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.510 
you can see we now have the vise in a
horizontal<00:01:38.970> position<00:01:39.950> this<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.130> something

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
horizontal position this is something

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.940 
horizontal position this is something
you<00:01:41.640> can't<00:01:41.909> do<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> conventional<00:01:42.750> vise<00:01:43.259> so

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
you can't do with a conventional vise so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.980 
you can't do with a conventional vise so
we're<00:01:44.100> doing<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.549> same<00:01:44.820> piercing<00:01:45.420> operation

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
we're doing the same piercing operation

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.249 
we're doing the same piercing operation
as<00:01:46.110> before<00:01:46.640> but<00:01:47.640> now<00:01:47.700> you're<00:01:48.479> able<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.930> see<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
as before but now you're able to see the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.069 
as before but now you're able to see the
work<00:01:49.439> from<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.860> different<00:01:50.100> perspective<00:01:51.079> it's

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
work from a different perspective it's

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.170 
work from a different perspective it's
suddenly<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.680> lot<00:01:52.979> easier<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:53.820> what<00:01:54.000> you're

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
suddenly a lot easier to see what you're

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.870 
suddenly a lot easier to see what you're
working<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.040> that's<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.490> improve

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
working on and that's going to improve

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.569 
working on and that's going to improve
your<00:01:56.939> accuracy<00:01:57.799> now<00:01:58.799> I'll<00:01:59.009> show<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.310> where

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
your accuracy now I'll show you where

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.090 
your accuracy now I'll show you where
this<00:01:59.790> vise<00:02:00.060> really<00:02:00.689> shines<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
this vise really shines in the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.609 
this vise really shines in the
horizontal<00:02:02.700> orientation<00:02:03.079> you're<00:02:04.079> no<00:02:04.320> longer

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
horizontal orientation you're no longer

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.310 
horizontal orientation you're no longer
fighting<00:02:05.040> gravity<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:06.540> don't<00:02:06.719> need<00:02:06.960> anything
