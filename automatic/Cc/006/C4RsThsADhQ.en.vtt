00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
some of the information we found both

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.200 
some of the information we found both
over<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.349> DCI<00:00:10.710> season<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.519> here<00:00:11.940> with<00:00:12.090> the

east ascension high school band the main

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.550 
east ascension high school band the main
thing<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.299> correct<00:00:15.630> microphone<00:00:16.320> in

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
thing is that the correct microphone in

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.310 
thing is that the correct microphone in
the<00:00:16.680> correct<00:00:16.980> placement<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.779> very<00:00:18.779> important

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
the correct placement is very important

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.590 
the correct placement is very important
don't<00:00:20.070> mess<00:00:20.310> with<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.640> board<00:00:20.910> don't<00:00:21.449> mess

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
don't mess with the board don't mess

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.269 
don't mess with the board don't mess
with<00:00:21.630> speakers<00:00:22.230> don't<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:22.590> anything<00:00:22.920> else

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
with speakers don't do anything else

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.980 
with speakers don't do anything else
unless<00:00:23.609> you're<00:00:23.939> sure<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.660> correct

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
unless you're sure that the correct

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.689 
unless you're sure that the correct
microphone<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.680> picking<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.160> instrument

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
microphone is picking up the instrument

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.189 
microphone is picking up the instrument
because<00:00:27.210> that's<00:00:27.420> where<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> lot<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
because that's where a lot of the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.900 
because that's where a lot of the
problems<00:00:28.619> start<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.490> we're<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.789> talk

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
problems start so we're going to talk

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.370 
problems start so we're going to talk
about<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.269> difference<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.720> two<00:00:30.960> types<00:00:31.199> of

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
about the difference in two types of

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.979 
about the difference in two types of
microphones<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.340> first<00:00:32.640> will<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:32.989> dynamic

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
microphones the first will be dynamic

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.080 
microphones the first will be dynamic
microphones<00:00:34.559> now<00:00:35.100> these<00:00:35.309> microphones<00:00:35.850> are

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
microphones now these microphones are

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.270 
microphones now these microphones are
designed<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.350> sound<00:00:37.680> pickup<00:00:38.129> from

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
designed to be have sound pickup from

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.549 
designed to be have sound pickup from
very<00:00:38.550> close<00:00:38.879> very<00:00:39.420> six<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.989> eight<00:00:40.140> inches<00:00:40.410> away

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
very close very six to eight inches away

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.139 
very close very six to eight inches away
from<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.890> sound<00:00:41.160> source<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.730> they're

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
from the sound source and they're

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.119 
from the sound source and they're
specifically<00:00:42.629> designed<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.469> they<00:00:43.590> don't<00:00:43.950> pick

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
specifically designed so they don't pick

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.979 
specifically designed so they don't pick
up<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.399> lot<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.700> sounds<00:00:45.030> from<00:00:45.090> around<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.600> so

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
up a lot of sounds from around it so

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.560 
up a lot of sounds from around it so
these<00:00:46.140> applications<00:00:46.800> are<00:00:46.980> great<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.570> places

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
these applications are great for places

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360 
these applications are great for places
where<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.840> want<00:00:48.989> drums<00:00:49.350> or<00:00:49.649> soloists<00:00:50.280> where

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
where you want drums or soloists where

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.799 
where you want drums or soloists where
you<00:00:50.460> don't<00:00:50.700> want<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> pick<00:00:51.030> up<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.329> lot<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
you don't want to pick up a lot in the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.840 
you don't want to pick up a lot in the
background<00:00:52.289> now<00:00:52.890> you've<00:00:53.100> seen<00:00:53.340> these<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.550> lot

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
background now you've seen these a lot

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.299 
background now you've seen these a lot
the<00:00:54.210> first<00:00:54.449> type<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:55.079> call<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> vocal<00:00:55.890> dynamic

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the first type we call a vocal dynamic

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.069 
the first type we call a vocal dynamic
microphone<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.090> has<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> little<00:00:57.510> bit<00:00:57.690> bigger<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
microphone it has a little bit bigger of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.410 
microphone it has a little bit bigger of
a<00:00:58.230> pattern<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.129> has<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> ability<00:00:59.460> to<00:01:00.030> pick

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
a pattern and it has the ability to pick

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.020 
a pattern and it has the ability to pick
up<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.840> wide<00:01:01.260> range<00:01:01.590> around<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.760> great

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
up a wide range around it this is great

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.119 
up a wide range around it this is great
for<00:01:03.300> sounds<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.780> are<00:01:03.870> gonna<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.229> both<00:01:04.769> what

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
for sounds that are gonna be both what

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.429 
for sounds that are gonna be both what
we<00:01:05.159> call<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.670> access<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.479> maybe<00:01:06.869> sounds<00:01:07.320> that

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
we call on access and maybe sounds that

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.929 
we call on access and maybe sounds that
come<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.770> from<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.070> side<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.610> don't<00:01:08.820> have

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
come in from the side so you don't have

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.910 
come in from the side so you don't have
to<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.180> everyone<00:01:09.450> write<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.049> front<00:01:10.320> where

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
to have everyone write up on front where

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.520 
to have everyone write up on front where
as<00:01:11.070> an<00:01:11.189> instrument<00:01:11.790> microphone<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.540> much<00:01:13.260> more

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
as an instrument microphone is much more

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.530 
as an instrument microphone is much more
directional<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.369> picks<00:01:14.610> up<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.970> lot<00:01:15.210> more<00:01:15.420> of

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
directional it picks up a lot more of

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.990 
directional it picks up a lot more of
what's<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.930> front<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.189> great<00:01:17.520> when

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
what's in front of it this is great when

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.539 
what's in front of it this is great when
I<00:01:18.030> want<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.390> isolate<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:19.170> sound<00:01:19.530> such<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> drum

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
I want to isolate a sound such as a drum

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.999 
I want to isolate a sound such as a drum
or<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.030> horn<00:01:21.360> soloist<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.080> not<00:01:22.259> get<00:01:22.439> anything

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
or a horn soloist and not get anything

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.070 
or a horn soloist and not get anything
else<00:01:23.189> around<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.509> other<00:01:24.750> type<00:01:25.049> of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
else around it the other type of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.300 
else around it the other type of
microphone<00:01:25.560> we're<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> look<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.189> in

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
microphone we're going to look at in

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.830 
microphone we're going to look at in
this<00:01:26.400> series<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.030> condenser<00:01:27.630> microphone

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
this series is a condenser microphone

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.380 
this series is a condenser microphone
now<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.520> small<00:01:29.909> diaphragm

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
now this one is a small diaphragm

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.450 
now this one is a small diaphragm
condenser<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:31.110> much<00:01:31.500> more<00:01:31.770> sensitive<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
condenser it's much more sensitive and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.010

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.440 
soloists so let's go ahead and take a
look<00:01:51.299> at<00:01:51.570> how<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.930> microphone<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.799> placed

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
look at how this microphone is placed

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.090 
look at how this microphone is placed
underneath<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.689> marimba<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.770> two

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
underneath this marimba so we have two

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.100 
underneath this marimba so we have two
of<00:01:56.399> these<00:01:56.490> pro<00:01:56.790> 37<00:01:57.479> small<00:01:57.780> diaphragm

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110

condenser microphones underneath our

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.450 
condenser microphones underneath our
marimba<00:02:00.299> now<00:02:00.990> notice<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> mounted

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
marimba now notice we have a mounted

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.280 
marimba now notice we have a mounted
down<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.360> good<00:02:03.600> amount<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.930> distance

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
down with a good amount of distance

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.200 
down with a good amount of distance
between<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.950> microphone<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> bars<00:02:05.939> I

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
between the microphone and the bars I

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.240 
between the microphone and the bars I
see<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> common<00:02:07.170> mistake<00:02:07.350> with<00:02:07.680> marching<00:02:08.069> bands

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
see a common mistake with marching bands

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.609 
see a common mistake with marching bands
is<00:02:08.429> people<00:02:08.700> try<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.879> put<00:02:09.119> their<00:02:09.270> mics<00:02:09.539> much<00:02:10.319> too

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
is people try to put their mics much too

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.589 
is people try to put their mics much too
high<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.310> problem<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.239> pickup

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
high the problem is is that the pickup

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.260 
high the problem is is that the pickup
pattern<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.050> my

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
pattern of the my

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.790 
pattern of the my
grifone<00:02:13.570> doesn't<00:02:14.050> have<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.230> light<00:02:14.560> enough

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
grifone doesn't have a light enough

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.070 
grifone doesn't have a light enough
spread<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.670> pick<00:02:15.880> up<00:02:16.030> all<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.360> bars<00:02:16.570> equally

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
spread to pick up all the bars equally

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.380 
spread to pick up all the bars equally
so<00:02:17.530> what<00:02:17.710> happens<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.490> only<00:02:18.640> get<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.910> couple

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
so what happens is you only get a couple

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.420 
so what happens is you only get a couple
of<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.570> bars<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.320> when<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.560> listen<00:02:20.800> back<00:02:21.160> or

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
of the bars so when you listen back or

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.380 
of the bars so when you listen back or
you're<00:02:21.550> playing<00:02:21.760> audio<00:02:22.150> through<00:02:22.360> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
you're playing audio through the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.870 
you're playing audio through the
speakers<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.350> get<00:02:23.590> very<00:02:24.070> low<00:02:24.250> signal<00:02:24.490> and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
speakers you get very low signal and

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.610 
speakers you get very low signal and
then<00:02:25.000> three<00:02:25.270> or<00:02:25.330> four<00:02:25.480> bars<00:02:25.720> just<00:02:25.870> jump<00:02:26.380> out<00:02:26.470> of

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
then three or four bars just jump out of

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
then three or four bars just jump out of
the<00:02:26.680> mix<00:02:26.890> really<00:02:27.190> loud

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
the mix really loud

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.640 
the mix really loud
so<00:02:27.970> we're<00:02:28.120> using<00:02:28.240> two<00:02:28.540> microphones<00:02:28.690> spread

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
so we're using two microphones spread

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.710 
so we're using two microphones spread
out<00:02:29.800> on<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.070> low<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.310> high<00:02:30.610> end<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.480> we've

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
out on the low and high end and we've

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.270 
out on the low and high end and we've
already<00:02:31.870> talked<00:02:32.200> about<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.680> last<00:02:32.830> series

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
already talked about in the last series

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.040 
already talked about in the last series
about<00:02:33.430> how<00:02:33.580> we<00:02:33.640> can<00:02:33.880> EQ<00:02:34.330> these<00:02:34.510> differently

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
about how we can EQ these differently

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.100 
about how we can EQ these differently
from<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.980> board<00:02:36.250> now<00:02:36.820> as<00:02:37.180> far<00:02:37.510> as<00:02:37.570> mounting

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
from the board now as far as mounting

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.920 
from the board now as far as mounting
goes<00:02:38.350> we<00:02:38.830> found<00:02:39.160> these<00:02:39.340> on<00:02:39.550> stage<00:02:40.090> boom<00:02:40.480> arms

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
goes we found these on stage boom arms

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.990 
goes we found these on stage boom arms
they're<00:02:41.350> like<00:02:41.590> ten<00:02:42.040> dollars<00:02:42.220> each<00:02:42.730> and

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
they're like ten dollars each and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.930 
they're like ten dollars each and
they're<00:02:43.390> designed<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:44.050> mount<00:02:44.620> microphones<00:02:45.400> on

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
they're designed to mount microphones on

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.960 
they're designed to mount microphones on
either<00:02:46.300> microphone<00:02:46.900> stands<00:02:47.260> or<00:02:47.650> music<00:02:48.460> stands

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
either microphone stands or music stands

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.390 
either microphone stands or music stands
or<00:02:49.120> on<00:02:49.570> drum<00:02:49.930> hardware<00:02:50.380> for<00:02:50.650> drummers<00:02:50.890> but

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
or on drum hardware for drummers but

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.070 
or on drum hardware for drummers but
this<00:02:51.610> works<00:02:51.820> really<00:02:52.120> well<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.780> this

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
this works really well in this

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.840 
this works really well in this
application<00:02:53.740> because<00:02:54.070> they<00:02:54.250> mount<00:02:54.550> on<00:02:54.730> the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
application because they mount on the

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.820 
application because they mount on the
frame<00:02:55.090> right<00:02:55.360> here<00:02:55.630> I'm<00:02:56.020> running<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.650> bar

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
frame right here I'm running the bar

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.760 
frame right here I'm running the bar
straight<00:02:57.130> down<00:02:57.460> and<00:02:57.760> then<00:02:58.150> I'm<00:02:58.270> using<00:02:58.300> these

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
straight down and then I'm using these

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.800 
straight down and then I'm using these
additional<00:02:59.770> flexible<00:03:00.400> ends<00:03:01.270> to<00:03:01.570> be<00:03:01.660> able<00:03:01.720> to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
additional flexible ends to be able to

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.660 
additional flexible ends to be able to
position<00:03:02.260> my<00:03:02.410> mic<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.010> gives<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.490> little

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
position my mic and it gives it a little

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.300 
position my mic and it gives it a little
bit<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:03.970> shock<00:03:04.840> mount<00:03:05.140> as<00:03:05.260> well<00:03:05.290> so<00:03:06.160> this

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
bit of shock mount as well so this

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.220 
bit of shock mount as well so this
allows<00:03:06.610> me<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.820> have<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.030> nice<00:03:07.330> clean<00:03:07.660> mounting

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
allows me to have a nice clean mounting

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.110 
allows me to have a nice clean mounting
right<00:03:08.410> in<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.560> middle<00:03:08.770> and<00:03:09.070> then<00:03:09.490> run<00:03:09.700> my<00:03:09.850> mics

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
right in the middle and then run my mics

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.870 
right in the middle and then run my mics
out<00:03:10.330> with<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.320> very<00:03:11.620> low<00:03:11.860> profile<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.640> at<00:03:12.790> the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
out with a very low profile and at the

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.640 
out with a very low profile and at the
end<00:03:13.030> of<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.240> season<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:13.810> just<00:03:14.050> have<00:03:14.380> to<00:03:14.500> unscrew

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
end of the season I just have to unscrew

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.670 
end of the season I just have to unscrew
one<00:03:15.250> screw<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.150> can<00:03:16.330> take<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.660> off<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.110> it's

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
one screw and I can take it off and it's

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.440 
one screw and I can take it off and it's
all<00:03:17.950> stored<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.670> ready<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.000> go

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
all stored and ready to go

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.360 
all stored and ready to go
so<00:03:20.050> that's<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.500> way<00:03:20.650> we'll<00:03:21.040> do<00:03:21.190> all<00:03:21.310> the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
so that's the way we'll do all the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.490 
so that's the way we'll do all the
microphones<00:03:22.180> for<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.570> marimbas<00:03:22.959> we'll<00:03:23.320> talk

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
microphones for the marimbas we'll talk

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.530 
microphones for the marimbas we'll talk
about<00:03:23.740> the<00:03:23.890> cabling<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.550> next<00:03:24.820> series<00:03:25.000> but

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
about the cabling in the next series but

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.880 
about the cabling in the next series but
before<00:03:25.810> we<00:03:25.900> do<00:03:26.020> that<00:03:26.050> I<00:03:26.230> want<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.590> go<00:03:26.680> talk

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
before we do that I want to go talk

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.949 
before we do that I want to go talk
about<00:03:27.130> soloist<00:03:27.670> mics<00:03:27.910> for<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.180> field<00:03:28.390> through

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
about soloist mics for the field through

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.050 
about soloist mics for the field through
all<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.290> season<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.800> DCI<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.310> do<00:03:30.700> all<00:03:30.880> the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
all the season a DCI and do all the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.030 
all the season a DCI and do all the
marching<00:03:31.390> competitions<00:03:31.990> I<00:03:32.140> saw<00:03:32.350> this<00:03:32.560> year<00:03:32.890> I

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
marching competitions I saw this year I

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.699 
marching competitions I saw this year I
saw<00:03:33.520> lots<00:03:33.940> of<00:03:34.150> errors<00:03:34.510> made<00:03:34.990> in<00:03:35.020> miking

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
saw lots of errors made in miking

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.199 
saw lots of errors made in miking
instrumental<00:03:36.220> soloist<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:37.060> most

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
instrumental soloist and the most

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.910 
instrumental soloist and the most
important<00:03:37.690> thing<00:03:37.870> is<00:03:38.050> when<00:03:38.200> that<00:03:38.320> child<00:03:38.650> comes

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
important thing is when that child comes

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.740 
important thing is when that child comes
up<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.310> play<00:03:39.490> their<00:03:39.700> big<00:03:39.880> solo<00:03:40.180> on<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.480> field

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
up to play their big solo on the field

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.560 
up to play their big solo on the field
that<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:41.470> sounds<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.310> just<00:03:43.000> as<00:03:43.150> good<00:03:43.300> through

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
that it sounds is just as good through

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.120 
that it sounds is just as good through
the<00:03:43.660> speakers<00:03:44.080> as<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:44.440> does<00:03:44.620> coming<00:03:44.950> out<00:03:45.040> of

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
the speakers as it does coming out of

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.680 
the speakers as it does coming out of
their<00:03:45.250> horn<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:45.700> I<00:03:46.030> know<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.270> probably<00:03:46.360> know

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
their horn and I know you probably know

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.910 
their horn and I know you probably know
what<00:03:46.810> I'm<00:03:46.870> talking<00:03:46.930> about<00:03:47.440> where<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:47.620> hear

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
things that just don't sound like that

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.660 
things that just don't sound like that
characteristic<00:03:50.200> instrument<00:03:50.830> a<00:03:50.980> lot<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.520> thats

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
characteristic instrument a lot of thats

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.300 
characteristic instrument a lot of thats
the<00:03:51.820> speakers<00:03:52.180> you're<00:03:52.360> using<00:03:52.570> but<00:03:53.080> also<00:03:53.310> it

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
the speakers you're using but also it

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.460 
the speakers you're using but also it
comes<00:03:54.760> down<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.209> microphone<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:56.170> again

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
comes down to the microphone so again

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.530 
comes down to the microphone so again
back<00:03:56.740> to<00:03:56.770> our<00:03:56.920> three<00:03:57.190> types<00:03:57.520> if<00:03:57.790> I'm<00:03:58.209> a<00:03:58.240> trumpet

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
back to our three types if I'm a trumpet

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.510 
back to our three types if I'm a trumpet
soloist<00:03:58.990> and<00:03:59.350> I<00:03:59.680> know<00:03:59.740> that<00:04:00.040> I<00:04:00.130> just<00:04:00.340> want<00:04:00.459> to

soloist and I know that I just want to
play<00:04:00.610> that<00:04:00.910> trumpet<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.570> there's<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:01.959> lot<00:04:02.170> of

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
play that trumpet and there's a lot of

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.840 
play that trumpet and there's a lot of
movement<00:04:02.560> behind<00:04:03.070> me<00:04:03.160> on<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.400> field<00:04:03.580> and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
movement behind me on the field and

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.610 
movement behind me on the field and
other<00:04:03.940> sounds<00:04:04.450> I'm<00:04:04.750> going<00:04:05.050> to<00:04:05.110> use<00:04:05.380> this

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
other sounds I'm going to use this

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.190 
other sounds I'm going to use this
dynamic<00:04:06.250> microphone<00:04:07.120> this<00:04:07.570> instrument

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
dynamic microphone this instrument

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.600 
dynamic microphone this instrument
microphone<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.770> has<00:04:08.860> a<00:04:08.890> very<00:04:09.190> narrow

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
microphone that has a very narrow

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.150 
microphone that has a very narrow
pattern<00:04:10.090> so<00:04:10.570> that<00:04:10.690> allows<00:04:10.930> me<00:04:10.959> to<00:04:11.140> get<00:04:11.380> up<00:04:11.560> play

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
pattern so that allows me to get up play

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.520 
pattern so that allows me to get up play
my<00:04:12.340> trumpet<00:04:12.700> solo<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:13.270> now<00:04:13.630> pick<00:04:13.870> up<00:04:13.989> anything

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
my trumpet solo and now pick up anything

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.289 
my trumpet solo and now pick up anything
else<00:04:14.709> around<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.160> if<00:04:15.400> that's<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.790> only<00:04:16.120> thing

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
else around it if that's the only thing

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.150 
else around it if that's the only thing
you're<00:04:16.419> using<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:16.810> microphone<00:04:16.989> for<00:04:17.590> this

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
you're using this microphone for this

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.949 
you're using this microphone for this
one's<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.520> way<00:04:18.669> if<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.570> have<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:19.750> situation

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
one's the way if I have a situation

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.539 
one's the way if I have a situation
where<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.470> want<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.680> little<00:04:20.859> bit<00:04:20.980> of<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.130> warmer

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
where I want a little bit of a warmer

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.570 
where I want a little bit of a warmer
sound<00:04:21.990> maybe<00:04:22.990> it's<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.229> trombone<00:04:23.710> maybe<00:04:24.370> it's<00:04:24.520> a

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
sound maybe it's a trombone maybe it's a

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.700 
sound maybe it's a trombone maybe it's a
baritone<00:04:25.060> maybe<00:04:25.750> it's<00:04:26.020> a

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
baritone maybe it's a

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.860 
baritone maybe it's a
either<00:04:27.160> a<00:04:27.280> saxophone<00:04:27.940> or<00:04:28.090> another<00:04:28.300> instrument

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
either a saxophone or another instrument

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.890 
either a saxophone or another instrument
I<00:04:28.960> may<00:04:29.199> use<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:30.400> dynamic<00:04:30.850> microphone<00:04:31.419> but

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
I may use the dynamic microphone but

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.420 
I may use the dynamic microphone but
more<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.259> vocal<00:04:32.620> style<00:04:32.889> it's<00:04:33.100> a<00:04:33.190> little

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
more the vocal style it's a little

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.010 
more the vocal style it's a little
warmer<00:04:33.819> it's<00:04:34.180> got<00:04:34.360> a<00:04:34.389> little<00:04:34.509> bit<00:04:34.660> of<00:04:34.720> a<00:04:34.780> wider

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
warmer it's got a little bit of a wider

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.200 
warmer it's got a little bit of a wider
pickup<00:04:35.530> pattern<00:04:35.919> so<00:04:36.310> it's<00:04:36.490> great<00:04:36.699> to<00:04:36.880> get<00:04:37.000> like

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
pickup pattern so it's great to get like

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.689 
pickup pattern so it's great to get like
down<00:04:37.479> in<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.690> saxophone<00:04:38.289> bill<00:04:38.530> it's<00:04:39.160> great<00:04:39.490> to

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
down in a saxophone bill it's great to

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.249 
down in a saxophone bill it's great to
get<00:04:39.880> you<00:04:40.120> know<00:04:40.240> if<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.479> trumpet<00:04:40.840> player<00:04:41.050> or

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
get you know if the trumpet player or

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:42.540 
get you know if the trumpet player or
the<00:04:41.349> trombone<00:04:41.830> player<00:04:42.039> is<00:04:42.160> at<00:04:42.280> a<00:04:42.340> different

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
the trombone player is at a different

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.460 
the trombone player is at a different
angle<00:04:42.849> and<00:04:43.660> they<00:04:43.780> want<00:04:43.930> to<00:04:43.990> come<00:04:44.169> in<00:04:44.319> a<00:04:44.349> little

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
angle and they want to come in a little

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.080 
angle and they want to come in a little
sideways<00:04:44.800> you<00:04:45.190> have<00:04:45.310> a<00:04:45.340> little<00:04:45.580> more<00:04:45.789> room<00:04:46.030> to

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
sideways you have a little more room to

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.629 
sideways you have a little more room to
wiggle<00:04:46.449> which<00:04:47.289> is<00:04:47.470> great<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:48.009> might<00:04:48.460> want<00:04:48.610> to

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
wiggle which is great you might want to

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.670 
wiggle which is great you might want to
try<00:04:48.849> both<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.300> see<00:04:49.419> what<00:04:49.599> sounds<00:04:49.930> better<00:04:50.110> just

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
try both and see what sounds better just

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.020 
try both and see what sounds better just
know<00:04:50.830> that<00:04:51.039> this<00:04:51.190> is<00:04:51.370> going<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.550> pick<00:04:51.789> up<00:04:51.940> a

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
know that this is going to pick up a

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.760 
know that this is going to pick up a
little<00:04:52.210> wider<00:04:52.509> so<00:04:52.990> you<00:04:53.020> have<00:04:53.259> to<00:04:53.380> be<00:04:53.470> careful

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
little wider so you have to be careful

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.100 
little wider so you have to be careful
about<00:04:53.860> different<00:04:54.280> sounds<00:04:54.639> now<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.509> most

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
about different sounds now the most

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.450 
about different sounds now the most
important<00:04:56.650> thing<00:04:56.800> is<00:04:56.889> these<00:04:57.039> are<00:04:57.099> dynamic

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
important thing is these are dynamic

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.879 
important thing is these are dynamic
microphones<00:04:58.270> these<00:04:58.840> are<00:04:58.960> for<00:04:59.110> one<00:04:59.320> soloist

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
microphones these are for one soloist

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.920 
microphones these are for one soloist
only<00:05:00.190> if<00:05:00.400> you<00:05:00.789> have<00:05:00.940> more<00:05:01.210> than<00:05:01.330> one<00:05:01.509> person

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
only if you have more than one person

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.990 
only if you have more than one person
playing<00:05:02.199> maybe<00:05:02.740> it's<00:05:02.919> a<00:05:02.949> woodwind<00:05:03.370> group<00:05:03.639> or

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
playing maybe it's a woodwind group or

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.360 
playing maybe it's a woodwind group or
it's<00:05:04.240> a<00:05:04.300> trio<00:05:04.570> or<00:05:04.690> quartet<00:05:05.410> or<00:05:05.590> something<00:05:05.979> in<00:05:06.130> I

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
it's a trio or quartet or something in I

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.279 
it's a trio or quartet or something in I
would<00:05:06.789> strongly<00:05:07.060> suggest<00:05:07.389> going<00:05:07.870> back<00:05:08.139> to

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
would strongly suggest going back to

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.710 
would strongly suggest going back to
your<00:05:08.380> pro<00:05:08.620> 37<00:05:09.340> small<00:05:09.970> diaphragm<00:05:10.449> condenser

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
your pro 37 small diaphragm condenser

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.020 
your pro 37 small diaphragm condenser
microphone<00:05:11.530> because<00:05:11.979> this<00:05:12.310> is<00:05:12.490> sense<00:05:12.729> enough

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
microphone because this is sense enough

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.689 
microphone because this is sense enough
to<00:05:13.060> pick<00:05:13.389> up<00:05:13.539> a<00:05:13.690> wide<00:05:14.020> area<00:05:14.349> so<00:05:15.099> see<00:05:15.340> a<00:05:15.370> lot<00:05:15.550> of

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
to pick up a wide area so see a lot of

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.700 
to pick up a wide area so see a lot of
times<00:05:15.910> we<00:05:16.180> have<00:05:16.300> one<00:05:16.479> microphone<00:05:16.960> up<00:05:17.169> that<00:05:17.590> it

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
times we have one microphone up that it

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.830 
times we have one microphone up that it
may<00:05:17.889> work<00:05:18.070> great<00:05:18.340> for<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.610> trumpet<00:05:19.030> soloist<00:05:19.330> but

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
may work great for a trumpet soloist but

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.050 
may work great for a trumpet soloist but
it<00:05:19.930> does<00:05:20.259> not<00:05:20.470> work<00:05:20.770> for<00:05:21.039> your<00:05:21.400> woodwind<00:05:21.789> choir

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
it does not work for your woodwind choir

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.149 
it does not work for your woodwind choir
so<00:05:22.570> if<00:05:22.720> you<00:05:22.810> have<00:05:22.990> a<00:05:23.020> situation<00:05:23.289> in<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:23.949> show

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
so if you have a situation in the show

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:25.680 
so if you have a situation in the show
we're<00:05:24.370> using<00:05:24.669> one<00:05:24.880> mic<00:05:25.090> stand<00:05:25.120> in<00:05:25.509> one

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
we're using one mic stand in one

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.689 
we're using one mic stand in one
microphone<00:05:26.319> and<00:05:26.560> you<00:05:26.620> have<00:05:26.740> multiple<00:05:27.280> solos

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
microphone and you have multiple solos

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.570 
microphone and you have multiple solos
going<00:05:27.909> on<00:05:28.150> I<00:05:28.419> would<00:05:29.020> strongly<00:05:29.319> suggest<00:05:29.590> using

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
going on I would strongly suggest using

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.969 
going on I would strongly suggest using
this<00:05:30.699> Pro<00:05:30.909> 37<00:05:31.509> condenser<00:05:31.990> mic<00:05:32.169> you<00:05:32.590> can<00:05:32.710> always

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
this Pro 37 condenser mic you can always

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.379 
this Pro 37 condenser mic you can always
turn<00:05:33.130> it<00:05:33.280> down<00:05:33.490> a<00:05:33.550> little<00:05:33.820> bit<00:05:34.030> for<00:05:34.300> the

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
turn it down a little bit for the

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.870 
turn it down a little bit for the
soloist<00:05:34.900> and<00:05:35.050> turn<00:05:35.500> it<00:05:35.620> up<00:05:35.800> a<00:05:35.949> little<00:05:36.039> bit<00:05:36.340> for

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
soloist and turn it up a little bit for

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.909 
soloist and turn it up a little bit for
your<00:05:36.970> players<00:05:37.270> now<00:05:37.870> remember<00:05:38.380> there<00:05:38.740> is<00:05:38.889> a

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
your players now remember there is a

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.310 
your players now remember there is a
pattern<00:05:39.610> coming<00:05:40.060> out<00:05:40.210> of<00:05:40.360> here<00:05:40.539> so<00:05:40.900> if<00:05:41.050> I<00:05:41.139> have

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
pattern coming out of here so if I have

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.570 
pattern coming out of here so if I have
a<00:05:41.349> quartet<00:05:41.889> I'm<00:05:42.070> going<00:05:42.190> to<00:05:42.250> ask<00:05:42.370> those

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
a quartet I'm going to ask those

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.279 
a quartet I'm going to ask those
students<00:05:42.909> to<00:05:43.000> step<00:05:43.389> back<00:05:43.630> a<00:05:43.659> little<00:05:43.930> bit<00:05:44.139> and

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
students to step back a little bit and

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.020 
students to step back a little bit and
get<00:05:44.409> some<00:05:44.590> distance<00:05:44.860> between<00:05:45.219> the<00:05:45.490> mic<00:05:45.699> so<00:05:45.909> it

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
get some distance between the mic so it

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.670 
get some distance between the mic so it
picks<00:05:46.210> up<00:05:46.360> all<00:05:46.630> those<00:05:46.840> instruments<00:05:47.139> equally

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
picks up all those instruments equally

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.070 
picks up all those instruments equally
but<00:05:48.430> just<00:05:48.639> know<00:05:48.849> that<00:05:48.880> when<00:05:49.270> that's<00:05:49.570> happening

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
but just know that when that's happening

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.719 
but just know that when that's happening
this<00:05:50.229> microphone<00:05:50.710> is<00:05:50.770> more<00:05:51.070> sensitive<00:05:51.610> and

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
this microphone is more sensitive and

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:53.670 
this microphone is more sensitive and
it's<00:05:51.880> going<00:05:52.090> to<00:05:52.180> pick<00:05:52.360> up<00:05:52.539> other<00:05:52.930> things<00:05:53.500> in

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
it's going to pick up other things in

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.439 
it's going to pick up other things in
the<00:05:53.770> field<00:05:53.949> so<00:05:54.490> work<00:05:54.699> with<00:05:54.849> your<00:05:55.000> jewel<00:05:55.210> Rider

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
the field so work with your jewel Rider

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.959 
the field so work with your jewel Rider
and<00:05:55.690> your<00:05:55.810> music<00:05:56.139> arranger<00:05:56.560> and<00:05:56.710> think<00:05:57.669> about

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969 
and your music arranger and think about

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:00.330 
and your music arranger and think about
where<00:05:58.539> the<00:05:58.690> placement<00:05:58.960> of<00:05:59.169> the<00:05:59.259> solo<00:05:59.500> is<00:05:59.740> from

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
where the placement of the solo is from

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.520 
where the placement of the solo is from
an<00:06:00.460> audio<00:06:00.789> standpoint<00:06:01.389> as<00:06:01.509> well<00:06:01.690> you<00:06:02.259> want<00:06:02.380> to

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
an audio standpoint as well you want to

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.379 
an audio standpoint as well you want to
get<00:06:02.680> the<00:06:03.009> rest<00:06:03.219> of<00:06:03.370> the<00:06:03.430> band<00:06:03.639> as<00:06:03.759> far<00:06:03.789> away<00:06:04.240> as

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
get the rest of the band as far away as

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.360 
get the rest of the band as far away as
possible<00:06:04.449> so<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.229> souls<00:06:05.469> can<00:06:05.740> be<00:06:05.830> isolated

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
possible so the souls can be isolated

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.560 
possible so the souls can be isolated
that<00:06:06.460> way<00:06:06.610> we<00:06:06.729> can<00:06:06.880> really<00:06:07.210> use<00:06:07.360> that

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
that way we can really use that

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.930 
that way we can really use that
microphone<00:06:08.259> and<00:06:08.560> we<00:06:08.919> can<00:06:09.070> amplify<00:06:09.219> it<00:06:09.639> really

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
microphone and we can amplify it really

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.089 
microphone and we can amplify it really
well<00:06:10.120> from<00:06:10.270> our<00:06:10.419> StudioLive<00:06:10.930> mixer<00:06:11.099> without

background<00:06:19.060> noise<00:06:19.620> condenser<00:06:20.620> mic<00:06:20.860> is<00:06:21.070> going

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
background noise condenser mic is going

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.029 
background noise condenser mic is going
to<00:06:21.460> be<00:06:21.550> great<00:06:21.759> for<00:06:21.969> a<00:06:22.030> small<00:06:22.300> ensemble<00:06:23.039> quartet

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039

to be great for a small ensemble quartet
trio<00:06:24.490> even<00:06:25.330> Quinn<00:06:25.570> set<00:06:25.780> up<00:06:25.900> on<00:06:26.050> the<00:06:26.139> field<00:06:26.380> but

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
trio even Quinn set up on the field but

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.930 
trio even Quinn set up on the field but
you're<00:06:26.770> going<00:06:26.860> to<00:06:26.919> need<00:06:27.039> more<00:06:27.219> distance<00:06:27.759> away

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
you're going to need more distance away

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.399 
you're going to need more distance away
from<00:06:28.090> the<00:06:28.419> mic<00:06:28.599> and<00:06:28.930> you<00:06:29.080> need<00:06:29.169> to<00:06:29.229> make<00:06:29.380> sure

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409 
from the mic and you need to make sure

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:30.990 
from the mic and you need to make sure
that<00:06:29.560> everyone<00:06:30.159> is<00:06:30.250> in<00:06:30.400> the<00:06:30.490> pickup<00:06:30.820> pattern

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
that everyone is in the pickup pattern

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.580 
that everyone is in the pickup pattern
so<00:06:31.570> you're<00:06:31.690> going<00:06:31.810> to<00:06:31.870> make<00:06:32.020> sure<00:06:32.229> that<00:06:32.440> the

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
so you're going to make sure that the

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.010 
so you're going to make sure that the
rest<00:06:32.800> of<00:06:32.979> the<00:06:33.039> ensemble<00:06:33.400> is<00:06:33.759> far<00:06:34.000> away<00:06:34.090> so

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
rest of the ensemble is far away so

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.200 
rest of the ensemble is far away so
that's<00:06:35.409> enough<00:06:35.680> on<00:06:35.830> microphones<00:06:36.339> for<00:06:36.520> now<00:06:36.669> the

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
that's enough on microphones for now the

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.640 
that's enough on microphones for now the
next<00:06:37.570> series<00:06:37.779> we're<00:06:38.229> going<00:06:38.349> to<00:06:38.409> get<00:06:38.500> into

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
next series we're going to get into

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.010 
next series we're going to get into
cabling<00:06:39.250> and<00:06:39.460> how<00:06:39.699> to

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
cabling and how to

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.090 
cabling and how to
all<00:06:40.169> of<00:06:40.500> this<00:06:40.620> up<00:06:40.889> quickly<00:06:41.400> and<00:06:41.819> efficiently
