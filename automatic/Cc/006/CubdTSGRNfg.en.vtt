00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.180
 welcome to a new episode 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.490
 of blue fire barbecue 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.099
 Today I unpacked the bock 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.530
 because today we will become Asian 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.990
 Have a fried curry rice with you today 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.550
 make vegetables and chicken and that the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.199
 very wonderful without expensive accessories 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.150
 does that work you see in this 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.350
 Today's wake of blood fire barbecue 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.350
 have lots of fun with it 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.640
 just before I start 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.830
 show what we are firing the bock today 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.230
 and you need it for one thing 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.370
 first time here such a cake ring the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.400
 you can buy everywhere so one 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.420
 You can adjust the stainless steel ring 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.360
 is perfect for baking 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.230
 and on the other hand the gps from whom or 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.520
 something similar has popped the main thing 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.170
 while the entrance can bloom through 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.270
 It's time for a few preparations 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.780
 meet and you just hit the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.060
 two eggs gives a small bowl 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.570
 about two tablespoons of that 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.570
 rice wine 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.160
 as the salt the sugar around the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.160
 pepper 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.780
 now moved the whole place with a 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.780
 whisk through and set it aside 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.630
 the vegetables as well as the meat should you 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.410
 already cut into small pieces 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.480
 to have 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.170
 if the buck stays hot once 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.170
 no time for it 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.509
 The suit is finished by the annealed 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.299
 I had about halfway with before 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.110
 Briquettes filled this tilt now 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.110
 just in the cake ring 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.190
 and since we need a lot of bums 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.100
 I still give you two pieces of bamboo cologne 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.159
 but that's not absolutely necessary 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.159
 is 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.209
 when all preparations have been made 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.209
 we can hang up 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.920
 after about one to two minutes , the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.650
 vogue the right heat 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.720
 The beginning of the week can now exist 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.500
 just a hefty shot a little oil 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.500
 in hot buck 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.970
 Now in the first step is the chicken 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.050
 seared meat 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.130
 important when walking is it you have to 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.350
 stir constantly 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.610
 So that's how you really do it 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.080
 has fast to the thing so one 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.080
 monkey heat that's madness 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.620
 after the meat has been seared 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.360
 you get one from the wok and again 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.360
 shot some oil go in 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.520
 in the next step, the vegetables will be 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.800
 fried and we start with it 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.680
 logically with the vegetables on the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.900
 longest need to be done in the 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.460
 in case it's carrots too 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.270
 once vigorously swing through 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.270
 the paprika 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.440
 as well as the run 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.520
 and the peas 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.220
 Last but not least there are the sprouts 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.220
 in addition 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.250
 I usually prefer that here 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.260
 fresh sprouts I have in the case 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.989
 no longer got and had to 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.519
 even the inlaid it 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.019
 but it is certainly better if you 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.180
 the possibility take on everyone 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.290
 case fresh goods were in my opinion 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.780
 it will be a bit better 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.020
 they just stay crispier and are 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.000
 The taste is also much better than 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.410
 Next is the rice in the wok 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.410
 and also stirs the strong with cloak 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.710
 Now the curry powder is on the line 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.710
 to give that too 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.930
 like a shot soy sauce 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.800
 and always remember to stir stir 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:06.000
 stir that is the secret when walking 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.000
 everything has to keep moving 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:15.000
 Now you can do the meat again 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:17.100
 Add to that and stir again 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.800
 Stepped the eggs together with the 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.100
 white wine and spices too 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.100
 give 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:34.289
 again swing vigorously and 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.289
 then it is already finished 

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:15.549
 so friends so the food was really great 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:19.989
