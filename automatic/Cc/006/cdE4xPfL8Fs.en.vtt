00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
your data and if you leave it on though

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.660 
your data and if you leave it on though
it's<00:02:29.580> going<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.850> constantly<00:02:30.360> search<00:02:30.780> for<00:02:31.670> open

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
it's going to constantly search for open

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.130 
it's going to constantly search for open
network<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.330> that's<00:02:33.600> something<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:34.020> don't

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
network so that's something you don't

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.590 
network so that's something you don't
really<00:02:34.350> need<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:35.010> have<00:02:35.160> going<00:02:35.400> on<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.090> it's

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
really need to have going on and it's

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.990 
really need to have going on and it's
going<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.780> use<00:02:36.959> more<00:02:37.260> battery<00:02:37.680> life<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:38.250> GPS<00:02:38.790> is

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
going to use more battery life so GPS is

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.280 
going to use more battery life so GPS is
kind<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.330> same<00:02:39.510> way<00:02:39.569> constantly

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
kind of the same way constantly

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.320 
kind of the same way constantly
