00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.250
 but today I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.759
 sugar mass around here I have a little bit 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.080
 the nba does not last the cold either but it would be 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.970
 white yes and second for the cake do 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.940
 eye mouth 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:26.420
 and for that we're going to take a bath water 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:31.970
 Maria here already four teaspoons of 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:35.120
 water and unflavored gelatin 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:41.530
 this is new 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.530
 honey that is transparent is called siro 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.190
 and this afternoon he believes nonetheless this is 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.010
 to put it a little hard half of the 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.850
 sugar sheath 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.239
 that comes in 500 are 250 grams of 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.239
 sugar 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.540
 well we proceed as I said in four 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.910
 a jet of water then I wrote 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.590
 over here so I do not forget 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.640
 after four water mergers one 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.640
 gelatin spoon 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.020
 a function to gelatin 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.579
 without flavor 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.579
 they are mixing well 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.409
 Y 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.909
 4th century 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:21.860
 has a contracture a little the thing not 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.790
 very good then they throw him four 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.790
 expired tablespoons 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.890
 you know what measure 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.909
 4 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.560
 9 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.069
 Y 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.830
 good friends 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.570
 this is 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.570
 a tiny little girl 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.569
 this would be too much look would be 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.990
 too much then what we want is 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:39.990
 like an eighth like that 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.180
 a little bit of truth 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.630
 because if the dough does not get too hard and 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.630
 then 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.420
 well and this would be for 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.440
 in the fire is ready is an hour 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.500
 hold everything 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.830
 thinking little by little to the appointment that 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.830
 they have 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.020
 realize someone has to do it 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.520
 little by little because they are not brought to 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.520
 all really 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.650
 is prepared to do many 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.410
 ah 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.670
 Welcome 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.870
 They realize 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.870
 then they go forward 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.960
 it's going to be like that I do not know if you can see me 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:20.860
 but here they are doing common 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.940
 well look but you keep mixing it 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:28.080
 everything to see if it is missing a little but 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.080
 you are ready 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.620
 Well ok 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.150
 and that's it 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.590
 A) Yes 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.810
 it looks like a little 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.310
 going so I left 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:04.899
 Only a little bit remains 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:12.000
 it's okay 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.000
 with this I'm going to paste everything 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:20.650
 and thus their mass will be saved 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.440
 description 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.449
 only then cooling can cause 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.360
 they take out 15 minutes before and they work it 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:32.840
 good so that it does not come down use 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.719
 in cornstarch and already good and until 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:39.250
 decorations like flowers mouth eyes and 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:39.250
 all those good things
