00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.150
 [Music] 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.860
 hey people welcome to one 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.719
 new video of me in this video 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.680
 it's all about my hair to her 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.549
 I know I have the hair 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.900
 isolated 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.429
 I now have a long bob and 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.410
 This of course has mine too 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.360
 styling and caring routine of my hair 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.070
 changed and if you want to know what 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.329
 I do so every day with it the hair 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.119
 look like that 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.770
 then it will definitely be mine 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.020
 probably at the time with a hair 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.860
 Long-term volume shampoo for fine hair 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.899
 from cool 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.340
 I have that relatively new, we can see 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.890
 and so I do not know how I 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.629
 that thinks so far but quite okay and 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.910
 then I always use one 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.559
 moisture of alverde I have 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.149
 I often bought after and can 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.010
 I really recommend you 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.969
 I have the feeling that my hair 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.980
 really very well maintained after that 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.929
 shower cream I dress myself 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.879
 make me and make me then 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:56.739
 The hair is so easy on the time 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.899
 dry well and I'll dry them 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.879
 then not so long must first 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.280
 then I take my favorite 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.530
 foam stabilizer from wella pro series in 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.030
 the highest strength level because likes 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.979
 I really like it because he does not have the hair 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.780
 but still glued very good 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.939
 Volume produces something really long 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.680
 keeps and then just defends 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:27.680
 everywhere on my hairline 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:27.680
 [Music] 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.980
 in my lengths, I impart 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.500
 splashes of the so-called miracle oil 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.270
 of garnier fructis that leaves the hair 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.150
 just shiny because supple 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.259
 Look and prevent foot 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.259
 [Music] 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.690
 so that the products look good in the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.550
 I'm brushing hair now 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.470
 Of course you should normally 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.320
 yes use a comb but I like that 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:06.820
 not because that attracts so terrible 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:09.229
 [Music] 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.330
 now it's about to blow dry and 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.739
 Please for your hair not on it is called 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.170
 that stage because that is very harmful 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.180
 for the hair and produces freshly me 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.340
 take mostly the middle or cold 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.349
 level and always for my hair 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.390
 over head because that generates again 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.030
 a little volume at the beginning and leaves the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.989
 Hair does not seem so flat 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.489
 then I would still have my hair 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.739
 times through or lost her 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.620
 and then share a game on 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:39.519
 upside down 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:42.200
 [Music] 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.239
 Okay we come to the hair styling now 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.670
 Part of the moment I'm wearing my hair 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.379
 very easily screwed in and smooth 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.209
 and I get that very well at one 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.000
 Hair length with this rotating 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.439
 warm air round brush out with the device 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.569
 I get along very well because of it 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:59.090
 at the same time a hair dryer and a round brush 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.739
 is and you brush either right 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.450
 or turn around left 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.549
 You do not have to be funny about it 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.950
 turn the arms behind the back 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.269
 It is important to share the back of the head 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.549
 that you really streak by strand 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.290
 then get worked with the device 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.329
 to get the best possible result 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.519
 For that I always share a lot 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.230
 from my hair and clip the rest 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.970
 on top of my head together with me 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.519
 Hair just does not get in the way 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.829
 the device is called branche active and 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.720
 is from the company rowenta and I have 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.209
 it a few years ago in saturn or 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.459
 I bought this media market 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.349
 warm air brush but only girls with 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.180
 recommend shorter hair because I have 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.980
 the experience that made that happen 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.210
 volume for longer hair directly 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.340
 hangs out again 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.230
 [Music] 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:47.000
 [Applause] 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.910
 [Music] 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.800
 [Applause] 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.470
 [Music] 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.300
 [Applause] 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.520
 [Music] 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.990
 you can now right here below 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.150
 in the picture see that there is one more 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.820
 another essay for this brush gives 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.930
 just a small round brush and with it 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.880
 you can just one more hair 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.620
 bit more of a turn but I use 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.620
 usually the slightly larger one 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.380
 [Applause] 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.480
 so now it's time to toup I've got 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.650
 by nature very fine flat hair 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.910
 and must therefore volume the fake 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.940
 For that I take single strands 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.340
 first up and up from the upper back of the head 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.230
 then spray some hairspray behind it 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.930
 I suppose a fine came and would come 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.060
 hair against their growth direction by 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.980
 knot the shorter ones, so to speak 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.210
 hair at the neck something and thereby 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.529
 then arises the volume 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.529
 [Music] 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.650
 [Music] 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.930
 I'm doing the same thing on the left 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.090
 and right of my crest with it me 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.640
 optically more volume at the top of the head 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:15.540
 have 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:18.100
 [Music] 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.990
 In my opinion, then enough 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.390
 I 'll take my copy again 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.610
 breasts to hand and paint with it completely 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.830
 Carefully over the teased patient 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.630
 this unravels the upper hair 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.880
 again and cover that I stood 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.860
 I had to go so long 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.810
 Carefully hold my hair until we get that 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.790
 final result and I like none 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.210
 weird looking people are seeing more 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.430
 can 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.530
 Finally, I fix my hair with 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.690
 the hairspray of wellaflex and spray 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.700
 of it also something on my finger with it 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.890
 I have the little baby hair sticking out 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.090
 something can curb at the forehead and 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.020
 then I'm already done with 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:57.570
 styling my hair 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:06:00.430
 [Music] 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.020
