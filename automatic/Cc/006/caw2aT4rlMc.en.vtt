00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.620
 and we are going to answer a question 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.320
 that everyone is doing that is 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.630
 going to playstation 4 in japan if 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.040
 So much success has he had in the rest of the 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.660
 good world, andrew gause 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.760
 responsible for sony computer 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.980
 entertainment has explained the reasons 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.770
 for which in your opinion the console 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.199
 Playstation 4 is not performing 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.080
 rhythm comparable to that of other regions in 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.330
 the Japanese country attentive reasons for the 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.920
 success in the West according to house one of 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.750
 the reasons why the console has 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.399
 worked well in the West is that 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.109
 It has streaming services that 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.659
 have not yet achieved an impact 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:40.120
 comparable in Japanese the executive 

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:41.979
 perceives that this is the result of several 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.050
 structural issues of the industry 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:46.539
 of entertainment in Japan that do 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.699
 not secondary use is given in the 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.769
 console is to say the console is not 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.299
 used as a multimedia center in Japan 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.209
 and that's why people are not 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:57.219
 interesting and they say that there is no pessimism 

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:59.889
 before japan the console is doing 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.600
 just a good job 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:03.100
 howse says it does not stand out but the 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.590
 work that you are doing in sales is 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.460
 good in terms of the sales situation 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.049
 of playstation 4 had certain 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.420
 doubts about the feasibility of 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.190
 console market in Japan and according to 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.770
 they are aware of the fact that 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.630
 they do not have the type of content yet 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.810
 natives of publishers and developers 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.030
 Japanese who want in Japan like that 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.159
 something temporary eye because they have also 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.770
 talked about success in the West as 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.869
 motor for japan what does this mean 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.759
 good for Mr. Hauché according to 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.550
 words of his there is enthusiasm before 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.009
 Playstation 4 among the developers 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.409
 and publishers and considers that this has been 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.149
 reinforced by seeing the success it has had 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.310
 in markets outside of Japan 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.380
 however house admits that when 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.270
 they were presenting the console they had 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.880
 more problems when selling it to 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.560
 the Japanese publishers and developers 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.750
 in order playstation 4 needs a small 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.850
 push at least in the country in the country 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.149
 nipón this I think is more than 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.149
 Clear
