00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:36.979 
and what I'm finding in practice is that

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:38.680 
and what I'm finding in practice is that
patients<00:00:37.430> are<00:00:37.489> teaching<00:00:37.850> me<00:00:37.970> to<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:38.479> after

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
patients are teaching me to and after

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.439 
patients are teaching me to and after
each<00:00:39.080> meeting<00:00:39.949> I'll<00:00:40.280> learn<00:00:40.460> some<00:00:40.760> new<00:00:41.000> little

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
each meeting I'll learn some new little

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:42.610 
each meeting I'll learn some new little
tid<00:00:41.629> better<00:00:41.839> I'll<00:00:41.989> go<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:42.379> I'll<00:00:42.409> look

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
tid better I'll go and I'll look

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.860 
tid better I'll go and I'll look
something<00:00:42.979> up<00:00:43.129> and<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:43.699> I<00:00:44.180> think<00:00:44.239> that<00:00:44.540> that

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
something up and and I think that that

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.920 
something up and and I think that that
growth<00:00:45.559> on<00:00:45.769> both<00:00:45.799> sides<00:00:46.309> is<00:00:46.549> is<00:00:47.089> absolutely

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
growth on both sides is is absolutely

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.259 
growth on both sides is is absolutely

what does your best picture of health
look<00:01:25.760> like<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.240> then<00:01:26.360> once<00:01:27.320> people<00:01:27.650> start

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
look like and then once people start

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.920 
look like and then once people start
thinking<00:01:28.730> once<00:01:29.030> patients<00:01:29.420> start<00:01:29.600> thinking

thinking once patients start thinking

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.440 
thinking once patients start thinking
that<00:01:30.080> oh<00:01:30.230> I'm<00:01:30.620> dictating<00:01:30.920> what<00:01:31.820> my<00:01:31.940> goals<00:01:32.180> are

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450

that oh I'm dictating what my goals are
I<00:01:32.480> think<00:01:32.659> that<00:01:33.020> really<00:01:33.290> gets<00:01:33.530> people<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:34.100> little

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
I think that really gets people a little

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.399 
I think that really gets people a little
bit<00:01:34.370> more<00:01:34.430> bought<00:01:34.760> in<00:01:34.940> so<00:01:35.750> what<00:01:36.110> really<00:01:36.230> gets

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
bit more bought in so what really gets

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:37.870 
bit more bought in so what really gets
me<00:01:36.620> excited<00:01:36.710> when<00:01:37.190> I<00:01:37.220> have<00:01:37.370> a<00:01:37.400> patient<00:01:37.610> come
