to<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> left<00:01:39.570> side<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.960> side<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
to do on the left side the side with the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.440 
to do on the left side the side with the
slab<00:01:40.950> we're<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.060> get<00:01:42.210> rid<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.360> this

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
slab we're going to get rid of this

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.450 
slab we're going to get rid of this
middle<00:01:42.750> block<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.229> put<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> piece<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.100> redstone

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
middle block and put a piece of redstone

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.330 
middle block and put a piece of redstone
here<00:01:45.500> now<00:01:46.500> here's<00:01:46.829> where<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.009> start<00:01:47.130> our

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
here now here's where we start our

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.550 
here now here's where we start our
building<00:01:47.759> we're<00:01:47.939> going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.119> start<00:01:48.240> right<00:01:48.420> here

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
building we're going to start right here

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.850 
building we're going to start right here
at<00:01:49.560> our<00:01:49.770> stair<00:01:50.340> step<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:51.210> come<00:01:51.420> up<00:01:51.649> come<00:01:52.649> all

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
at our stair step we come up come all

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.520 
at our stair step we come up come all
the<00:01:53.009> way<00:01:53.040> across<00:01:53.509> connect<00:01:54.509> these<00:01:54.720> two<00:01:55.020> this

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the way across connect these two this

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.010 
the way across connect these two this
that's<00:01:55.799> actually<00:01:56.100> very<00:01:56.130> important<00:01:56.640> later<00:01:56.729> on

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
that's actually very important later on

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.100 
that's actually very important later on
come<00:01:58.020> all<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> way<00:01:58.350> back<00:01:58.759> put<00:01:59.759> one<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.450> come

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
come all the way back put one here come

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.950 
come all the way back put one here come
all<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> way<00:02:01.350> across<00:02:01.640> go<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.060> one<00:02:03.689> last

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
all the way across go up and one last

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.499 
all the way across go up and one last
one<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.060> should<00:02:06.299> look

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
one like that so it should look

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.600 
one like that so it should look
something<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.369> we<00:02:08.489> have<00:02:08.580> a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
something just like this so we have a

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.059 
something just like this so we have a
stair-step<00:02:09.020> this<00:02:10.020> one<00:02:10.229> looks<00:02:10.379> like<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
stair-step this one looks like on the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.010 
stair-step this one looks like on the
right<00:02:11.280> side<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.610> cannon<00:02:11.940> stair<00:02:12.599> step<00:02:12.810> like

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
right side of the cannon stair step like

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.730 
right side of the cannon stair step like
that

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
that

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.910 
that
the<00:02:13.920> front<00:02:14.450> it's<00:02:15.450> like<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:15.960> so<00:02:16.800> it's

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
the front it's like this so it's

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.320 
the front it's like this so it's
actually<00:02:17.070> really<00:02:17.340> simple<00:02:17.430> you're<00:02:17.880> kinda<00:02:18.240> just

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
actually really simple you're kinda just

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.960 
actually really simple you're kinda just
doing<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.660> stair<00:02:18.870> step<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.730> now<00:02:20.730> we're<00:02:20.880> going

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
doing a stair step and now we're going

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.640 
doing a stair step and now we're going
to<00:02:21.030> start<00:02:21.240> putting<00:02:21.360> our<00:02:21.540> whetstone<00:02:22.020> down<00:02:22.230> so

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
to start putting our whetstone down so

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.070 
to start putting our whetstone down so
our<00:02:23.250> red<00:02:23.490> stone<00:02:23.790> will<00:02:24.180> just<00:02:24.300> follow<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.870> path

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
our red stone will just follow the path

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.280 
our red stone will just follow the path
of<00:02:25.290> our<00:02:26.060> stairs<00:02:27.060> here<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.720> coming<00:02:28.020> all<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> way

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
of our stairs here so coming all the way

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.280 
of our stairs here so coming all the way
up<00:02:29.060> boom<00:02:30.060> boom<00:02:30.360> all<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.780> way<00:02:30.870> up<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.140> very

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
up boom boom all the way up to the very

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.860 
up boom boom all the way up to the very
top<00:02:31.410> now<00:02:32.370> we're<00:02:32.520> not<00:02:32.700> done<00:02:32.970> yet<00:02:33.000> if<00:02:33.300> we<00:02:33.540> put

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
top now we're not done yet if we put

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.480 
top now we're not done yet if we put
teen<00:02:34.110> tea<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.440> right<00:02:34.590> now<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:35.340> would

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
teen tea in it right now it would

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.420 
teen tea in it right now it would
explode<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.210> land<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.660> our<00:02:37.110> bedrock<00:02:38.100> which

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
explode and land on our bedrock which

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.340 
explode and land on our bedrock which
something<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:38.850> don't<00:02:39.000> want<00:02:39.300> so<00:02:39.990> using<00:02:40.140> our

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
something we don't want so using our

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.530 
something we don't want so using our
slabs<00:02:40.740> we're<00:02:41.220> going<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.370> put<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.550> slab<00:02:41.910> here<00:02:42.360> on

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
slabs we're going to put a slab here on

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.830 
slabs we're going to put a slab here on
that<00:02:42.870> cut<00:02:43.080> out<00:02:43.260> right<00:02:44.220> here<00:02:44.340> on<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.550> bottom

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
that cut out right here on the bottom

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.540 
that cut out right here on the bottom
we're<00:02:45.840> going<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:45.990> come<00:02:46.140> up<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.890> side<00:02:47.160> on

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
we're going to come up to the side on

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.480 
we're going to come up to the side on
our<00:02:47.580> right<00:02:47.910> side<00:02:47.970> put<00:02:48.540> one<00:02:48.780> right<00:02:48.960> here<00:02:49.500> and

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
our right side put one right here and

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.800 
our right side put one right here and
then<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.880> top<00:02:51.090> we're<00:02:51.480> going<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.660> put<00:02:51.780> one

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
then on the top we're going to put one

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.290 
then on the top we're going to put one
in<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.410> middle<00:02:52.740> like<00:02:53.010> we're<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.910> team<00:02:54.060> t

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
in the middle like we're the team t

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.470 
in the middle like we're the team t
shoots<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.740> then<00:02:55.890> diagonal<00:02:56.490> one<00:02:56.820> right<00:02:57.000> here

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
shoots and then diagonal one right here

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.260 
shoots and then diagonal one right here
and<00:02:57.600> diagonal<00:02:58.440> again<00:02:58.800> one<00:02:59.250> right<00:02:59.520> here<00:03:00.090> if

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
and diagonal again one right here if

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.890 
and diagonal again one right here if
that<00:03:00.510> makes<00:03:00.870> any<00:03:00.930> sense<00:03:01.910> okay<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.660> we're<00:03:03.780> going

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
that makes any sense okay so we're going

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.230 
that makes any sense okay so we're going
to<00:03:03.990> do<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.430> we're<00:03:05.430> going<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.580> take<00:03:05.670> our<00:03:05.820> ladders

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
to do is we're going to take our ladders

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.270 
to do is we're going to take our ladders
out<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.690> we're<00:03:07.050> gonna<00:03:07.110> place<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.590> couple<00:03:07.830> right

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
out and we're gonna place a couple right

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.030 
out and we're gonna place a couple right
here<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.910> will<00:03:09.060> be<00:03:09.150> our<00:03:09.260> reloading<00:03:10.260> lighter

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
here this will be our reloading lighter

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.300 
here this will be our reloading lighter
so<00:03:11.340> we<00:03:11.460> can<00:03:11.610> reload<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.210> lot<00:03:12.450> faster<00:03:12.690> now

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
so we can reload it a lot faster now

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.580 
so we can reload it a lot faster now
we're<00:03:14.310> good<00:03:14.460> to<00:03:14.580> put<00:03:14.790> our<00:03:14.940> T<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.390> T<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.720> extra

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
we're good to put our T and T in extra

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.190 
we're good to put our T and T in extra
not<00:03:16.710> yet<00:03:17.030> first<00:03:18.030> off<00:03:18.240> what<00:03:18.780> we<00:03:18.840> need<00:03:18.990> to<00:03:19.110> do

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.830 
above the ladder we're going to take a
little<00:03:23.370> trench<00:03:23.790> coming<00:03:24.090> all<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.420> way<00:03:24.450> back<00:03:24.540> to

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
little trench coming all the way back to

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.010 
little trench coming all the way back to
the<00:03:25.230> end<00:03:25.440> right<00:03:25.680> here<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.660> I'm<00:03:27.660> going<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:27.930> make

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
the end right here and I'm going to make

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.380 
the end right here and I'm going to make
this<00:03:28.050> bedrock<00:03:28.560> real<00:03:28.980> quick<00:03:29.220> nice<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.270> simple

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
this bedrock real quick nice and simple

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.260 
this bedrock real quick nice and simple
do<00:03:30.780> do<00:03:30.900> do<00:03:31.050> do<00:03:31.200> doop<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.850> we're<00:03:33.000> going<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.150> do

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
do do do do doop and we're going to do

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.240 
do do do do doop and we're going to do
is<00:03:33.510> put<00:03:33.810> rest<00:03:34.110> on<00:03:34.260> coming<00:03:34.500> all<00:03:34.710> the<00:03:34.860> way<00:03:34.890> over

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
is put rest on coming all the way over

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.250 
is put rest on coming all the way over
and<00:03:35.610> connecting<00:03:36.120> with<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.690> one<00:03:36.870> right<00:03:37.050> above

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
and connecting with the one right above

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.160 
and connecting with the one right above
the<00:03:37.560> ladder<00:03:38.540> so<00:03:39.540> we're<00:03:39.780> going<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:39.960> put<00:03:39.990> a

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
the ladder so we're going to put a

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.100 
the ladder so we're going to put a
button<00:03:40.440> here<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.340> button<00:03:41.670> here<00:03:42.090> we're<00:03:42.960> not

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
button here and a button here we're not

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.900 
button here and a button here we're not
using<00:03:43.290> repeaters<00:03:43.920> because<00:03:44.280> this<00:03:44.550> way<00:03:44.760> it

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
using repeaters because this way it

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.390 
using repeaters because this way it
keeps<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.300> smaller<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.960> a<00:03:46.590> lot<00:03:46.740> more<00:03:46.890> simple

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
keeps it smaller and a lot more simple

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.790 
keeps it smaller and a lot more simple
so<00:03:47.910> we're<00:03:48.330> going<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.510> use<00:03:48.660> our<00:03:48.840> ladder<00:03:49.500> for

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
so we're going to use our ladder for

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.670 
so we're going to use our ladder for
reloading<00:03:50.130> mechanism<00:03:50.780> so<00:03:51.780> first<00:03:52.290> off<00:03:52.500> we're

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
reloading mechanism so first off we're

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.680 
reloading mechanism so first off we're
going<00:03:52.770> to<00:03:52.860> put<00:03:52.920> 18t<00:03:53.460> right<00:03:53.880> here<00:03:54.180> right<00:03:54.540> above

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
going to put 18t right here right above

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.690 
going to put 18t right here right above
the<00:03:54.930> water<00:03:55.140> not<00:03:55.530> in<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:55.920> water<00:03:56.070> right<00:03:56.340> above
