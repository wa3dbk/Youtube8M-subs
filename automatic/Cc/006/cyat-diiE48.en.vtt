guys these guys are multi Rank 1 glutes
and<00:00:47.239> it<00:00:47.480> was<00:00:47.719> sort<00:00:48.469> of<00:00:48.530> like<00:00:48.589> a<00:00:48.769> mere<00:00:49.309> where

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
and it was sort of like a mere where

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.540 
and it was sort of like a mere where
they<00:00:50.089> had<00:00:50.269> a<00:00:50.300> hunter<00:00:50.870> la<00:00:51.530> Pharaoh<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:52.339> we'll

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
they had a hunter la Pharaoh and we'll

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.079 
they had a hunter la Pharaoh and we'll
have<00:00:52.699> a<00:00:52.760> le<00:00:53.059> hunter<00:00:54.019> and<00:00:54.339> decay<00:00:55.339> so<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.940> bottom

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
have a le hunter and decay so the bottom

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.119 
have a le hunter and decay so the bottom
line<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.390> when<00:00:56.690> it<00:00:56.780> comes<00:00:56.929> with<00:00:57.109> a<00:00:57.289> DPS<00:00:57.679> matchup

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129

it<00:00:58.339> was<00:00:58.510> relatively<00:00:59.510> like<00:00:59.839> a<00:00:59.870> decay<00:01:00.559> versus

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
it was relatively like a decay versus

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.099 
it was relatively like a decay versus
federal<00:01:01.159> type<00:01:01.489> of<00:01:01.640> thing<00:01:01.820> so<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.899> main<00:01:03.079> thing

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109

about<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.679> fights<00:01:03.949> guys<00:01:04.220> which<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:04.550> need<00:01:04.610> to

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
about the fights guys which you need to

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.090 
about the fights guys which you need to
realize<00:01:04.879> is<00:01:05.120> in<00:01:05.390> each<00:01:05.510> new<00:01:05.840> to<00:01:06.170> apply<00:01:06.620> as<00:01:06.830> many

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
realize is in each new to apply as many

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.630 
realize is in each new to apply as many
dots<00:01:07.460> as<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:07.940> possibly<00:01:08.480> can<00:01:08.780> as

why is because I will show you the basic

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.280 
why is because I will show you the basic
a<00:01:16.280> turning<00:01:16.670> point<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:17.180> us<00:01:17.420> winning<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:17.990> that

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
a turning point of us winning and that

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.760 
a turning point of us winning and that
was<00:01:18.470> all<00:01:18.710> my<00:01:19.160> doubts<00:01:19.330> 8<00:01:20.330> or<00:01:20.930> whatever<00:01:21.410> you<00:01:21.620> guys

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
was all my doubts 8 or whatever you guys

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.550 
was all my doubts 8 or whatever you guys
could<00:01:22.010> call<00:01:22.250> it<00:01:22.370> so<00:01:23.210> anyway<00:01:23.570> at<00:01:23.750> this<00:01:24.140> point<00:01:24.380> in

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
could call it so anyway at this point in

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.710 
could call it so anyway at this point in
time<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:25.130> fights<00:01:25.640> were<00:01:25.820> back<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.240> forth<00:01:26.510> this

my<00:01:51.050> glove<00:01:51.320> was<00:01:51.500> a<00:01:51.530> little<00:01:51.950> bit<00:01:52.070> on<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.340> cool

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
my glove was a little bit on the cool

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.100 
my glove was a little bit on the cool
down<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:52.910> beginning<00:01:53.300> so<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.450> decided<00:01:53.810> not<00:01:53.960> to

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
down the beginning so I decided not to

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.170 
down the beginning so I decided not to
use<00:01:54.140> my<00:01:54.350> engineering<00:01:54.530> laughs<00:01:55.070> engine<00:01:55.460> but<00:01:56.060> it

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
use my engineering laughs engine but it

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.390 
use my engineering laughs engine but it
still<00:01:56.450> was<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.870> relatively<00:01:57.500> well<00:01:57.800> so<00:01:58.250> I'm<00:01:58.340> going

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
still was a relatively well so I'm going

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.960 
still was a relatively well so I'm going
for<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.060> actual<00:01:59.630> mine<00:01:59.960> freeze<00:02:00.440> on<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:01.490> shaman

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
for the actual mine freeze on the shaman

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.870 
for the actual mine freeze on the shaman
and<00:02:02.120> he<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:02.840> believe<00:02:02.960> jerked<00:02:03.650> me<00:02:03.800> and<00:02:04.010> my<00:02:04.580> dad's

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
and he I believe jerked me and my dad's

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.880 
and he I believe jerked me and my dad's
got<00:02:05.270> him<00:02:05.480> out<00:02:05.690> of<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.990> trap<00:02:06.260> because<00:02:06.740> my

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
got him out of the trap because my

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.369 
got him out of the trap because my
hunter<00:02:07.190> didn't<00:02:07.460> run<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.610> trap<00:02:07.970> I<00:02:08.179> guess<00:02:08.660> gets

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
hunter didn't run the trap I guess gets

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.619 
hunter didn't run the trap I guess gets
