using this red clay you're going to be

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.590 
using this red clay you're going to be
using<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.320> smoother<00:01:37.619> side<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.970> still<00:01:39.390> may

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
using the smoother side so it still may

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.899 
using the smoother side so it still may
scratch<00:01:39.930> your<00:01:40.110> clay<00:01:40.380> creation<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.890> bit<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.610> um

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
scratch your clay creation a bit but um

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.210 
scratch your clay creation a bit but um
if<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.450> does<00:01:42.600> scratch<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.110> then<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.860> just<00:01:44.040> need

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
if it does scratch it then you just need

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.480 
if it does scratch it then you just need
to<00:01:44.340> glaze<00:01:44.579> over<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.090> we'll<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.299> fine<00:01:45.509> so

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
to glaze over it and we'll be fine so

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.149 
to glaze over it and we'll be fine so
let's<00:01:47.490> start<00:01:47.850> um<00:01:48.060> Tris<00:01:48.869> ball<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.740> may<00:01:49.890> need<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
let's start um Tris ball you may need to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.310 
let's start um Tris ball you may need to
take<00:01:50.310> your<00:01:50.460> blade<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.970> if<00:01:51.659> there's<00:01:51.930> some<00:01:52.110> big

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
take your blade and if there's some big

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.899 
take your blade and if there's some big
particles<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.369> kind<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.640> scrape

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
particles like this just kind of scrape

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.090 
particles like this just kind of scrape
it<00:01:54.060> off<00:01:54.149> slowly<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.530> don't<00:01:55.710> make<00:01:55.920> on

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
it off slowly so that you don't make on

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.179 
it off slowly so that you don't make on
many<00:01:56.430> big<00:01:56.759> scratch<00:01:57.060> marks<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:58.979> see

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
many big scratch marks so as you can see

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.200 
many big scratch marks so as you can see
I<00:01:59.219> already<00:01:59.310> got<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.880> off<00:02:00.060> then

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
I already got that off then

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.810 
I already got that off then
some<00:02:01.600> other<00:02:01.810> clay<00:02:02.620> colors<00:02:03.100> that<00:02:03.369> are<00:02:03.520> stuck

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
some other clay colors that are stuck

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.270 
some other clay colors that are stuck
just<00:02:04.750> kind<00:02:05.049> of<00:02:05.110> scrape<00:02:05.440> it<00:02:05.560> up<00:02:05.650> lightly<00:02:05.890> and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
just kind of scrape it up lightly and

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.800 
just kind of scrape it up lightly and
then<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.610> would<00:02:06.760> just<00:02:07.259> slowly<00:02:08.259> like<00:02:08.920> get<00:02:09.490> off

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
then it would just slowly like get off

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.710 
then it would just slowly like get off
and<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:11.410> cannot<00:02:11.680> just<00:02:12.130> carve<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.330> out<00:02:13.450> because

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
and you cannot just carve it out because

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.870 
and you cannot just carve it out because
if<00:02:13.990> you<00:02:14.080> carve<00:02:14.319> it<00:02:14.440> out<00:02:14.560> then<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:15.520> know<00:02:15.640> it'll

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
if you carve it out then you know it'll

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.090 
if you carve it out then you know it'll
look<00:02:16.090> horrible<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.660> stuff<00:02:16.990> so<00:02:17.319> you<00:02:17.800> have<00:02:17.950> to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
look horrible and stuff so you have to

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.250 
look horrible and stuff so you have to
be<00:02:18.190> really<00:02:18.459> careful<00:02:18.610> when<00:02:18.880> doing<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:20.020> do

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
some clay stains you can just take your

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.410 
some clay stains you can just take your
razor<00:03:17.110> blade<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.410> start<00:03:17.860> kind<00:03:18.820> of<00:03:18.970> scraping

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
razor blade and start kind of scraping

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.229 
razor blade and start kind of scraping
it<00:03:19.630> off<00:03:19.720> but<00:03:20.049> do<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.650> lightly<00:03:20.890> you<00:03:21.670> can't<00:03:21.880> carve

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
it off but do it lightly you can't carve

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.699 
it off but do it lightly you can't carve
it<00:03:22.360> out<00:03:22.480> otherwise<00:03:22.840> it's<00:03:23.019> going<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.230> be<00:03:23.320> a<00:03:23.350> dent

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
it out otherwise it's going to be a dent

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.710 
it out otherwise it's going to be a dent
right<00:03:23.890> there<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:25.420> just<00:03:25.690> slowly<00:03:25.900> scrape<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.620> off

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
right there so just slowly scrape it off

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.830 
right there so just slowly scrape it off
then<00:03:28.720> for<00:03:29.140> on<00:03:29.579> other<00:03:30.579> dusting<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.329> jack<00:03:31.540> I'm

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
then for on other dusting the jack I'm

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.630 
then for on other dusting the jack I'm
just<00:03:32.560> going<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:32.799> use<00:03:33.010> my<00:03:33.040> new<00:03:33.220> buffer

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.770 

that<00:03:40.360> should<00:03:40.569> be<00:03:40.690> something<00:03:40.840> like<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:42.450> so<00:03:43.450> it

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
that should be something like this so it

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.480 
that should be something like this so it
looks<00:03:44.050> really<00:03:44.440> clean<00:03:44.709> now<00:03:44.920> compared<00:03:45.430> to

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
looks really clean now compared to

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.390 
looks really clean now compared to
before<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:46.620> yeah<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.830> hope<00:03:48.100> this<00:03:48.280> tutorial

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
before and yeah I hope this tutorial

rather<00:04:02.140> than<00:04:02.290> sand<00:04:02.709> paper<00:04:02.920> because<00:04:03.370> i<00:04:03.580> cannot

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
rather than sand paper because i cannot

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.590 
rather than sand paper because i cannot
find<00:04:04.600> those<00:04:04.990> very<00:04:05.350> um<00:04:05.820> like<00:04:06.820> these<00:04:07.209> kind<00:04:07.510> of

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
find those very um like these kind of

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.140 
find those very um like these kind of
texture<00:04:08.500> kind<00:04:08.770> of<00:04:08.920> sandpaper<00:04:09.280> em<00:04:09.640> near<00:04:09.970> me

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
texture kind of sandpaper em near me

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.270 
texture kind of sandpaper em near me
because<00:04:10.900> most<00:04:11.140> of<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.380> sandpaper<00:04:11.709> here<00:04:12.070> are

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
because most of the sandpaper here are

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.729 
because most of the sandpaper here are
actually<00:04:12.430> very<00:04:12.940> very<00:04:13.060> rough<00:04:13.450> like<00:04:14.260> this<00:04:14.500> and

actually very very rough like this and
they<00:04:14.980> will<00:04:15.130> definitely<00:04:15.280> make<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.150> very<00:04:16.570> big

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630
