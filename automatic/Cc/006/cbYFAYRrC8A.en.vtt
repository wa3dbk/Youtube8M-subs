out<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> hundred<00:01:37.439> percent<00:01:37.560> after<00:01:38.150> a<00:01:39.150> couple

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
out a hundred percent after a couple

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.090 
out a hundred percent after a couple
hours<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.200> should<00:01:40.229> get<00:01:40.770> done

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
hours it should get done

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.280

two hours later and the transcode is

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.620 
two hours later and the transcode is
complete<00:01:45.710> it<00:01:45.920> could<00:01:46.610> take<00:01:46.790> longer<00:01:46.850> if<00:01:47.450> you

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
complete it could take longer if you

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.860
