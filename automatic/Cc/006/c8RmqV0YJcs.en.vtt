00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.969
 It is a series of impersonation acts that are all over again 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.120
 It is clear that the US clear congratulation fee is charged 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.190
 eb-g that secrets were cleared by others 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.929
 Have you seen the story of objection ぇ let me present 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.160
 For stories involving more than the works I received 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.400
 Because there was a lot of talk about the US mind, everyone kind of thought seed 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.239
 digestion 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.319
 As I was told a lot of stories that made me think 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:32.369
 I think I'm also out in the picture Shiori's City of Ariwa of this thought 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.360
 It is also the feeling that you can feel embarrassed and empathic 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.260
 I can understand 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.879
 Well, each one of them is asking if it is correct 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.320
 Because it is a sense of value, think about it for a moment 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 I think I will go last season to get you 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.720
 Even if you comment on the service, basically you have a game of analog 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.990
 Because it is mon to record that one by one individually 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.360
 Clear how to comment this comment 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.530
 It's supposed to be 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.330
 I do not know before but 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.370
 I'm talking with lbo conan dol 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.080
 I said that but from Chandan 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.720
 Thank you very much 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.720
 I was told that I would say tomorrow 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.750
 If you ask if it is usually for the ridge because you know the age 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.440
 I can't laugh like 1-0 in the last match 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.880
 It is not 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.010
 I love coming and going for a moment when it happens 16-17 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.280
 is 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.960
 In that kind of place, I'll show you the connectiona 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.500
 I'm thinking I'm going to mess with it, but I'm sorry 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.110
 While there is no more news 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.240
 There are many voices in the picture alone and this game next year 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.350
 It's rather long and it's a very long page 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.200
 There is also my own law 4 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.230
 I'm not going to record, but that 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.260
 Other stories of this software do not have twelve in mind 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.170
 I can not understand the whole story and see great medical care 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.810
 But the exchange office is 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.740
 It was good for this house when I left this tunnel 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.000
 You may fall into the state from the extent you think 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.020
 There is a moment that I think I'm widely focused, but now 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.420
 It is quite easy to take a shot again, but everyone lives a year 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.579
 Listening at 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.650
 I will try to understand the aero 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.609
 I took an average year 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.669
 That's the life of a woman of that person or eight 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.669
 Because I do not necessarily want to see that oneself 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.609
 Return to the wind if it was difficult for me to think for a long time 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.369
 I used to have a lot of work done often 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:37.689
 Though 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:38.690
 In this way already 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.240
 I think I'm going to be an adult, but if you're in production you might feel like that 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.749
 It is likely to be liquefied, but it is a member of society 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.370
 As we often want to save on any personal computer 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.660
 I'm reading but I wondered if it was difficult 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.129
 There are many things to think about 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.409
 Everyone of the feed 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.320
 Those characters 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.049
 Can I write my full name 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.209
 Opened 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.069
 Clearing eco-le planted a role in 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.910
 That's right 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.510
 The person in the next task to Enayama is all kanji with full name 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.309
 To write in 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:12.750
 I think I'm going with Airbus 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.590
 Eh I'm character stability failure I do not see it I miss you 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.310
 As far as I can tell, I write the feeling of f and send it to this person 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.880
 Thank you for your consideration 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.399
 Although it did not become a comment to say vulgarity to 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:28.619
 That's why the other day showed the way station
