00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.949
 from nobody like that nobody is with you 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.080

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.480
 dreaming of that bed who has lived

 crying for nothing that nothing will be left 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.010

 couple of friends who do not understand each other but 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.489

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.410

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.079

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.740
 with saliva up are healing a 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.840
 space to say what I call 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.700
 when I fall from the host if I do not die of 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.460
 money I feel because I want to bark for 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.530

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.630
 eyes as the road says doing now 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.479
 for a clear hobby that I want to win 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.729

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.830

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.710
