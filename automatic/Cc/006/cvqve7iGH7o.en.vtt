is called suven 8 and and to report to

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.110 
is called suven 8 and and to report to
you<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.679> positive<00:00:50.100> results<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.670> had<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
you the positive results we had on a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.119 
you the positive results we had on a
memory<00:00:51.719> endpoint<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.500> was<00:00:52.649> pre<00:00:52.890> specified

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
memory endpoint that was pre specified

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.160 
memory endpoint that was pre specified
and<00:00:53.730> which<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:53.999> the<00:00:54.030> most<00:00:54.239> relevant<00:00:54.749> endpoint

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and which is the most relevant endpoint

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.810 
and which is the most relevant endpoint
in<00:00:55.350> these<00:00:55.499> patients<00:00:55.710> category<00:00:56.309> which<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.640> very

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
in these patients category which is very

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.049 
in these patients category which is very
mild<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.390> ad<00:00:58.230> patients<00:00:58.670> it's<00:00:59.670> medical

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
mild to ad patients it's medical

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.419 
mild to ad patients it's medical
nutrition<00:01:00.269> and<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:01.499> we<00:01:01.710> think<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.070> may<00:01:02.249> offer

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
nutrition and then we think it may offer

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.690 
nutrition and then we think it may offer
a<00:01:02.820> new<00:01:03.179> approach<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.350> dietary<00:01:05.280> management

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
a new approach a dietary management

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.490 
a new approach a dietary management
approach<00:01:06.120> if<00:01:06.300> you<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:07.080> people<00:01:07.110> with

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
approach if you like for people with

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.560 
approach if you like for people with
very<00:01:07.710> early<00:01:08.040> Alzheimer's<00:01:08.520> disease<00:01:08.850> it's

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
very early Alzheimer's disease it's

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.870 
very early Alzheimer's disease it's
based<00:01:09.870> on<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.170> number<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.280> years<00:01:11.550> of<00:01:11.610> research

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
based on a number of years of research

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.060 
based on a number of years of research
actually<00:01:12.330> carried<00:01:12.840> out<00:01:12.960> at<00:01:13.140> MIT<00:01:13.470> Harvard

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
actually carried out at MIT Harvard

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.650 
actually carried out at MIT Harvard
where<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.730> product<00:01:15.240> was<00:01:15.420> developed

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
where the product was developed

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.320 
where the product was developed
initially<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.550> based<00:01:17.760> on<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> fact

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
initially and it is based on the fact

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.060 
initially and it is based on the fact
that<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.570> need<00:01:18.720> nutritional<00:01:19.260> elements<00:01:19.350> to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
that you need nutritional elements to

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.300 
that you need nutritional elements to
build<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.430> synapse<00:01:20.880> my<00:01:21.090> membrane<00:01:22.310> because

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
build up synapse my membrane because

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.430 
build up synapse my membrane because
synapse<00:01:23.760> dysfunction<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.720> very<00:01:25.200> very

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
synapse dysfunction is very very

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.260 
synapse dysfunction is very very
critical<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.130> Alzheimer's<00:01:26.640> disease<00:01:26.970> it's

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
critical to Alzheimer's disease it's

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.110 
critical to Alzheimer's disease it's
actually<00:01:27.510> critical<00:01:28.050> to<00:01:28.410> cause<00:01:29.400> symptoms<00:01:29.730> and

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
actually critical to cause symptoms and

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.970 
actually critical to cause symptoms and
Alzheimer's<00:01:30.570> disease<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.140> not<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.620> amyloid

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
Alzheimer's disease it's not the amyloid

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.010 
Alzheimer's disease it's not the amyloid
load<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.580> causes<00:01:32.970> memory<00:01:33.150> problem<00:01:33.660> it's<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
load that causes memory problem it's the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.750 
load that causes memory problem it's the
loss<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.350> sign<00:01:34.620> abscess<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.520> loss<00:01:35.640> of

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
loss of sign abscess and the loss of

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.790 
loss of sign abscess and the loss of
neurons<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.270> does<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.080> then<00:01:37.590> there<00:01:37.770> are

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
neurons that does so and then there are

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.320 
neurons that does so and then there are
many<00:01:38.010> studies<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.610> which<00:01:38.760> you<00:01:38.910> see<00:01:39.120> on<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
many studies of which you see on the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.780 
many studies of which you see on the
left<00:01:39.510> hand<00:01:39.780> side<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.320> already<00:01:40.650> an<00:01:40.860> MCI<00:01:41.220> the

left hand side that already an MCI the
number<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.150> synapses<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.990> down<00:01:43.260> and<00:01:43.590> in

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
number of synapses is down and in

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.460 
number of synapses is down and in
Alzheimer's<00:01:44.370> disease<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.910> down<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:46.110> forty

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
Alzheimer's disease it's down to forty

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.620 
Alzheimer's disease it's down to forty
four<00:01:46.680> percent<00:01:46.710> actually<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.240> look<00:01:48.270> at<00:01:48.510> the

four percent actually if you look at the
writers<00:01:49.050> is<00:01:49.260> this<00:01:49.470> figure<00:01:49.800> that<00:01:49.830> you<00:01:50.130> see<00:01:50.340> all

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

works on memory in a three month trial
only<00:03:23.310> already<00:03:24.060> then<00:03:24.660> let's<00:03:24.870> see<00:03:25.050> whether<00:03:25.290> it's

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
only already then let's see whether it's

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.950 
only already then let's see whether it's
extends<00:03:26.190> into<00:03:26.340> six<00:03:26.820> months<00:03:27.150> trial<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.660> also<00:03:27.930> a

now<00:03:57.210> is<00:03:57.450> basically<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.230> same<00:03:58.260> as<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.740> souvenir

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
now is basically the same as a souvenir

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.730 
now is basically the same as a souvenir

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
open-label study and there was a very

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.390 
open-label study and there was a very
high<00:04:51.390> product<00:04:51.900> appreciation<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:53.070> overall

high product appreciation the overall

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.520 
high product appreciation the overall
compliance<00:04:53.790> in<00:04:54.180> Suva<00:04:54.540> need<00:04:54.660> to<00:04:54.870> study<00:04:55.140> and<00:04:55.410> the

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
compliance in Suva need to study and the

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.950 
compliance in Suva need to study and the
end<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.860> open-label<00:04:56.280> was<00:04:56.790> in<00:04:57.000> up<00:04:57.270> in<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.540> 90s

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
end the open-label was in up in the 90s

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.900 
end the open-label was in up in the 90s
so<00:04:58.200> people<00:04:58.530> really<00:04:58.710> liked<00:04:59.040> it<00:04:59.190> and<00:04:59.370> stayed<00:04:59.700> on

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
so people really liked it and stayed on

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.780 
so people really liked it and stayed on
the<00:05:00.030> product<00:05:00.420> for<00:05:00.600> the<00:05:00.720> whole<00:05:00.870> time<00:05:01.640> this<00:05:02.640> is

the primary endpoint memory as you can
see<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.400> same<00:05:05.640> as<00:05:05.820> in<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:05.970> previous<00:05:06.180> talk

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630

which<00:05:25.590> is<00:05:25.860> just<00:05:26.370> barely<00:05:26.790> not<00:05:27.060> significant<00:05:27.660> but

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
which is just barely not significant but

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.680 
which is just barely not significant but
it's<00:05:28.110> my<00:05:28.290> mainly<00:05:28.590> driven<00:05:28.770> by<00:05:28.950> the<00:05:29.100> memory

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
it's my mainly driven by the memory

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.810 
it's my mainly driven by the memory
component<00:05:30.690> of<00:05:30.810> it<00:05:30.930> this<00:05:31.890> is<00:05:32.070> the<00:05:32.190> open-label

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
component of it this is the open-label

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.150 
component of it this is the open-label
extension<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:33.810> here<00:05:34.110> we<00:05:34.290> saw<00:05:34.470> exactly<00:05:34.860> what

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
extension and here we saw exactly what

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.690 
extension and here we saw exactly what
we<00:05:35.340> hoped<00:05:35.520> for<00:05:35.880> in<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.630> 24<00:05:37.140> to<00:05:37.290> 48<00:05:37.680> weeks<00:05:38.070> the

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
we hoped for in the 24 to 48 weeks the

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.210 
we hoped for in the 24 to 48 weeks the
memory<00:05:39.330> actually<00:05:39.720> even<00:05:40.020> improved<00:05:40.470> further<00:05:40.800> so

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
memory actually even improved further so

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.740 
memory actually even improved further so
there<00:05:41.310> was<00:05:41.430> no<00:05:41.610> ceiling<00:05:42.120> effect<00:05:42.240> on<00:05:42.630> this

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
there was no ceiling effect on this

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.360 
there was no ceiling effect on this
memory<00:05:43.110> so<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.380> mild<00:05:43.620> patients<00:05:44.070> could<00:05:44.220> even

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
memory so the mild patients could even

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.820 
memory so the mild patients could even
improve<00:05:44.850> further<00:05:45.180> so<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:46.110> difference<00:05:46.320> in<00:05:46.740> the

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
improve further so the difference in the

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.820 
improve further so the difference in the
24<00:05:47.370> to<00:05:47.520> 48<00:05:47.910> weeks<00:05:48.240> is<00:05:48.480> again<00:05:48.810> in<00:05:49.020> the<00:05:49.440> active

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
24 to 48 weeks is again in the active

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.010 
24 to 48 weeks is again in the active
group<00:05:50.070> that<00:05:50.280> stayed<00:05:50.580> on<00:05:50.760> active<00:05:51.150> again<00:05:51.810> was

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
group that stayed on active again was

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.750 
group that stayed on active again was
significant<00:05:52.830> and<00:05:53.010> the<00:05:53.190> ones<00:05:53.340> who<00:05:53.490> were<00:05:53.610> on

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
significant and the ones who were on

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.370 
significant and the ones who were on
placebo<00:05:54.210> in<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.420> first<00:05:54.660> part<00:05:54.960> of<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.170> study

made<00:05:58.230> the<00:05:58.350> jump<00:05:58.560> also<00:05:58.950> improve<00:05:59.340> memory<00:05:59.580> and<00:05:59.940> it

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
made the jump also improve memory and it

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.890 
made the jump also improve memory and it
is<00:06:00.150> again<00:06:00.420> significant<00:06:02.090> so<00:06:03.090> how<00:06:03.300> to<00:06:03.360> conclude

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
is again significant so how to conclude

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.560 
is again significant so how to conclude
