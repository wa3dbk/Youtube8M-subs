00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.190
 it's never a lesson is the combination of a numeric keyboard and so I went 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.059
 insert the broadcast time 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.069
 Nokia claims that you can come up with a device musically add up mgs 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:19.619
 The question is whether the storm is fulfilling all those promises and if so 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.890
 worth 60 euros 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.250
 I swallow that his time 9 after 78 just and is very busy 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.769
 the back is made of aluminum 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.550
 and the design takes some getting used to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.590
 the device has gone in nissan at home that said pretty good you can and quickly 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.390
 easily press key and it responds 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.460
 seeing people is 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.480
 That is pretty important because a small time screenings 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.190
 the kibet has room for the svm it takes some getting used to but if you don't do it 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.740
 is in the netherlands with the client then one can call and send SMS ns with 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.460
 that can also be via the shortcut how you go straight to the iq of a message 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.450
 and i'm working fine there too 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.240
 on the back of the first details and during a five megapixel camera 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.370
 without vs and asia 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.860
 the 5 megapixel camera there expect good photos 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.180
 that is actually quite against x series of nokia and mainly consists of 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.180
 music phones this phone would therefore be the ultimate phone for the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.300
 Must be a music lover you are also having fun navigating via kibet 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.829
 afterwards it is army 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.350
 and now it is most important for a better world 7 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.490
 yes it works but if that is for the true music lover good address that is the 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.640
 ask 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.450
 important with a music phone is that you can have much happier ones there 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.460
 it comes standard with two gigabyte micro sd card with device I am the end 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.610
 lead to 16 gigabytes 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.400
 for music lovers 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.070
 but also for other people 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.820
 has the device and very funny element and that is the dunes 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.680
 the telegraaf reports that 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 not posted 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.110
 that's what that means 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.349
 You can register via a 3G or WiFi connection 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.219
 we are therefore not very fast 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.119
 a small disadvantage is the small timetable 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.019
 m what you get keyboard 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.419
 the design of a nut ex vitesse dike is beautiful but the interaction 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.779
 between the timetable and I am here, I am not really up to par 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.999
 With the basic version working on the device you can make good calls and send text messages 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.389
 you also have a letter to play music 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.369
 the device costs 169 euros I think you can buy the same for much less money 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:45.749
 basic functions
