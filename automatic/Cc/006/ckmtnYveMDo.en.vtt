00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
last year I was or this year I was close

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.410 
last year I was or this year I was close
against<00:01:17.009> Murray<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.520> semis<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.330> know

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
against Murray in the semis and you know

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.999 
against Murray in the semis and you know
I<00:01:18.450> had<00:01:18.659> tough<00:01:18.930> one<00:01:19.170> against<00:01:19.470> strong<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
I had tough one against strong in the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.880 
I had tough one against strong in the
quarters<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:21.420> not<00:01:21.930> satisfied<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.860> I

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
quarters so I was not satisfied but I

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.730 
quarters so I was not satisfied but I
think<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.490> was<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> good<00:01:23.790> event<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.270> know<00:01:24.390> and

think it was a good event you know and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.109 
think it was a good event you know and
two<00:01:25.740> players<00:01:26.009> played<00:01:26.280> each<00:01:26.400> other<00:01:26.610> or<00:01:26.850> maybe

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
two players played each other or maybe

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.789 
two players played each other or maybe
more<00:01:27.420> players<00:01:27.750> who<00:01:27.960> were<00:01:28.080> at<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.470> playing

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
really well that moment and only two

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.710 
really well that moment and only two
guys<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.560> make<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> finals<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:33.570> he

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.649 
guys can make it to the finals so and he
deserved<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.229> more<00:01:34.350> than<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.590> did<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.070> then

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
deserved it more than I did and then

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.140 
deserved it more than I did and then
clearly<00:01:36.659> Wimbledon<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.380> US<00:01:37.439> Open<00:01:38.150> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
clearly Wimbledon and the US Open the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.819 
clearly Wimbledon and the US Open the
longer<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> year<00:01:39.990> went<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.470> more<00:01:40.619> difficult

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
longer the year went the more difficult

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.679 
longer the year went the more difficult
it<00:01:41.159> became<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:41.700> me<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.119> that's<00:01:42.329> not<00:01:42.509> when<00:01:42.659> I

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
it became for me so that's not when I

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.179 
it became for me so that's not when I
had<00:01:42.840> aspirations<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:43.799> make<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
had aspirations to really make the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.030 
had aspirations to really make the
finals<00:01:44.549> anymore<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.780> French<00:01:46.020> Open<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.710> thought

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
finals anymore the French Open I thought

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.830 
finals anymore the French Open I thought
I<00:01:47.070> had<00:01:47.490> an<00:01:47.610> opportunity<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:48.420> that's<00:01:48.600> when

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
I had an opportunity but that's when

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.020 
I had an opportunity but that's when
things<00:01:49.049> started<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.439> go<00:01:49.649> get<00:01:50.310> worse<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.880> know

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
things started to go get worse you know

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.940 
things started to go get worse you know
against<00:01:51.600> Tsonga<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.990> didn't<00:01:52.229> play<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> very<00:01:52.770> good

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
against Tsonga I didn't play a very good

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.620 
against Tsonga I didn't play a very good
match<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.670> could<00:01:54.090> sense<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.479> something

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
match and I could sense that something

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.600 
match and I could sense that something
was<00:01:54.990> wrong<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.290> my<00:01:55.500> game<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:56.100> was<00:01:56.369> lacking

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
was wrong in my game I was lacking

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.580 
was wrong in my game I was lacking
practice<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.329> was<00:01:57.450> lacking<00:01:57.659> matches<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.259> was

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
practice I was lacking matches I was

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.160 
practice I was lacking matches I was
lacking<00:01:58.799> just<00:01:59.159> the<00:02:00.060> fitness<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.600> guess<00:02:00.840> just

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
lacking just the fitness I guess just

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.020 
lacking just the fitness I guess just
because<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.799> setbacks<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.340> had<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.000> so

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
because of all the setbacks I had and so

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.920 
because of all the setbacks I had and so
then<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.610> but<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.149> know<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> team<00:02:06.630> and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
then you but in you know the team and

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.990 
then you but in you know the team and
myself<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.560> also<00:02:07.710> knew<00:02:08.009> realistically<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.819> we

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
myself I also knew realistically like we

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.850 
myself I also knew realistically like we
can<00:02:09.209> aim<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:09.720> winning<00:02:10.110> grand<00:02:10.349> slams<00:02:10.619> right

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
can aim for winning grand slams right

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.770 
can aim for winning grand slams right
away<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.160> that's<00:02:11.550> why<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:12.390> was<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> more

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
away so that's why it was a more

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.690 
away so that's why it was a more
difficult<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.290> challenge

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
difficult and challenge

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.300 
difficult and challenge
season<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.150> many<00:02:14.330> ways<00:02:14.569> but<00:02:14.930> I'm<00:02:15.319> happy<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.860> got

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
season in many ways but I'm happy I got

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.869 
season in many ways but I'm happy I got
out<00:02:16.459> of<00:02:16.580> it

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
out of it

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.880 
out of it
okay<00:02:17.270> I<00:02:17.450> still<00:02:17.629> finished<00:02:17.989> six<00:02:18.470> in<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.680> world

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
okay I still finished six in the world

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.860 
okay I still finished six in the world
which<00:02:19.129> is<00:02:19.250> unbelievable<00:02:19.760> for<00:02:19.970> me<00:02:20.090> after<00:02:20.540> all

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
which is unbelievable for me after all

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.290 
which is unbelievable for me after all
the<00:02:20.959> problems<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.349> had<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.800> now<00:02:22.519> hopefully

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
the problems I had and now hopefully

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.240 
the problems I had and now hopefully

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
don't go so well what's gonna be the

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.170 
don't go so well what's gonna be the
situation<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:37.310> know<00:02:37.430> tennis<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.000> very

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
situation you know tennis is very

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.809 
situation you know tennis is very
important<00:02:38.660> but<00:02:38.840> it's<00:02:38.959> not<00:02:39.050> everything

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
important but it's not everything

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.860 
important but it's not everything
especially<00:02:40.819> your<00:02:40.970> family<00:02:41.150> realized<00:02:41.720> that

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
especially your family realized that

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.380 
especially your family realized that
anyways<00:02:42.230> laters<00:02:43.040> then<00:02:43.250> but<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:43.940> always<00:02:44.209> had<00:02:44.360> a

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
anyways laters then but I always had a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.600 
anyways laters then but I always had a
good<00:02:44.450> perspective<00:02:44.810> for<00:02:45.620> things<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.130> that's

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
good perspective for things and that's

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.640 
good perspective for things and that's
why<00:02:46.819> actually<00:02:47.030> as<00:02:47.599> crazy<00:02:47.959> as<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.200> might<00:02:48.410> sound

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
why actually as crazy as it might sound

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.620 
why actually as crazy as it might sound
I<00:02:48.890> actually<00:02:49.010> quite<00:02:49.310> enjoyed<00:02:49.370> this<00:02:50.030> this<00:02:50.360> year

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
I actually quite enjoyed this this year

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.020 
I actually quite enjoyed this this year
with<00:02:51.140> all<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.470> setbacks<00:02:51.890> I<00:02:52.250> had<00:02:52.489> trying<00:02:52.910> to

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
with all the setbacks I had trying to

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.509 
with all the setbacks I had trying to
find<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.299> way<00:02:53.420> out<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:55.190> most<00:02:55.370> difficult

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
find a way out of it the most difficult

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.430 
find a way out of it the most difficult
part<00:02:55.819> was<00:02:56.150> when<00:02:56.299> I<00:02:56.329> didn't<00:02:56.630> quite<00:02:56.959> know<00:02:57.200> how<00:02:57.410> I

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
part was when I didn't quite know how I

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.050 
part was when I didn't quite know how I
was<00:02:57.680> gonna<00:02:57.769> get<00:02:58.010> out<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.610> know<00:02:58.819> from

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
was gonna get out of it you know from

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.880 
was gonna get out of it you know from
those<00:02:59.420> select<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.900> few<00:03:00.170> days<00:03:00.349> or<00:03:00.560> maybe<00:03:00.590> a

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
those select a few days or maybe a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.069 
those select a few days or maybe a
couple<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.190> weeks<00:03:01.370> where<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.150> was<00:03:02.329> like<00:03:02.510> jeez<00:03:02.989> I

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
couple of weeks where I was like jeez I

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.130 
couple of weeks where I was like jeez I
don't<00:03:03.260> know<00:03:03.349> exactly<00:03:04.099> what<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.400> do<00:03:04.549> yet<00:03:04.819> but

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
don't know exactly what to do yet but

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.569 
don't know exactly what to do yet but
let's<00:03:06.140> just<00:03:06.380> be<00:03:06.590> patient<00:03:07.069> here<00:03:07.280> let's<00:03:07.459> keep

working<00:03:07.910> hard<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.329> hopefully<00:03:08.510> success<00:03:09.049> is

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
working hard and hopefully success is

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.500 
working hard and hopefully success is
going<00:03:09.319> to<00:03:09.380> come<00:03:09.560> back<00:03:09.739> so<00:03:10.040> that's<00:03:10.819> where<00:03:11.090> the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
going to come back so that's where the

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.660 
going to come back so that's where the
season<00:03:11.810> was<00:03:11.959> difficult<00:03:12.470> at<00:03:12.560> times<00:03:12.590> but<00:03:13.160> again

I've had so many incredible seasons in a

I've had so many incredible seasons in a
row<00:03:16.430> that<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.510> season<00:03:18.290> like<00:03:18.380> that<00:03:18.590> this<00:03:18.829> is<00:03:19.130> okay
