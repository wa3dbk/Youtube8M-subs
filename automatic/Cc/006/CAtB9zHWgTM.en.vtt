vampires<00:00:00.719> are<00:00:00.989> able<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.260> achieve<00:00:01.439> immortality

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
vampires are able to achieve immortality

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.579 
vampires are able to achieve immortality
by<00:00:02.879> feeding<00:00:03.210> off<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.600> blood<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:04.049> others<00:00:04.350> in

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
by feeding off the blood of others in

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.590 
by feeding off the blood of others in
real<00:00:05.310> life<00:00:05.520> there's<00:00:05.910> no<00:00:06.089> such<00:00:06.299> thing<00:00:06.569> as

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
real life there's no such thing as

vampires<00:00:06.830> sure<00:00:07.830> there<00:00:08.069> are<00:00:08.220> vampire<00:00:09.000> bats<00:00:09.030> and

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
vampires sure there are vampire bats and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.749 
vampires sure there are vampire bats and
parasites<00:00:10.260> but<00:00:10.500> they're<00:00:10.980> simply<00:00:11.400> gaining

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
parasites but they're simply gaining

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.910 
parasites but they're simply gaining
sustenance<00:00:12.599> from<00:00:12.780> blood<00:00:13.110> they're<00:00:13.650> still

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
sustenance from blood they're still

sustenance from blood they're still
aging<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.670> will<00:00:14.910> eventually<00:00:15.480> die<00:00:15.770> growing

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
aging and will eventually die growing

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.250 
aging and will eventually die growing
younger<00:00:17.340> by<00:00:17.760> draining<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.630> blood<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.990> others

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
younger by draining the blood of others

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.050 
younger by draining the blood of others
is<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:19.529> something<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.220> comic<00:00:20.640> books<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
is just something in comic books and

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.439 
is just something in comic books and
movies<00:00:21.619> or<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:25.130> I'm<00:00:26.130> rusty<00:00:26.609> Ward<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.090> I

movies or is it I'm rusty Ward and I
want<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.750> suck<00:00:27.960> your<00:00:28.109> blood<00:00:28.340> let<00:00:29.340> me<00:00:29.460> clarify<00:00:29.670> I

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
want to suck your blood let me clarify I

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.330 
want to suck your blood let me clarify I
don't<00:00:30.390> need<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.630> suck<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.619> need<00:00:31.859> to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
don't need to suck it I just need to

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.940 
don't need to suck it I just need to
stitch<00:00:32.700> your<00:00:33.210> skin<00:00:33.630> together<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:34.260> mine<00:00:34.530> so

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
stitch your skin together with mine so

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.709 
stitch your skin together with mine so
that<00:00:35.100> our<00:00:35.219> blood<00:00:35.520> vessels<00:00:35.940> grow<00:00:36.180> together<00:00:36.360> and

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
that our blood vessels grow together and

and what he found was the cartilage of
the<00:01:00.270> older<00:01:00.719> rat<00:01:00.899> became<00:01:01.320> healthier<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.160> more

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the older rat became healthier and more

find out exactly what was happening when

find out exactly what was happening when
they<00:01:14.100> combine<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.580> circulatory<00:01:15.000> systems<00:01:15.780> of

they combine the circulatory systems of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.649 
they combine the circulatory systems of
old<00:01:16.259> mice<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:16.979> those<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.640> young<00:01:17.880> mice<00:01:18.119> they

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
old mice with those of young mice they

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.020 
old mice with those of young mice they
again<00:01:18.960> observed<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.979> old<00:01:20.220> mice<00:01:20.610> healed

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
again observed that the old mice healed

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.270 
again observed that the old mice healed
at<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> same<00:01:21.509> rate<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> young<00:01:22.140> mice<00:01:22.380> did<00:01:22.619> but

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
at the same rate the young mice did but

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.149 
at the same rate the young mice did but
they<00:01:23.700> also<00:01:24.000> found<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.200> young<00:01:25.590> mice<00:01:25.860> were

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
they also found that the young mice were

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.850 
they also found that the young mice were
growing<00:01:26.610> prematurely<00:01:27.390> old<00:01:27.720> what<00:01:28.710> they

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
growing prematurely old what they

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.100 
growing prematurely old what they
discovered<00:01:29.520> was<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.030> old<00:01:30.240> mouse<00:01:30.630> was

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
discovered was the old mouse was

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.710 
discovered was the old mouse was
stealing<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> young<00:01:32.070> Mouse's<00:01:32.640> life<00:01:33.000> force<00:01:33.390> or

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
stealing the young Mouse's life force or

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.850 
stealing the young Mouse's life force or
a<00:01:34.369> more<00:01:35.369> technical<00:01:35.790> explanation<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
a more technical explanation is that the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.280 
a more technical explanation is that the
old<00:01:38.130> mouse<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.670> benefiting<00:01:39.299> from<00:01:39.570> compounds

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
old mouse was benefiting from compounds

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.350 
old mouse was benefiting from compounds
in<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.500> blood<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> young<00:01:41.159> mouse<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
in the blood of the young mouse the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.960 
in the blood of the young mouse the
compounds<00:01:43.049> woke<00:01:43.649> up<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.070> stem<00:01:44.310> cells<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
compounds woke up the stem cells in the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.760 
compounds woke up the stem cells in the
old<00:01:45.119> mices<00:01:45.600> bodies<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.320> were<00:01:46.409> previously

what<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.829> do<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.520> turns<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.630> an<00:01:51.780> organism

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
what to do it turns out as an organism

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.950 
what to do it turns out as an organism
