global<00:05:27.610> pop<00:05:27.880> phenomenon<00:05:28.360> and<00:05:28.840> to<00:05:29.469> me<00:05:29.620> it<00:05:29.800> just

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
global pop phenomenon and to me it just

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.240 
global pop phenomenon and to me it just
it<00:05:30.400> ruins<00:05:30.969> the<00:05:31.150> whole<00:05:31.180> thing<00:05:31.599> so<00:05:32.349> that's<00:05:32.919> my

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
it ruins the whole thing so that's my

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.629 
it ruins the whole thing so that's my
opinion<00:05:33.669> on<00:05:34.000> it<00:05:34.210> I'll<00:05:34.360> be<00:05:35.080> glad<00:05:35.320> to<00:05:35.919> hear<00:05:36.610> what

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
opinion on it I'll be glad to hear what
