drawing<00:00:08.099> your<00:00:08.280> face<00:00:08.309> side<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.030> edge<00:00:09.179> marks<00:00:09.630> is

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
drawing your face side and edge marks is

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.660 
drawing your face side and edge marks is
the<00:00:09.870> first<00:00:10.230> thing<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.469> do<00:00:10.740> when<00:00:11.099> marking<00:00:11.519> out

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
the first thing to do when marking out

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.620 
the first thing to do when marking out
any<00:00:11.940> joinery<00:00:12.509> items<00:00:14.059> this<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.179> what<00:00:15.330> they<00:00:15.450> look

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
any joinery items this is what they look

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.500 
any joinery items this is what they look
like<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:16.650> pig's<00:00:16.920> tail<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.550> face<00:00:17.910> mark<00:00:18.270> and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
like the pig's tail is the face mark and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:32.810 
like the pig's tail is the face mark and
the<00:00:18.660> V<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.289> edge<00:00:19.410> mark<00:00:31.579> let's<00:00:32.579> take<00:00:32.790> a

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the V is the edge mark let's take a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.060 
the V is the edge mark let's take a
simple<00:00:33.210> frame<00:00:33.480> like<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.290> see<00:00:34.739> why<00:00:35.040> we

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
simple frame like this and see why we

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:47.230 
simple frame like this and see why we
need<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.520> draw<00:00:35.790> face<00:00:36.180> side<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.750> edge<00:00:36.899> marks

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.600 

these<00:00:48.240> marks<00:00:48.750> indicate<00:00:49.380> the<00:00:49.710> best<00:00:49.950> face<00:00:50.280> and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
these marks indicate the best face and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.090 
these marks indicate the best face and
edge<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.390> timber<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.830> good<00:00:53.040> look

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
edge on the timber so have a good look

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.729 
edge on the timber so have a good look
at<00:00:53.370> your<00:00:53.460> materials<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.390> decide<00:00:55.080> which<00:00:55.380> side

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
at your materials and decide which side

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.330 
at your materials and decide which side
is<00:00:56.070> preferred<00:00:56.580> not<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.000> see<00:00:57.680> this<00:00:58.680> enables<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
is preferred not to see this enables you

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:27.649 
is preferred not to see this enables you
to<00:00:59.370> hide<00:00:59.730> an<00:00:59.910> ugly<00:01:00.210> knot<00:01:00.420> or<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> timber<00:01:01.290> defect

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.539 

on<00:01:28.659> all<00:01:28.869> joinery<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.710> edge<00:01:29.860> marks<00:01:30.310> face

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
on all joinery the edge marks face

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.410 
on all joinery the edge marks face
inwards<00:01:31.090> towards<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.600> center

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.780 

this<00:01:35.350> helps<00:01:35.710> you<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:35.890> assemble<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.520> frame

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
this helps you to assemble the frame

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.910 
this helps you to assemble the frame
because<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.450> can<00:01:37.600> tell<00:01:37.840> which<00:01:38.049> way<00:01:38.259> round<00:01:38.560> the

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
because you can tell which way round the

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.200 
because you can tell which way round the
individual<00:01:39.520> parts<00:01:39.880> go

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.399 

this<00:01:46.210> is<00:01:46.329> the<00:01:46.450> face<00:01:46.630> mark<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.509> this<00:01:50.170> is<00:01:50.289> the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
this is the face mark and this is the

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.770 
this is the face mark and this is the
edge<00:01:50.560> mark

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.870 

the<00:01:58.780> stocks<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.470> any<00:01:59.680> marking<00:02:00.160> tools<00:02:00.430> should

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
the stocks of any marking tools should

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.240 
the stocks of any marking tools should
always<00:02:01.180> be<00:02:01.540> in<00:02:01.720> contact<00:02:01.960> with<00:02:02.860> either<00:02:03.040> the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
always be in contact with either the

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.940 
always be in contact with either the
face<00:02:03.520> side<00:02:03.820> or<00:02:04.210> edge<00:02:04.510> during<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.440> marking<00:02:05.830> out

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
face side or edge during the marking out

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.719 
face side or edge during the marking out
process<00:02:08.009> look<00:02:09.009> at<00:02:09.070> the<00:02:09.190> position<00:02:09.580> of<00:02:09.670> the

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
process look at the position of the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.130 
process look at the position of the
stock<00:02:10.119> of<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.390> square

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
stock of the square

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.010 
stock of the square
during<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.590> marking<00:02:11.950> out<00:02:12.210> it's<00:02:13.210> always<00:02:13.780> on<00:02:13.990> a

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
during the marking out it's always on a

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:26.569 
during the marking out it's always on a
side<00:02:14.350> with<00:02:14.710> a<00:02:14.740> pencil<00:02:14.980> mark

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.670 

if<00:02:27.579> you<00:02:27.790> always<00:02:27.999> observe<00:02:28.510> this<00:02:28.749> rule<00:02:29.049> the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
if you always observe this rule the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.949 
if you always observe this rule the
lines<00:02:29.950> will<00:02:30.219> meet<00:02:30.400> up<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.030> your<00:02:31.299> frame<00:02:31.599> will

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
lines will meet up and your frame will

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:51.230 
lines will meet up and your frame will
be<00:02:31.989> square

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.970 

this<00:02:52.240> is<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.480> show<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.780> what<00:02:53.200> happens<00:02:53.680> if<00:02:53.800> you

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
this is to show you what happens if you

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.130 
this is to show you what happens if you
simply<00:02:54.490> rotate<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:54.940> timber<00:02:55.569> as<00:02:55.870> you're

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
simply rotate the timber as you're

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.380 
simply rotate the timber as you're
marking<00:02:56.530> out<00:02:59.250> just<00:03:00.250> marking<00:03:00.700> round<00:03:01.000> in<00:03:01.300> the

marking out just marking round in the
same<00:03:01.600> direction<00:03:01.810> will<00:03:02.470> create<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:02.830> step<00:03:03.280> in<00:03:03.490> the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
same direction will create a step in the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.240 
same direction will create a step in the
lines

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250
