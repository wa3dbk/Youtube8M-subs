00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.160
 Super fast pizza 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.680
 No need for blender food processor and easy to clean 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.900
 Crisp on the outside of this pizza 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.160
 The taste of the middle soft like bread 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.840
 Pizza + Italian Bread Two in One 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.140
 It’s easy to cook easily and quickly. 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.220
 Preheat oven 220-230C (general) or 200C (fan) 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.040
 Baking tray (about 30x20 cm) 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.760
 Use a full cream piece about 10-15g 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.360
 Put the baking tray in the oven for about 20 seconds 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.320
 Just to bake the plate hot and start to dissolve 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.440
 Spread the cream with a spoon 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.760
 It’s not true to make pizza with cream. 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.020
 But I don't like the smell of olive oil baked in high temperature. 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.720
 If you like, you can replace this cream with a spoonful of olive oil. 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.020
 Put aside 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.020
 250 grams of medium flour 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.600
 1 &amp; 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast powder 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.700
 Half teaspoon salt 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.720
 Half teaspoon of sugar (optional) 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.860
 Stir 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.500
 170 g (ml) lukewarm water 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.900
 Mix into dough 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.240
 In order to mix evenly, I like to push it away in the bowl. 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.360
 Then fold back 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.160
 It takes a few minutes to repeat it once or twice. 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.140
 I didn't plan to knead or send this dough. 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.120
 Sounds weird but will succeed! 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.580
 Very sticky and soft dough 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.860
 Put this on the plate 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.100
 a cream on the back of the spoon 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.700
 Shape the dough into neat points 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.320
 Turn over 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.100
 This way, this side is also oiled. 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.920
 Spread a large plastic wrap on top 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.740
 Press the dough open 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.660
 If the dough is not covered with oil, the plastic wrap will stick. 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.800
 I try to push it on average but it doesn't need to be perfect. 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.960
 Let me put a pizza sauce soon. 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.140
 "Tomato Mud" about two tablespoons 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.340
 It seems to be called "concentrated tomato paste" 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.360
 Plus a thinner tomato product 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.080
 Canned tomatoes or tomato sauce about one tablespoon 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.860
 a little salt 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.420
 Oregon / Oregano leaves (or other vanilla) 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.360
 a little olive oil (can be omitted) 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.480
 If you use canned tomatoes instead of ketchup and add a little sugar 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.700
 I reuse the bowl and spoon that I just cooked. 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.700
 Painted on the dough 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.440
 This is thicker than the prepared pasta 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.900
 I only put the cheddar cheese in the above material. 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.020
 You can also add other American sausages such as 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.380
 If you want to add vegetables such as green onions, don't put too much 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.020
 To avoid too wet 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.100
 Put in a preheated oven for 17-20 minutes 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.940
 Sprinkle some dried parsley (can be omitted) just add some color 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.080
 This is two or three 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.720
 With a vegetable salad is a delicious meal 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.360
 Thanks for watching! 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.660
