00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
to find them again when they respond and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.119 
to find them again when they respond and
usually<00:01:01.079> when<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.379> find<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.890> they're<00:01:02.039> not

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
usually when you find one they're not

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.650 
usually when you find one they're not
really<00:01:02.340> clumped<00:01:02.789> together<00:01:02.850> sometimes<00:01:03.539> they

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
really clumped together sometimes they

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.539 
really clumped together sometimes they
are<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> most<00:01:04.860> part<00:01:04.979> they<00:01:05.280> aren't

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
are but for the most part they aren't

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.580 
are but for the most part they aren't
and<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.330> find<00:01:06.540> one<00:01:06.780> say<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.350> five

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and if you find one say it's like five

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.020 
and if you find one say it's like five
feet<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.950> front<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> next<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.880> you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
feet in front of you the next one you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.070 
feet in front of you the next one you
could<00:01:09.150> probably<00:01:09.299> see<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:09.930> around

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
could probably see but it's around

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.230 
could probably see but it's around
twenty<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.500> thirty<00:01:10.799> feet<00:01:11.130> next<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> one

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
twenty to thirty feet next to the one

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.060 
twenty to thirty feet next to the one
that's<00:01:12.540> already<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:12.960> front<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.710> it's

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
that's already in front of you so it's

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.039 
that's already in front of you so it's
really<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:14.880> easy<00:01:14.909> if<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.420> range<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:15.900> if

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
really really easy if your range but if

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.450 
really really easy if your range but if

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.220 
minutes after and then 2 minutes after
that<00:02:43.579> I<00:02:43.790> got<00:02:43.969> the<00:02:44.090> super<00:02:44.420> another<00:02:44.810> super

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
that I got the super another super

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.770 
that I got the super another super
cooling<00:02:45.470> coolant<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.519> that<00:02:47.239> was<00:02:47.389> that<00:02:47.629> was

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
cooling coolant so that was that was

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.420 
cooling coolant so that was that was
pretty<00:02:47.810> good<00:02:48.139> I<00:02:48.200> was<00:02:48.470> really<00:02:48.980> surprised<00:02:49.340> that

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
pretty good I was really surprised that

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.710 
pretty good I was really surprised that
they<00:02:49.579> dropped<00:02:49.879> that<00:02:49.939> early<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.569> thought

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
they dropped that early and I thought

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.210 
they dropped that early and I thought
that<00:02:50.930> they<00:02:51.379> weren't<00:02:51.620> gonna<00:02:51.709> be<00:02:51.889> worth<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.189> lot

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
that they weren't gonna be worth a lot

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.220 
that they weren't gonna be worth a lot
and<00:02:52.609> the<00:02:53.030> super<00:02:53.329> cooling<00:02:53.540> pump<00:02:53.870> isn't<00:02:54.079> worth

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
and the super cooling pump isn't worth

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.929 
and the super cooling pump isn't worth
Allah<00:02:54.470> is<00:02:54.799> it's<00:02:54.980> only<00:02:55.099> worth<00:02:55.310> around<00:02:55.459> hundred

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:55.939 
Allah is it's only worth around hundred

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.280 
Allah is it's only worth around hundred
the<00:02:56.030> three<00:02:56.209> hundred<00:02:56.480> gold<00:02:56.659> at<00:02:56.870> least<00:02:57.109> that's

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
the three hundred gold at least that's

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.140 
the three hundred gold at least that's
how<00:02:57.349> it<00:02:57.469> is<00:02:57.680> on<00:02:57.799> my<00:02:57.889> server<00:02:58.129> so<00:02:58.790> that's<00:02:58.969> pretty

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
how it is on my server so that's pretty

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.509 
how it is on my server so that's pretty
much<00:02:59.239> chump<00:03:00.139> change<00:03:00.349> but<00:03:00.889> the<00:03:01.010> super<00:03:01.280> cooling

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
much chump change but the super cooling

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.849 
much chump change but the super cooling
cooling<00:03:01.819> it's<00:03:02.150> worth<00:03:02.329> around<00:03:02.510> two<00:03:03.019> K<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.290> 3<00:03:03.409> K

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
cooling it's worth around two K to 3 K

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.089 
cooling it's worth around two K to 3 K
or<00:03:04.099> 1.9<00:03:04.579> K<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:04.819> 3<00:03:04.909> K<00:03:05.180> so<00:03:05.689> that<00:03:06.530> that's<00:03:06.829> a<00:03:06.889> pretty

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
or 1.9 K to 3 K so that that's a pretty

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.979 
or 1.9 K to 3 K so that that's a pretty
good<00:03:07.280> amount<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.790> then<00:03:08.209> so<00:03:08.359> I<00:03:08.389> went<00:03:08.689> ahead<00:03:08.780> and

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
good amount and then so I went ahead and

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.990 
good amount and then so I went ahead and
I<00:03:09.260> took<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.560> break<00:03:09.829> because<00:03:10.069> there<00:03:10.459> was<00:03:10.549> there

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
I took a break because there was there

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.699 
I took a break because there was there
were<00:03:11.090> some<00:03:11.239> things<00:03:11.359> I<00:03:11.629> needed<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.959> tend<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.469> and

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
were some things I needed to tend to and

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.069 
were some things I needed to tend to and
I<00:03:12.790> came<00:03:13.790> back<00:03:13.819> and<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.239> decided<00:03:14.569> to<00:03:14.659> farm<00:03:14.870> for

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
I came back and I decided to farm for

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.349 
I came back and I decided to farm for
another<00:03:15.319> 30<00:03:15.980> minutes<00:03:16.310> or<00:03:16.430> so<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.729> by<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.209> way

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
another 30 minutes or so and by the way

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.509 
another 30 minutes or so and by the way
I<00:03:17.389> farmed<00:03:17.930> for<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.139> total<00:03:18.379> of<00:03:18.440> an<00:03:18.530> hour<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.919> so<00:03:19.489> I

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
I farmed for a total of an hour and so I

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.430 
I farmed for a total of an hour and so I
farmed<00:03:19.879> for<00:03:20.060> another<00:03:20.299> 30<00:03:20.569> minutes<00:03:20.930> or<00:03:21.049> so<00:03:21.079> and

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
farmed for another 30 minutes or so and

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.020 
farmed for another 30 minutes or so and
I<00:03:21.889> couldn't<00:03:22.220> believe<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.430> because<00:03:22.639> when<00:03:23.000> I

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
I couldn't believe it because when I

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.780 
I couldn't believe it because when I
went<00:03:23.540> back<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.840> farm<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:25.069> was<00:03:25.129> a<00:03:25.250> little<00:03:25.609> slow

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
went back to farm it was a little slow

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.360 
went back to farm it was a little slow
at<00:03:25.940> first<00:03:26.209> but<00:03:26.540> then<00:03:26.750> at<00:03:27.229> the<00:03:27.500> 20<00:03:28.040> minute

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
at first but then at the 20 minute

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
actually finished all of my farming at

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.140 
actually finished all of my farming at
the<00:03:59.389> end<00:03:59.540> I<00:03:59.720> got<00:04:00.409> 5<00:04:00.799> zom<00:04:01.310> struck<00:04:01.609> battle<00:04:01.939> pits

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
the end I got 5 zom struck battle pits

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.969 
the end I got 5 zom struck battle pits
so<00:04:02.359> that's<00:04:02.599> gonna<00:04:02.780> make<00:04:02.870> me<00:04:03.139> quite<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:03.650> few

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:03.979 
so that's gonna make me quite a few

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:05.770 
so that's gonna make me quite a few
amount<00:04:04.220> of<00:04:04.340> gold<00:04:04.609> especially<00:04:04.879> for<00:04:05.299> only<00:04:05.449> one

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
amount of gold especially for only one

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.839 
amount of gold especially for only one
hour<00:04:05.930> of<00:04:06.199> farming<00:04:06.590> that's<00:04:06.769> pretty<00:04:07.280> freakin

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
hour of farming that's pretty freakin

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.689 
hour of farming that's pretty freakin
nuts<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.599> so<00:04:09.139> I<00:04:09.169> was<00:04:09.439> really<00:04:10.069> really

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:10.699 
nuts and so I was really really

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.580 
nuts and so I was really really
impressed<00:04:10.939> with<00:04:11.389> this<00:04:11.509> farming<00:04:11.900> spot<00:04:12.169> usually

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
impressed with this farming spot usually

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.319 
impressed with this farming spot usually
I<00:04:12.620> don't<00:04:12.829> really<00:04:13.159> care<00:04:13.430> for<00:04:13.489> farming<00:04:14.030> spots

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
I don't really care for farming spots

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.149 
I don't really care for farming spots
but<00:04:14.569> this<00:04:14.750> spot<00:04:14.989> is<00:04:15.139> actually<00:04:15.620> really<00:04:15.889> good

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:16.159 
but this spot is actually really good

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:18.430 
but this spot is actually really good
however<00:04:16.609> if<00:04:17.030> you're<00:04:17.180> probably<00:04:17.419> on<00:04:17.659> a

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
however if you're probably on a

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.920 
however if you're probably on a
alliance<00:04:19.130> PI<00:04:19.370> server<00:04:19.759> where<00:04:20.359> like<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.750> ratio

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
alliance PI server where like the ratio

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.769 
alliance PI server where like the ratio
is<00:04:21.109> probably<00:04:21.469> 80<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:21.950> 20<00:04:22.250> or<00:04:22.580> 70<00:04:22.969> to<00:04:23.090> 30<00:04:23.210> with

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:23.779 
is probably 80 to 20 or 70 to 30 with

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:25.670 
is probably 80 to 20 or 70 to 30 with
the<00:04:23.930> higher<00:04:24.169> ratio<00:04:24.590> being<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:25.070> Alliance

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
the higher ratio being the Alliance

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.020 
the higher ratio being the Alliance
then<00:04:26.039> you're<00:04:26.220> probably<00:04:26.340> not<00:04:26.550> going<00:04:26.759> to<00:04:26.880> be

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
then you're probably not going to be

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.450 
then you're probably not going to be
doing<00:04:27.690> this<00:04:27.780> as<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:27.990> horde<00:04:28.350> unless<00:04:29.160> you<00:04:29.310> go

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
doing this as a horde unless you go

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.650 
doing this as a horde unless you go
ahead<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:29.910> farm<00:04:30.150> in<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.360> middle<00:04:30.539> of<00:04:30.600> the

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
ahead and farm in the middle of the

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.150 
ahead and farm in the middle of the
night<00:04:30.780> at<00:04:30.990> like<00:04:31.139> 3:00<00:04:31.440> a.m.<00:04:31.470> when<00:04:31.979> like

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
night at like 3:00 a.m. when like

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.159 
night at like 3:00 a.m. when like
everybody's<00:04:32.610> sleeping<00:04:32.789> but<00:04:33.449> regardless<00:04:33.810> it's

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
everybody's sleeping but regardless it's

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.170 
everybody's sleeping but regardless it's
a<00:04:34.350> really<00:04:34.919> good<00:04:35.070> place<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.430> farm<00:04:35.610> really<00:04:35.850> good

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
a really good place to farm really good

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.909 
a really good place to farm really good
I<00:04:36.210> really<00:04:36.419> like<00:04:36.660> this<00:04:36.780> place<00:04:36.960> but<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.770> only

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
I really like this place but the only

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.110 
I really like this place but the only
problem<00:04:38.280> is<00:04:38.340> though<00:04:38.580> is<00:04:38.699> that<00:04:38.820> you<00:04:38.910> have<00:04:39.000> to

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
problem is though is that you have to

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.810 
problem is though is that you have to
patrol<00:04:39.389> around<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.930> shore<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.370> islands

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
patrol around the shore and the islands

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.330 
patrol around the shore and the islands
because<00:04:42.210> again<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:43.530> creatures<00:04:43.949> are<00:04:44.100> pretty

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
because again the creatures are pretty

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.430 
because again the creatures are pretty
much<00:04:44.550> distant<00:04:45.120> when<00:04:45.300> they're<00:04:45.509> set<00:04:45.930> apart<00:04:46.199> from

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
much distant when they're set apart from

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.320 
much distant when they're set apart from
each<00:04:46.590> other<00:04:46.740> but<00:04:47.400> from<00:04:47.610> time<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.970> time<00:04:48.000> they

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
each other but from time to time they

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.120 
each other but from time to time they
actually<00:04:48.660> do<00:04:48.810> travel<00:04:49.169> in<00:04:49.229> packs<00:04:49.410> of<00:04:49.650> two<00:04:49.889> three

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
actually do travel in packs of two three

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.400 
actually do travel in packs of two three
four<00:04:50.550> or<00:04:50.699> maybe<00:04:50.820> even<00:04:51.210> five<00:04:51.509> and<00:04:51.780> as<00:04:52.110> you<00:04:52.259> guys
