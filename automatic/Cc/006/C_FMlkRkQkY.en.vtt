00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.789
 here is sixteen is not in France in Nancy I am in 2006 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.789
 it's approached through several videos what's called in the 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.579
 middle harmonica deposition 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.640
 all the examples will be played with a friendly detonique of 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.640
 grant hole 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.830
 so let's start with his mans jacket 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.250
 rahmani who tuned in two wheels 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.700
 contains all notes 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.600
 from the back range whether it's blowing inspiring 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.600
 so how does his presentation on your mini than his notes 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.300
 % blowing you have all blowing each other to monica you have 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.329
 the back but ground 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.240
 DOMISOL 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.240
 DOMISOL 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.310
 an aspirant is a little more complicated 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.370
 you have but this one 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.370
 ref to the ssii 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.860
 c reuters the position of m 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.890
 I want it to be in another video and why these notes are arranged 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.510
 so 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.990
 for the moment t 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.909
 it's important that harmonica contains all the notes of the back range 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.730
 we all learn at rugby school face ssii 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.780
 by the way this range of back could play it in the middle the harmonica 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.190
 starting with the number four hole blowing 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.310
 you will blow the 4l suck then passed between ios 5 the blown 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.380
 alas pirated 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.649
 do the same thing in six suffers and is inspired and when you go into 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.649
 this area do reverse sucked blow 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.360
 you will surely notice again by doing same scheme starting from the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.459
 brush flers 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.459
 you do not win 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:17.199
 you get dorignies 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.529
 only 6 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.950
 in other words you miss the lighthouse and the la to play the game back in the 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:23.799
 serious 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.729
 these two notes the famous we will get with the technique of 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.569
 operations it is a position of the jaw of the tongue for the purpose 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.989
 general position of the left 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.749
 who's going to get down notes we're going to play an example in the 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:38.749
 hole number 2 as for spir I have a single 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.059
 naturally now position in my tongue my jaw a little bit 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.999
 differently 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:45.039
 what is the subject of another video 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.929
 first of all I want to insert my half-time blood into them 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:49.999
 lower again 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.999
 half time to the lighthouse 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.219
 I need to complete the range of waters 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.219
 in hole # 3 deprive myself and so I 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:02.429
 I'm going down 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:05.429
 half-time then another half-tone to finish the month 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.170
 that I need for Madame de dos so if I want to work a little with a 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:15.079
 fault there 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.079
 I pulled the back range in the bass 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.129
 annabelle 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.849
 to return to the main theme of this video 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.829
 besides the game of positions know that if you play 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.470
 wholesale on your nintendo 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.589
 we call that the first position 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:38.029
 here is an example 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:41.469
 of a well-known American traditional piece 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:43.779
 play on a year to 10 42 euros 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.779
 this piece of course and so many others 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:54.459
 full mi 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.849
 m 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.629
 bingo 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.359
 percent 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.629
 an island 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.629
 10% 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.219
 the 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.289
 4 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.439
 no 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:20.120
 he 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.120
 who 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.490
 the 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:35.099
 I'm not there 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.110
 the minimum which 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.110
 m it's no 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.930
 the 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.939
 the 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:50.120
 line 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.460
 we live there 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.460
 the middle 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.580
 let's go now to the second position 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.039
 in fact it's about playing in the ground 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.219
 on your friend carlos it's good to play in a tone that is not the one 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:09.330
 of your handicap 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.919
 So you will have to find on your friendly and note tomorrow soil 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.150

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.479
 to give an example of the superimposition had played the same 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:19.740
 piece 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.550
 but this time 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.550
 I started on a baraka actor to blow 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.439
 I will start now inspired parades 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.979
 each was changed following only 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.859
 and here I will also have to use the technique of alterations 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.620
 the 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.620
 on the other hand, 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:57.589
 tears 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:00.599
 m 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.979

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:04.610
 varin 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.610
 in the order of 1% 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:11.279
 3 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:20.069
 you would have understood it 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:23.210
 the game of the second position in the Tour de France on a lake 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.900
 before working a little more it's the operation 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.039
 this text which is intended at the beginning 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.309
 but do not be discouraged by the results of autopsies 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:32.740
 should thereafter 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.240
 we clearly love this section 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.350
