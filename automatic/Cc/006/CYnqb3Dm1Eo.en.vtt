maybe<00:00:36.960> I'm<00:00:37.290> looking<00:00:37.559> at<00:00:37.800> our<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> think<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
maybe I'm looking at our I think it's a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.799 
maybe I'm looking at our I think it's a
combo<00:00:38.670> bass<00:00:38.879> amp<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.180> tenor<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:39.540> explain

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
combo bass amp a tenor you can explain

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:40.760 
combo bass amp a tenor you can explain
why<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.020> not<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.200> combo

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
why it's not a combo

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it new is there's a built-in power

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.490 
it new is there's a built-in power
amplifier<00:00:56.510> we've<00:00:57.510> taken<00:00:57.750> our<00:00:57.960> minimal<00:00:58.320> one

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
amplifier we've taken our minimal one

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.319 
amplifier we've taken our minimal one
amp<00:00:58.910> which<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> 1000<00:01:00.960> watt<00:01:01.050> amplifier<00:01:02.329> and

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
amp which is a 1000 watt amplifier and

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.270 
amp which is a 1000 watt amplifier and
installed<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.019> our<00:01:04.170> base<00:01:04.350> cabinets<00:01:04.650> and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
installed it in our base cabinets and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.200 
installed it in our base cabinets and
this<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.700> adds<00:01:06.000> only<00:01:06.240> six<00:01:06.600> pounds<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:08.210> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
this one adds only six pounds for the to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.170 
this one adds only six pounds for the to
the<00:01:09.360> weight<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> whole<00:01:09.960> cabinet<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:12.000> has

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.469 
the weight of the whole cabinet it has
an<00:01:12.360> XLR<00:01:12.840> input<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.939> made<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> take<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
an XLR input it's it's made to take a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.929 
an XLR input it's it's made to take a

or<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.920> actually<00:01:28.950> plug<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> guitar

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
or you can actually plug the guitar

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.300 
or you can actually plug the guitar
right<00:01:30.119> into<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> guitar<00:01:30.930> has<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.850> enough

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
right into it if the guitar has a enough

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.770 
right into it if the guitar has a enough
level<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.460> its<00:01:35.670> output<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.329> many<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
level on its output like many of the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.200 
level on its output like many of the
ones<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.140> power<00:01:37.290> supply<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.740> built<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.280> with

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
ones with power supply is built in with

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.719 
ones with power supply is built in with
batteries<00:01:40.200> or<00:01:40.590> some<00:01:41.009> other<00:01:41.159> scheme<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.610> get

batteries or some other scheme to get

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.940 
batteries or some other scheme to get
the<00:01:41.850> output<00:01:42.210> up<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.360> about<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.649> know<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:43.860> a

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
the output up to about you know it's a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.499 
the output up to about you know it's a
lie<00:01:44.130> almost<00:01:44.520> line<00:01:44.700> level<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.180> will<00:01:45.299> drive

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
lie almost line level that will drive

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.609 
lie almost line level that will drive
this<00:01:45.659> thing<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.649> full<00:01:46.829> power<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:48.530> would<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
this thing to full power so would you

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.080 
this thing to full power so would you
say<00:01:49.649> then<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.939> was

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
say then that this is a this was

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.139 
say then that this is a this was
designed<00:01:51.299> mainly<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.729> bassists<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:54.030> are

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
designed mainly for bassists that are

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.620 
designed mainly for bassists that are
running<00:01:54.630> active<00:01:55.229> fries<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.710> board<00:01:56.040> or<00:01:56.909> may<00:01:57.420> or

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
running active fries on board or may or

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.510 
running active fries on board or may or
other<00:01:57.810> types<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.290> different<00:01:59.130> output

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
other types of different output

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.560 
other types of different output
situations<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.180> that

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
situations like that

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
situations like that
yeah<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.990> new

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
yeah the new

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.349 
yeah the new
guitars<00:02:01.859> a<00:02:02.070> lot<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.460> them<00:02:02.579> have<00:02:02.759> active<00:02:02.969> freeze

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
guitars a lot of them have active freeze

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.230 
guitars a lot of them have active freeze
on<00:02:03.539> really<00:02:03.810> nice<00:02:03.960> tone<00:02:04.200> controls<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:04.859> you

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
on really nice tone controls so you

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.580 
on really nice tone controls so you
often<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.509> an<00:02:06.600> outboard<00:02:06.960> preamp<00:02:07.409> it's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
often have it an outboard preamp it's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.770 
often have it an outboard preamp it's
just<00:02:07.770> redundant<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.239> can<00:02:09.479> get<00:02:09.629> actually

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
just redundant so you can get actually

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.809 
just redundant so you can get actually
the<00:02:09.959> cleanest<00:02:10.500> lowest<00:02:10.979> noise<00:02:11.160> signal<00:02:11.640> coming

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
the cleanest lowest noise signal coming

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.479 
the cleanest lowest noise signal coming
right<00:02:12.030> out<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.360> bass<00:02:12.980> if<00:02:13.980> you've<00:02:14.190> got<00:02:14.370> an

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
right out of the bass if you've got an

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.250 
right out of the bass if you've got an
old<00:02:14.640> bass<00:02:14.819> with<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.239> passive<00:02:15.629> controls<00:02:16.050> or

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
old bass with this passive controls or

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.520 
old bass with this passive controls or
even<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.500> new<00:02:16.650> base<00:02:16.860> with<00:02:17.099> just<00:02:17.250> passive

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
even a new base with just passive

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.160 
even a new base with just passive
pickups<00:02:20.569> you'll<00:02:21.569> probably<00:02:21.720> want<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:21.989> use<00:02:22.049> a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
pickups you'll probably want to use a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.619 
pickups you'll probably want to use a
preamp<00:02:22.530> for<00:02:22.560> tone<00:02:22.830> control<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:24.120> also<00:02:24.239> sounds

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
preamp for tone control it also sounds

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.320 
preamp for tone control it also sounds
to<00:02:24.720> me<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.110> might<00:02:25.319> be<00:02:25.440> an<00:02:25.920> excellent<00:02:26.330> an

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
to me like this might be an excellent an

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.570 
to me like this might be an excellent an
excellent<00:02:27.720> choice<00:02:28.530> for<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.799> signal<00:02:29.160> path<00:02:29.310> for

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
excellent choice for a signal path for

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.820 
excellent choice for a signal path for
reamping<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.330> studio<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:31.560> if<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.769> were

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
reamping in the studio like if you were

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.620 
reamping in the studio like if you were
actually<00:02:32.010> like<00:02:32.400> taking<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.030> signal<00:02:33.299> back<00:02:33.420> out

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
actually like taking a signal back out

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.270 
actually like taking a signal back out
of<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.840> deck<00:02:34.170> yeah<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:34.769> could<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.010> come

of the deck yeah you could just come

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.910 
of the deck yeah you could just come
