today<00:00:23.610> we're<00:00:23.790> going<00:00:23.940> to<00:00:24.030> do<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.380> baseline<00:00:25.380> run

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
today we're going to do a baseline run

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.560 
today we're going to do a baseline run
on<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.910> came

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
on this as it came

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.750 
on this as it came
it's<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.590> no.5<00:00:29.660> 1200<00:00:30.660> XL<00:00:33.050> will<00:00:34.050> make<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> few

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
it's a no.5 1200 XL will make a few

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.550 
it's a no.5 1200 XL will make a few
beats<00:00:35.760> well<00:00:36.300> we've<00:00:36.540> already<00:00:36.810> heat<00:00:37.110> sink<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
beats well we've already heat sink the

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.650 
beats well we've already heat sink the
motor<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.580> now<00:00:38.760> we're<00:00:38.970> going<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.150> make<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> few

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
motor so now we're going to make a few

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.830 
motor so now we're going to make a few
passes<00:00:39.900> to<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.680> up<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:43.790> baseline<00:00:44.790> and<00:00:45.390> then<00:00:45.540> go

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
passes to get up a baseline and then go

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.290 
passes to get up a baseline and then go
out<00:00:46.110> be<00:00:46.980> changing<00:00:47.550> out<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> plugs<00:00:48.120> and

basically<00:04:52.580> what<00:04:52.790> you<00:04:52.970> want<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.300> do<00:04:53.480> is<00:04:54.080> find

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
basically what you want to do is find

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.220 
basically what you want to do is find
your<00:04:54.620> peak<00:04:54.920> of<00:04:55.160> where<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.580> were<00:04:55.760> before<00:04:56.230> and

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
your peak of where you were before and

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.640 
your peak of where you were before and
you<00:04:57.410> come<00:04:57.650> down<00:04:57.920> oh<00:04:58.220> five<00:04:58.820> ten<00:04:59.590> foot-pounds<00:05:00.590> of

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
you come down oh five ten foot-pounds of

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.290 
you come down oh five ten foot-pounds of
torque<00:05:00.710> and<00:05:01.130> you<00:05:01.220> draw<00:05:01.460> an<00:05:01.550> imaginary<00:05:01.670> line

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
torque and you draw an imaginary line

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.260 
torque and you draw an imaginary line
and<00:05:02.810> you<00:05:03.350> would<00:05:03.530> shade<00:05:03.830> that<00:05:04.070> in<00:05:04.340> and<00:05:04.580> that

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
and you would shade that in and that

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.620 
and you would shade that in and that
would<00:05:05.510> be<00:05:05.720> the<00:05:05.990> torque<00:05:06.380> peak<00:05:07.060> that<00:05:08.060> you<00:05:08.120> would

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
would be the torque peak that you would

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.450 
would be the torque peak that you would
feel<00:05:08.930> when<00:05:09.380> you're<00:05:09.530> riding<00:05:09.740> your<00:05:09.950> bike<00:05:10.130> that's

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
feel when you're riding your bike that's

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.290 
feel when you're riding your bike that's
where<00:05:10.760> it<00:05:11.300> feel<00:05:11.660> it's<00:05:12.160> where<00:05:13.160> hit<00:05:13.700> hard<00:05:14.000> and

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
where it feel it's where hit hard and

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.320 
where it feel it's where hit hard and
pull<00:05:14.570> hard<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.520> torque<00:05:16.520> what<00:05:16.790> you<00:05:16.970> would<00:05:17.120> do

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
pull hard and torque what you would do

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.080 
pull hard and torque what you would do
is<00:05:17.570> you'd<00:05:17.780> look<00:05:18.080> up<00:05:18.260> at<00:05:18.440> the<00:05:19.100> new<00:05:19.400> torque<00:05:19.760> curve

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
is you'd look up at the new torque curve

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.690 
is you'd look up at the new torque curve
and<00:05:20.419> then<00:05:21.230> you<00:05:21.440> would<00:05:21.650> come<00:05:21.919> down<00:05:21.950> to<00:05:22.460> where

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
and then you would come down to where

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.230 
and then you would come down to where
that<00:05:23.000> line<00:05:23.330> was<00:05:24.190> and<00:05:25.190> now<00:05:25.490> you<00:05:25.550> see<00:05:25.940> it<00:05:26.090> not

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
that line was and now you see it not

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.780 
that line was and now you see it not
only<00:05:26.540> comes<00:05:26.810> on<00:05:26.960> stronger<00:05:27.440> but<00:05:28.190> it<00:05:28.340> comes<00:05:28.580> on

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
only comes on stronger but it comes on

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.750 
only comes on stronger but it comes on
sooner<00:05:29.270> and<00:05:29.419> it<00:05:29.960> stays<00:05:30.260> on<00:05:30.500> longer<00:05:30.800> so<00:05:31.520> your

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
sooner and it stays on longer so your

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.020 
sooner and it stays on longer so your
torque<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.450> part<00:05:32.720> that<00:05:32.960> you<00:05:33.169> really<00:05:33.530> enjoy

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
torque the part that you really enjoy

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.360 
torque the part that you really enjoy
stays<00:05:35.030> on<00:05:35.390> a<00:05:35.750> lot<00:05:36.110> more<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:36.740> there's<00:05:37.130> a<00:05:37.190> lot

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
stays on a lot more and there's a lot

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.900 
stays on a lot more and there's a lot
more<00:05:37.580> powerful<00:05:38.060> and<00:05:38.660> that<00:05:39.160> relates<00:05:40.160> to<00:05:40.580> a

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
more powerful and that relates to a

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.880 
more powerful and that relates to a
little<00:05:41.300> more<00:05:41.450> enjoyment<00:05:41.840> in<00:05:42.200> the<00:05:42.290> saddle

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
little more enjoyment in the saddle

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.710 
little more enjoyment in the saddle
one<00:05:43.550> of<00:05:43.669> the<00:05:43.730> interesting<00:05:44.300> things<00:05:44.570> about

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
one of the interesting things about

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.640 
one of the interesting things about
these<00:05:45.530> bikes<00:05:45.890> is<00:05:46.990> that<00:05:47.990> they<00:05:48.860> produce<00:05:50.650> there's

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
these bikes is that they produce there's

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.620 
these bikes is that they produce there's
almost<00:05:51.919> a<00:05:52.220> supernatural<00:05:52.700> thing<00:05:53.180> about<00:05:53.419> them

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
almost a supernatural thing about them

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.470 
almost a supernatural thing about them
there's<00:05:53.930> a<00:05:54.100> sensitivity<00:05:55.100> tool<00:05:55.580> and<00:05:56.120> when

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
there's a sensitivity tool and when

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.230 
there's a sensitivity tool and when

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
to sense the idiosyncrasies the quirks

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.400
