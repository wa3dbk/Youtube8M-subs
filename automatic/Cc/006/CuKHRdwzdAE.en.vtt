leads are connected and the heat shrink

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.200 
leads are connected and the heat shrink
is<00:04:25.410> covering<00:04:25.949> the<00:04:26.039> connectors<00:04:26.430> it's<00:04:26.820> time<00:04:27.090> to

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
is covering the connectors it's time to

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:35.680 
is covering the connectors it's time to
add<00:04:27.330> some<00:04:27.360> heat

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690
