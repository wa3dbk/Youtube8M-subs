tripod<00:03:46.130> that<00:03:46.250> is<00:03:46.430> in<00:03:46.940> aluminium<00:03:47.180> so<00:03:47.930> aluminium

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
tripod that is in aluminium so aluminium

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.220 
tripod that is in aluminium so aluminium
tube<00:03:48.890> aluminium<00:03:49.460> casting<00:03:50.270> it<00:03:50.660> at<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.050> same

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
tube aluminium casting it at the same

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.260 
tube aluminium casting it at the same
time<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:51.860> this<00:03:52.070> is<00:03:52.310> very<00:03:52.640> important

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270
