attacker so you have enough time to get
away<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.620> safety<00:00:34.920> there's<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.730> lot<00:00:35.880> of

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
away to safety there's a lot of

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.280 
away to safety there's a lot of
differences<00:00:36.360> between<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:36.930> pepper

spray one of the main differences being

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.610 
spray one of the main differences being
that<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.510> powder<00:00:39.750> versus<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.260> liquid

pepper<00:00:41.489> spray<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.420> use<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.750> effectively<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
pepper spray to use it effectively it

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.080 
pepper spray to use it effectively it
has<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.770> get<00:00:43.890> particularly<00:00:44.399> right<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
has to get particularly right in the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.790 
has to get particularly right in the
eyes<00:00:45.239> or<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> face<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.350> nice<00:00:46.530> thing<00:00:46.770> about

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
eyes or the face the nice thing about

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.459 
eyes or the face the nice thing about
the<00:00:47.190> hot<00:00:47.370> shot<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.239> fans<00:00:48.840> out<00:00:49.110> into

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the hot shot is that it fans out into

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.049 
the hot shot is that it fans out into
about<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.649> 12<00:00:49.950> foot<00:00:50.100> cloud<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.579> starts<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.910> open

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
about a 12 foot cloud and starts to open

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.420 
about a 12 foot cloud and starts to open
up<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.719> particles<00:00:51.989> are<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> lot<00:00:52.500> finer<00:00:52.800> they're

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
up the particles are a lot finer they're

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.680 
up the particles are a lot finer they're
going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:53.789> into<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.180> lungs<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.539> lot

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
going to get into your lungs a lot

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.170 
going to get into your lungs a lot
quicker<00:00:54.899> into<00:00:55.410> your<00:00:55.530> eyes<00:00:55.680> what<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.579> does<00:00:56.789> is

quicker into your eyes what it does is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.270 
quicker into your eyes what it does is
it<00:00:57.480> makes<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.020> difficult<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.500> breathe<00:00:58.649> your

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
it makes it difficult to breathe your

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.310 
it makes it difficult to breathe your
eyes<00:00:59.460> slams<00:00:59.820> shut<00:01:00.120> immediately<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.079> can't

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
eyes slams shut immediately you can't

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.080 
eyes slams shut immediately you can't
see<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.309> gives<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.670> enough<00:01:02.820> time<00:01:03.030> to

once or multiple attackers at once the
cloud<00:01:20.460> will<00:01:20.700> start<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.060> fan<00:01:21.240> out<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.540> you'll

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
cloud will start to fan out as you'll

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.300 
cloud will start to fan out as you'll
see<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.020> minute<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.470> fire<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.710> pepper

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
see in a minute when we fire it pepper

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.670 
see in a minute when we fire it pepper
spray<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.759> really<00:01:24.060> designed<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:25.290> person

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
spray is really designed for one person

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.590 
spray is really designed for one person
it's<00:01:25.799> usually<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.189> stream<00:01:26.640> okay<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.479> much

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it's usually a stream okay so how much

secondary effect that'll start will let

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.100 
secondary effect that'll start will let
attacker<00:02:47.879> and<00:02:48.030> also<00:02:48.299> alert<00:02:48.540> other<00:02:48.720> people
