00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.059
 good black today we are going to install a 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.700

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.500
 lunatics pandora good first thing 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.009
 what they have to do then is turn off the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.009
 phone 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.350
 it does not turn off 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.260
 good and once turned off they light it with 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.260

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.250
 more pressed the volume key more 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.100
 and as we see has started in mode 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:10.500
 recovery the first thing we have to 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.500
 to do then is to make the waves 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.340
 and here we slide to the right 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.930
 and then we go back and we go to 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.850
 advanced in white and we put here says 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.850

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.520
 and we go back 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.869
 and then we go to where it says clue 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.869

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.190

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.550

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.050
 decision to make the right 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.890
 well I'm going to pose the video so that 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.780

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.890
