00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
and I think that so many Americans don't

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.550 
and I think that so many Americans don't
know<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.790> they<00:02:23.910> don't<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.080> you're

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
bringing voice to that and you know and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.190 
bringing voice to that and you know and
that's<00:02:29.580> one<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:29.940> reasons<00:02:30.300> why<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.540> wanted
