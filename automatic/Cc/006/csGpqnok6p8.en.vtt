00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
shot this will give you much better

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.080 
shot this will give you much better
control<00:01:04.019> over<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.379> park<00:01:04.619> during<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> shot<00:01:05.159> so

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
control over the park during the shot so

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.039 
control over the park during the shot so
next<00:01:06.270> we're<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.510> be<00:01:06.570> taking<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> look<00:01:06.990> at

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
next we're going to be taking a look at

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.060 
next we're going to be taking a look at
the<00:01:07.140> relation<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.560> where<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> puck<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:07.950> going

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the relation of where the puck is going

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.859 
the relation of where the puck is going
to<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:08.580> hockey<00:01:08.790> stance<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.689> there's

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
to be in your hockey stance now there's

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:10.850 
to be in your hockey stance now there's
a<00:01:09.930> lot<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.140> people<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.409> will<00:01:10.530> teach<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
a lot of people that will teach the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.020 
a lot of people that will teach the
slightly<00:01:11.130> differently<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:11.580> I'll<00:01:11.790> explain

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
slightly differently but I'll explain

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.490 
slightly differently but I'll explain
why<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> way<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:13.080> do<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
why we do it the way we do it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200 
why we do it the way we do it
I'd<00:01:13.890> recommend<00:01:14.280> having<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.729> puck<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> few

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
I'd recommend having the puck a few

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.910 
I'd recommend having the puck a few
inches<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.540> front<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.810> your<00:01:15.960> front<00:01:16.110> skate<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
inches in front of your front skate the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.230 
inches in front of your front skate the
reason<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.729> because<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:18.090> said

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
reason for that is because we said

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.609 
reason for that is because we said
earlier<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.720> video<00:01:18.840> all<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.409> power

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
earlier on in the video all of the power

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.320 
earlier on in the video all of the power
in<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.920> shot<00:01:20.159> comes<00:01:20.610> from<00:01:20.759> impacting<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
in this shot comes from impacting the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
in this shot comes from impacting the
ice<00:01:21.450> before<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.259> puck<00:01:22.500> getting<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> stick<00:01:23.159> to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
ice before the puck getting the stick to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.310 
ice before the puck getting the stick to
flex<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.820> onl<00:01:24.479> flex<00:01:24.630> generating<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> most

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
flex and onl flex generating the most

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.080 
flex and onl flex generating the most
power<00:01:25.650> out<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.979> shot<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
power out of this shot if you have the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.060 
power out of this shot if you have the
puck<00:01:27.360> further<00:01:27.780> back<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.140> your<00:01:28.259> stance<00:01:28.470> there

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
puck further back in your stance there

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.200 
puck further back in your stance there
isn't<00:01:29.310> enough<00:01:29.460> space<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.939> hit<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
isn't enough space for you to hit the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.460 
isn't enough space for you to hit the
ice<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.540> get<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> stick<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.020> flex<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
ice and get the stick to flex to

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.469 
ice and get the stick to flex to
generate<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> good<00:01:32.040> amount<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.310> power<00:01:32.520> from

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
generate a good amount of power from

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.490 
generate a good amount of power from
there<00:01:33.659> we're<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:34.020> taking<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> look<00:01:34.439> at

there we're going to be taking a look at

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.020 
there we're going to be taking a look at
the<00:01:34.590> windup<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.130> course<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.820> another

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the windup of course this is another

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.460 
the windup of course this is another
important<00:01:36.390> part<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> slap<00:01:36.900> shot<00:01:36.930> you

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
important part of the slap shot you

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.929 
important part of the slap shot you
don't<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.130> too<00:01:38.400> high<00:01:38.610> lifting

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
don't to be going up too high lifting

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.039 
don't to be going up too high lifting
the<00:01:39.030> stick<00:01:39.210> way<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> air<00:01:39.720> because

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
the stick way up in the air because

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.270 
the stick way up in the air because
it'll<00:01:40.200> take<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.439> forever<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.829> get<00:01:40.920> back<00:01:41.100> down

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
it'll take you forever to get back down

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.469 
it'll take you forever to get back down
and<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.850> course<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.119> don't<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.360> throw

at the same time that you're doing this

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.340 
at the same time that you're doing this
you<00:02:42.180> also<00:02:42.300> want<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.540> remember<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.870> open<00:02:43.080> your

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
you also want to remember to open your

every<00:02:47.220> shot<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.580> take<00:02:47.730> on<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.970> ice<00:02:48.090> a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
every shot that you take on the ice a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.240 
every shot that you take on the ice a
really<00:02:49.290> important<00:02:49.590> point<00:02:49.680> about<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.040> slap

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
really important point about the slap

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.350 
really important point about the slap
shot<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.790> might<00:02:50.940> think<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.210> lot<00:02:51.330> of

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
shot is that you might think a lot of

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.550 
shot is that you might think a lot of
the<00:02:51.480> bigger<00:02:51.660> guys<00:02:51.900> are<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.140> ones<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.380> have

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
the bigger guys are the ones that have

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.290 
the bigger guys are the ones that have
the<00:02:52.680> bigger<00:02:52.860> shots<00:02:53.160> but<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:53.880> all<00:02:54.090> about

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
the bigger shots but it's all about

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.970 
the bigger shots but it's all about
technique<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.930> not<00:02:55.200> brute<00:02:55.410> strength<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
technique and not brute strength so the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.290 
technique and not brute strength so the
more<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.250> practice<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.850> more<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.210> get

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
more you practice this the more you get

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.910 
more you practice this the more you get
these<00:02:57.450> points<00:02:57.750> down<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.050> tee<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.740> more

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
these points down to a tee the more

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.730 
these points down to a tee the more
effective<00:02:59.310> you'll<00:02:59.460> be<00:02:59.550> on<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.790> ice<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:01.650> the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
effective you'll be on the ice so the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.780 
effective you'll be on the ice so the
last<00:03:01.860> point<00:03:02.070> we're<00:03:02.160> going<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.340> cover<00:03:02.490> is<00:03:02.700> going

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
last point we're going to cover is going

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.920 
last point we're going to cover is going

to be the follow-through this is how you

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.360 
to be the follow-through this is how you
aim<00:03:04.200> with<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.440> slap<00:03:04.650> shot<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.980> control<00:03:05.250> if

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
aim with the slap shot and control if

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.490 
aim with the slap shot and control if
that<00:03:05.460> goes<00:03:05.550> low<00:03:05.760> or<00:03:05.970> high<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:07.080> general<00:03:07.380> rule

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
puck will go high so remember although

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.400 
puck will go high so remember although
the<00:03:15.270> slap<00:03:15.450> shot<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.750> most<00:03:15.900> powerful<00:03:16.050> shot

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
the slap shot is the most powerful shot
