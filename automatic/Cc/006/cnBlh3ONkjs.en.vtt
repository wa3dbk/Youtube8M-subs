anyways why are we looking at a piece of

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.770 
anyways why are we looking at a piece of
paper<00:00:40.070> these<00:00:41.070> are<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.790> three<00:00:42.149> schematics

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
paper these are the three schematics

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.110 
paper these are the three schematics
that<00:00:43.020> i<00:00:43.469> made<00:00:43.860> for<00:00:44.129> things<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.940> will

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
that i made for things that I will

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.160 
that i made for things that I will
destroy<00:00:45.329> or<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:46.260> destroyed<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.550> right

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
destroy or have destroyed on the right

destroy or have destroyed on the right
made<00:00:49.170> before<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.489> mini<00:00:50.910> bots<00:00:51.890> mega<00:00:52.890> gigas

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
made before the mini bots mega gigas

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.970 
made before the mini bots mega gigas
stood<00:00:54.360> tall<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.680> was<00:00:55.860> my<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.520> first<00:00:57.980> leaders

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
stood tall it was my like first leaders

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.170 
stood tall it was my like first leaders
sized<00:00:59.840> ultra<00:01:00.840> sized<00:01:01.579> model<00:01:03.110> anyways<00:01:04.129> his

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
sized ultra sized model anyways his

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.880 
sized ultra sized model anyways his
chest<00:01:06.180> was<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.750> big<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.290> his<00:01:07.530> shoulders

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
chest was this big and his shoulders

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.330 
chest was this big and his shoulders
were<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.220> big<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.270> main<00:01:09.420> problem<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:10.310> why<00:01:11.310> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
were this big the main problem of why I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.899 
were this big the main problem of why I
destroy<00:01:12.150> him<00:01:12.510> was<00:01:12.960> he<00:01:13.409> couldn't<00:01:13.740> stand<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.460> know

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
destroy him was he couldn't stand I know

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.730 
destroy him was he couldn't stand I know
it's<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.360> fault<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:15.990> why<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.200> destroyed<00:01:16.710> him

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.510 
it's my fault that's why I destroyed him
and<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:17.460> why<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:18.270> created<00:01:19.040> this<00:01:20.040> little<00:01:20.280> guy

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and that's why I created this little guy

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.510 
and that's why I created this little guy
sure<00:01:21.210> he<00:01:21.360> was<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> little<00:01:21.930> modification<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.009> I

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
sure he was a little modification and I

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.109 
sure he was a little modification and I
did<00:01:24.060> change<00:01:24.420> his<00:01:24.509> hips<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.740> he<00:01:26.369> fell<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.909> his

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
did change his hips but he fell on his

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.730 
did change his hips but he fell on his
back<00:01:27.270> once<00:01:27.900> again<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.790> thus<00:01:29.790> mega<00:01:30.750> girgis<00:01:31.110> 3.0

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
back once again and thus mega girgis 3.0

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.990 
back once again and thus mega girgis 3.0
was<00:01:32.490> born<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:34.229> i'll<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.430> bring<00:01:35.610> him<00:01:35.759> up

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.679 

anyways<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.920> get<00:01:48.159> him<00:01:48.250> Stan<00:01:48.490> he<00:01:49.360> does<00:01:49.540> not

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
anyways just get him Stan he does not

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.370 
anyways just get him Stan he does not
stand<00:01:50.079> as<00:01:50.439> easy<00:01:50.799> as<00:01:51.189> his<00:01:51.789> previous

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
stand as easy as his previous

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.630 
stand as easy as his previous
predecessors<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.619> that's<00:01:53.860> why<00:01:54.039> I<00:01:54.070> am<00:01:54.430> going

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
predecessors and that's why I am going

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.899 
predecessors and that's why I am going
to<00:01:54.700> destroy<00:01:54.880> him<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:56.829> little<00:01:57.369> story<00:01:57.610> before

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
to destroy him and a little story before

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.630 
to destroy him and a little story before
I<00:01:58.149> get<00:01:58.509> to<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.869> meat<00:01:59.289> of<00:01:59.320> this<00:02:00.280> video<00:02:00.670> I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
I get to the meat of this video I

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.460 
I get to the meat of this video I
growing<00:02:03.640> up<00:02:03.850> watching<00:02:04.270> transformers<00:02:04.840> and

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
growing up watching transformers and

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.040 
growing up watching transformers and
seeing<00:02:05.920> them<00:02:06.189> transform<00:02:06.610> really<00:02:07.420> inspired<00:02:07.899> me

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
seeing them transform really inspired me

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.830 
seeing them transform really inspired me
I<00:02:08.530> too<00:02:08.860> wanted<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.880> make<00:02:10.209> some<00:02:10.509> things

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
I too wanted to make some things

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.320 
I too wanted to make some things
transform<00:02:11.560> just<00:02:12.160> like<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.489> as<00:02:12.849> sort<00:02:13.150> of

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
transform just like that as sort of

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.140 
transform just like that as sort of
problem<00:02:14.050> solving<00:02:14.560> type<00:02:15.489> of<00:02:16.140> niche<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.470> had<00:02:18.150> but

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
problem solving type of niche I had but

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.680 
problem solving type of niche I had but
in<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.959> series<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.650> can't<00:02:20.920> have<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.819> one<00:02:22.060> the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
in the series you can't have the one the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.199 
in the series you can't have the one the
transformation<00:02:23.470> scheme<00:02:23.769> without<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:25.030> other

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
transformation scheme without the other

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.110 
transformation scheme without the other
then<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.769> character<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.599> fills<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:29.049> void

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
then the character that fills the void

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.289 
then the character that fills the void
so<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.150> was<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.780> fan<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.830> series<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.489> I<00:02:33.849> still

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
so I was a fan of the series and I still

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.100 
so I was a fan of the series and I still
am<00:02:34.450> but<00:02:34.900> now<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.310> have<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:37.090> mindset<00:02:37.750> of

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
am but now that I have a mindset of

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.490 
am but now that I have a mindset of
creating<00:02:38.830> my<00:02:38.950> own<00:02:38.980> characters<00:02:39.730> for<00:02:40.269> myself<00:02:40.780> my
