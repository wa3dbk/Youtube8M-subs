00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
XT one they've brought out a whole bunch

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.740

of<00:00:20.160> an<00:00:20.250> X<00:00:20.400> series<00:00:20.730> cameras<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.539> last

couple of years and they've been a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.730 
couple of years and they've been a
fantastic<00:00:23.340> Hebe<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:24.090> think<00:00:25.080> because<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.619> a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
fantastic Hebe I think because it's a

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.279 
fantastic Hebe I think because it's a
pairing<00:00:26.310> between<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.939> kind<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.539> cool<00:00:27.689> styling

which hasn't copped the retro keeps the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.120 
which hasn't copped the retro keeps the
fact<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.140> lot<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.320> other<00:00:31.529> cameras<00:00:31.980> have

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
fact that a lot of other cameras have

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.510 
fact that a lot of other cameras have
MDF<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.660> they<00:00:33.870> also<00:00:34.050> deliver<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:35.070> terms<00:00:35.309> of

MDF but they also deliver in terms of
their<00:00:35.730> image<00:00:36.000> quality

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
their image quality

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.479 
their image quality
astoundingly<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.350> extra<00:00:37.739> ins<00:00:37.860> technology

astoundingly the extra ins technology
I've<00:00:38.610> done<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> video<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.210> explaining<00:00:39.960> how<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
I've done a video on explaining how the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.880 
I've done a video on explaining how the
X<00:00:40.710> trans<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.250> different<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.879> by<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> traditional

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
X trans is different to by a traditional

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.410 
X trans is different to by a traditional
biosensors<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.550> works<00:00:44.760> incredibly<00:00:45.300> well

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
biosensors but it works incredibly well

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.600 
biosensors but it works incredibly well
so<00:00:46.110> at<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> moment<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.309> one<00:00:47.520> is

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
so at the moment you can see this one is

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.729 
rocking the new 56 meal 1.2 and what is
it<00:00:51.750> there's<00:00:51.930> something<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> water<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.680> the

one<00:00:59.820> separately<00:01:00.239> though<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.989> there's<00:01:01.199> some

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
one separately though but there's some

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
one separately though but there's some
big<00:01:01.649> changes<00:01:02.129> between<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.609> one<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.210> XE

big changes between this one and the XE

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.140 
big changes between this one and the XE
2<00:01:03.870> whilst<00:01:04.589> they<00:01:04.739> may<00:01:04.949> share<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.430> sensor<00:01:05.909> there's

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
2 whilst they may share a sensor there's

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.270 
2 whilst they may share a sensor there's
a<00:01:06.240> couple<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.659> important<00:01:07.170> improvements<00:01:08.159> on

a couple of important improvements on

a couple of important improvements on
this<00:01:08.400> one<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.450> will<00:01:09.810> bring<00:01:10.049> even

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
this one that I think will bring even

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.200 
this one that I think will bring even
more<00:01:10.500> people<00:01:10.890> kicking<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.640> screaming<00:01:12.000> over

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
more people kicking and screaming over

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.730 
more people kicking and screaming over

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the threshold in a mirrorless let's have

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.330 
the threshold in a mirrorless let's have
a<00:01:13.799> look<00:01:13.920> around<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.990> xt-1<00:01:16.439> styling

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
a look around this one the xt-1 styling

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.890 
a look around this one the xt-1 styling
it<00:01:17.490> won't<00:01:17.670> be<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.000> everyone<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.750> gonna

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
it won't be for everyone but it's gonna

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.679 
it won't be for everyone but it's gonna
be<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> lot<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.890> people<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.729> tugs<00:01:21.479> at<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
be for a lot of people it tugs at the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.929 
be for a lot of people it tugs at the
heartstrings<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> nice<00:01:23.040> classic<00:01:23.430> design

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
heartstrings it is a nice classic design

the<00:01:24.540> pentaprism<00:01:24.869> seems<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.500> bit<00:01:25.619> funny<00:01:25.890> being

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
the pentaprism seems a bit funny being

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.060 
the pentaprism seems a bit funny being
mirrorless<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:26.880> we'll<00:01:27.600> get<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.960> that

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
mirrorless but we'll get to that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.410 
mirrorless but we'll get to that
obviously<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.579> got<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> manual<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
put both dials to automatic and then

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.880 
put both dials to automatic and then
you're<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.009> auto<00:01:59.399> mode<00:02:00.649> underneath<00:02:01.649> those

you're in auto mode underneath those
dials<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.460> also<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:03.060> more<00:02:03.420> direct<00:02:03.780> access

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
dials you also have more direct access

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.450 
dials you also have more direct access
so<00:02:04.350> you've<00:02:04.469> got<00:02:04.649> your<00:02:04.799> different<00:02:04.920> shooting

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.180 
and then your metering modes as well
it's<00:02:13.480> got<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.660> new<00:02:13.840> rotating<00:02:14.260> screen<00:02:14.710> which<00:02:14.950> may

it's got a new rotating screen which may

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.990 
it's got a new rotating screen which may
look<00:02:15.430> very<00:02:15.460> familiar<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.240> Sony<00:02:16.570> users<00:02:18.000> taking

a look through the menus this has a

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.470 
a look through the menus this has a
bunch<00:02:20.770> of<00:02:20.950> different<00:02:21.010> manual<00:02:21.970> focus<00:02:22.360> assist

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480

split<00:02:25.480> image<00:02:25.690> mode<00:02:26.140> like<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.590> xe2<00:02:26.980> has<00:02:27.550> giving

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
split image mode like the xe2 has giving

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.890 
split image mode like the xe2 has giving
you<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.540> central<00:02:29.020> area<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.470> focus<00:02:29.650> with<00:02:30.900> but

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
you that central area to focus with but

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.780 
you that central area to focus with but
it's<00:02:32.170> got<00:02:32.410> lots<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.740> other<00:02:32.950> options<00:02:33.190> as<00:02:33.610> well

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
it's got lots of other options as well

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.880 
it's got lots of other options as well
so<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:34.270> course<00:02:34.510> has<00:02:34.750> got<00:02:34.900> focus<00:02:35.350> peaking<00:02:35.560> but

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
so of course has got focus peaking but

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.710 
so of course has got focus peaking but
it<00:02:35.980> offers<00:02:36.280> three<00:02:36.670> different<00:02:36.700> colors<00:02:37.420> white

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
it offers three different colors white

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.310 
it offers three different colors white
red<00:02:37.990> and<00:02:38.020> blue<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:39.550> different

red and blue and in different

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.390 
red and blue and in different
intensities<00:02:41.320> so<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.590> can<00:02:41.860> choose<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.250> as<00:02:42.370> a

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
intensities so you can choose it as a

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.300 
intensities so you can choose it as a
high<00:02:42.730> or<00:02:42.790> low<00:02:43.000> depending<00:02:43.480> on<00:02:43.780> how<00:02:44.440> intense<00:02:45.100> you

high or low depending on how intense you
want<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.700> look<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.090> be<00:02:46.120> on<00:02:47.110> high<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.620> really

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
want that look to be on high you really

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.310 
want that look to be on high you really
notice<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.970> little<00:02:49.120> dancing<00:02:49.660> hands<00:02:50.050> over

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
notice the little dancing hands over

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.310 
notice the little dancing hands over
whatever<00:02:50.500> you're<00:02:50.770> gonna<00:02:50.860> be<00:02:51.040> focusing<00:02:51.610> on<00:02:52.320> one

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
whatever you're gonna be focusing on one

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.750 
whatever you're gonna be focusing on one
of<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.560> biggest<00:02:54.070> things<00:02:54.280> that<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.550> haven't

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
of the biggest things that I haven't

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.430 
of the biggest things that I haven't
heard<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.150> lot<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.390> people<00:02:55.630> go<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.959> about<00:02:56.200> is

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
heard a lot of people go on about is

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.190 
heard a lot of people go on about is
this<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.250> first<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.180> X<00:02:58.450> lineup<00:02:58.959> that's

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
this is the first of the X lineup that's

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.440 
this is the first of the X lineup that's
truly<00:02:59.560> where<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.130> proof<00:03:00.370> this<00:03:00.610> has<00:03:00.850> over<00:03:01.060> 80

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
truly where the proof this has over 80

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.780 
truly where the proof this has over 80
weather<00:03:01.810> seals<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.560> magnesium<00:03:02.980> body<00:03:03.520> and

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
weather seals and a magnesium body and

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.910 
weather seals and a magnesium body and
this<00:03:04.420> one's<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:04.930> know<00:03:04.959> really<00:03:05.380> taking<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:05.890> to

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
this one's you know really taking it to

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.430 
this one's you know really taking it to
cameras<00:03:06.490> like<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.850> olympus<00:03:07.270> om-d<00:03:07.480> series

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
cameras like the olympus om-d series

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.020 
cameras like the olympus om-d series
that<00:03:08.620> have<00:03:08.800> been<00:03:08.950> waterproof<00:03:09.490> for<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.760> while

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
that have been waterproof for a while

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.720 
that have been waterproof for a while
now<00:03:10.630> this<00:03:10.959> is<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.320> trick<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.830> 0.77

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
now this is the trick to the 0.77

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.850 
now this is the trick to the 0.77
magnification<00:03:13.570> viewfinder<00:03:14.200> which<00:03:14.320> is<00:03:14.530> just

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
magnification viewfinder which is just

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.680 
magnification viewfinder which is just
massive<00:03:15.550> when<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:16.030> look<00:03:16.180> through<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:16.510> it's

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
massive when you look through it it's

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.229 
massive when you look through it it's
just<00:03:17.080> a<00:03:17.200> joy<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.560> shoot<00:03:17.980> with<00:03:18.190> it's<00:03:18.970> not

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
just a joy to shoot with it's not

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.509 
just a joy to shoot with it's not
actually<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.780> different<00:03:20.230> LCD<00:03:20.860> in<00:03:21.070> there<00:03:21.280> it's

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
actually a different LCD in there it's

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.759 
actually a different LCD in there it's
just<00:03:21.820> got<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.150> specially<00:03:22.900> designed<00:03:23.080> optical

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
just got a specially designed optical

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.910 
just got a specially designed optical
system<00:03:24.220> which<00:03:24.400> blows<00:03:24.850> up<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.780> viewfinder<00:03:26.320> and

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
system which blows up the viewfinder and

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.130 
system which blows up the viewfinder and
because<00:03:27.670> it's<00:03:27.880> so<00:03:28.060> big<00:03:28.269> that<00:03:28.630> lets<00:03:28.930> you

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
because it's so big that lets you

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.080 
because it's so big that lets you
actually<00:03:29.290> have<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.739> split<00:03:30.310> one<00:03:30.519> look<00:03:30.820> at<00:03:30.940> the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
actually have a split one look at the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.600 
actually have a split one look at the
image<00:03:31.630> there<00:03:31.900> when<00:03:32.739> you're<00:03:32.890> doing<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.310> split

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
image there when you're doing the split

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.400 
image there when you're doing the split
focusing<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.239> lets<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:34.660> keep<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:34.989> whole

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
focusing it lets you keep the whole

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.020 
focusing it lets you keep the whole
display<00:03:35.739> so<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:35.980> can<00:03:36.040> see<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:36.310> composition<00:03:36.880> and

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
display so you can see a composition and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.240 
display so you can see a composition and
just<00:03:37.269> have<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.540> focus<00:03:37.900> on<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.170> right<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:38.739> the

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
just have the focus on the right and the

just have the focus on the right and the
sensor<00:03:39.640> is<00:03:39.760> really<00:03:40.450> adaptive<00:03:41.050> and<00:03:41.320> responsive

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
sensor is really adaptive and responsive

this either the technology I showed you

this either the technology I showed you
with<00:04:24.760> that<00:04:24.910> lens<00:04:25.120> setup<00:04:25.510> is<00:04:25.810> pretty<00:04:26.140> nifty

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
with that lens setup is pretty nifty

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.830 
with that lens setup is pretty nifty
until<00:04:27.670> I<00:04:27.700> was<00:04:27.940> shown<00:04:28.150> that<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:28.360> wouldn't<00:04:28.660> have

until I was shown that I wouldn't have

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.600 
until I was shown that I wouldn't have
thought<00:04:29.110> that<00:04:29.170> it<00:04:29.500> was<00:04:29.680> just<00:04:29.980> a<00:04:30.070> magnifying

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
thought that it was just a magnifying

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.130 
thought that it was just a magnifying
glass<00:04:30.820> I<00:04:31.000> thought<00:04:31.180> it<00:04:31.270> was<00:04:31.360> a<00:04:31.420> bigger<00:04:31.660> LCD

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
screen in there the quality is really

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.280 
screen in there the quality is really
that<00:04:33.760> good<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.240> lag<00:04:34.480> is<00:04:34.750> really<00:04:35.020> really

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
that good and a lag is really really

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.430 
that good and a lag is really really
minor<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:36.250> for<00:04:37.090> manual<00:04:37.540> focus<00:04:37.960> because<00:04:38.290> you

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
minor and for manual focus because you

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.110 
minor and for manual focus because you
can<00:04:38.620> fit<00:04:38.920> some<00:04:39.160> pretty<00:04:39.340> nifty<00:04:39.610> in<00:04:39.820> manual

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120

focusing is really really nifty I can

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.440 
focusing is really really nifty I can
see<00:04:51.160> why<00:04:51.310> people<00:04:51.340> are<00:04:51.700> pre-ordering<00:04:52.240> these

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
see why people are pre-ordering these

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.010 
see why people are pre-ordering these
like<00:04:52.690> crazy<00:04:53.970> it's<00:04:54.970> a<00:04:55.210> really<00:04:55.570> nice<00:04:55.690> little

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
like crazy it's a really nice little

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.720 
like crazy it's a really nice little
lens<00:04:56.200> I<00:04:56.410> think<00:04:56.650> sorry<00:04:57.070> really<00:04:57.340> nice<00:04:57.490> little

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
lens I think sorry really nice little

lens I think sorry really nice little
camera<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.120> lens<00:04:58.210> is<00:04:58.420> nice<00:04:58.600> too<00:04:58.900> though<00:04:59.080> I

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
camera the lens is nice too though I

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.910 
camera the lens is nice too though I
have<00:05:00.640> used<00:05:00.940> I<00:05:01.330> think<00:05:01.540> every<00:05:01.960> one<00:05:02.110> of<00:05:02.140> the<00:05:02.440> Fuji

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
have used I think every one of the Fuji

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.340 
have used I think every one of the Fuji
X<00:05:03.160> cameras<00:05:03.760> and<00:05:04.000> I<00:05:04.030> have<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.300> say<00:05:04.480> hands<00:05:04.780> down<00:05:04.900> I

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
X cameras and I have to say hands down I

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.740 
X cameras and I have to say hands down I
you<00:05:06.160> know<00:05:06.250> if<00:05:06.430> I'm<00:05:06.580> going<00:05:06.790> out<00:05:06.970> to<00:05:07.120> buy<00:05:07.300> one<00:05:07.540> it

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
you know if I'm going out to buy one it

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.440 
you know if I'm going out to buy one it
would<00:05:07.990> be<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.260> xt-1<00:05:08.620> no<00:05:09.010> doubt<00:05:09.300> apart<00:05:10.300> from

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
would be the xt-1 no doubt apart from

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.850 
would be the xt-1 no doubt apart from
having<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.780> latest<00:05:10.930> generation<00:05:11.290> of

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
having the latest generation of

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.800 
having the latest generation of
everything<00:05:12.550> in<00:05:12.700> it<00:05:12.820> I<00:05:12.970> just<00:05:13.510> think<00:05:13.690> the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
everything in it I just think the

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.660 
everything in it I just think the
ergonomics<00:05:14.440> and<00:05:14.590> the<00:05:14.770> overall<00:05:15.130> balance<00:05:15.310> of

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
ergonomics and the overall balance of

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
you guys because this is still a

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.580 
you guys because this is still a

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
prototype so I can't put a card into the

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.100
