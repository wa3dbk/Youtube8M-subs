00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 illegal car racing that ends in death 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.759
 that sounds like a blatant 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.500
 video game but it is the hard one 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.960
 reality on german roads 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.730
 what is going on we have the video games 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.839
 I'm lost in reality 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.130
 number and that's what's going on short 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.289
 many of you are probably getting up 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.539
 the almost furious series and seven at 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.880
 the exciting car call powerfully 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.859
 the freedom the speed 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.080
 Booming engines fascinate us 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.449
 somehow this mixture of forbidden 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.189
 and yet seemingly harmless after all 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.780
 illegal road races have long since 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.950
 not just on the television or the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.219
 computer screen instead 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.480
 they are becoming more common in Germany 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.890
 A total of five people are in this 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.660
 year already the probable race 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.789
 died and that was not the raser 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.920
 behind the wheel his cyclist 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.829
 just crossed the crosswalk 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.140
 cars or taxis duly opened 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.239
 their lane of people passing through 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.010
 random at the wrong time in the wrong place 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.879
 were and that's why you live 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.649
 have lost 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.270
 alone three of these alleged raser 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.579
 accidents are in the city of cologne 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.350
 happened in the spring died a man in 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.909
 frankfurt on the weekend one 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.100
 uninvolved women bremen 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.390
 she was traveling on her lane and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.430
 It was hit by two razors 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.270
 wanted to overtake each other from the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.369
 crowded street 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.390
 the now a punishment if participates 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.280
 makes itself punishable 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.159
 you get caught by the police a 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.409
 driving ban â‚¬ 400 penalty and two 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.759
 points in flensburg but what are they 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.580
 for people with their cars through 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.920
 the streets race fines accidents 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.689
 and dead do not seem to matter at all 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.700
 are actually always young men 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.320
 between 18 and 25 years 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.090
 some of them have been before 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.100
 others are prosecuted 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.020
 completely inconspicuous one is here 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.390
 unemployed other permanent jobs 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.850
 but they all have one thing in common 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.560
 need their car for their ego this 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.409
 men love cars they are stuck a lot 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.369
 Borrow and mock money 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.930
 Traffic psychologists agree that 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.820
 but here with the race others 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.799
 want to impress and looking for 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.420
 confirmation in the cologne 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.549
 meanwhile over a real raser 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.960
 Scene on more than 200 young people 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.240
 appreciates the cologne 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.530
 let the group meet many of them 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.960
 in the evening on the right side of the Rhine 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.160
 at the fountain and then drive in convoy 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.840
 direction downtown 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.730
 Because especially like the blades 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.650
 over busy roads the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.020
 miserable cologne wrestler or the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.569
 aachener street in hamburg is the 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.250
 Jungfernstieg is very popular and in Berlin 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.720
 what a young man recently during 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.709
 a fan in a big beer garden 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.239
 clear 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.130
 the more central the place the more 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.440
 spectators and potential admirers 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.209
 there are for the razors but at the same time 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.860
 of course, that's what the scene does a lot 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.050
 dangerous for innocent bystanders 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.550
 seems to be the consequences of their fans 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.030
 However, the razor no thoughts 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.310
 do 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.019
 Transport experts say it's about that 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.360
 own can estimate realistically 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.750
 and unite to recognize where the limits 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.000
 lie 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.430
 because many young raser overestimate themselves 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.800
 totally the latest trend in the world 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.600
 scene with never were at the 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.239
 last illegal when in cologne with one 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.880
 but you were dead in carsharing cars 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.900
 on the way, partly to their own 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.940
 to protect cars 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.709
 they may not have a car and 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.840
 Now how can you run the illegal ones 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.700
 fight local politics in cologne 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.440
 for example, roads demand their own 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.120
 race track characteristics 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.370
 that they are solid again from me 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.650
 mobile flashing less lanes for 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.600
 the cars or green wave only at tempo 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.320
 50 But if all this is what brings 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.480
 not so clear 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.890
 also beyond ps limit for young people 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.190
 is discussed again and again 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.380
 a proposal until the end of the 24th 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.560
 year of life there are only cars with up 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.750
 to 136 ps and in Austria 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.190
 beginner half a year after her 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.350
 license again a kind of exam 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.930
 with driving safety training and 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.820
 psychological feedback talk there 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.519
 are the accident numbers among young drivers 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.440
 the rental car also declined significantly 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.140
 wants to be used as race cars the 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.180
 there are plans to contain the police 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.489
 to share information with carsharing providers 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.450
 and potentials do not scrape it 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.730
 to borrow cars 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.590
 but that would require the carsharing and 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.630
 car rental providers first of all the 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.200
 official permission have more data too 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.850
 raise 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.680
 a change at the federal level 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.650
 It should be determined if all this is true 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.850
 is really something brings is questionable 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.260
 Traffic psychologists believe we have 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.989
 want 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.420
 and some also believe films like 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.519
 the fast and furious series or 60 more 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.220
 seconds and computer games like need for 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.359
 speed or gotham racing heat their 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.100
 even more 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.709
 but we have long known this dispute 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.930
 the killers play over and over again 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.000
 ask psychologists to do it 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.710
 Killer games are aggressive and aggressive 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.840
 Awaken the need to shoot yourself 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.520
 or on the contrary, build the 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.039
 Aggression and maybe sharpening 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.440
 even the reflexes definite results 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:38.000
 existed in the long run 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.010
 There are never any races to play 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.940
 less studies the results are here 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.430
 but similar 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.229
 The question is one gets through 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.389
 racing game to speed junkie 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.910
 or stand speed junkies 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.289
 Just love racing game if you like 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.720
 to transfer these studies to everyday life 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.940
 can not believe many believe that 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.320
 only way the problem in the long term 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.449
 to get the grip is there 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.860
 to dock your problems and that 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.470
 Need for validation of the young men 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.750
 arise in the social environment in the 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.360
 family in the circle of friends and in the 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.520
 The whole company has more cars here 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.710
 and more coal transport 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.150
 verziert what do you think how can you do that 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.010
 to get a grip on the problem of the rotor 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.990
 write it in the comments 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.380
 I am yes and that was a deal 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.380
 short
