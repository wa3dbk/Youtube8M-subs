00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.460
 this is the order to which there are a couple of 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.990
 weeks but I will not make it obvious 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.990
 because I had problems with the world 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:21.930
 the computer I the montella pieces 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.560
 and it cost me in total in what is the box 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.280
 750 euros 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.530
 everything full of a slump 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.340
 and well I will put you in the description 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.920
 all the components and 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.190
 and what it cost me each one now we're going to 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.670
 open the box 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.860
 as you can see the box is one of the strikers 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:47.950
 x advanced and is tourism I love with 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.510
 the x red 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.310
 then more for who you have to come 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.310
 already with the component that you like 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.100
 and much more 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.930
 it costs me a lot ariel 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.060
 leaving stopped 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.720
 on hard drives 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 this 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.100
 is a hard drive and correct undoing is 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.930
 quite like 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.050
 and then also the box goes with a 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:40.850
 bunch of fans here came one 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.430
 this one is up here and the two 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.180
 fronts that are there in that job 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.180
 here and here 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.120
 well this is the power source 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.540
 one strike xd 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.230
 different watts with classification of 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.960
 made a bronze board 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:10.619
 and here we have a 9 fx processor 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.410
 8.650 with its heatsink of this thing that 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.910
 an impressive noise if you plan to buy 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.310
 this processor I recommend that you 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.720
 you buy another fan for kings now 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.080
 you will see with action the computer that 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.080
 it makes a noise 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.069
 they are better 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.620
 since 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:38.130
 two numbers from 4 gb to 1600 megahertz and 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.340
 cr9 latency 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.360
 then we also have the motherboard a 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.300
 giga valencia 970 of 3 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:52.570
 it's pretty good does not have pci 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.570
 express 3.0 but it is also contained 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:02.830
 and this is the amd hd 78 graphics card 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.690
 70 black edition and assemblers vx 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.830
 it's graphic foreigner how good it is 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:12.520
 is that it's not like a 78 70 normal h 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:16.150
 because it has the chip of the mdd 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.740
 laser is higher than 7 thousand 900 then 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.040
 has a performance similar to h of 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.040
 795 cl 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.560
 here we have 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.710
 the secondary hard disk that will be the 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.340
 shabat barracuda a unique integral 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:43.120
 normal and then here we have the ssd 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.880
 one believes you see that it's 120 gb a 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.220
 samsung 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:52.390
 of 8 series 840 and the abyss is incredible 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.240
 It spreads on computers 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:00.630
 for this operation in just about 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.630
 seconds with this minute 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.580
 well I will keep orderly 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.239
 the screen is that you have here I am 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.470
 used again I have to change it 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.190
 why 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.190
 but is that we have 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.780
 I'm doing 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.370
 here the harvest is being loaded 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.890
 and now to start the system itself 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.890
 operative 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.480
 is that after windows 8 this fast 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.540
 that almost can not be seen and well open me teach 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.310
 as performance this graphics card in 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.310
 some games like the one that exists 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:08.910
 good as you see I have understood well 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.960
 and the identity of the work riva 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.010
 and generates the people in the end I would like 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.969
 and now it goes further this time that if 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.829
 you find 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.310
 As you can see, this is the reality at the end 

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:40.180
 I can not run 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.180
 all 12 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:51.150
 everything is at maximum 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.150
 but filters that are our moment 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:56.229
 and good 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:05.080
 after starting 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:08.099
 30-40 and she's sitting 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.099
 what the graphic card showed 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.870
 is very good 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.130
 but fast of 17 over the spectacular 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.130
 all right 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:35.750
 this video that you liked we put 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.800
 the comments he answers 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.800
 practically all
