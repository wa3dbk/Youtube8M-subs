00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.170 
actually had a lot of strategic element
and<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.189> found<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.700> was<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> key

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
and I found that that was a key

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.670 
and I found that that was a key
component<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:40.049> need<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.229> garrison

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
component you really need to garrison

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.770 
component you really need to garrison
units<00:01:41.070> inside<00:01:41.340> buildings<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.270> order<00:01:42.570> for<00:01:42.720> you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
units inside buildings in order for you

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.480 
units inside buildings in order for you
to<00:01:42.840> gain<00:01:43.020> advantage<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.680> sort<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.950> hold<00:01:44.159> key

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
to gain advantage in sort of hold key

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.109 
to gain advantage in sort of hold key
structural<00:01:45.060> areas<00:01:45.540> now<00:01:46.369> in<00:01:47.369> terms<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.880> how<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
structural areas now in terms of how the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.389 
structural areas now in terms of how the
game<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.869> sort<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.290> how<00:01:50.040> you're<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
game is sort of how you're going to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.149 
game is sort of how you're going to
progress<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.240> terms<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.810> what<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.799> can<00:01:52.950> gain

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
progress in terms of what you can gain

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.850 
progress in terms of what you can gain
access<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:54.329> purchase<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.409> generals<00:01:55.740> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
access to or purchase the generals of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.010 
access to or purchase the generals of
course<00:01:56.040> are<00:01:56.159> they<00:01:56.310> main<00:01:56.610> sort<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.060> area<00:01:57.600> for

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
course are they main sort of area for

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.330 
course are they main sort of area for
that<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:58.649> didn't<00:01:58.860> mention<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.219> they

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
that they didn't mention that they

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.620 
that they didn't mention that they
didn't<00:01:59.520> want<00:01:59.640> any<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.210> pay<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.420> win

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
didn't want any of it to be pay to win

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.910 
didn't want any of it to be pay to win
so<00:02:00.840> none<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> generals<00:02:01.409> will<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.590> stronger

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
so none of the generals will be stronger

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.570 
so none of the generals will be stronger
than<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> other<00:02:02.250> one

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
than the other one

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.070 
than the other one
but<00:02:03.030> that's<00:02:03.210> something<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.570> you'll<00:02:03.780> lock

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
but that's something that you'll lock

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.560 
but that's something that you'll lock
over<00:02:04.410> time<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:05.490> they<00:02:05.640> mentioned<00:02:06.300> that<00:02:06.420> there

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
over time but they mentioned that there

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.330 
over time but they mentioned that there
are<00:02:06.720> multiple<00:02:07.080> game<00:02:07.320> modes<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.800> people<00:02:08.220> to
