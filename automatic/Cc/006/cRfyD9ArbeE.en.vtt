00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.220
 hello, i 'm gustavo campelo director of 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.900
 ideal bed 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.950
 We are going to talk about how to improve. 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.950
 communication with your animal 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.170
 the most common error in animal communication 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.220
 is to deal with the dog as if they 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.630
 were children 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.160
 I always play with my clients, which is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.019
 I need to teach a little 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.580
 that the dogs and we learn a 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.289
 a little dog too what? 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.640
 happens on a daily basis is that each person 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.620
 of the house deals with the dog of a 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.700
 way this always generates a lot of 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.700
 anxiety and stress 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.430
 it is and always is worth remembering that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.809
 human communication is very much based on 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.390
 verbal expression we speak time 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.879
 what do we mean by the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.830
 dogs this does not happen in communication 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.290
 canine is much more important than 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.940
 body expression as a tail position 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.739
 ear position than vocalization 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.900
 usually they communicate the time 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.890
 whole and uninterrupted by 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.780
 body expression 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.790
 we need to know this and learn to 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.380
 understand and send messages that the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.270
 dog understands so that communication 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.920
 efficient is the best way to 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.869
 to solve this problem is to create rules 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.300
 clear that all the people in the family 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.160
 know and finally follow something else 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.289
 It helps a lot to always have the same 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.520
 commands dog does not create two or 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.450
 three words that mean the same 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.680
 thing 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.899
 Do you know when the dog went that face? 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.670
 of the is actually trying to understand 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.830
 What you say but can not 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.170
 then a very clear example of people 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.729
 call the dog see geek and another 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.470
 call here geek 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.789
 the dog can even understand the two 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.709
 only this will take much more 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.690
 time will be much more difficult when 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:47.640
 all the same language the dog 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.140
 knows exactly what is expected 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.550
 relationship becomes much more 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.550
 strengthened and pleasurable 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.310
 is
