helps out bring the levels down lets us

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.870 
helps out bring the levels down lets us
control<00:01:45.640> a<00:01:45.820> lot<00:01:46.090> better<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:48.520> just<00:01:48.580> makes

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
control a lot better and it just makes

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.810 
control a lot better and it just makes
the<00:01:49.060> overall<00:01:49.450> like<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.560> production<00:01:50.950> value<00:01:51.490> of

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
the overall like the production value of

00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:01.950 
the overall like the production value of
this<00:01:52.600> video<00:01:52.930> that<00:01:53.350> much<00:01:53.530> more<00:02:00.690> almost<00:02:01.690> put<00:02:01.869> my
