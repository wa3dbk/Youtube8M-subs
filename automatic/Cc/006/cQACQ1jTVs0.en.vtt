00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:45.030

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.820
 clothes fit just right 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.909

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.170

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.580
 home is not safe to stay 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.770
 need to go somewhere well where exactly 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.979
 hut on the mountain hope she has not yet 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.979

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.070

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.819

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.120

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.120

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.120
 comfortable
