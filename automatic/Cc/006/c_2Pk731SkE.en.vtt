00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.090 
such as here with the epc keyboard this

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.290 
such as here with the epc keyboard this
is<00:00:07.240> a<00:00:07.620> interesting<00:00:08.620> bit<00:00:08.830> of<00:00:08.980> kit<00:00:09.309> this<00:00:09.969> summer

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.300 
is a interesting bit of kit this summer

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.589 
is a interesting bit of kit this summer
look<00:00:10.450> at<00:00:10.540> the<00:00:10.630> depth<00:00:11.290> of<00:00:11.530> it<00:00:12.179> how<00:00:13.179> about<00:00:13.389> that

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:13.599 
look at the depth of it how about that

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.029 
look at the depth of it how about that
there's<00:00:13.809> a<00:00:13.900> full<00:00:14.259> pc<00:00:15.039> with<00:00:15.339> integrated<00:00:17.039> and

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
there's a full pc with integrated and

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.850 
there's a full pc with integrated and
its<00:00:18.250> sin<00:00:18.670> it's<00:00:19.539> weird<00:00:19.840> i<00:00:19.990> got<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.560> blackberry

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
its sin it's weird i got the blackberry

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.390 
its sin it's weird i got the blackberry
got<00:00:21.490> the<00:00:21.790> vga<00:00:22.420> that<00:00:23.350> I<00:00:23.470> see<00:00:23.530> my<00:00:23.890> fault<00:00:24.190> there

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
got the vga that I see my fault there

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.270 
got the vga that I see my fault there
yeah<00:00:24.940> a<00:00:24.970> couple<00:00:25.540> of<00:00:25.780> headphone<00:00:26.500> port<00:00:26.920> three

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.280 
yeah a couple of headphone port three

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.350 
yeah a couple of headphone port three
usps<00:00:27.940> looks<00:00:28.570> like<00:00:29.520> antenna<00:00:30.520> outputs<00:00:31.060> for

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
usps looks like antenna outputs for

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.360 
usps looks like antenna outputs for
where<00:00:31.750> does<00:00:31.840> it<00:00:31.870> go<00:00:31.960> Wi-Fi<00:00:32.500> i<00:00:32.529> guess<00:00:32.800> i<00:00:33.039> guess

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
where does it go Wi-Fi i guess i guess

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.740 
where does it go Wi-Fi i guess i guess
you<00:00:33.460> can<00:00:33.550> put<00:00:33.700> some<00:00:33.820> internal<00:00:34.180> antennas<00:00:34.660> on

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
you can put some internal antennas on

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.170 
you can put some internal antennas on
that<00:00:34.899> as<00:00:35.050> well<00:00:35.200> show<00:00:35.920> us<00:00:36.010> the<00:00:36.100> screen<00:00:36.340> yeah

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
that as well show us the screen yeah

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.720 
that as well show us the screen yeah
that's<00:00:37.480> a<00:00:37.600> 5-inch<00:00:38.230> 800<00:00:38.890> x<00:00:39.010> 480<00:00:39.550> resolution

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
that's a 5-inch 800 x 480 resolution

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.830 
that's a 5-inch 800 x 480 resolution
touch<00:00:40.630> bad<00:00:40.900> touch<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.489> I'm<00:00:42.790> well<00:00:43.090> the<00:00:43.480> system

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
touch bad touch so I'm well the system

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.550 
touch bad touch so I'm well the system
is<00:00:43.930> based<00:00:44.170> on<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.440> intel<00:00:44.710> atom<00:00:44.829> n270<00:00:45.670> so<00:00:46.560> maybe

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
is based on the intel atom n270 so maybe

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.580 
is based on the intel atom n270 so maybe
they<00:00:48.190> are<00:00:48.310> also<00:00:48.489> announcing<00:00:49.060> it<00:00:49.180> with<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.450> n<00:00:50.200> 3

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
they are also announcing it with the n 3

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.639 
they are also announcing it with the n 3
30<00:00:50.920> so<00:00:51.399> you<00:00:51.460> can<00:00:51.730> even<00:00:51.970> expect<00:00:52.960> a<00:00:53.110> dual<00:00:53.320> core

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
30 so you can even expect a dual core

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.080 
30 so you can even expect a dual core
atom<00:00:54.190> system<00:00:55.030> in<00:00:55.809> this<00:00:56.020> key<00:00:56.230> keyboard<00:00:57.090> yeah

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
atom system in this key keyboard yeah

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.660 
atom system in this key keyboard yeah
well<00:00:58.270> in<00:00:58.390> terms<00:00:58.570> of<00:00:58.780> build<00:00:59.050> quality<00:00:59.489> it<00:01:00.489> looks

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
well in terms of build quality it looks

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.360 
well in terms of build quality it looks
very<00:01:01.059> solid<00:01:01.390> I<00:01:01.809> like<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.800> I<00:01:03.040> like<00:01:03.219> the

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
very solid I like the I like the

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.639 
very solid I like the I like the
feedback<00:01:03.760> of<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.000> keyboard<00:01:04.449> it<00:01:05.110> reminds<00:01:05.500> me<00:01:05.619> a

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
feedback of the keyboard it reminds me a

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.120 
feedback of the keyboard it reminds me a
little<00:01:05.740> bit<00:01:05.890> on<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.189> macbook<00:01:06.490> pro<00:01:06.520> or<00:01:07.119> sony

between<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:12.130> different<00:01:12.490> keys<00:01:12.700> which<00:01:13.360> makes

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
between the different keys which makes

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.330 
between the different keys which makes
it<00:01:13.720> you<00:01:13.930> know<00:01:13.960> way<00:01:14.380> more<00:01:14.409> easy<00:01:14.799> for<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:17.340> to

great aluminum finish unfortunately only
powered<00:01:26.170> by<00:01:26.350> DC<00:01:26.890> there's<00:01:27.100> no<00:01:27.190> battery<00:01:27.580> in<00:01:27.610> it

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
powered by DC there's no battery in it

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.190 
powered by DC there's no battery in it
right<00:01:27.940> no<00:01:28.150> you<00:01:28.210> don't<00:01:28.479> just<00:01:28.780> connector<00:01:29.290> right

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200

only that would be funny what's still in
our<00:01:34.369> interesting<00:01:34.880> concept<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:35.960> know

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
our interesting concept and you know

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.510 
our interesting concept and you know
you<00:01:36.970> can<00:01:37.120> just<00:01:37.300> see<00:01:37.570> where<00:01:37.870> mobile<00:01:38.800> heart<00:01:39.310> up

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
you can just see where mobile heart up

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.290 
you can just see where mobile heart up
that<00:01:39.730> forms<00:01:40.120> i<00:01:40.240> am<00:01:40.480> going<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.290> write<00:01:41.560> yeah

pant<00:01:56.440> nipple<00:01:56.740> would<00:01:56.800> be<00:01:56.860> karat<00:01:57.220> gold<00:01:57.510> so<00:01:58.510> this

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
pant nipple would be karat gold so this

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.090 
pant nipple would be karat gold so this
is<00:01:58.660> a<00:01:58.780> first<00:01:59.050> we<00:01:59.230> haven't<00:01:59.470> seen<00:01:59.590> this<00:01:59.710> working

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
is a first we haven't seen this working
