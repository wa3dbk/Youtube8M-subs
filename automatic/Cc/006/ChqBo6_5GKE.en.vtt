00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.910
 to the girls 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.490
 this is cold one of the most events 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.410
 mythical of the club are the Thursdays we want 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.120
 present it with the protagonist 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.120
 main that is chagas 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.890
 the first session we present is 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.010
 important that followers of the game 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.760
 in which there is within each session 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.250
 and what is the soul that moves something inside 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.920
 on Thursdays it has always been one of the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.149
 most important and good days I think not 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.389
 There is no one better to explain what is 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.670
 freak that you yourself started two years ago 

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:44.010
 years and a session a bit free without 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.949
 ties for people to have fun 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.949
 do whatever you want this write dance 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.019
 yells something you want this is 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.620
 free well with your life is also free 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.850
 you live here in summer comes from london 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.999
 you were in last year also in 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.339
 Munich are influences from outside the people 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:04.860
 you bring your but you know also here that the 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.170
 people are having fun the truth that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.350
 go out helps you 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.689
 to catch things see catch music ideas 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.780
 styles the truth that is a great 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.399
 influence to go out I advise it the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.049
 such truth is I surprised 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.850
 a lot with the dap this was very strong 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.470
 in london the tram was also a 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.830
 the order of the day are things that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.140
 better they are also not booming but there 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.479
 every day every nightclub in three styles 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.220
 one there is a more pluralistic environment there 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.740
 many more people and you have everything 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.100
 but good here we have this that this is 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.159
 to thank all summer we can 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.250
 listen to great name artists we are 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.500
 sitting with jaime in jaime saga before 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.299
 it was mister Chagas I imagine that this 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.039
 has an evolution that has happened because 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.920
 you are removing from mister times of change 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.959
 not a little, not a little more, my name is not 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.340
 a mystery I am nobody, I am tiger 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:58.500
 just and everyone is already telling me 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.390
 jagger and pulled a check on the music 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.729
 that closeness will also have been reflected 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.220
 to the good public is what I try not to 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.210
 every Thursday will not come a bit to 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.160
 all people because it can be cold 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.250
 is filled with many kinds of people not 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.230
 you always try to carry the electronics 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.820
 of all kinds but always good 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.760
 truth that enters the slope a 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.350
 little more in the sessions I do them a 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.120
 little less mana is not what I 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.800
 would like to always do and finish a 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.900
 little here melodic so that people will 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.460
 go a little with the feelings no yes 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.680
 who wants to be mind the quantum music 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.870
 because cold means freedom I 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.220
 I think that did not convey a bit of 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.900
 freedom not because right now we're 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.850
 in a time that what we need 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.950
 a little bit is forgetting the things that are 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.540
 going through there disinhibiting a little no 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.220
 he's talking about the same thing all day and 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.480
 who likes this that comes here 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.180
 just as I go fishing to go to 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.290
 fish I do not know a little do not get rid of everything 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.410
 what was happening to our 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.060
 around are complicated moments 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.090
 personally I think there has been a 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.330
 cultural change an epochal change the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.010
 music also has to reflect yes 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.990
 truth is the truth that I miss 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.090
 a lot of those club times that the 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.550
 people went alone to listen to music and 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.710
 focused on the music and they are changing 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.530
 a lot of things and I would like to recover 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.120
 that's that kind of club on the web 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.120
 people came alone to hear the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.490
 music focused on music and nothing 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.260
 and have fun getting in there a little bit 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.240
 music you think is a transport 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.069
 to communicate among people who 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.040
 feel the same man I think the 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.170
 music in the soul of everything a little bit without 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.190
 music we could not live I think it would not be 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.190
 a little boring life 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.080
 the music because on Thursdays for me the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.120
 kisses of a very special night always 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.500
 had a special magic that night here 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.910
 There are also Fridays that come 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.709
 international on Saturdays that 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.500
 turns this a bit into a slope 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.550
 more commercial but good the web was 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.410
 there and the truth that we have two years 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.970
 strong last year was very good 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.100
 people had a great time and I think that 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.450
 this year we're going to try to get it 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:02.030
 happen just as well so we have 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:05.330
 ambientazo madness good hopefully not 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.330
 there are no problems but here 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.950
 come all and nothing and you are all 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.459
 guests already know this is pri and 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.890
 have a good time and nothing like at home 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.470

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.660
 start this week we have cold 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.780
