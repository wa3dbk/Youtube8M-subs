00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.040
 elio people these insulating tanks for 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.750
 christmas video on gta 5 it will be fine 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.369
 heard from a knife how to change his 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.529
 ridiculous bathroom weapons and when 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.570
 is in a helicopter or in a plane from 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.100
 hunt the ridicule he will change to 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.530
 machine guns and for the 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.450
 rocket launcher so I teach you to 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.809
 do it because very few people on the 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.190
 know but expect what this 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.829
 do not be you who personalizes and 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.600
 it's already a ridiculous thing to integrate 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.190
 in gta but that increases the accuracy 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.469
 so I think it's a wonder 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.750
 really if you want to play for them 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.820
 camouflage weapons there you are already killed 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.280
 400 and a half the rates to unlock a 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.420
 camouflage on a weapon so I you 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.239
 explain immediately how the 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.160
 brain to change his vehicle like 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.660
 you can see there it's just in 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.000
 filling all saints ben and I'm going 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.920
 I teach you to show you how 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.149
 change it finally there are still some 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.220
 people who know my name after 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.110
 does I show you how changed 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.319
 so then you press start 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.119
 you go into display settings 

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:22.690
 you go into weapon target and you 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.060
 turn complex and normally there is 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.410
 can see that the ridicule has changed so 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.780
 there is still a little small 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.360
 white dot in the middle between a circle 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.190
 transparent gray limit finally it's 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.790
 weird so you'll see when you 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.580
 will do so 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.290
 that's the money you want I already have 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.130
 everything I need in his window 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.260
 which hello to you so yes so the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.510
 reticle exchanger wants some 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.180
 everywhere simple and fluid under you 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.590
 can see stuff like that it finally 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.780
 snipers separated that rifles 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.720
 of assault think there is no need and 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.860
 while the pumps have changed 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.220
 so that's really for the body to 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.690
 body or is what you imagine so 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.119
 small tits grenade launcher at a circle 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.600
 I like the rocket launcher 5 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.400
 ares so on that there the rockets 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.690
 you can see a little square pass 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.459
 of course the helicopters are the same except 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.080
 that there because it is bigger and the 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.750
 work on the helicopters it's like 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.250
 like this then good for them 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.830
 grenades it's the same 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.550
 the little round the little white circle at 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.610
 beginning 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.650
 except that he shrank the finer 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.209
 so frankly I think it's 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.030
 better so I hope it was two 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.470
 hours to help in any case for me that 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.400
 really helped me to aim for the heads 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.459
 and all so I'm going to send this video 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.430
 at the monf the tv team I hope the club 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.660
 so if I'm blue of thanks to you 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.310
 and I'm going to have a quick hit 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.820
 where people had been 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.820
 udder
