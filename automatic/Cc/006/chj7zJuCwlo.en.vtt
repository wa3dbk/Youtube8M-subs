break down the ammonia in your tank a
little<00:00:48.000> bit<00:00:48.120> more<00:00:48.329> efficiently<00:00:49.070> than<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.129> bio

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
little bit more efficiently than the bio

although the bio balls are good this

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.330 
although the bio balls are good this
will<00:00:54.210> break<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.600> down<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.170> little<00:00:55.739> bit<00:00:56.190> more

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
will break it down a little bit more

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.119 
will break it down a little bit more
efficiently<00:00:56.789> more<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.300> live<00:00:57.600> rock<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.980> can

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
efficiently more like live rock you can

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.099 
efficiently more like live rock you can
also<00:00:59.280> add<00:00:59.520> live<00:00:59.850> rock<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.570> back<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.020> your

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
also add live rock to the back of your

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.030 
also add live rock to the back of your
tank<00:01:01.579> instead<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.699> your<00:01:02.789> bio<00:01:03.030> balls<00:01:03.739> but<00:01:04.739> what

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
tank instead of your bio balls but what

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.950 
tank instead of your bio balls but what
you'll<00:01:05.250> find<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.150> dissolves<00:01:06.479> over

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you'll find is that it dissolves over

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.440 
you'll find is that it dissolves over
time<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.560> breaks<00:01:07.740> down<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:09.119> product

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
time and it breaks down so this product

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.260 
time and it breaks down so this product
actually<00:01:09.750> doesn't<00:01:10.290> break<00:01:10.470> down<00:01:10.970> I've<00:01:11.970> taken

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
actually doesn't break down I've taken

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.550 
actually doesn't break down I've taken
it<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.540> step<00:01:12.570> further

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it a step further

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.060 
it a step further
where<00:01:14.159> I've<00:01:14.369> purchased<00:01:14.760> these<00:01:15.619> welded<00:01:16.619> filter

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
where I've purchased these welded filter

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.749 
where I've purchased these welded filter
bags<00:01:17.509> there's<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.900> per<00:01:19.470> box<00:01:19.740> that's<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.490> per

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
bags there's one per box that's one per

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.929 
bags there's one per box that's one per
box<00:01:21.560> like<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.950> I've<00:01:23.070> put<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.380> matrix<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.670> D

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
box like so I've put the matrix or the D

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.600 
box like so I've put the matrix or the D
nitrate<00:01:28.430> into<00:01:29.430> these<00:01:30.270> filter<00:01:30.750> bags<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.610> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
nitrate into these filter bags and it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.539 
nitrate into these filter bags and it
comes<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> tie<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.390> filter<00:01:33.900> bags<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
comes with a tie the filter bags and

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.480 
comes with a tie the filter bags and
then<00:01:35.549> I've<00:01:35.700> simply<00:01:36.180> rinsed<00:01:36.540> them<00:01:36.710> with<00:01:37.710> ro/di

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
then I've simply rinsed them with ro/di

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.200 
then I've simply rinsed them with ro/di
water<00:01:38.750> salted<00:01:39.750> water<00:01:40.430> ro/di<00:01:41.430> salted<00:01:42.000> water

before<00:01:43.170> putting<00:01:43.409> them<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> bio<00:01:44.040> cube<00:01:44.310> so

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
before putting them in the bio cube so

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.240 
before putting them in the bio cube so
I'm<00:01:45.030> taking<00:01:45.390> out<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.659> bulk<00:01:45.869> bought<00:01:46.619> bio<00:01:46.920> balls

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
I'm taking out the bulk bought bio balls

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.620 
I'm taking out the bulk bought bio balls
and<00:01:47.570> I'm<00:01:48.570> putting<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:50.270> which<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.299> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
and I'm putting in this which is a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.100 
and I'm putting in this which is a
matrix<00:01:52.110> media<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:55.310> in<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.520> future<00:01:57.110> when

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
matrix media and in the future when

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.770 
matrix media and in the future when
there's<00:01:58.469> detritus<00:01:59.040> built<00:01:59.280> up<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.149> back<00:02:00.329> I

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
there's detritus built up in the back I

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.980 
there's detritus built up in the back I
can<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.920> take<00:02:02.100> out<00:02:02.310> one<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.119> these<00:02:03.329> at<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> time

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
can just take out one of these at a time

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.940 
can just take out one of these at a time
and<00:02:04.409> rinse<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.159> fresh<00:02:06.079> ro/di<00:02:07.079> salted<00:02:07.710> water

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and rinse it in fresh ro/di salted water

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.300 
and rinse it in fresh ro/di salted water
hopefully<00:02:08.959> it<00:02:09.959> will<00:02:10.200> reduce<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.979> amount<00:02:11.069> of

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
hopefully it will reduce the amount of

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.400 
hopefully it will reduce the amount of
maintenance<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> have<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.420> do<00:02:12.599> over
