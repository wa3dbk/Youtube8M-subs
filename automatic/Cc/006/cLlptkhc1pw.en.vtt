00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.250
 in the little school you have to the first 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.590
 that you use on the skates teach you to 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.330
 skate in the primordial once you already 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.880
 Companies to skate will be implementing 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.800
 knee pads for the canilleras falls 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.180
 for the strokes of the 8 and the clubs in 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.730
 gloves to take care of hands 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.510
 we played 4 players in which there are two 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.030
 defenses one that is the net advocate 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.670
 sensor to center 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.010
 then we find the 2 gÃ¼ines that are 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.930
 the two front ones in which is one of 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.790
 arias and the other plays out 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.410
 In total the campus is 10 let's say 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.839
 there has to be a substitute goalkeeper and 4 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.530
 players their lenses are also two 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.500
 times of 20 minutes or 25 depends on the 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.540
 competition 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.060
 In case of a tie, it will lengthen as 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.950
 any other sport and just 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.000
 later the forward is more 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.430
 destabilizing 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.540
 that the defender the defender is using 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.750
 plus the auction what 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.030
 and another thing and the medium uses more the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.450
 man the game 8 that would be like hitch 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.450
 football 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.220
 in hockey the most dynamic acting 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.750
 the archer is not like any other 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.190
 sport for soccer 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.770
 about that because they take longer to 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.120
 arrive arrive more often but 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.040
 you have to those movements more 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.650
 explosives faster because you have to 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.610
 be more attentive a situation is passed 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.780
 from attack to defense with a lot of transition 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.909
 then we have to be with 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.860
 moved physically to pass for 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.000
 play at high intensity 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.640
 the changes can occur in 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.850
 any time when the coach 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.130
 He thinks it convenient too can you 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.580
 produce the situation of some card 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.789
 blue or red in the case of blue card 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.280
 the player is removed for 2 minutes and that 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.920
 ended up in a minority the team that is 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.620
 you or the card your we force 3 against 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.230
 4 in case of red please can we return 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.989
 to enter if an amount of 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.260
 blue is red and not enter 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.260
 again
