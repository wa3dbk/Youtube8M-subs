carbon<00:02:30.290> pollution

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
carbon pollution

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.470 
carbon pollution
has<00:02:30.920> fallen<00:02:31.219> by<00:02:31.549> 10%<00:02:32.420> since<00:02:33.010> 2007<00:02:34.090> even<00:02:35.090> as

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:45.469 
doubling the pace at which we cut carbon

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.099 
doubling the pace at which we cut carbon
pollution<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.579> China<00:02:47.209> is<00:02:47.389> committed<00:02:47.870> for<00:02:47.900> the

pollution and China is committed for the
first<00:02:48.379> time<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:49.489> limiting<00:02:49.700> their<00:02:50.299> emissions

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
first time to limiting their emissions

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.709
