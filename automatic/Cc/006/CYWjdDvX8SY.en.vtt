00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
I think it's something like a commander

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.840 
I think it's something like a commander
he<00:01:00.449> has<00:01:00.690> got<00:01:00.930> armor<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.489> he's<00:01:02.670> got<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
he has got armor and not so he's got a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
he has got armor and not so he's got a
shield<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.510> his<00:01:03.690> life<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.140> obviously<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
shield and his life and obviously the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.679 
shield and his life and obviously the
disruptor<00:01:05.280> I'm<00:01:05.430> always<00:01:05.580> best<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.000> shield<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
disruptor I'm always best for shield the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.929 
disruptor I'm always best for shield the
in<00:01:06.780> San<00:01:06.960> Remo<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.560> best<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.159> armor<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.640> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
in San Remo is best for armor and you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.310 
in San Remo is best for armor and you
want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.180> keep<00:01:09.299> sweeping<00:01:09.570> swapping<00:01:10.229> your

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and when they're down to life I

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.730 
and when they're down to life I
generally<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> use<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.080> cendri<00:01:16.470> ammo

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
generally like to use in cendri ammo

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.289 
generally like to use in cendri ammo
because<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.340> stun<00:01:17.610> them<00:01:17.759> sometimes<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
because it can stun them sometimes and

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.940 
because it can stun them sometimes and
set<00:01:18.479> them<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.689> fire<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.470> just<00:01:19.650> gives<00:01:19.799> you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
set them on fire and it just gives you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.190 
set them on fire and it just gives you
an<00:01:20.250> easier<00:01:20.520> job<00:01:20.580> well<00:01:21.360> you're<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.990> right

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
harder than it needs to be but this is

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.560 
harder than it needs to be but this is
my<00:02:55.750> technique<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.380> how<00:02:56.560> people<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:58.300> worst

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
my technique and how people the worst

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.530 
my technique and how people the worst
thing<00:02:58.870> about<00:02:59.080> this<00:02:59.770> fight<00:03:00.130> is<00:03:00.460> not<00:03:01.090> only<00:03:01.390> is

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
thing about this fight is not only is

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.930 
thing about this fight is not only is
that<00:03:01.570> this<00:03:01.840> giant<00:03:02.470> machine<00:03:02.920> but<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.790> couple

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
that this giant machine but in a couple

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.700 
that this giant machine but in a couple
of<00:03:04.120> moments<00:03:04.300> it's<00:03:04.750> going<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:04.990> spawn<00:03:05.200> enemies

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
of moments it's going to spawn enemies

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.670 
of moments it's going to spawn enemies
so<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:07.750> other<00:03:07.870> places<00:03:08.320> i<00:03:08.410> tried<00:03:08.650> the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
so the the other places i tried the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.080 
so the the other places i tried the
different<00:03:09.190> vantage<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.700> try<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:09.910> get<00:03:10.060> a

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
different vantage is to try and get a

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.030 
different vantage is to try and get a
better<00:03:10.210> spot<00:03:10.480> against<00:03:10.780> this<00:03:10.930> boss<00:03:11.170> i<00:03:11.440> quickly

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.370 
pounding and the first time I played it
and<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:24.340> did<00:03:24.520> this<00:03:24.640> strategy<00:03:25.120> my<00:03:25.690> team<00:03:25.960> somehow

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
and I did this strategy my team somehow

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.290 
and I did this strategy my team somehow
stayed<00:03:26.650> alive<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.250> they<00:03:27.640> kept<00:03:27.910> him<00:03:28.060> occupied

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
stayed alive and they kept him occupied

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.760 
stayed alive and they kept him occupied
while<00:03:28.480> I<00:03:28.660> shot<00:03:28.960> him<00:03:29.050> in<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.230> back<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.650> it

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
while I shot him in the back and it

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.230 
while I shot him in the back and it
worked<00:03:29.950> really<00:03:30.220> well<00:03:30.370> but<00:03:30.970> on<00:03:31.120> this

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
worked really well but on this

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.420 
worked really well but on this
playthrough<00:03:31.510> my<00:03:32.050> team<00:03:32.290> died<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:33.100> doesn't

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
playthrough my team died and it doesn't

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.040 
playthrough my team died and it doesn't
quite<00:03:33.490> work<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:34.060> he<00:03:34.120> actually<00:03:34.240> moves<00:03:34.660> over<00:03:35.020> to

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
quite work and he actually moves over to

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.990 
quite work and he actually moves over to
try<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.410> shoot<00:03:35.620> at<00:03:35.770> the<00:03:35.860> krogan<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:36.700> I<00:03:36.730> have<00:03:36.910> to

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
try and shoot at the krogan so I have to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.370 
try and shoot at the krogan so I have to
put<00:03:37.150> myself<00:03:37.300> in<00:03:37.630> danger<00:03:37.990> to<00:03:38.110> get<00:03:38.260> his

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
put myself in danger to get his

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.260 
put myself in danger to get his
attention<00:03:38.500> again<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.280> then<00:03:39.610> get<00:03:39.820> back<00:03:40.000> into

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
attention again and then get back into

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.530 
attention again and then get back into
the<00:03:40.890> inter<00:03:41.890> cover<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:43.030> reason<00:03:43.360> that<00:03:43.390> this

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
the inter cover and the reason that this

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.330 
the inter cover and the reason that this
happens<00:03:43.600> is<00:03:44.080> one<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.560> those<00:03:44.740> enemies<00:03:45.220> I've

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
happens is one of those enemies I've

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.830 
happens is one of those enemies I've
mentioned<00:03:45.520> throws<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.030> grenade<00:03:46.240> at<00:03:46.420> me<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:46.780> the

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
mentioned throws a grenade at me and the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.240 
mentioned throws a grenade at me and the
only<00:03:46.959> way<00:03:47.140> to<00:03:47.200> evade<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.650> grenade<00:03:47.950> is<00:03:48.130> to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
only way to evade the grenade is to

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.500 
only way to evade the grenade is to
actually<00:03:48.370> drop<00:03:48.670> down<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:49.000> ladder<00:03:49.209> that<00:03:49.420> we

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
actually drop down the ladder that we

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.620 
actually drop down the ladder that we
climbed<00:03:49.780> up<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.080> get<00:03:50.230> here<00:03:50.560> so<00:03:51.250> this<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.420> the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
climbed up to get here so this is the

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.390 
climbed up to get here so this is the
safest<00:03:53.080> place<00:03:53.320> to<00:03:53.350> kill<00:03:53.680> this<00:03:53.830> boss<00:03:54.070> but<00:03:54.340> at

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
safest place to kill this boss but at

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.100 
safest place to kill this boss but at
the<00:03:54.490> same<00:03:54.670> time<00:03:54.910> it's<00:03:55.420> still<00:03:55.870> pretty

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
the same time it's still pretty

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.140 
the same time it's still pretty
dangerous<00:03:56.709> if<00:03:56.830> you<00:03:57.160> get<00:03:57.310> unlucky<00:03:57.580> but<00:03:57.850> this<00:03:58.000> is

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
dangerous if you get unlucky but this is

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.820 
dangerous if you get unlucky but this is
all<00:03:58.300> about<00:03:58.540> your<00:03:58.690> team<00:03:58.900> staying<00:03:59.230> alive<00:03:59.530> and

all about your team staying alive and
it's<00:04:00.100> all<00:04:00.220> about<00:04:00.430> where<00:04:00.640> those<00:04:00.790> soldiers<00:04:01.150> that

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
it's all about where those soldiers that

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.670 
it's all about where those soldiers that
I<00:04:01.540> can't<00:04:01.840> see<00:04:02.140> a<00:04:02.350> moving<00:04:03.240> but<00:04:04.240> his<00:04:05.230> first<00:04:05.500> life

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
I can't see a moving but his first life

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.500 
I can't see a moving but his first life
part<00:04:05.980> is<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.280> shield<00:04:06.640> so<00:04:07.030> just<00:04:07.209> usually

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
part is the shield so just usually

what's just happened because of that

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.260 
what's just happened because of that

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
back so now I have to switch to

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.740 
back so now I have to switch to
disruptor<00:06:03.640> ammo<00:06:03.880> to<00:06:04.030> take<00:06:04.210> it<00:06:04.330> off<00:06:04.450> and<00:06:04.720> then

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
disruptor ammo to take it off and then

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.680 
disruptor ammo to take it off and then
switch<00:06:05.440> to<00:06:05.470> in<00:06:05.680> sundry<00:06:05.979> a<00:06:06.010> mortar<00:06:06.490> to<00:06:07.360> take<00:06:07.540> it

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
switch to in sundry a mortar to take it

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.340 
switch to in sundry a mortar to take it
out<00:06:07.840> but<00:06:09.330> this<00:06:10.330> this<00:06:10.660> makes<00:06:10.930> me<00:06:11.080> think<00:06:11.110> that

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
out but this this makes me think that

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.450 
out but this this makes me think that
this<00:06:11.410> game<00:06:11.560> is<00:06:11.710> going<00:06:11.950> to<00:06:12.010> be<00:06:12.070> hard<00:06:12.340> on

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
this game is going to be hard on

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.760 
this game is going to be hard on
insanity<00:06:12.760> and<00:06:13.240> as<00:06:14.020> I<00:06:14.200> mentioned<00:06:14.229> in<00:06:14.650> the<00:06:14.680> last

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
insanity and as I mentioned in the last

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.560 
insanity and as I mentioned in the last
video<00:06:15.070> I<00:06:15.460> may<00:06:15.820> be<00:06:15.880> fighting<00:06:16.330> this<00:06:16.419> battle

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
video I may be fighting this battle

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
wrong there may be a technique like a

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.800 
wrong there may be a technique like a
week's<00:06:18.370> point<00:06:18.669> he's<00:06:19.150> got<00:06:19.360> something<00:06:19.690> on<00:06:19.750> his
