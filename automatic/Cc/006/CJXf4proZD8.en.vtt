and just jump into this I prepare the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.089 
and just jump into this I prepare the
demo<00:00:22.260> directory<00:00:22.500> for<00:00:23.130> today's<00:00:23.810> session<00:00:24.810> and

demo directory for today's session and

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.589 
demo directory for today's session and
let's<00:00:26.099> navigate<00:00:26.580> into<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:28.640> if<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:30.150> look<00:00:30.300> here

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
let's navigate into that if we look here

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.810 
let's navigate into that if we look here
we'll<00:00:30.929> see<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.500> couple<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.800> different<00:00:32.160> files<00:00:32.430> to

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
we'll see a couple of different files to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.270 
we'll see a couple of different files to
ps1<00:00:33.180> files<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.960> service<00:00:34.320> demo<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.860> VMI

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
ps1 files a service demo and a VMI

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.670 
ps1 files a service demo and a VMI
Explorer<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.750> let's<00:00:36.930> start<00:00:37.200> with<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> simple

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
Explorer so let's start with a simple

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.369 
Explorer so let's start with a simple
and<00:00:38.070> upgraded<00:00:38.610> feature<00:00:38.790> from<00:00:39.090> last<00:00:39.270> time<00:00:39.570> VMI

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
and upgraded feature from last time VMI

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.030 
and upgraded feature from last time VMI
Explorer

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
Explorer

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.600 
Explorer
that's<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.640> powershell<00:00:42.180> script<00:00:43.219> so<00:00:44.219> let's<00:00:44.430> run

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
that's a powershell script so let's run

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.600 
that's a powershell script so let's run
that<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.120> know<00:00:45.300> what<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.600> expect<00:00:46.340> this<00:00:47.340> is

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
that so you know what to expect this is

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.420 
that so you know what to expect this is
an<00:00:47.760> app<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.379> looks<00:00:49.710> pretty<00:00:50.010> much<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.219> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
an app just it looks pretty much like a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.110 
an app just it looks pretty much like a
Windows<00:00:50.879> app<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.949> could<00:00:52.949> be<00:00:53.070> pretty<00:00:53.670> useful

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
Windows app so could be pretty useful

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.220 
Windows app so could be pretty useful
tool<00:00:54.649> so<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.190> want<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.460> make<00:00:56.850> into<00:00:57.719> an<00:00:57.809> exe

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
tool so this I want to make into an exe

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.270 
tool so this I want to make into an exe
file<00:00:59.840> upgrade<00:01:00.840> since<00:01:01.109> last<00:01:01.350> time<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.890> you

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
file upgrade since last time is that you

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.579 
file upgrade since last time is that you
don't<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.940> specify<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.600> name<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
don't have to specify the name of the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.130 
don't have to specify the name of the
output<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.790> don't<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.510> specify<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
output and you don't have to specify the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.530 
output and you don't have to specify the
name<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> icon<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:08.820> there<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.090> an<00:01:09.240> icon

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
name of the icon so if there is an icon

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.109 
name of the icon so if there is an icon
with<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.020> same<00:01:10.380> name<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.280> script<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.909> will

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
with the same name as the script it will

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.210 
with the same name as the script it will
automatically<00:01:12.750> bind<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
automatically bind that to the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.940 
automatically bind that to the
executable<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.990> let's<00:01:16.290> create<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.860> new

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
executable so let's create a new

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.539 
executable so let's create a new
self-hosted<00:01:17.909> PS<00:01:18.270> file<00:01:18.710> let's<00:01:19.710> call<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.040> VMI

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
self-hosted PS file let's call it VMI

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.410 
self-hosted PS file let's call it VMI
Explorer<00:01:21.330> dot<00:01:21.990> P<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.320> one<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.070> very<00:01:24.000> simple

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
Explorer dot P is one so very simple

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
Explorer dot P is one so very simple
command<00:01:25.430> just<00:01:26.430> run<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:27.560> if<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:29.310> look<00:01:29.460> down

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
command just run that if we look down

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.499 
command just run that if we look down
here<00:01:29.700> got<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.600> exe<00:01:30.990> file<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:32.210> it's<00:01:33.210> got<00:01:33.390> to

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
here got the exe file and it's got to

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.740 
here got the exe file and it's got to
write<00:01:33.689> icon<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.320> well<00:01:35.030> let's<00:01:36.030> run<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:39.630> we

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
write icon as well let's run that and we

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.010 
write icon as well let's run that and we
got<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.170> here<00:01:40.820> I<00:01:41.820> still<00:01:42.299> get<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.509> console

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
got it up here I still get the console

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.560 
got it up here I still get the console
though<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.340> need<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.640> remove<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.270> it's

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
though if we need to remove that it's

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.649 
though if we need to remove that it's
still<00:01:45.810> possible<00:01:46.070> we<00:01:47.070> use<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.549> same<00:01:47.820> switch<00:01:48.420> as

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
still possible we use the same switch as

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.950 
still possible we use the same switch as
last<00:01:48.930> time<00:01:49.170> let<00:01:49.409> me<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.560> remove<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.689> XE<00:01:51.689> file

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
last time let me just remove the XE file

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:02.990 
last time let me just remove the XE file
here<00:01:53.750> so<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.790> just<00:01:57.200> hide<00:01:58.200> console<00:02:01.399> again<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
here so and just hide console again the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.130 
here so and just hide console again the
exe<00:02:03.540> file<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.899> generated<00:02:04.079> got<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> right<00:02:05.040> icon

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
exe file is generated got the right icon

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.710 
exe file is generated got the right icon
and<00:02:07.140> when<00:02:07.740> we<00:02:07.860> run<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.330> just<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.569> the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
and when we run it we just see the

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.289 
and when we run it we just see the
console<00:02:10.080> quickly<00:02:10.560> blinking<00:02:10.979> by

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
console quickly blinking by

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.420 
console quickly blinking by
and<00:02:12.750> now<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:13.530> don't<00:02:13.739> have<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.400> anymore<00:02:16.430> so

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
and now we don't have that anymore so

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.640 
and now we don't have that anymore so
that's<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.849> quick<00:02:18.150> way<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.650> simplifying

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
that's a quick way and simplifying

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.500 
that's a quick way and simplifying
generating<00:02:21.079> files<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:23.359> completely<00:02:24.359> new

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
generating files a completely new

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.630 
generating files a completely new
feature<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.230> possibility<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.430> get

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
feature is the possibility to get

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.479 
feature is the possibility to get
information<00:02:26.939> about<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:28.530> file<00:02:29.129> that<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.340> have

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
information about a file that you have

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
I've done now is to actually make it

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.909 
I've done now is to actually make it
possible<00:03:09.329> to<00:03:09.599> run<00:03:09.900> services<00:03:12.919> PowerShell

scripts<00:03:14.250> as<00:03:14.450> services<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:16.349> we're<00:03:16.590> going<00:03:16.769> to

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
scripts as services and we're going to

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.430 
scripts as services and we're going to
look<00:03:16.979> at<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.579> service<00:03:18.299> demo<00:03:18.540> dot<00:03:18.900> P<00:03:19.139> is<00:03:19.229> one

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
look at the service demo dot P is one

file<00:03:19.709> now<00:03:19.979> if<00:03:20.419> I<00:03:21.419> open<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:21.930> up<00:03:22.909> you<00:03:23.909> can<00:03:24.120> see

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
file now if I open this up you can see

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.199 
file now if I open this up you can see
here<00:03:24.510> there<00:03:24.810> is<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.989> function<00:03:25.500> main<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:26.220> the

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
here there is a function main and the

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.420 
here there is a function main and the
only<00:03:27.449> thing<00:03:27.659> that<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:28.319> function<00:03:28.889> does<00:03:29.159> is

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
only thing that this function does is

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.869 
only thing that this function does is
it's<00:03:29.959> infinite<00:03:30.959> while<00:03:31.500> loop<00:03:31.829> here<00:03:32.159> that<00:03:32.400> will

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
it's infinite while loop here that will

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.969 
it's infinite while loop here that will
never<00:03:33.150> end<00:03:33.479> because<00:03:34.109> that's<00:03:34.290> managed<00:03:34.769> by<00:03:34.919> the

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
never end because that's managed by the

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:39.289 
never end because that's managed by the
service<00:03:35.400> itself<00:03:36.379> during<00:03:37.379> this<00:03:37.530> loop<00:03:38.299> we

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
service itself during this loop we

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.530 
service itself during this loop we
actually<00:03:40.079> take<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.919> date<00:03:41.180> print<00:03:42.180> that<00:03:42.329> out<00:03:42.389> to

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
actually take the date print that out to

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
actually take the date print that out to
a<00:03:42.720> file<00:03:43.049> called<00:03:43.409> demo<00:03:44.299> txt<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.629> appending

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
a file called demo txt and appending

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.550 
a file called demo txt and appending
that<00:03:46.739> I'll<00:03:47.189> actually<00:03:47.489> introduce<00:03:48.449> a<00:03:48.769> another

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
that I'll actually introduce a another

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.649 
that I'll actually introduce a another
little<00:03:52.560> variable<00:03:53.040> here<00:03:53.400> let's<00:03:53.819> take<00:03:54.209> start

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
little variable here let's take start

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.860 
little variable here let's take start
sleep<00:03:55.109> 5<00:03:55.530> seconds<00:03:56.159> just<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.150> make<00:03:57.389> sure<00:03:57.629> that

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
sleep 5 seconds just to make sure that

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.379 
sleep 5 seconds just to make sure that
we<00:03:58.560> don't<00:03:58.769> use<00:03:59.579> all<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.819> available<00:04:00.030> resources

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
we don't use all the available resources

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.559 
we don't use all the available resources
in<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.199> computer<00:04:01.970> so<00:04:02.970> I'm<00:04:03.060> going<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.359> save

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
that one and go over here so the command

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.460 
that one and go over here so the command
is<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.209> same<00:04:09.419> as<00:04:09.629> before<00:04:09.840> new<00:04:10.379> self-hosted<00:04:11.269> PS

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
for the GUI as well so let's call it

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.280 
for the GUI as well so let's call it
like<00:04:51.600> that<00:04:52.910> so<00:04:53.910> we'll<00:04:54.240> run<00:04:54.540> with<00:04:54.780> that<00:04:55.020> and

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
like that so we'll run with that and

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.790 
like that so we'll run with that and

line<00:05:06.530> so<00:05:07.530> we<00:05:07.860> cannot<00:05:08.130> actually<00:05:08.460> start<00:05:08.910> it<00:05:09.030> from

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
line so we cannot actually start it from

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.390 
line so we cannot actually start it from
the<00:05:09.240> command<00:05:09.600> line<00:05:09.660> we<00:05:10.440> need<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:10.770> install<00:05:11.190> it

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
the command line we need to install it

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.640 
the command line we need to install it
as<00:05:11.550> a<00:05:11.880> service

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
as a service

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.030 
as a service
this<00:05:14.490> is<00:05:14.850> something<00:05:15.720> that<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.990> can<00:05:16.170> do<00:05:16.350> with

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
this is something that you can do with

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.090 
this is something that you can do with
install<00:05:17.940> util<00:05:18.510> or<00:05:18.930> or<00:05:19.770> use<00:05:20.040> the<00:05:20.340> built-in

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
install util or or use the built-in

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.690 
install util or or use the built-in
feature<00:05:24.260> install<00:05:25.260> and<00:05:25.650> then<00:05:26.250> you<00:05:26.400> have<00:05:26.580> the

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
feature install and then you have the

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.350 
feature install and then you have the
corresponding<00:05:27.060> uninstall<00:05:27.930> for<00:05:28.830> the<00:05:28.920> service

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
corresponding uninstall for the service

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.680 
corresponding uninstall for the service
so<00:05:30.360> just<00:05:30.630> running<00:05:30.870> this<00:05:31.640> ok<00:05:32.640> it<00:05:32.970> installed<00:05:33.540> the

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
so just running this ok it installed the

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:41.210 
so just running this ok it installed the
application<00:05:35.300> we<00:05:36.300> should<00:05:36.570> see<00:05:36.870> here<00:05:37.380> a<00:05:37.530> I<00:05:40.220> went

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
application we should see here a I went

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.700 
application we should see here a I went
in<00:05:41.280> to<00:05:41.370> refresh<00:05:41.820> we<00:05:42.660> have<00:05:42.780> the<00:05:42.930> service<00:05:43.470> demo

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
in to refresh we have the service demo

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.390 
in to refresh we have the service demo
here<00:05:44.040> I<00:05:44.310> set<00:05:45.030> the<00:05:45.120> type<00:05:45.330> to<00:05:45.950> manual<00:05:46.950> startup

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
here I set the type to manual startup

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.960 
here I set the type to manual startup
type<00:05:48.530> just<00:05:49.530> because<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:50.010> perhaps<00:05:50.520> want<00:05:50.850> to

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
type just because you perhaps want to

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.930 
type just because you perhaps want to
adjust<00:05:51.180> something<00:05:51.960> around<00:05:52.650> it<00:05:52.920> and<00:05:53.160> from<00:05:53.730> of

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
adjust something around it and from of

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.070 
adjust something around it and from of
these<00:05:54.180> values<00:05:54.780> are<00:05:55.020> hard-coded<00:05:56.720> so<00:05:57.720> let's

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
these values are hard-coded so let's

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.590 
these values are hard-coded so let's
start<00:05:58.590> a<00:05:58.740> service<00:06:00.950> so<00:06:01.950> it's<00:06:02.070> running<00:06:02.450> you<00:06:03.450> can

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
start a service so it's running you can

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.080 
start a service so it's running you can
see<00:06:03.750> that<00:06:03.900> it<00:06:04.050> produced<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:04.680> demo<00:06:05.250> txt<00:06:05.820> file

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
see that it produced the demo txt file

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.930 
see that it produced the demo txt file
and<00:06:06.920> it<00:06:07.920> has<00:06:08.100> already<00:06:08.460> run<00:06:08.880> two<00:06:09.570> times<00:06:10.940> you

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
and it has already run two times you

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.890 
and it has already run two times you
open<00:06:12.060> it<00:06:12.300> again<00:06:12.890> run<00:06:13.890> on<00:06:14.040> third<00:06:14.280> time<00:06:14.750> so<00:06:15.750> this

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
open it again run on third time so this

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.130 
open it again run on third time so this
is<00:06:16.110> perfect<00:06:16.650> for<00:06:16.710> background<00:06:17.370> jobs<00:06:18.140> things

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
is perfect for background jobs things

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.790 
is perfect for background jobs things
that<00:06:19.410> you<00:06:19.560> need<00:06:19.800> to<00:06:19.830> run<00:06:20.400> on<00:06:20.850> the<00:06:21.000> server

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
that you need to run on the server

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.430 
that you need to run on the server
permanently<00:06:23.150> and<00:06:24.950> let's<00:06:25.950> go<00:06:26.130> ahead<00:06:26.250> and<00:06:27.440> close

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
permanently and let's go ahead and close

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.430 
permanently and let's go ahead and close
it<00:06:28.740> and<00:06:28.980> it<00:06:29.190> what<00:06:30.000> it<00:06:30.120> does<00:06:30.150> when<00:06:30.660> it<00:06:30.780> closes<00:06:31.260> it

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
it and it what it does when it closes it

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.880 
it and it what it does when it closes it
gives<00:06:31.800> a<00:06:32.070> signal<00:06:32.820> to<00:06:33.210> complete<00:06:33.660> to<00:06:34.290> the<00:06:34.530> script

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
gives a signal to complete to the script

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.390 
gives a signal to complete to the script
so<00:06:35.130> you<00:06:35.190> actually<00:06:35.400> have<00:06:35.760> a<00:06:35.820> chance<00:06:36.690> to<00:06:37.220> wrap<00:06:38.220> up

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
so you actually have a chance to wrap up

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.939 
so you actually have a chance to wrap up
what<00:06:38.640> you're<00:06:38.820> doing

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:39.949 
what you're doing

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.950 
what you're doing
so<00:06:40.949> those<00:06:41.189> were<00:06:41.460> some<00:06:41.909> of<00:06:42.150> the<00:06:42.240> new<00:06:42.389> features

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
so those were some of the new features

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.820 
so those were some of the new features
that<00:06:42.990> is<00:06:43.559> available<00:06:44.099> in<00:06:44.189> the<00:06:45.229> 12.00<00:06:46.229> version

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
that is available in the 12.00 version

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.549
