00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.670
 so 1.14 safe dlc information 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.380
 I was online for this video I am 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.880
 not only I have in the company of your nest 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.679
 meuse 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.350
 hi everyone so that's like 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.910
 so you know it for every dlc that 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.520
 it's just an update where a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.160
 new dlc lease is often themes 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.609
 as the theme beachmen the holy theme 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.769
 valentine 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.340
 so this time there will be a new 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.349
 theme so the new theme will be the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.559
 hippie theme so why hippie because 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.920
 that in the title of the hipster dmcc so 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.840
 here and will be aware of the 60s 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.480
 so in this dlc you can find 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.309
 full of so many elements of 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.170
 the old time so the 60s 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.210
 for example in the breasts I think 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.559
 we will find big revolver he 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.809
 Until recently that weapons have been 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.940
 shutters but we know that there will be 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.399
 xix is ​​not going to defend the tooth 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.859
 that as in the years then 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.750
 there the sorts of red bull slim jeans to 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.739
 just about what there will be there will also be 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.210
 free tuition to all kinds 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.540
 of bees rossi haircuts 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.850
 which will be very original so as the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.010
 spices get dressed and cash headdress to 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.689
 the time I will leave your gamers 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 to explain a little bit 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.189
 cars that wants to have so in 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.229
 this next dlc so already the first 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.689
 car that was unveiled this is the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.150
 good falls so the tip to the good one has 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.610
 an image pretty much of what she 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.409
 looks so here we are not sure to 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.329
 100% career will look like that 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.100
 officially 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.020
 then there will therefore Rhapsody 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.299
 retro car so it shows enough 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.640
 that they were going to be around the 60s 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.650
 So it really hippie and the Pope 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.310
 is also said will be a super sports 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.100
 classic so in my opinion we think that 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.200
 because here in the lot of cars 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.509
 there is always a sporty flavor but 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.979
 so there we could have been an athlete 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.909
 so I think it will be this one this 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.759
 will surely be a sports charge 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.250
 classic luxury and the theme of 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.979
 sixties pretty much so too 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.070
 in the seven cars so in the es4 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.690
 we could have got you 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.479
 made 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.280
 eros and bled and the clinton so there 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.890
 glendale and the blade that are two 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.270
 big street cars so from gta 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.790
 is addressed at the time for 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.620
 connoisseurs for the nostalgic rsa 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.230
 it's nice to find so 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.400
 two years and a car I know I 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.770
 believe that the glendale was the 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.720
 car where we could put supers 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.590
 suspension there to do the competitions 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.180
 in gta san andreas 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.240
 in the first missions for those 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.190
 who remember that's so prepared 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.900
 so we can cook them but that 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.630
 would make monsters coeff 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.420
 good after we are basically it was written 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.960
 so in the in the information of the 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.040
 deaths that it would be affordable prices 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.780
 so affordable prices 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.070
 that means it will be in a month 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.470
 about thirty thousand forty thousand on 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.580
 so basically say that no matter 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.170
 which player is not necessarily 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.240
 hyper rich can enjoy this 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.500
 death I think it's pretty good of 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.760
 eurostar's share of having done that as 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.890
 that at least it's not like in the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.570
 ancient essays where there was by 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.100
 example the z porn and this thing like that 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.920
 cars that cost super expensive 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.240
 kind 700000 that good after I think that 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.300
 many of us have enough 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.250
 money thanks to the thanks to the big ones 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.560
 shits among the acquired all be like 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.060
 we can often make money 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.060
 thanks to lychees everything is surely for you 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.020
 could see on my channel so when 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.250
 even I think there is still a 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.440
 small minority of players who do not have 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.850
 a lot of money so to make some 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.220
 cars like that like the glendale where 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.570
 the blade that need not be they 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.770
 should be below 50 but I think 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.480
 it must be pretty good 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.790
 especially after we can kill them and 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.800
 after that can be original of the born case 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.739
 in his way times after as they have 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.840
 wrote in the site their hidden potential 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.220
 it was written so hidden potential that 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.320
 means that for example there would have 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.959
 maybe areas and improvements 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.730
 really unique about his cars on 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.870
 these two cars for example I know 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.780
 not like old-fashioned in gta 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.090
 for the super suspension 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.850
 do not know we ask to see and that's it 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.440
 we do not know a loan we have a lot 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.830
 often talk 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.510
 also robberies so they have 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.450
 finally who ever goes out what but I think 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.370
 that for this dlc this he will go out because 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.930
 that people neither fixed in the 60s 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.450
 so there was a lot of robberies in 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.360
 those years that I think he's going 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.660
 go out for this dlc and in addition they have 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.240
 they pronounced it already in autumn and 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.090
 so here is the good period 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.530
 we will say that like that so we would like 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.930
 although the robberies happen for this 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.880
 dlc 1.14 it's still a rumor this 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.250
 is not official but I think 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.320
 it's a small wink since in 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.550
 the 60s so in years like 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.420
 that hippies there were big 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.100
 bank robbers 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.440
 I do not think for those who know 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.850
 the story here in my opinion it would be 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.420
 smart to put the robberies in 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.610
 this dlc 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.810
 that's all I think we all have 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.180
 more questions after if you have 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.590
 other questions we are here for me I 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.000
 think we already said everything so yeah 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.800
 in this dishes do you expect 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.120
 not find cars like the 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.210
 role to internet users of cars 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.560
 really athletic expect rather 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.020
 to find a style really old-fashioned 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.940
 for really hippie peace and love with 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.120
 really original haircuts 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.710
 really crazy defect but the flowers 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.330
 to be like that what does he really foot 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.980
 what really retro style cars 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.220
 and all with enough forms to his 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.960
 horses low voice and sb your buzz 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.300
 here I leave a huge void for 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.850
 say a little word of the end peace and 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.740
 love the genres with so is neither the 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.419
 do not forget to like commenting on the video 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.050
 of course if it brought you 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.730
 news 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.510
 we meet for a next video 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.510
 be warm
