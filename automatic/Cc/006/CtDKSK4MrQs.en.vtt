00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 books in French is my 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.359
 biggest challenge because I'm still 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.309
 learning to speak French 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.070
 I study a little more than one year to 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.650
 language and the whole process is 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.379
 that I still get used to the language to 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.779
 grammar is as complicated as the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.850
 grammar of any Latin language but 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.710
 is different from that of the grammar of the language 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.260
 then we get confused by the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.910
 time all different pronunciation then I 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.010
 I will pass on to you the experiences 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.230
 I already had with reading that worked 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.190
 For me but remembering that I'm one. 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.440
 basic level almost reaching the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.239
 intermediary in the end I'm going here 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.210
 a student experience for the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.739
 student books that I could read and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.079
 You are very proud of that. 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.329
 and I got to read this book is a book 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.480
 is finding in the bookstore in the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.850
 part of the middleton textbooks 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.730
 Which in Portuguese do I remember? 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.609
 I wrote at the time it's plunged and falls 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.899
 a trap the inspector created me he is 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.780
 a very popular detective is given to 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.549
 Belgian French culture so it is 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.560
 best of that old story of 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.210
 police books the tram who is 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.619
 learning and police books that 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.159
 We always understood what the book is going to. 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.619
 contain not always having a crime one and 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.960
 has been trying to investigate this crime and 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.939
 in the end he discovers that he was the criminal 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.159
 It's always this routine then for us. 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.180
 is learning and will lose part 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.850
 because we can not 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.860
 to understand everything is much easier to start 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.409
 with books so cops 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.610
 This is a textbook as well. 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.070
 his level is 1500 words to achieve 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.420
 read even with a certain tranquility 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.210
 also another book and so it is not 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.700
 teaching is a real book in shells 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.560
 I already did review here is the type and 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.530
 sombrio monte in Portuguese and was 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.320
 translated as fear and submission and he 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.750
 It was written by this time that you have the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.090
 her photo here on the cover because this book 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.280
 It's kind of self-biographical he tells 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.409
 The story of her that grew up in Japan is 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.930
 belgian birth and growing japan 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.970
 She tells you about the first stage. 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.099
 that she found a Japanese company and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.140
 the cultural shock that she lived was a 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.910
 terrible year only disaster a book 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.370
 funny and I read this book when 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.870
 I had to seal the six months of class I 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.400
 never thought I 'd be able to read a 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.500
 book is not a book for 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.110
 students but my teacher 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.000
 guaranteed that it was simple guaranteed 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.010
 that I could really understand 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.830
 make it clear by always supporting me 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.190
 dictionary more but look it's only letters 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.200
 huge and quick to read and also a 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.000
 good tip worked for me I think 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.980
 It can work for you too. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.170
