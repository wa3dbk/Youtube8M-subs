00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.199
 huge eyes and separated their 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.350
 head and ears round sun 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.099
 flat nose located exactly between the eyes 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.219
 and a sturdy body of what made chest sun 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:23.519
 so is the exotic cat a race that was created by the human being of 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.640
 chance 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.640
 and whose origins are difficult to track 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.960
 the Qatari 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.350
 belongs to the dog breed 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.790
 but once 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.930
 the static gap aecc has the same physical characteristics or 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.770
 Business 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.670
 but with short hair 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.670
 those of Persian for example it would be like her having hair 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.470
 It is a compliment 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.600
 and he would be an exotic 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.430
 the access to the peak I started breeders pride for the 60's 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.220
 what they were looking for was the departure 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.720
 bnp net 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.150
 Persian cats 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.290
 if the complications of Persian peru 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.020
 they started in the sixties to cross with an American shorthair 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.000
 and for the year 71 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.470
 already considered 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.710
 a race the exotic and 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.760
 the raising of exotic spending 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.530
 It is very difficult due to the large size of his head the births are difficult 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.240
 the litters are usually not more than 3 or 4 kittens, which is not easy 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.380
 get ahead 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.210
 since many do not exceed the passage of breast milk to conventional food 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.260
 once they have grown they do not need special attention 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.220
 that's why before courtois they need 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.660
 but I prefer the inverse 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.260
 as for example bathroom 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
 continuous at least once at least twice 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.430
 so much so that the backdrop and short hair but to him 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.050
 much more hair density 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.210
 i also there are 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.630
 maybe not so big 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.630
 the most line that killed him 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.630
 colom almond 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.590
 they indicated that these exotic 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.189
 It is very simple 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.359
 we just need a pen for example 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.189
 and the kittens will not be able to resist following her with their eyes 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.189
 willing to jump on it 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.009
 Acapulco killed badly 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:28.669
 eat to eat different 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:29.749
 the data is ethical 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.189
 in one act it is a little more manipulated by the hand of man 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.089
 with indoor sea data 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:40.469
 mandate to be at home quiet are not parties want to go out to the street or 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:45.269
 hunt or st county a little bit more perverse hunter instinct 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.879
 but comparing it with the cat or common 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.139
 now well beyond the much quieter format much more feasible power of 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.059
 be able to have in a house or in a plis 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:57.219
 the tranquility of good 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.179
 despite a fact that was 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.839
 very very quiet 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.669
 thing that most of the other vaccine 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.950
 this much more active data needs more benefits 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.049
 and they do little or nothing 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.149
 gere can do them so fine sanitary topics 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.209
 the couch 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.209
 a little bit of wii game 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:20.199
 and tanned 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.529
 coffee rillo 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:26.739
 bim bam bum and almond tree are some of the names of these puppies that 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.599
 milian would go with affection 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.959
 hoping to find in a litter a unique and special kitten 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:35.569
 apart from power 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:36.899
 You have to take them out 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.899
 in a bed a lot 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.679
 and I at least what you want to get thing 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:47.529
 and that adapt to the standard to be able to go expertise or 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:48.679
 teach 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:49.839
 more than selling 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:53.199
 I'm looking forward to the position or really nice to stay and 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.769
 take it on exhibition 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.499
 although with age they become more fragile and affectionate 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:05.019
 these animals keep their playful character throughout their lives 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.919
 characterizes this race 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.729
 what makes them the perfect companions for lovers of 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.959
 cats
