00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.120 

this<00:00:00.329> is<00:00:00.480> an<00:00:00.630> inch-and-a-quarter<00:00:01.490> ram<00:00:02.490> pump

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.130 
this is an inch-and-a-quarter ram pump

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.570 
this is an inch-and-a-quarter ram pump
what<00:00:05.130> this<00:00:05.310> does<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:06.029> takes<00:00:07.250> falling<00:00:08.250> water

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
what this does is it takes falling water

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.620 
what this does is it takes falling water
and<00:00:09.740> pumps<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.889> vertical<00:00:11.429> under<00:00:12.179> high

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
and pumps it vertical under high

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.290 
and pumps it vertical under high
pressure<00:00:14.089> so<00:00:16.550> this<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.609> an<00:00:17.970> inch<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.270> a

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
pressure so this is an inch and a

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.540 
pressure so this is an inch and a
quarter<00:00:18.480> shutoff<00:00:19.020> valve<00:00:19.350> all<00:00:19.680> these<00:00:20.070> nipples

quarter shutoff valve all these nipples

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.380 
quarter shutoff valve all these nipples
are<00:00:20.730> three<00:00:21.029> inches<00:00:21.330> long<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.680> union<00:00:23.609> to

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
are three inches long this is a union to

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.330 
are three inches long this is a union to
disconnect<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.289> service<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.830> pump<00:00:26.099> for

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
disconnect it to service the pump for

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.830 
disconnect it to service the pump for
any<00:00:26.460> reason<00:00:27.260> this<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> brass<00:00:29.519> swing<00:00:30.449> check

valve this is a spring check valve this
is<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> pressure<00:00:40.680> chamber<00:00:41.070> which<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.940> going

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
is the pressure chamber which is going

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.959 
is the pressure chamber which is going

to be filled with this and what that

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.209 
to be filled with this and what that
keeps<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.510> from<00:00:45.539> doing<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.920> chamber

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
keeps it from doing is that chamber

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
got to be sure to do is use a cleaner on

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.630 
got to be sure to do is use a cleaner on
both<00:01:13.710> sides<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.060> PVC<00:01:15.659> fittings<00:01:16.640> because

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
both sides of the PVC fittings because

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.630 
both sides of the PVC fittings because
this<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> shock<00:01:18.900> wave<00:01:19.400> that's<00:01:20.400> how<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
this is a shock wave that's how a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.999 
this is a shock wave that's how a
hydraulic<00:01:21.210> ram<00:01:21.420> pump<00:01:21.659> works<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.650> shock<00:01:22.979> wave

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
hydraulic ram pump works that shock wave

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.249 
hydraulic ram pump works that shock wave
could<00:01:23.610> break<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> fittings<00:01:24.390> what<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
could break the fittings what the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.499 
could break the fittings what the
cleaner<00:01:25.530> does<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:26.130> primer<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:27.439> that<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.590> starts

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
cleaner does in primer is that it starts

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.010 
cleaner does in primer is that it starts
melting<00:01:30.920> both<00:01:31.920> sides<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> PVC<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
melting both sides of the PVC the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.410 
melting both sides of the PVC the
fitting<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> nipple<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.119> when<00:01:36.299> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
fitting in the nipple so that when you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.100 
fitting in the nipple so that when you
glue<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.640> more<00:01:38.640> fuse<00:01:39.119> together<00:01:39.390> so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
glue it it's it's more fuse together so

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.830 
glue it it's it's more fuse together so
if<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.740> cleaner<00:01:41.100> will<00:01:41.369> actually<00:01:41.880> start

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
if this cleaner will actually start

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.069 
if this cleaner will actually start
melting<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.470> PVC<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> fusing<00:01:45.630> process

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
melting the PVC for the fusing process

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.100 
melting the PVC for the fusing process
very<00:01:46.350> critical<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.180> on<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.479> portion<00:01:48.810> of

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
very critical to do on this portion of

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.050 
very critical to do on this portion of
it<00:01:49.259> where<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.009> shock<00:01:50.250> wave<00:01:50.490> occurs<00:01:52.790> back<00:01:53.790> here

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
it where the shock wave occurs back here

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.609 
it where the shock wave occurs back here
it's<00:01:54.210> important<00:01:54.600> not<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.780> use<00:01:54.930> threaded

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
it's important not to use threaded

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.670 
it's important not to use threaded
fittings<00:01:56.040> because<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.700> pressure<00:01:57.030> gets

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
fittings because this pressure gets

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.560 
fittings because this pressure gets
pretty<00:01:58.680> big<00:01:58.920> there's<00:01:59.430> no<00:01:59.610> shock<00:01:59.969> wave<00:02:00.240> here

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
pretty big there's no shock wave here

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.560 
pretty big there's no shock wave here
but<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> amount<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.259> pressure<00:02:02.060> it<00:02:03.060> gets<00:02:03.329> up

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
but the amount of pressure it gets up

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.120 
but the amount of pressure it gets up
there<00:02:03.600> quite<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.020> bit<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:04.710> important<00:02:05.100> to

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
there quite a bit so it's important to

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.709 
there quite a bit so it's important to
clean<00:02:05.430> both<00:02:05.790> sides<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.299> each<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.600> these

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
clean both sides of each of these

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.089 
clean both sides of each of these
fittings<00:02:07.110> before<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.680> put<00:02:07.890> them<00:02:07.979> together

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
fittings before you put them together

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.540 
fittings before you put them together
and<00:02:08.489> these<00:02:09.030> are<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.590> pressure<00:02:10.590> fitted<00:02:11.069> just

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and these are just pressure fitted just

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.040 
and these are just pressure fitted just
to<00:02:11.730> get<00:02:11.849> an<00:02:11.940> idea<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
to get an idea of the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.720 
to get an idea of the
measurement<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.680> size<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.370> thing

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:26.400 

so<00:02:17.730> I'll<00:02:18.210> glue<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.600> up

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:42.220 

look

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.220 

what<00:02:43.230> they<00:02:43.380> do<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:45.450> get<00:02:45.599> do<00:02:45.780> your<00:02:45.900> food<00:02:46.080> or

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
what they do to get do your food or

00:02:46.230 --> 00:03:42.370 
what they do to get do your food or
something

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.700 

all<00:03:43.380> right<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:43.740> is<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.900> test<00:03:45.900> run<00:03:46.230> of<00:03:46.260> the

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
all right this is the test run of the

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.090 
all right this is the test run of the
hydraulic<00:03:47.250> ram<00:03:47.490> pump<00:03:47.820> I'm<00:03:48.330> using<00:03:48.660> this<00:03:49.100> IBC

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
hydraulic ram pump I'm using this IBC

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.670 
hydraulic ram pump I'm using this IBC
tank<00:03:50.430> here<00:03:50.730> it's<00:03:50.940> full<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.300> water<00:03:51.480> it's<00:03:51.870> at

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
tank here it's full of water it's at

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.740 
tank here it's full of water it's at
about<00:03:52.920> four<00:03:53.220> feet<00:03:53.490> so<00:03:53.820> to<00:03:53.880> give<00:03:54.090> me<00:03:54.240> an<00:03:54.360> idea

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
about four feet so to give me an idea

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:05.660 
about four feet so to give me an idea
how<00:04:02.180> really<00:04:03.180> didn't<00:04:03.570> have<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:04.080> start<00:04:04.670> started

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
how really didn't have to start started

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.480 
how really didn't have to start started
automatically<00:04:06.450> which<00:04:06.660> is<00:04:07.670> pretty<00:04:08.670> neat

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
automatically which is pretty neat

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.270 
automatically which is pretty neat
you<00:04:11.490> tell<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.420> vibration<00:04:13.230> is<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.620> shock<00:04:13.920> wave

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
you tell the vibration is the shock wave

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.280 
you tell the vibration is the shock wave
that<00:04:14.580> shoots<00:04:14.910> back<00:04:15.240> up<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.660> pipe<00:04:15.960> and

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
that shoots back up that pipe and

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.680 
that shoots back up that pipe and
actually<00:04:16.680> inside<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.190> tank<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.730> have<00:04:18.450> this

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
actually inside the tank I have this

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.600 
actually inside the tank I have this
these<00:04:19.020> valves<00:04:19.500> turned<00:04:19.770> off<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.250> what<00:04:20.459> it's

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
these valves turned off and what it's

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.070 
these valves turned off and what it's
doing<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:20.970> building<00:04:21.209> pressure<00:04:23.840> so<00:04:24.840> when<00:04:24.960> it

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
doing is building pressure so when it

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.770 
doing is building pressure so when it
starts<00:04:25.410> slowing<00:04:25.680> down<00:04:29.570> supposed<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:30.630> be<00:04:30.750> a

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
starts slowing down supposed to be a

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.600 
starts slowing down supposed to be a
pressure<00:04:31.080> gauge<00:04:31.410> there<00:04:31.860> but<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.130> figured<00:04:32.520> I

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
pressure gauge there but I figured I

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.450 
pressure gauge there but I figured I
could<00:04:32.790> do<00:04:32.910> without<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:36.980> so<00:04:37.980> that's<00:04:38.190> this

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
could do without it so that's this

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.660 
could do without it so that's this
vertical<00:04:39.000> column<00:04:40.670> of<00:04:41.690> water<00:04:43.220> you<00:04:44.220> tell<00:04:44.460> by<00:04:44.610> the

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
vertical column of water you tell by the

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.510 
vertical column of water you tell by the
pressure<00:04:45.030> there<00:04:45.650> it's<00:04:46.650> actually<00:04:47.130> from<00:04:47.340> the

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
pressure there it's actually from the

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.400 
pressure there it's actually from the
water<00:04:47.760> higher<00:04:48.180> than<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.660> tank<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.290> that's

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
water higher than that tank and that's

00:04:49.410 --> 00:05:01.930 
water higher than that tank and that's
the<00:04:49.620> principle<00:04:49.830> of<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:50.460> hydraulic<00:04:50.940> grandpa

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.220 

might<00:05:02.940> not<00:05:03.090> be<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.240> bad<00:05:03.480> idea<00:05:03.540> to<00:05:03.930> have<00:05:04.050> a

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
might not be a bad idea to have a

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.020 
might not be a bad idea to have a
pressure<00:05:04.590> gauge<00:05:04.860> that's<00:05:05.480> that<00:05:06.480> way<00:05:06.690> I<00:05:06.750> know<00:05:06.960> I

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
pressure gauge that's that way I know I

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:19.290 
pressure gauge that's that way I know I
am<00:05:12.650> I'm<00:05:13.650> Maximus<00:05:14.310> maximizing<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:16.250> efficiency

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.600 

here<00:05:20.300> we<00:05:20.390> go<00:05:20.540> the<00:05:20.750> time<00:05:20.990> test<00:05:21.350> this<00:05:21.590> is<00:05:21.770> just<00:05:22.490> so

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
here we go the time test this is just so

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.820 
here we go the time test this is just so
you<00:05:22.640> know<00:05:22.760> this<00:05:23.000> watches<00:05:23.570> tap<00:05:23.810> technology<00:05:24.650> you

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
you know this watches tap technology you

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.150 
you know this watches tap technology you
just<00:05:26.140> you<00:05:27.140> start<00:05:27.410> it<00:05:27.590> like<00:05:27.710> that

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
just you start it like that

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:57.900 
just you start it like that
stop<00:05:28.370> it<00:05:28.520> like<00:05:28.670> that<00:05:29.090> so<00:05:30.220> alright<00:05:32.470> here<00:05:33.470> we<00:05:33.500> go

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.450 

okay<00:05:58.910> what<00:05:59.120> I<00:05:59.150> got<00:05:59.420> was<00:05:59.690> a<00:06:00.430> five-gallon<00:06:01.430> bucket

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
okay what I got was a five-gallon bucket

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.620 
okay what I got was a five-gallon bucket
filled<00:06:02.180> in<00:06:02.920> four<00:06:03.920> minutes

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
filled in four minutes

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:10.180 
filled in four minutes
so<00:06:07.030> obviously<00:06:08.030> the<00:06:08.480> the<00:06:08.810> vertical<00:06:09.320> climb<00:06:09.890> on

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
so obviously the the vertical climb on

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.830 
so obviously the the vertical climb on
this<00:06:10.460> thing<00:06:10.730> is<00:06:10.910> not<00:06:11.090> going<00:06:11.300> to<00:06:11.390> be<00:06:11.540> as<00:06:11.660> high

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
this thing is not going to be as high

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.630 
this thing is not going to be as high
it's<00:06:12.110> going<00:06:12.260> to<00:06:12.350> be<00:06:12.440> about<00:06:12.650> five<00:06:13.040> feet<00:06:13.340> maybe

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
it's going to be about five feet maybe

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:19.180 
it's going to be about five feet maybe
half<00:06:13.970> of<00:06:14.120> that<00:06:14.300> and<00:06:17.320> just<00:06:18.320> the<00:06:18.470> rate<00:06:18.710> of<00:06:18.860> float

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
half of that and just the rate of float

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.030 
half of that and just the rate of float
now<00:06:19.700> with<00:06:20.540> that<00:06:20.870> being<00:06:21.200> it<00:06:21.530> I<00:06:21.740> guess<00:06:22.220> 10<00:06:22.520> feet

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
now with that being it I guess 10 feet

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.500 
now with that being it I guess 10 feet
it's<00:06:25.040> eighteen<00:06:25.550> hundred<00:06:25.880> and<00:06:25.940> eighty<00:06:26.210> gallons

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
it's eighteen hundred and eighty gallons

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:35.290 
it's eighteen hundred and eighty gallons
a<00:06:26.990> day<00:06:29.170> in<00:06:30.170> a<00:06:30.710> 24<00:06:31.190> hour<00:06:31.220> period<00:06:31.460> so<00:06:34.090> with<00:06:35.090> half

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
a day in a 24 hour period so with half

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.820 
a day in a 24 hour period so with half
of<00:06:35.510> that<00:06:35.660> maybe<00:06:36.050> I'll<00:06:36.560> get<00:06:36.980> anywhere<00:06:37.640> between

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
of that maybe I'll get anywhere between

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.540 
of that maybe I'll get anywhere between
3,000<00:06:39.830> and<00:06:40.030> 4,000<00:06:41.030> gallons<00:06:41.540> a<00:06:41.690> day<00:06:41.750> a<00:06:42.550> free

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
3,000 and 4,000 gallons a day a free

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.590 
3,000 and 4,000 gallons a day a free
pumping<00:06:44.180> power<00:06:44.480> from<00:06:45.200> free<00:06:45.710> Creek<00:06:46.190> and<00:06:46.600> starts

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
pumping power from free Creek and starts

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.860 
pumping power from free Creek and starts
automatically<00:06:48.290> so<00:06:49.250> I<00:06:49.280> am<00:06:49.730> completely<00:06:50.120> stoked

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
automatically so I am completely stoked

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.160 
automatically so I am completely stoked
and<00:06:51.170> now<00:06:52.070> will<00:06:52.580> install<00:06:53.150> this<00:06:53.390> system<00:06:53.810> in<00:06:53.990> the

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.170 
and now will install this system in the

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.250 
and now will install this system in the
Creek<00:06:54.470> in<00:06:55.150> preparation<00:06:56.150> for<00:06:56.180> Saturday's<00:06:56.900> rain

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260 
Creek in preparation for Saturday's rain

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.080 
Creek in preparation for Saturday's rain
and<00:06:58.870> start<00:06:59.870> filling<00:07:00.260> my<00:07:00.470> pond<00:07:00.800> and<00:07:01.190> if<00:07:01.580> I<00:07:01.820> have

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090 
and start filling my pond and if I have

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.680 
and start filling my pond and if I have
three<00:07:02.420> ponds<00:07:02.690> out<00:07:02.990> here<00:07:03.320> if<00:07:03.760> if<00:07:04.760> I<00:07:05.030> get<00:07:05.360> start

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
three ponds out here if if I get start

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.600 
three ponds out here if if I get start
getting<00:07:05.720> overflow<00:07:06.500> on<00:07:06.800> one<00:07:07.070> pond

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
getting overflow on one pond

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.340 
getting overflow on one pond
I<00:07:07.810> will<00:07:08.810> jet<00:07:09.350> a<00:07:09.670> large<00:07:10.670> PVC<00:07:11.450> pipe<00:07:11.720> from<00:07:12.110> one

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.350 
I will jet a large PVC pipe from one

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.980 
I will jet a large PVC pipe from one
pond<00:07:12.680> to<00:07:13.010> another<00:07:13.340> and<00:07:13.610> then<00:07:14.420> if<00:07:14.540> it<00:07:14.690> can<00:07:14.840> keep

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:14.990 
pond to another and then if it can keep

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.190 
pond to another and then if it can keep
up<00:07:15.200> with<00:07:15.380> that<00:07:15.590> I<00:07:15.860> will<00:07:16.160> jet<00:07:16.520> another<00:07:17.150> PVC<00:07:17.900> pipe

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:18.200 
up with that I will jet another PVC pipe
