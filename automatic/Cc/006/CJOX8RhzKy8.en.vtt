right here leave it's a number 20 Torx
but<00:01:09.780> also<00:01:12.770> an<00:01:13.940> allen<00:01:14.940> key<00:01:14.970> will<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> trick

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
but also an allen key will do the trick

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.700 
but also an allen key will do the trick
on<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.910> car<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.149> got<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.479> part<00:01:18.840> from<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.560> was

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
on the car I got the part from it was

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.590 
on the car I got the part from it was
actually<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> 10<00:01:20.369> millimeter<00:01:20.700> bolt<00:01:21.149> which<00:01:21.450> I'll

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
actually a 10 millimeter bolt which I'll

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.290 
actually a 10 millimeter bolt which I'll
replace<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:24.080> later<00:01:25.490> now<00:01:26.490> two<00:01:26.550> bolts

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
replace this with later now two bolts

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.889 
replace this with later now two bolts
fourteen<00:01:27.869> millimeter<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.179> two<00:01:32.690> for<00:01:33.690> that

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
fourteen millimeter one and two for that

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.550 
fourteen millimeter one and two for that
it's<00:01:34.080> probably<00:01:34.320> worthwhile<00:01:34.729> disconnecting

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:50.399 

this<00:01:39.390> connector<00:01:40.390> here<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.810> bolts<00:01:50.140> are<00:01:50.259> off

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
this connector here the bolts are off

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.420 
this connector here the bolts are off
the<00:01:51.039> unit<00:01:51.340> comes<00:01:51.579> clear<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.710> can<00:01:53.920> see<00:01:53.950> there

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
the unit comes clear you can see there

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.789 
the unit comes clear you can see there
hopefully<00:01:55.119> where<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:58.259> dental<00:01:59.259> floss<00:01:59.409> is

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
hopefully where the dental floss is

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:16.890 
hopefully where the dental floss is
coming<00:02:00.130> out<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:15.180> sure<00:02:16.180> there's<00:02:16.480> proper

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
coming out and sure there's proper

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.289 
coming out and sure there's proper
torque<00:02:17.319> settings<00:02:17.799> but<00:02:20.760> people<00:02:21.760> like<00:02:21.880> us<00:02:22.090> don't

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
torque settings but people like us don't

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:43.350 
torque settings but people like us don't
worry<00:02:22.569> about<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:23.819> little<00:02:24.819> bolt<00:02:26.489> millimeter

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.930 

and<00:02:43.930> then<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.830> connection

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
and then the connection

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.619 
and then the connection
again<00:02:48.430> that's<00:02:49.430> it

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
again that's it

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.399 
again that's it
finally<00:02:53.299> insert<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.540> bolt<00:02:54.749> at<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.019> end<00:02:55.260> of

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
finally insert the bolt at the end of

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:01.930 
finally insert the bolt at the end of
the<00:02:55.469> belt

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.199 

tighten<00:03:02.940> with<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.150> 12<00:03:03.510> millimeter<00:03:08.209> plastic

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
tighten with a 12 millimeter plastic

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.640 
tighten with a 12 millimeter plastic
piece<00:03:10.400> on<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.580> back<00:03:11.930> pull<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.020> forward<00:03:13.440> till

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
piece on the back pull it forward till

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:22.360 
piece on the back pull it forward till
it<00:03:13.770> snaps<00:03:15.290> other<00:03:16.290> piece<00:03:16.680> forward<00:03:20.360> set<00:03:21.360> down

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
it snaps other piece forward set down

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:42.570 
it snaps other piece forward set down
maybe<00:03:24.110> we're<00:03:25.110> done

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.160 

this<00:03:43.580> is<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.850> interesting<00:03:44.090> bit<00:03:44.330> a<00:03:44.690> device

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
this is the interesting bit a device

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.550 
this is the interesting bit a device

from me taking everything apart it turns

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.979 
from me taking everything apart it turns
out<00:04:19.520> you<00:04:19.670> don't<00:04:19.850> actually<00:04:20.120> have<00:04:20.480> to<00:04:20.780> take

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
out you don't actually have to take

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.240 
out you don't actually have to take
everything<00:04:21.290> apart<00:04:21.560> a<00:04:23.920> little<00:04:24.920> bit<00:04:25.130> of<00:04:25.250> prying

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
everything apart a little bit of prying

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.110 
everything apart a little bit of prying
opposite<00:04:28.250> up<00:04:28.400> a<00:04:29.980> little<00:04:30.980> plastic<00:04:32.200> doohickeys

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
opposite up a little plastic doohickeys

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.890 
opposite up a little plastic doohickeys
they<00:04:35.120> simply<00:04:35.540> come<00:04:35.750> apart

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.530 

opens<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.870> in<00:04:43.230> there<00:04:44.090> you<00:04:45.090> can<00:04:45.210> see<00:04:45.240> the

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
opens it and in there you can see the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:55.460 
opens it and in there you can see the
little<00:04:45.720> device<00:04:46.169> I<00:04:47.840> hope<00:04:51.680> that<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:54.470> finger

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
little device I hope that the finger

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
little device I hope that the finger
normally<00:04:55.889> controls<00:04:56.400> in<00:04:57.260> like<00:04:58.260> this<00:04:58.560> it's<00:04:59.310> in

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
normally controls in like this it's in

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:08.900 
normally controls in like this it's in
there<00:04:59.790> and<00:05:01.220> it's<00:05:03.380> simply<00:05:04.380> that<00:05:07.310> little<00:05:08.310> piece

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
there and it's simply that little piece

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.510 
there and it's simply that little piece
is<00:05:09.150> back<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:11.250> belt<00:05:11.490> moves<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:13.860> go<00:05:14.010> in<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.370> out

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
is back the belt moves and go in and out

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.070 
is back the belt moves and go in and out
like<00:05:15.620> anything

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:35.300 

theoretically<00:05:28.520> when<00:05:29.520> you<00:05:29.670> let<00:05:29.880> it<00:05:29.970> go<00:05:34.310> then

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
theoretically when you let it go then

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.880 
theoretically when you let it go then
locks<00:05:35.610> again
