00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.420
 leave it forbidden to insult the video 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.410
 so to realize this creation you 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.789
 will need ocher colored clay paste 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.079
 to make the cake dough 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.370
 finally you do not have to use 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.320
 the gold color when you can use 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.050
 the color you wish sahara finally 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.539
 I use the color offer number 17 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:03.449
 you will need a tweezers 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:10.200
 of a lemon cane of a cutting object 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:15.960
 scalpel cutter with a brush of a box 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.450
 pastel and whipped off you 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.790
 see me I have already prepared my whipped cream 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.310
 with madou he already knows everything mounted and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.340
 so it's a little optional 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.710
 as you wish to make your bottom of 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.150
 pie but I'm using a mold and 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.650
 I have just mold and a 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.990
 beer capsule actually 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.400
 and I use to make you a background of 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.659
 pie and I think it's going very, very 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.560
 well 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:43.170
 so here to begin with so here 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.149
 to start we take our bottom of 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.200
 pie and we take some fimo paste 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.790
 ocher color 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.780
 here you see me I took a little 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:56.310
 near this quantity and we will have it available 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.880
 a trip he spreads a little and we go there 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.880
 arranged in the bottom of the mold 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.730
 here and now the operation is going 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.930
 consist of you see the map was a 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.100
 little dirty but hey it has no 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.960
 importance because it's going to be 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.990
 covered now the operation that we 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.180
 going to practice will be to support the 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.640
 more possible in the center to make a 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.010
 hollow power after then put the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.740
 chantilly 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.350
 I support the center and I report on 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.240
 edges to make you do by cons 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.100
 well the drawing of the small pimples on the 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.100
 sides to make the pie spirit 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.110
 that's what it gives so you can 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.630
 to find that one melts pie is enough 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.680
 dig and you see it's good 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.270
 hollow inside 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.750
 and now this price is going to have to make 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.870
 took place and not enough bottom 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.200
 baking pie so obviously ten 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:15.190
 minutes ten minutes to 110 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:20.200
 degrees so here I find you a 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:23.380
 time it will be done so here is my 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.060
 tart is ready it is hard it 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.920
 well cooked and clever what will have to 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.410
 to do is take your pocket 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.910
 socket with your whipped pit is 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.650
 simply come there willing to 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.030
 the inside for to actually make the 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.070
 meringue on lemon pie 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.070
 meringue go go it's gone 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:55.430
 so here I have arranged machin cheer up 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.850
 I think it gives a good effect and 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.010
 now I'm going to come take 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.600
 a few slices of calm from my cane 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.790
 lemon and I will come to the if he is 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.459
 disposed at the center to show that 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.300
 it's a lemon meringue pie I 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.300
 take my tweezers 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.109
 hop there 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.890
 and here and now the little step 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.740
 which gives a lot a lot a lot 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.420
 more realism to your creation 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.590
 it's just taking your 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:43.700
 bolt of Palétès dry pastel 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:46.880
 rub the thief a bit, see the chestnut 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.400
 there the cold a little with my brush and 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.460
 I will come but very gently 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.500
 to not distort the vo changed I 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.630
 will come 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.630
 delicately tinted with my brush 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:06.200
 the ledges to give a little staff this 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:10.930
 cooked aspect burnt lemon pie 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.930
 real meringue 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:20.390
 my name is not really going very 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:23.230
 delicately tap them that over the 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.230
 more discreetly possible 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:06:00.060
 and here is your lemon meringue pie 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:02.430
 colorful is ready to dry in fact 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.800
 now we have to let everything dry 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.470
 just whipped cream and I find that 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.810
 it gives a very realistic effect 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.039
