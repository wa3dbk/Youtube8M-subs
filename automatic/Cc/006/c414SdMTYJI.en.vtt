video on a rope coil we've previously

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.510 
video on a rope coil we've previously
gone<00:00:16.139> over<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.619> ideas<00:00:16.980> before<00:00:17.190> with<00:00:17.490> just

request<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.859> what<00:00:23.160> we'd<00:00:23.310> like<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.550> do<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.789> kind

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
request so what we'd like to do is kind

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.050 
request so what we'd like to do is kind
of<00:00:24.060> demonstrate<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.720> real<00:00:24.960> quick<00:00:26.060> basically

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
of demonstrate that real quick basically

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.689 
of demonstrate that real quick basically
what<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.359> does<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.840> enable<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.699> coil

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
what this does is enable you to coil

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.880 
what this does is enable you to coil
your<00:00:29.939> rope<00:00:30.119> for<00:00:30.420> fast<00:00:30.750> deployment<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:31.560> also

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
your rope for fast deployment but also

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.440 
your rope for fast deployment but also
you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.189> wear<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.579> if<00:00:32.759> you're<00:00:32.880> climbing<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
you can wear it if you're climbing and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.299 
you can wear it if you're climbing and
things<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:33.989> kind<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.890> neat<00:00:35.070> knot

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
things like that so kind of a neat knot

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.850 
things like that so kind of a neat knot
to<00:00:35.489> learn<00:00:35.960> basically<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> first<00:00:37.350> step<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.739> you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
to learn basically the first step is you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.619 
to learn basically the first step is you
want<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.100> find<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> midpoint<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:39.270> your<00:00:39.450> rope

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
want to find the midpoint in your rope

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.020 
want to find the midpoint in your rope
you<00:00:40.110> make<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> Bight<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.860> you're<00:00:41.430> basically<00:00:41.969> in

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
you make a Bight and you're basically in

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.639 
you make a Bight and you're basically in
and<00:00:42.180> Flake<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.570> rope<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.960> what<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.410> means

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and Flake the rope and what that means

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.080 
and Flake the rope and what that means
is<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:43.890> you're<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.309> alternate<00:00:44.820> from

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
is that you're going to alternate from

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.220 
is that you're going to alternate from
side<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.360> side<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:46.280> like<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:48.020> this<00:00:49.020> is

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
side to side just like this this is

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.880 
side to side just like this this is
about<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.500> 30<00:00:49.800> meter<00:00:50.010> rope<00:00:50.309> -<00:00:51.590> we're<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.770> going

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
about a 30 meter rope - we're just going

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.410 
about a 30 meter rope - we're just going
to<00:00:52.920> keep<00:00:53.160> alternating<00:00:54.230> Mickey<00:00:55.230> loops<00:00:56.420> just

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
to keep alternating Mickey loops just

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.049 
to keep alternating Mickey loops just
like<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.070> see<00:00:59.309> I'm<00:00:59.399> making<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.730> loop<00:00:59.910> on

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
like so you can see I'm making a loop on

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.900 
like so you can see I'm making a loop on
one<00:01:00.300> side<00:01:00.570> passing<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.559> over<00:01:01.739> my<00:01:01.890> hand<00:01:02.129> making

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
one side passing it over my hand making

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.060 
one side passing it over my hand making
another<00:01:03.300> loop<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> other<00:01:03.840> side<00:01:04.229> once<00:01:04.949> you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
another loop on the other side once you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.760 
another loop on the other side once you
get<00:01:05.250> about<00:01:05.460> six<00:01:05.850> feet<00:01:06.090> from<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> end<00:01:06.630> here<00:01:06.770> and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
get about six feet from the end here and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.140 
get about six feet from the end here and
make<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.100> more<00:01:08.130> loop<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:08.970> we've<00:01:09.119> got

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
make one more loop see if we've got

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.760 
make one more loop see if we've got
about<00:01:09.450> six<00:01:09.720> feet<00:01:10.790> that's<00:01:11.790> around<00:01:12.090> six<00:01:12.420> feet

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
about six feet that's around six feet

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.870 
about six feet that's around six feet
what<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.890> want<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.430> point<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.850> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
what you want to do at this point is you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.760 
what you want to do at this point is you
have<00:01:15.150> your<00:01:15.420> rope<00:01:15.630> separated<00:01:16.170> into<00:01:16.290> two<00:01:16.530> halves

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
have your rope separated into two halves

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.270 
have your rope separated into two halves
and<00:01:17.390> grab<00:01:18.390> your<00:01:18.799> basically<00:01:19.799> your<00:01:20.009> working

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
and grab your basically your working

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.190 
and grab your basically your working
ends<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.909> you're<00:01:21.659> just<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.020> twist

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
ends and you're just going to twist

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.600 
ends and you're just going to twist
around<00:01:23.330> do<00:01:24.330> at<00:01:24.479> least<00:01:24.600> twice<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.200> so

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.730 

this<00:01:28.610> up<00:01:28.790> here<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.210> twist<00:01:30.080> around<00:01:30.350> now<00:01:30.530> you're

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
this up here so twist around now you're

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.040 
this up here so twist around now you're
going<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:30.920> pass<00:01:31.130> those<00:01:31.430> working<00:01:31.820> ends<00:01:32.120> through

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
going to pass those working ends through

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.500 
going to pass those working ends through
that<00:01:33.590> top<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.160> loop<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:35.090> you're<00:01:35.210> left<00:01:35.390> with

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
that top of the loop so you're left with

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.550 
that top of the loop so you're left with
something<00:01:35.810> like<00:01:36.080> this

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
something like this

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.960 
something like this
now<00:01:37.400> what<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:38.150> enables<00:01:38.660> you<00:01:38.930> to<00:01:38.960> do<00:01:39.200> is<00:01:39.970> Drake

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
now what this enables you to do is Drake

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.830 
now what this enables you to do is Drake
that<00:01:41.000> over<00:01:41.390> your<00:01:41.480> back<00:01:42.370> just<00:01:43.370> like<00:01:43.520> so<00:01:43.790> you<00:01:44.690> can

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
that over your back just like so you can

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.900 
that over your back just like so you can
take<00:01:45.050> these<00:01:45.230> working<00:01:45.590> ends<00:01:45.920> pass<00:01:46.520> them<00:01:46.760> around

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
take these working ends pass them around

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.030 
take these working ends pass them around
that<00:01:47.450> rope<00:01:47.810> in<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.080> back<00:01:49.450> just<00:01:50.450> like<00:01:50.600> that

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
that rope in the back just like that

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.340 
that rope in the back just like that
come<00:01:52.040> around<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.460> front<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:53.140> simply<00:01:54.140> tie

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
come around to the front and simply tie

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.050 
come around to the front and simply tie
a<00:01:54.380> square<00:01:54.710> knot<00:01:54.800> or<00:01:55.370> something<00:01:55.430> like<00:01:55.850> that

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
a square knot or something like that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.600 
a square knot or something like that
just<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.840> secure<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:57.470> now<00:01:58.070> that<00:01:58.130> gives<00:01:58.490> you

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
just to secure it so now that gives you

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.780 
just to secure it so now that gives you
a<00:01:58.670> way<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:59.590> basically<00:02:00.590> store<00:02:01.160> your<00:02:01.340> rope<00:02:01.520> you

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
a way to basically store your rope you

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.640 
a way to basically store your rope you
can<00:02:01.820> climb<00:02:02.210> with<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.660> you're<00:02:02.900> not<00:02:03.050> hindered<00:02:03.470> by

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650
