let's<00:00:28.030> first<00:00:28.680> take<00:00:29.680> out<00:00:30.030> everything<00:00:35.070> because

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.450 

it<00:00:40.510> would<00:00:40.810> have<00:00:40.870> been<00:00:40.930> really<00:00:41.830> really

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
it would have been really really

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.440 
it would have been really really
challenging<00:00:44.040> his<00:00:45.040> legs<00:00:46.170> extremely<00:00:47.170> skinny

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
and I feel like that's the logical they

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:13.440 
and I feel like that's the logical they
could<00:00:55.150> have<00:00:55.270> made<00:01:10.050> also<00:01:11.050> his<00:01:11.399> arms<00:01:12.399> so<00:01:13.030> I<00:01:13.060> don't

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
could have made also his arms so I don't

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.010 
could have made also his arms so I don't
