favorite of the two types of RC cars the

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
favorite of the two types of RC cars the
Nitra<00:00:09.599> which<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.410> what<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.460> here<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:12.059> acme<00:00:12.719> r<00:00:12.750> &amp;

b<00:00:12.990> 16<00:00:13.559> or<00:00:14.299> electric<00:00:16.220> okay<00:00:17.220> we'll<00:00:17.369> start<00:00:17.640> with

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
b 16 or electric okay we'll start with

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.590 
b 16 or electric okay we'll start with
the<00:00:18.539> electric<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:20.130> no<00:00:20.310> longer<00:00:20.670> have<00:00:21.090> an

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
the electric and I no longer have an

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.830 
the electric and I no longer have an
electric<00:00:22.170> RC<00:00:22.529> car<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:24.890> due<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.189> fact<00:00:26.430> that

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
electric RC car and due to the fact that

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:35.740 
electric RC car and due to the fact that
well<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:29.029> esc<00:00:30.029> burned<00:00:30.960> out<00:00:31.700> twice<00:00:33.350> and

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
well the esc burned out twice and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.340 
well the esc burned out twice and
eventually<00:00:36.750> died<00:00:37.050> when<00:00:38.059> it<00:00:39.770> kept<00:00:40.770> melting<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
eventually died when it kept melting the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.720 
eventually died when it kept melting the
connections<00:00:43.350> where<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.800> battery<00:00:44.219> connects

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
connections where the battery connects

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.200 
connections where the battery connects
on<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.200> car<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.340> connectors<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.000> kept

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
on to the car the connectors just kept

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.450 
on to the car the connectors just kept
melting<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> end<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.890> was<00:00:50.309> just

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
melting and then in the end I was just

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.240 
melting and then in the end I was just
running<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.840> eejits<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.039> sat<00:00:53.219> on

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
running it and it eejits you just sat on

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.330 
running it and it eejits you just sat on
fire<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.090> when<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> end<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:56.129> my

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
fire so when that was the end of my

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.479 
fire so when that was the end of my
electric<00:00:57.300> car<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:58.559> nothing<00:00:58.770> got<00:00:59.100> troubles

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
electric car I have nothing got troubles

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.180 
electric car I have nothing got troubles
with<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.620> everything<00:01:01.620> kept<00:01:01.859> dropping

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
with it and everything kept dropping

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:11.630 
with it and everything kept dropping
after<00:01:02.820> there<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:05.540> yeah<00:01:06.650> so<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:10.130> prefer<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
after there and yeah so I prefer the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.310 
after there and yeah so I prefer the
Nitra<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:14.210> also<00:01:15.210> because<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.960> run<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
Nitra and also because you can run the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.240 
Nitra and also because you can run the
Nitra<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.159> long<00:01:17.460> as<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.790> want<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.390> do<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
Nitra for as long as you want to do and

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.910 
Nitra for as long as you want to do and
obviously<00:01:20.250> Perowne<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.939> having<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.240> fuel<00:01:21.600> and

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
obviously Perowne you having a fuel and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.740 
obviously Perowne you having a fuel and
coming<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.040> for<00:01:23.340> all<00:01:23.640> day<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.270> wanted<00:01:24.630> to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
coming it for all day if you wanted to

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.810 
coming it for all day if you wanted to
whereas<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.200> electric<00:01:25.770> once<00:01:26.670> your

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
whereas with electric once your

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.490 
whereas with electric once your
batteries<00:01:27.180> run<00:01:27.390> out<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.720> 20<00:01:28.110> minutes<00:01:28.259> or<00:01:28.470> so

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
batteries run out in 20 minutes or so

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.870 
batteries run out in 20 minutes or so
that's<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.310> you've<00:01:29.400> got<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> wait<00:01:29.729> another

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
that's it you've got to wait another

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.910 
that's it you've got to wait another
three<00:01:30.630> four<00:01:30.840> hours<00:01:31.049> from<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.500> charge<00:01:31.970> so<00:01:33.920> even

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
three four hours from to charge so even

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.490 
three four hours from to charge so even
though<00:01:34.979> nitro<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> bit<00:01:36.570> Messier<00:01:37.079> maybe<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
though nitro it's a bit Messier maybe a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.700 
though nitro it's a bit Messier maybe a
bit<00:01:37.619> more<00:01:37.759> costly<00:01:38.960> more<00:01:39.960> fun<00:01:40.259> because<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.619> can

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
bit more costly more fun because you can

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.530 
bit more costly more fun because you can
drag<00:01:41.159> them<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> lot<00:01:41.700> longer<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.090> i<00:01:42.210> found

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
drag them for a lot longer and i found

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.800 
drag them for a lot longer and i found
it<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> lot<00:01:42.930> more<00:01:43.079> reliable<00:01:43.710> than<00:01:43.920> my<00:01:44.810> electric

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
it a lot more reliable than my electric

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
it a lot more reliable than my electric
one<00:01:46.290> which<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.280> sir<00:01:47.630> ended<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.500> fire<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
one which is a sir ended on in fire and

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.249 
one which is a sir ended on in fire and
I<00:01:50.399> don't<00:01:50.640> had<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.090> literally<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.659> two<00:01:52.020> months

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
I don't had it literally like two months

personally<00:02:03.119> i'd<00:02:03.240> go<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:03.799> nitro<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.210> looking

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210
