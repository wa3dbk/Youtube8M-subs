00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.540
Welcome to Snap-on Training Solutions. This
module is designed to help you get the most

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.540
out of your SOLUS Edge diagnostic tool and
covers the use of scanner functional tests.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.670
Functional Tests are a great way to isolate
the cause of a problem between the controller,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:38.670
a component, wiring or other issues. Functional
Tests let you override the vehicle controller

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.590
to take control of a system and determine
to the vehicle responds properly or not.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.390
Functional Tests are a powerful companion
to Troubleshooter which often refers you to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.579
perform a Functional Test to verify a suspected
issue.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.960
As an example, we will use the injector balance
test. Let's begin by reviewing the description

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.960
of this test. From the main scanner menu,
select Troubleshooter, Engine and Tests &amp; Procedures.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.789
Select Functional Test Descriptions to see
a list of all available Functional Tests.

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:23.310
Select Injector Balance to see a description
of what the test will do for us.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.319
Troubleshooter tells us how to perform and
interpret the test. Now that we know what

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:35.319
to expect, select the Back button to return
to the Main Menu to perform the test.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.000
From Main Menu select Functional Tests.
Select the Injector Balance test.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The next screens give us step-by-step test
instructions. Select Continue.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.289
Select each injector one at a time to disable
it and compare the RPM drop between injectors.

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.280
If you are using a fuel pressure gauge in
conjunction with the test, compare pressure

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.880
drop between cylinders.
Select an injector once to deactivate and

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.880
again to activate. This is known as a Toggle
Test.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.810
Other useful types of functional tests are
Actuator Tests which check operation of devices

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.810
like solenoid valves, motors and relays. And
Output Controls, which monitor live output

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.219
data from the vehicle while you activate vehicle
components.

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:38.610
A good example of a powerful Output Control
is the AC Relay Test.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.560
Select the test and the AC Relay control shows
at the top of the screen, and the live data

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.370
parameter view opens.
By using the Functional Test and selecting

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.370
ON, you are overriding the controller. If
you command the relay to turn ON and it does

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.200
not activate, you've just eliminated the
controller from the possible causes. This

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.810
pinpoints the likely problem to be the relay
or wiring. In order to choose relevant data

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.810
parameters to monitor, use the Back button
to open the Data Manu.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.890
Select the data group Accessory, Electrical,
Theft Data.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.049
Click on the checkmark icon.
Let's view the data parameters relevant

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:34.049
to the AC Relay Test. First use the Select
All icon to deselect all parameters.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.889
Select just the parameters you want for your
diagnosis. To perform the AC Relay test we

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:47.489
will select AC-related data.
This will speed the data refresh rate to help

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.719
you catch short intermittent glitches. Here's
your Custom Data list. Now you can observe

00:03:53.719 --> 00:04:00.719
the vehicle data response when you command
the AC Relay On and Off.

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.620
