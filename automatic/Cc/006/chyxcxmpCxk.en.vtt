00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:05.240
 andrea antonelli several times Italian art milk and coffee shop champion 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.470
 speaks of coffee culture in Italy 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.509
 if the story of coffee and in Italy, thank you 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.499
 future café in Italy enascs exactly from the knowledge of coffee 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:17.800
 so let's not confuse what is expressed 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.019
 our consumption of espresso 20 hours different from the word coffee 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.819
 is 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:28.919
 ne yo give we are. coming in different forms under the espresso below 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.609
 ooi cappuccini latte art 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.520
 so to spread a little with the information 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.500
 we try to use strategies through our marketing 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.370
 bartenders who are here with us today 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.640
 it is difficult to offer the customer something innovative 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.649
 on condition 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.820
 in the grass cafeteria sector 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.890
 speaks in Italy 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.890
 the condition in which sense the condition 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.249
 of cultural gold production of dissemination knowledge 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.659
 so this is a man's I had to ask a bartender what the is 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.659
 coffee he says what's in the cup probably 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.840
 and I must say that lately in the end it is very felt 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.740
 although there is still a good slice of the market that tends to ignore for 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.130
 force this argument into thinking that making a coffee means a button tiger 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.580
 It is not so 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.030
 but training is thus the circle of culture, that is knowledge 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.310
 as I said before we have different types of robust Arabica coffee on 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.940
 there are already two, there are others 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.220
 as many then 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.220
 perceh know how to work the cooking temperature 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.620
 here are the secrets to be 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.690
 a good barman and above all specialized in the coffee sector then 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.780
 the bartender and the bartender mixing operator then 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.310
 in the drink 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.270
 the bartender the operator of the month of the cafeteria 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.700
 Coffee shop operator differs because it is called barista 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.510
 instead of grass they arm bartenders 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.929
 and is the professional of e coffee 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.619
 the one who knows that coffee is a plant 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.859
 examination of a plant 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.229
 and that seize nespresso but can also be extracted in many other ways 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.950
 it was American for breakfast filter france press to the Turkish to permote 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.670
 so these are nuances of the barista coffee the operator should 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:16.019
 learn about these types of extraction 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.889
 coffee disclosure refers only to professional operators 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.509
 can also to those who do it at home 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:27.159
 no surely now he does at home we remember the 33 and when dialects 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.379
 invented the mocha 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.109
 and citroen 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.029
 I try to distribute in Italy disclosing 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:37.049
 and the coffee culture in fact d believe that in all families we have home 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.079
 a mocha 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.829
 and we started a little from the I started from there from the moka 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.449
 for certain knowledge the bike can also be known as metal 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.729
 therefore knowledge of aluminum to know what makes us from aluminum 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:49.630
 instead of steel then 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.210
 sama a nonsense but simple file to do the simple beams you want to do 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.780
 coffee 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.589
 extracted with the motta 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:58.589
 it means 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:04.680
 here in the morning comes the ground church coffee 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.989
 in many cases 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.199
 there is a difference between a coffee at home is a coffee in the bar 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:13.339
 yes surely that is product difference because coffee made with the 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:17.139
 moka is a mocha extract that has made balestrate espresso posted 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.929
 are life differences without difference of 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:23.359
 There are some olfactory tactile bus perceptions 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:24.869
 an infinite series 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:29.819
 it is clear that the color slashes hair if the fact expressed is lacking if not 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.049
 voltage is taken care of on the equipment 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.429
 it should be a higher step for romatic profile 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:39.929
 you who are touring Italy with your exhibitions 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:44.299
 what differences there are in the perception of the coffee sector north-central south 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:50.549
 but surely there is no preference for consumption of major Arabica 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.760
 cocice prima rabite robusta faceb cuts a 50 50 jam enters two yes's 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.389
 however it prefers the prevalence of robust not for this good quality e 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:01.569
 bad quality 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.869
 it is a taste that is subtracted a little from the springs by the uses and customs of the 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:09.529
 area itself and therefore also the rumor a little so as to dispel sugar 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:13.169
 and it is said that the sugar must remain on the first of the espresso otherwise 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.729
 it's not good 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.969
 they are a bit of mirrors and it would be better to break these myths 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.479
 in short, this is not all true 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.300
 for sure the south taste is a little more or more a bit more about coffee 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.770
 narrow 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.419
 and therefore it is thought to be more concentrated rather than the opposite 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.039
 because it has a suv extracted the restricted and therefore only the fruit of a souté 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.259
 then flat station 4 while long coffee 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.819
 unusually that is seen then because it is thought to be lighter is more 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:43.720
 heavy because it is richer in substances than 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.720
 they are extracted over 30 seconds that were not to be extracted 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.580
 anyway everybody was wrong to think 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.719
 anyone who wants a bartender can do a preparation 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:55.849
 specific 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:57.779
 I believe there is a dowry 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:02.349
 innate in the sense that the waters a lot of passion first and the passion not 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.449
 you can buy you can't learn 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.039
 try it you can try to transcribe it someone else and then this bartender u 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.449
 this painter 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.210
 it is always to choose -6 walk the road they abandon themselves 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.629
 choose of the other 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:17.180
 me before arriving 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.600
 to become a bartender I walked a road like many others 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.600
 professionals who run lebart nn and then 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:26.480
 I have been 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.680
 I did something we say black sun 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.419
 and then the cafeteria passed the street because I knew it was 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:32.130
 the one that 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.130
 could look more like my character 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.020
 those wishing to invest in training for their own business 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.180
 it has an advantage it has a return only for passion 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.009
 no just for passion now 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:51.180
 because it's still I think there is both to say this training is not 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.189
 sale 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:55.679
 so when I talk about training he talks about culture we don't give any product 

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:56.749
 in this case 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:58.949
 I do training I do culture 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.729
 it is clear that I have the return if I then go home I put into practice what I am 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.050
 I learned in the course 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.240
 if I then go home and go ahead to operate the salon was next active 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.879
 or in my way 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:12.319
 it is clear that the interest is 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:14.050
 come - 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.529
 give your opinion on this event 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:21.569
 it signals the thing because to you yes you have companies it is a difficult thing to deal 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:25.530
 to see these baths and they are not confronted but they are 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:31.040
 % transmitting in their own way of seeing and also according to the different regions 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.860
 Italy because I see that there is not only Sicily 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.840
 here I'm 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.700
 % uses and customs of ways of acting and this 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.620
 surely a moment communication of communication is definitely leads 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.099
 of the benefits 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:45.689
 thank you please greet all
