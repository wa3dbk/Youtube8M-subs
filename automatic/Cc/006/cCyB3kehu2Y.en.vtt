00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
so on my last video I got a few

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.390 
so on my last video I got a few
questions<00:02:10.720> one<00:02:11.410> of<00:02:11.440> them<00:02:11.680> was<00:02:11.800> from<00:02:11.980> Cynthia

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
questions one of them was from Cynthia

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.150 
questions one of them was from Cynthia
and<00:02:12.670> she<00:02:12.910> asked<00:02:13.150> how<00:02:13.930> does<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.319> consistency

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
and she asked how does the consistency

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.220 
and she asked how does the consistency
of<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.400> cookie<00:02:15.790> dough<00:02:15.970> how<00:02:16.390> wet<00:02:16.629> or<00:02:16.660> dry<00:02:16.930> does

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
of the cookie dough how wet or dry does

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.809 
of the cookie dough how wet or dry does
affect<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.709> texture<00:02:18.069> of<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.459> finished

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
affect the texture of the finished

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.270 
affect the texture of the finished
cookie<00:02:19.180> personally<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:19.989> think<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.590> does<00:02:20.830> affect

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
cookie personally I think it does affect

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.360 
cookie personally I think it does affect
it<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.549> lot<00:02:22.290> like<00:02:23.290> my<00:02:23.440> last<00:02:23.650> video<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.190> batter

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
it a lot like my last video the batter

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.390 
it a lot like my last video the batter
was<00:02:24.610> really<00:02:25.000> wet<00:02:25.239> so<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.440> cookies<00:02:26.920> spread<00:02:27.220> out

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
was really wet so the cookies spread out

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.390 
was really wet so the cookies spread out
a<00:02:27.430> lot<00:02:28.290> whereas<00:02:29.290> when<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.560> made<00:02:29.830> cookies<00:02:30.129> that
