00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
little bit darker I'm just using a blush

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.680 
little bit darker I'm just using a blush
from<00:01:56.070> NYX<00:01:56.370> because<00:01:56.760> it<00:01:56.880> works<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:57.630> good

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
from NYX because it works just as good

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.230 
from NYX because it works just as good
and<00:01:58.080> I'm<00:01:58.650> just<00:01:58.830> patting<00:01:59.400> that<00:01:59.430> onto<00:01:59.910> the<00:02:00.060> lid

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
and I'm just patting that onto the lid

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.210 
and I'm just patting that onto the lid
again<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:00.690> I'll<00:02:00.780> blend<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:01.230> in<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.500> second<00:02:01.920> but

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
again and I'll blend it in a second but

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.550 
again and I'll blend it in a second but
it<00:02:02.340> gives<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.700> more<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.360> defined<00:02:04.140> pink

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
it gives it more of a defined pink

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.550 
it gives it more of a defined pink
rather<00:02:04.860> than<00:02:05.160> having<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.940> be<00:02:06.810> really<00:02:07.140> similar

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
rather than having it be really similar

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.350 
rather than having it be really similar
to<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.040> crease<00:02:08.280> color<00:02:08.550> which<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.850> purple<00:02:09.210> but

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
to the crease color which is purple but

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.760 
to the crease color which is purple but
it's<00:02:09.720> good<00:02:09.990> if<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.110> don't<00:02:10.410> want<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.619> go<00:02:10.710> too

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
it's good if you don't want to go too

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.240 
it's good if you don't want to go too
dramatic<00:02:11.460> and<00:02:12.470> then<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.590> just<00:02:13.770> want<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:13.980> blend

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
dramatic and then you just want to blend

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.430 
dramatic and then you just want to blend
those<00:02:14.490> two<00:02:14.790> colors<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:15.870> don't<00:02:16.230> look

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
those two colors in so you don't look

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.440

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
find a turquoise eyeliner and start

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.430

applying it to your upper lash line it
was<00:02:51.590> quite<00:02:51.800> difficult<00:02:52.040> for<00:02:52.310> us<00:02:52.520> with<00:02:52.640> this

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
was quite difficult for us with this

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.880 
was quite difficult for us with this
eyeliner<00:02:53.060> it's<00:02:53.360> not<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.600> most<00:02:53.750> pigmented<00:02:54.170> so

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
eyeliner it's not the most pigmented so

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.530 
eyeliner it's not the most pigmented so
basically<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.550> just<00:02:55.610> want<00:02:55.819> to<00:02:56.030> apply<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.450> to

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
basically you just want to apply it to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.110 
basically you just want to apply it to
your<00:02:56.720> upper<00:02:57.290> lash<00:02:57.440> line<00:02:57.470> like<00:02:57.920> I'm<00:02:58.069> doing<00:02:58.340> it

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
your upper lash line like I'm doing it

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.610 
your upper lash line like I'm doing it
doesn't<00:02:59.270> have<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.569> be<00:02:59.690> perfect<00:03:00.050> cuz<00:03:00.200> I'm<00:03:00.440> gonna

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
doesn't have to be perfect cuz I'm gonna

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.350 
doesn't have to be perfect cuz I'm gonna
go<00:03:00.770> over<00:03:01.040> it<00:03:01.130> with<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.340> shadow<00:03:01.610> in<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:01.970> second

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
go over it with the shadow in a second

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.140 
go over it with the shadow in a second
but<00:03:03.050> it's<00:03:03.290> just<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.920> give<00:03:04.070> a<00:03:04.250> nice<00:03:04.400> grip<00:03:04.940> and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
but it's just to give a nice grip and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.820 
but it's just to give a nice grip and
base<00:03:05.570> for<00:03:06.140> eye<00:03:06.920> shadow<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:08.380> like<00:03:09.380> I<00:03:09.470> said<00:03:09.680> I'm

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
base for eye shadow and like I said I'm

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.770 
base for eye shadow and like I said I'm
going<00:03:10.010> in<00:03:10.190> with<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.430> turquoise<00:03:10.940> eyeshadow<00:03:11.209> on

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
going in with a turquoise eyeshadow on

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.870 
going in with a turquoise eyeshadow on
an<00:03:11.959> angled<00:03:12.320> eyeliner<00:03:12.500> brush<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.459> find<00:03:13.700> that

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
an angled eyeliner brush and I find that

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.699 
an angled eyeliner brush and I find that
this<00:03:14.060> just<00:03:14.390> gives<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.840> color<00:03:15.020> a<00:03:15.260> little<00:03:15.560> more

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
this just gives the color a little more

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.320 
this just gives the color a little more
definition<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.489> definitely<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.090> really

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
definition and definitely a really

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.680 
definition and definitely a really

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
this look I'm going to be using two

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.509 
this look I'm going to be using two
mascaras<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.260> first<00:03:39.470> one<00:03:39.620> is<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:39.920> buxom<00:03:40.310> lash

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
mascaras the first one is the buxom lash

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.640 
mascaras the first one is the buxom lash
mascara<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.150> I'm<00:03:41.209> using<00:03:41.420> this<00:03:41.660> one<00:03:41.720> as<00:03:42.050> a<00:03:42.350> base

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
mascara and I'm using this one as a base

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.740 
mascara and I'm using this one as a base
because<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:43.160> find<00:03:43.550> that<00:03:43.700> this<00:03:43.880> mascara<00:03:44.300> holds

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
because I find that this mascara holds

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.320 
because I find that this mascara holds
the<00:03:44.840> curl<00:03:45.050> a<00:03:45.110> little<00:03:45.500> bit<00:03:45.620> better<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.820> so<00:03:47.239> you

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
the curl a little bit better and so you

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.300 
the curl a little bit better and so you
just<00:03:47.510> want<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.780> apply<00:03:48.019> a<00:03:48.290> thick<00:03:48.739> coat<00:03:48.769> of<00:03:49.160> this

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
just want to apply a thick coat of this

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.000 
just want to apply a thick coat of this
it<00:03:50.060> is<00:03:50.360> an<00:03:50.480> option<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:51.019> use<00:03:51.170> false<00:03:51.470> eyelashes

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
it is an option to use false eyelashes

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.090 
it is an option to use false eyelashes
however<00:03:52.430> idle<00:03:52.820> really<00:03:53.720> use<00:03:53.959> false<00:03:54.560> eyelashes
