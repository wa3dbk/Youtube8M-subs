a lot of cards depending on and you
leave<00:02:06.770> them<00:02:06.890> or<00:02:07.039> not<00:02:07.159> but<00:02:07.460> it's<00:02:07.729> very<00:02:08.030> useful

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
leave them or not but it's very useful

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.729 
leave them or not but it's very useful
to<00:02:08.599> have<00:02:08.780> if<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.170> want<00:02:09.319> to<00:02:09.349> protect<00:02:09.619> your

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
cards you also get the spin down like

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.870 
cards you also get the spin down like
counter<00:02:12.380> for<00:02:12.590> this<00:02:12.739> set<00:02:12.950> which<00:02:13.160> has<00:02:13.190> the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
counter for this set which has the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.690 
counter for this set which has the
symbol<00:02:14.480> for<00:02:14.870> coordinates<00:02:15.590> cards<00:02:15.980> on<00:02:16.099> it<00:02:16.130> and

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
symbol for coordinates cards on it and

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.640 
symbol for coordinates cards on it and
it<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.269> a<00:02:17.510> sort<00:02:18.230> of<00:02:18.290> marble<00:02:18.830> even<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:21.110> then<00:02:21.380> you

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
it is a sort of marble even and then you

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.949 
it is a sort of marble even and then you
get<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.220> important<00:02:22.850> which<00:02:23.000> are<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.390> Boosters

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
get the important which are the Boosters

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.490 
get the important which are the Boosters
and<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.860> stack<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.459> 80<00:02:26.150> assorted<00:02:26.720> lamp<00:02:27.049> so<00:02:27.440> you

and a stack of 80 assorted lamp so you

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.770 
and a stack of 80 assorted lamp so you
get<00:02:27.799> nine<00:02:28.069> boosters<00:02:28.580> all<00:02:28.790> together<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.599> fat

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
get nine boosters all together and a fat

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.270 
get nine boosters all together and a fat
pack<00:02:30.019> which<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.470> pretty<00:02:30.860> good<00:02:31.069> deal

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
pack which is a pretty good deal

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.150 
pack which is a pretty good deal
considering<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.299> I<00:02:32.360> think<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:32.900> paid<00:02:33.200> 27

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
considering that I think I paid 27

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.640 
considering that I think I paid 27
pounds<00:02:34.459> for<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.030> whole<00:02:35.209> thing<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:36.349> that<00:02:36.410> was

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
pounds for the whole thing and that was

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.820 
pounds for the whole thing and that was
from<00:02:36.920> magic<00:02:37.580> madhouse<00:02:38.030> which<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.930> find<00:02:39.650> usually

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
from magic madhouse which I find usually

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.100 
from magic madhouse which I find usually
has<00:02:40.250> some<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.060> best<00:02:41.239> prices<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.720> they

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
has some of the best prices and they

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.330 
has some of the best prices and they

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
deliver really fast

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.580 
deliver really fast
now<00:02:43.549> onto<00:02:43.819> opening<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.569> boosters<00:02:45.049> I<00:02:45.230> look<00:02:45.410> so

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
now onto opening the boosters I look so

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.380 
now onto opening the boosters I look so
weird<00:02:45.830> I'm<00:02:46.010> insane<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:46.670> this<00:02:47.000> is<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.239> new

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
weird I'm insane so this is the new

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.930 
weird I'm insane so this is the new
mechanic<00:02:47.870> which<00:02:48.080> is<00:02:48.230> tribute<00:02:48.769> and<00:02:49.100> basically

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
mechanic which is tribute and basically

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.930 
mechanic which is tribute and basically
how<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.180> works<00:02:50.239> is<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.980> your<00:02:51.980> opponent<00:02:52.670> gets

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
how it works is that your opponent gets

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.400 
how it works is that your opponent gets
to<00:02:53.150> choose<00:02:53.329> when<00:02:53.600> you<00:02:53.690> cast<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:54.109> card

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
to choose when you cast this card

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.319 
to choose when you cast this card
whether<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.859> will<00:02:55.010> get<00:02:55.190> three<00:02:55.790> plus<00:02:55.940> one<00:02:56.180> plus

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
whether you will get three plus one plus

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.840 
whether you will get three plus one plus
one<00:02:56.450> counters<00:02:56.989> on<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.320> or<00:02:57.560> if<00:02:57.859> it<00:02:58.100> will<00:02:58.250> get<00:02:58.430> the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
one counters on it or if it will get the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.970 
one counters on it or if it will get the
effect<00:02:59.239> below<00:02:59.720> and<00:03:00.049> it's<00:03:00.380> just<00:03:00.590> kind<00:03:00.829> of<00:03:00.890> a

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
effect below and it's just kind of a

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.370 
effect below and it's just kind of a
cool<00:03:01.340> mechanic<00:03:02.000> here<00:03:02.690> also<00:03:02.840> have<00:03:03.079> a<00:03:03.109> creature

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380
