00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
every time you get close to the river if

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.759 
every time you get close to the river if
it's<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.570> Christmas<00:00:30.570> Circle<00:00:31.080> repeatedly<00:00:31.650> to

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
it's like Christmas Circle repeatedly to

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.170 
it's like Christmas Circle repeatedly to
get<00:00:31.920> out<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.880> really<00:00:33.239> annoying<00:00:33.750> part<00:00:34.620> I

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
get out it's a really annoying part I

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.959 
get out it's a really annoying part I
didn't<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.110> came<00:00:37.980> really<00:00:38.520> close<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
didn't if it was I came really close to

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.440 
didn't if it was I came really close to
dying<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.290> never<00:00:40.500> died<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.910> part<00:00:42.180> so

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
dying but it never died on this part so

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.000 
dying but it never died on this part so
I<00:00:42.540> think<00:00:42.600> there's<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.170> checkpoint<00:00:43.440> between

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
I think there's a checkpoint between

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.639 
I think there's a checkpoint between
that<00:00:44.160> last<00:00:44.460> part<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.750> part<00:00:45.870> because

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
that last part and this part because

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.319 
that last part and this part because
this<00:00:46.739> parts<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.309> different<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.780> different

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
this parts so different that different

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.209 
this parts so different that different
that<00:00:52.550> if<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.760> died<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.800> after<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.980> whole

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that if you died here after that whole

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.490 
that if you died here after that whole
long<00:00:56.520> 7<00:00:57.000> meter<00:00:57.180> fight<00:00:57.449> you'd<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.199> pissed

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
long 7 meter fight you'd be so pissed

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.520 
long 7 meter fight you'd be so pissed
off<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:59.670> it<00:01:00.120> would<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.530> ridiculous

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
off that it would just be ridiculous

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.640 
off that it would just be ridiculous
right<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:03.420> I'm<00:01:03.510> assuming<00:01:03.899> there's<00:01:04.500> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
right so I'm assuming there's a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.230 
right so I'm assuming there's a
checkpoint<00:01:05.270> where<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.299> switched<00:01:06.750> video<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:09.210> I

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
checkpoint where I switched video so I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.120 
checkpoint where I switched video so I
just<00:01:09.810> keep<00:01:10.020> doing<00:01:10.260> your<00:01:10.320> heavy<00:01:10.530> attack<00:01:10.890> on

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
just keep doing your heavy attack on

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.929 
just keep doing your heavy attack on
them<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.170> try<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.260> roll<00:01:13.770> away<00:01:14.280> from<00:01:14.729> his

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
them and try to roll away from his

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.149 
them and try to roll away from his
attacks<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.750> at<00:01:16.080> all<00:01:16.110> possible<00:01:16.229> he<00:01:16.979> won't

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
attacks if at all possible he won't

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.450 
attacks if at all possible he won't
attack<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.640> while<00:01:17.790> you're<00:01:18.030> climbing<00:01:18.630> back<00:01:19.020> up

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
attack you while you're climbing back up

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.289 
attack you while you're climbing back up
thankfully

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
thankfully

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.609 
thankfully
and<00:01:22.539> then<00:01:22.990> after<00:01:23.710> this<00:01:23.950> there's<00:01:24.399> still
