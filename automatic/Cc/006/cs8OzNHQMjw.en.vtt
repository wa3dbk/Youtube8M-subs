but<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:59.460> now<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.820> only<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.420> unboxing<00:02:01.079> so

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
but for now it's only the unboxing so

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:09.950 
but for now it's only the unboxing so
let's<00:02:01.640> open<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.000> box

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.080 

so<00:02:10.960> the<00:02:11.050> box<00:02:11.230> has<00:02:11.650> already<00:02:12.130> been<00:02:12.310> opened<00:02:12.460> it<00:02:12.880> is

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
so the box has already been opened it is

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.590 
so the box has already been opened it is
not<00:02:13.300> a<00:02:13.900> new<00:02:14.500> device<00:02:14.890> for<00:02:15.160> us<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.420> the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
not a new device for us so this is the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.900 
not a new device for us so this is the
box<00:02:16.840> here<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:18.010> can<00:02:18.190> see<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.610> user<00:02:18.790> manual

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
box here you can see the user manual

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.600 
box here you can see the user manual
right<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:19.900> top<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.350> eyeball<00:02:20.710> and<00:02:20.860> e4a

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
projector which can project images at

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.629 
projector which can project images at
640<00:05:13.240> by<00:05:13.360> 480<00:05:13.599> resolution<00:05:14.310> another<00:05:15.310> set<00:05:15.550> of

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
640 by 480 resolution another set of

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.760 
640 by 480 resolution another set of
loudspeakers<00:05:16.270> here<00:05:16.599> and<00:05:16.779> the<00:05:17.379> power<00:05:17.560> button

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
loudspeakers here and the power button

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.159 
loudspeakers here and the power button
so<00:05:18.550> the<00:05:18.669> battery<00:05:18.969> is<00:05:19.090> already<00:05:19.509> inside<00:05:19.840> let's

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
so the battery is already inside let's

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.079 
so the battery is already inside let's
open<00:05:20.409> the<00:05:20.710> bat<00:05:20.889> and<00:05:21.219> see<00:05:21.490> what<00:05:21.759> else<00:05:22.120> is<00:05:22.479> inside

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:24.089 
open the bat and see what else is inside

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:27.329 
open the bat and see what else is inside
so<00:05:25.089> the<00:05:25.180> back<00:05:25.360> is<00:05:25.529> extremely<00:05:26.529> tough<00:05:26.740> to<00:05:26.979> open

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:27.339 
so the back is extremely tough to open

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:32.249 
so the back is extremely tough to open
with<00:05:27.819> hand<00:05:30.089> you<00:05:31.089> can<00:05:31.270> see<00:05:31.449> the<00:05:31.599> battery<00:05:31.810> here

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
with hand you can see the battery here

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.860 
with hand you can see the battery here
the<00:05:33.039> thousand<00:05:33.550> final<00:05:33.849> image<00:05:34.120> with<00:05:34.479> the<00:05:34.569> amount

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
the thousand final image with the amount

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.279 
the thousand final image with the amount
battery<00:05:35.259> and<00:05:35.440> you<00:05:36.430> also<00:05:36.610> have<00:05:36.969> the<00:05:37.360> SIM<00:05:37.990> card

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
battery and you also have the SIM card

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.680 
battery and you also have the SIM card
and<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:38.860> micro<00:05:39.129> SD<00:05:39.400> card<00:05:39.610> slots<00:05:39.909> stacked<00:05:40.509> upon

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
and the micro SD card slots stacked upon

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.610 
and the micro SD card slots stacked upon
each<00:05:40.870> other<00:05:41.169> here<00:05:41.639> let's<00:05:42.960> take<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.229> battery

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
each other here let's take the battery

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.180 
each other here let's take the battery
out<00:05:44.650> and<00:05:44.800> see<00:05:46.199> so<00:05:47.199> there<00:05:47.409> you<00:05:47.560> can<00:05:47.710> see<00:05:47.919> that

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
out and see so there you can see that

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.070 
out and see so there you can see that
it's<00:05:48.789> a<00:05:49.089> dual<00:05:49.419> SIM<00:05:49.750> phone

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
it's a dual SIM phone

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.839 
it's a dual SIM phone
one<00:05:50.349> is<00:05:50.669> gsm<00:05:51.669> 3g<00:05:51.699> and<00:05:52.300> other<00:05:52.750> is<00:05:53.139> TSM<00:05:53.680> edge<00:05:53.919> you

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
one is gsm 3g and other is TSM edge you

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:57.420 
one is gsm 3g and other is TSM edge you
also<00:05:54.969> have<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.479> micro<00:05:55.779> SD<00:05:56.020> card<00:05:56.229> slot<00:05:56.469> here<00:05:56.500> so

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
also have the micro SD card slot here so

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.760 
also have the micro SD card slot here so
that's<00:05:57.669> the<00:05:58.000> same<00:05:58.210> arrangement<00:05:58.569> of<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.349> phone

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
that's the same arrangement of the phone

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.800 
that's the same arrangement of the phone
you<00:06:00.339> can<00:06:00.520> also<00:06:00.789> notice<00:06:01.150> that<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.509> SAR<00:06:01.779> value

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
you can also notice that the SAR value

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.779 
you can also notice that the SAR value
is<00:06:02.469> embedded<00:06:03.069> here<00:06:03.279> in<00:06:03.430> the<00:06:03.520> back<00:06:04.589> so<00:06:05.589> let's

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
is embedded here in the back so let's

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.510 
is embedded here in the back so let's
power<00:06:06.789> on<00:06:06.819> this<00:06:07.120> device<00:06:07.389> and<00:06:07.740> see<00:06:08.740> what<00:06:09.219> it's

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
power on this device and see what it's

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.080 
power on this device and see what it's
like<00:06:09.819> the<00:06:10.089> software

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.790 

so<00:06:16.090> the<00:06:16.180> battery<00:06:16.480> is<00:06:16.570> extremely<00:06:17.170> low<00:06:17.320> so<00:06:17.590> we

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
so the battery is extremely low so we

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.130 
so the battery is extremely low so we
can't<00:06:18.010> really<00:06:18.370> show<00:06:18.580> you<00:06:18.610> the<00:06:19.420> project<00:06:19.630> I<00:06:19.900> will

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
can't really show you the project I will

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.020 
can't really show you the project I will
show<00:06:20.350> it<00:06:20.500> to<00:06:20.530> you<00:06:20.770> in<00:06:21.130> a<00:06:21.250> different<00:06:21.430> demo<00:06:21.850> as

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
show it to you in a different demo as

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.540 
show it to you in a different demo as
you<00:06:22.270> can<00:06:22.420> see<00:06:22.660> that<00:06:22.930> the<00:06:23.740> refresh<00:06:24.310> rate<00:06:24.520> is

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
you can see that the refresh rate is

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.960 
you can see that the refresh rate is
extremely<00:06:25.320> low<00:06:26.320> on<00:06:26.650> the<00:06:26.890> screen<00:06:27.220> it's<00:06:27.820> not

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
extremely low on the screen it's not

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.810 
extremely low on the screen it's not
visible<00:06:28.300> in<00:06:28.720> person<00:06:29.200> but<00:06:29.440> on<00:06:30.100> the<00:06:30.250> camera<00:06:30.580> it's

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
visible in person but on the camera it's

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.820 
visible in person but on the camera it's
showing<00:06:31.150> appliance<00:06:31.600> let's<00:06:32.170> quickly<00:06:32.500> go

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
showing appliance let's quickly go

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.520 
showing appliance let's quickly go
through<00:06:32.860> the<00:06:33.510> settings<00:06:34.510> page<00:06:34.900> to<00:06:35.170> the<00:06:35.290> about

through the settings page to the about

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.870 
through the settings page to the about
