00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.379
 We also had a big side 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:49.370
 enough hole biting on here 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:52.559

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:13.850
 gnawed on mice feast mountain and here here 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.610
 we have several holes at the same time 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:21.869
 also had to lay inside 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:27.780

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:31.079

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.229
 already stuck through this huge 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.570
 hole 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:42.630
 several internal patch is applied 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:49.340
 we have holes literally here everywhere 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:53.070
 present at the very moment 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.979
 which surprised us we encountered this 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.659
 first time that the mouse got inside 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.880
 and 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:06.990
 as we see nibbled the partition and 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.399
 not just nibbled but here's another 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.349
 hole through that is 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.930
 partition actually like a colander to this 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:18.459
 here already here are three patch points imposed 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.159
 here is one straight through the hole that is already 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.510
 it's like a hole in a hole is hard enough 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:28.049
 interesting for us 3rd 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.150
 partition all please 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:36.159
 the partition is literally a colander 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.859
 can we say here we see the case here 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:43.450
 surcharges points we have already imposed and now through 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:47.409
 here we see this hole all put 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.599
 a patch inside is quite difficult 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:55.359
 interesting such repair goes with us 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:59.730
 Tomorrow morning we will inflate we will check 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:02.730
 each compartment the boat us came from 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.730
 Rostov-on-Don 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:29.709
 Here we have already laid the third patch 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:32.879
 leveled it and there were 4 more holes 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:36.519
 inside we have closed up 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.319
 Now we need to wait 12 hours we all 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.389
 put patches leveled with a spatula 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:46.919
 need to wait 12 hours and inflate the compartment 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.919
 to ensure their tightness
