hey what's up this is Marcus Henderson

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.629 
hey what's up this is Marcus Henderson
you're<00:00:12.379> watching<00:00:12.680> Xin<00:00:12.889> and<00:00:13.099> the<00:00:13.490> yarn

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
you're watching Xin and the yarn

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.909 
you're watching Xin and the yarn
shredding<00:00:14.119> you<00:00:14.660> know<00:00:14.780> what<00:00:14.990> I<00:00:15.259> want<00:00:15.710> to<00:00:15.769> talk

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:15.919 
shredding you know what I want to talk

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.350 
shredding you know what I want to talk
about<00:00:16.040> getting<00:00:16.369> a<00:00:16.430> really<00:00:16.640> good<00:00:16.849> guitar<00:00:17.150> tone

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
about getting a really good guitar tone

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.080 
about getting a really good guitar tone
in<00:00:17.540> the<00:00:17.630> studio<00:00:17.960> today<00:00:18.320> particularly<00:00:19.130> metal

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
in the studio today particularly metal

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.700 
in the studio today particularly metal
metal<00:00:20.779> seems<00:00:20.990> to<00:00:21.080> be<00:00:21.200> one<00:00:21.349> of<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:21.470> hardest

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
metal seems to be one of the hardest

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.589 
metal seems to be one of the hardest
tones<00:00:22.099> to<00:00:22.310> master<00:00:22.760> and<00:00:23.060> a<00:00:23.119> lot<00:00:23.269> of<00:00:23.390> people

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
tones to master and a lot of people

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:24.970 
tones to master and a lot of people
think<00:00:23.750> it's<00:00:23.840> really<00:00:24.140> easy<00:00:24.349> to<00:00:24.500> just<00:00:24.650> plug<00:00:24.830> in

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
think it's really easy to just plug in

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.769 
think it's really easy to just plug in
and<00:00:25.130> go<00:00:25.250> nothing<00:00:26.000> could<00:00:26.119> be<00:00:26.210> farther<00:00:26.390> from<00:00:26.570> the

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
and go nothing could be farther from the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.210 
and go nothing could be farther from the
truth<00:00:26.810> you<00:00:27.380> know<00:00:27.470> when<00:00:27.590> it<00:00:27.679> comes<00:00:27.830> to<00:00:27.980> great

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
truth you know when it comes to great

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.790 
truth you know when it comes to great
guitar<00:00:28.609> tones<00:00:28.910> you<00:00:29.660> know<00:00:29.779> the<00:00:30.199> sum<00:00:30.529> of<00:00:30.650> its

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
guitar tones you know the sum of its

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.650 
guitar tones you know the sum of its
parts<00:00:30.890> is<00:00:31.400> really<00:00:31.789> all<00:00:31.939> that<00:00:32.090> counts<00:00:32.540> when

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
parts is really all that counts when

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.630 
parts is really all that counts when
you're<00:00:32.780> looking<00:00:33.050> at<00:00:33.260> instruments<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.070> every

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
you're looking at instruments and every

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.579 
you're looking at instruments and every
little<00:00:34.910> detail<00:00:35.059> involved<00:00:35.629> from<00:00:35.960> amplifiers

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:36.589 
little detail involved from amplifiers

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:39.460 
little detail involved from amplifiers
to<00:00:36.830> pick<00:00:37.160> up<00:00:37.339> sis<00:00:37.640> switches<00:00:38.629> and<00:00:38.750> knobs<00:00:38.809> they

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
to pick up sis switches and knobs they

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.320 
to pick up sis switches and knobs they
all<00:00:39.769> affect<00:00:40.159> your<00:00:40.309> tone<00:00:40.519> every<00:00:40.909> single<00:00:41.210> one<00:00:41.299> of

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
all affect your tone every single one of

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.610 
all affect your tone every single one of
them<00:00:41.479> puts<00:00:41.720> a<00:00:41.780> little<00:00:41.930> bit<00:00:42.049> under<00:00:42.320> your<00:00:42.409> tones

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
them puts a little bit under your tones

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.710 
them puts a little bit under your tones
so<00:00:43.129> when<00:00:43.250> it<00:00:43.339> comes<00:00:43.489> to<00:00:43.640> metal<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:44.510> want<00:00:44.570> to

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
so when it comes to metal you want to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.840 
so when it comes to metal you want to
start<00:00:44.900> concentrating<00:00:45.110> on<00:00:45.680> a<00:00:46.129> less<00:00:46.430> is<00:00:46.610> more

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
start concentrating on a less is more

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.500 
start concentrating on a less is more
approach<00:00:46.879> because<00:00:47.629> gain<00:00:48.350> is<00:00:48.739> a<00:00:48.769> tricky<00:00:49.339> thing

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
approach because gain is a tricky thing

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.670 
approach because gain is a tricky thing
particularly<00:00:50.510> when<00:00:50.900> it<00:00:50.989> comes<00:00:51.049> to<00:00:51.260> hard<00:00:51.470> rock

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
particularly when it comes to hard rock

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.439 
particularly when it comes to hard rock
and<00:00:51.860> metal<00:00:52.100> players<00:00:52.519> they<00:00:52.760> think<00:00:53.000> that<00:00:53.150> more

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
and metal players they think that more

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.869 
and metal players they think that more
gain<00:00:53.690> is<00:00:53.900> more<00:00:54.110> when<00:00:54.680> in<00:00:54.799> reality<00:00:54.979> more<00:00:55.610> gain

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
gain is more when in reality more gain

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.030 
gain is more when in reality more gain
is<00:00:56.150> just<00:00:56.360> more<00:00:56.600> noise<00:00:56.869> so<00:00:57.530> what<00:00:57.619> you<00:00:57.739> want<00:00:57.949> to

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
is just more noise so what you want to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.859 
is just more noise so what you want to
do<00:00:58.159> as<00:00:58.400> a<00:00:58.460> rule<00:00:58.850> of<00:00:58.970> thumb<00:00:59.000> if<00:00:59.479> you're<00:00:59.659> having

00:00:59.859 --> 00:00:59.869 
do as a rule of thumb if you're having

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:01.750 
do as a rule of thumb if you're having
trouble<00:01:00.320> harnessing<00:01:00.860> all<00:01:01.040> of<00:01:01.129> that<00:01:01.250> gain<00:01:01.460> and

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
trouble harnessing all of that gain and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.189 
trouble harnessing all of that gain and
it<00:01:01.850> just<00:01:02.000> sounds<00:01:02.210> fluffy<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:02.869> it<00:01:02.930> doesn't

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
it just sounds fluffy and it doesn't

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.380 
it just sounds fluffy and it doesn't
sound<00:01:03.290> tight<00:01:03.619> like<00:01:03.799> it<00:01:03.949> should<00:01:04.189> roll<00:01:05.000> back<00:01:05.210> the

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
sound tight like it should roll back the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.170 
sound tight like it should roll back the
gain<00:01:05.570> in<00:01:05.780> fact<00:01:06.080> as<00:01:06.740> a<00:01:06.770> rule<00:01:07.130> of<00:01:07.280> thumb<00:01:07.310> start

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
gain in fact as a rule of thumb start

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.330 
gain in fact as a rule of thumb start
with<00:01:08.420> less<00:01:08.780> gain<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.350> then<00:01:09.500> work<00:01:09.710> your<00:01:09.740> way<00:01:09.950> up

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
with less gain and then work your way up

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.190 
with less gain and then work your way up
you'd<00:01:10.580> be<00:01:10.700> surprised<00:01:11.149> about<00:01:11.329> how<00:01:11.539> little<00:01:11.929> gain

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
you'd be surprised about how little gain

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.569 
you'd be surprised about how little gain
you're<00:01:12.469> gonna<00:01:12.560> get<00:01:12.770> out<00:01:12.829> of<00:01:12.979> your<00:01:13.100> stuff<00:01:13.399> and

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
you're gonna get out of your stuff and

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.450 
you're gonna get out of your stuff and
still<00:01:14.179> have<00:01:14.329> it<00:01:14.450> sound<00:01:14.630> awesome<00:01:15.159> in<00:01:16.159> some

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
still have it sound awesome in some

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.389 
still have it sound awesome in some
amplifiers<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.329> third<00:01:17.679> just<00:01:18.679> at<00:01:18.799> three<00:01:19.130> is

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
amplifiers the third just at three is

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.580 
amplifiers the third just at three is
hardcore<00:01:19.789> like<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.179> 5150<00:01:20.899> if<00:01:21.020> any<00:01:21.200> if<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:21.409> guys

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
hardcore like a 5150 if any if you guys

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.109 
hardcore like a 5150 if any if you guys
have<00:01:21.770> 51<00:01:22.100> 50s<00:01:22.429> out<00:01:22.520> there<00:01:22.729> you're<00:01:22.850> gonna<00:01:22.909> be

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
have 51 50s out there you're gonna be

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.050 
have 51 50s out there you're gonna be
like<00:01:23.240> there's<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:24.310> outstanding<00:01:25.310> gain<00:01:25.820> on<00:01:26.030> that

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
like there's a outstanding gain on that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.270 
like there's a outstanding gain on that
amplifier<00:01:26.630> but<00:01:27.200> that<00:01:27.380> is<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.649> only<00:01:27.770> amplifier

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
amplifier but that is the only amplifier

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.380 
amplifier but that is the only amplifier
in<00:01:28.399> the<00:01:28.490> world<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.789> I<00:01:28.820> know<00:01:28.939> of<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:29.179> has

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
in the world that I know of that has

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.300 
in the world that I know of that has
five<00:01:29.689> gain<00:01:29.990> stages<00:01:30.499> and<00:01:30.770> when<00:01:31.009> you<00:01:31.100> hit<00:01:31.219> to

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
five gain stages and when you hit to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.649 
five gain stages and when you hit to
about<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.579> fourth<00:01:31.729> or<00:01:31.909> fifth<00:01:31.969> you're<00:01:32.390> really

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
about the fourth or fifth you're really

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.480 
about the fourth or fifth you're really
just<00:01:32.840> hitting<00:01:33.140> this<00:01:33.229> wasteland<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:34.039> gain<00:01:34.249> and

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
just hitting this wasteland of gain and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.980 
just hitting this wasteland of gain and
it<00:01:34.549> doesn't<00:01:34.789> really<00:01:34.880> sound<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:35.240> good<00:01:35.479> so

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
it doesn't really sound that good so

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.840 
it doesn't really sound that good so
check<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:36.350> out<00:01:36.439> everybody<00:01:36.679> here's<00:01:37.490> what<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:37.700> do

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
check it out everybody here's what I do
