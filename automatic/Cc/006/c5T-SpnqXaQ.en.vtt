a number of interesting answers here so
let's<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.860> go<00:01:04.920> over<00:01:05.129> them<00:01:05.369> starting<00:01:06.000> with

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
let's just go over them starting with

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
let's just go over them starting with
this<00:01:06.240> one<00:01:06.299> from<00:01:06.570> Joey<00:01:06.840> Gibbs<00:01:07.170> where<00:01:07.409> he

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
this one from Joey Gibbs where he

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.440

zombies<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:10.680> that's<00:01:10.860> worth<00:01:11.040> pointing<00:01:11.369> out

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
zombies so that's worth pointing out

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.950 
zombies so that's worth pointing out
because<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> confirms<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.510> name<00:01:12.659> space

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
because it confirms that the name space

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.780 
because it confirms that the name space
zombie<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.530> really<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.070> placeholder<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
zombie is really just a placeholder and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.340 
zombie is really just a placeholder and
that<00:01:15.210> there<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.810> proper<00:01:16.200> name

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
that there is going to be a proper name

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
that there is going to be a proper name
coming<00:01:16.740> soon<00:01:16.950> which<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.340> expected<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.090> now<00:01:18.360> we

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
coming soon which I expected but now we

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.539 
coming soon which I expected but now we
have<00:01:18.630> proof<00:01:18.710> now<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.860> next<00:01:20.040> one<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.280> very

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
have proof now this next one is very

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.340 
have proof now this next one is very
interesting<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.150> comes<00:01:21.330> from<00:01:21.450> Earth<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.930> he

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350

already talked about before but this is
just<00:03:00.340> further<00:03:00.760> reinforcing<00:03:01.449> the<00:03:01.540> fact<00:03:01.689> that

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
just further reinforcing the fact that

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.209 
just further reinforcing the fact that
although<00:03:02.109> the<00:03:02.319> game<00:03:02.469> is<00:03:02.709> built<00:03:02.949> for

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
alone wolf approach still works fine

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.059

money to get what you want they gave a
very<00:03:23.319> vague<00:03:23.620> answer<00:03:24.069> saying<00:03:24.400> destiny<00:03:24.970> is<00:03:25.120> an

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
very vague answer saying destiny is an

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.089 
very vague answer saying destiny is an
action<00:03:25.629> game<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.169> you'll<00:03:26.290> grind<00:03:26.560> your<00:03:26.739> enemies

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
action game so you'll grind your enemies

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.159 
action game so you'll grind your enemies
into<00:03:27.129> dust<00:03:27.609> so<00:03:28.329> again<00:03:28.540> that's<00:03:28.689> pretty<00:03:28.989> vague

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
into dust so again that's pretty vague

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.719 
into dust so again that's pretty vague
it<00:03:29.439> really<00:03:29.680> doesn't<00:03:29.979> say<00:03:30.099> anything<00:03:30.400> but<00:03:30.609> it

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729 
it really doesn't say anything but it

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.429 
it really doesn't say anything but it
kinda<00:03:31.180> makes<00:03:31.359> it<00:03:31.479> sound<00:03:31.689> like<00:03:31.959> there<00:03:32.169> will<00:03:32.259> be

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 
kinda makes it sound like there will be

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.140 
kinda makes it sound like there will be
some<00:03:32.680> grinding<00:03:33.069> element<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.579> game<00:03:33.759> but<00:03:34.090> I

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
some grinding element in the game but I

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.819 
some grinding element in the game but I
hope<00:03:34.389> it's<00:03:34.569> not<00:03:34.689> a<00:03:34.750> major<00:03:34.930> factor<00:03:35.319> because<00:03:35.739> I

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
hope it's not a major factor because I

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.140 
hope it's not a major factor because I
personally<00:03:36.370> don't<00:03:36.519> want<00:03:36.729> to<00:03:36.790> do<00:03:36.879> the<00:03:36.970> same
