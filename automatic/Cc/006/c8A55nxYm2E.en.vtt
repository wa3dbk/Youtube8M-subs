Soho<00:02:24.159> ponytail<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:25.420> know<00:02:25.540> just<00:02:25.750> clip<00:02:26.049> it<00:02:26.080> in

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
Soho ponytail you know just clip it in

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.680 
Soho ponytail you know just clip it in
and<00:02:26.650> off<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.250> go<00:02:27.280> now<00:02:28.090> this<00:02:28.239> is<00:02:28.299> a<00:02:28.420> little

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
and off you go now this is a little

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.210 
and off you go now this is a little
harder<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.019> use<00:02:29.230> right<00:02:29.410> now<00:02:29.560> because<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:29.890> have

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
harder you use right now because I have

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.280 
harder you use right now because I have
my<00:02:30.430> little<00:02:30.640> highlights<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.959> this<00:02:32.260> doesn't

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
my little highlights so this doesn't

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.990 
my little highlights so this doesn't
exactly<00:02:32.709> match<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:33.549> I<00:02:33.670> don't<00:02:33.700> think<00:02:33.910> I

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
exactly match that and I don't think I

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.490 
exactly match that and I don't think I
could<00:02:34.180> get<00:02:34.269> anything<00:02:34.480> that<00:02:34.720> does<00:02:34.900> but<00:02:35.290> other

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
could get anything that does but other

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.170 
could get anything that does but other
than<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.769> if<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.160> have<00:02:36.310> like<00:02:36.549> a<00:02:36.580> solid<00:02:37.030> color

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
than that if you have like a solid color

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.569 
than that if you have like a solid color
or<00:02:37.750> even<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.230> couple<00:02:38.470> highlights<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.400> are

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
or even a couple highlights that are

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.940 
or even a couple highlights that are
more<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:40.209> guess<00:02:40.780> typical<00:02:41.349> they<00:02:41.500> can<00:02:41.650> probably

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
more I guess typical they can probably

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.020 
more I guess typical they can probably
work<00:02:42.069> with<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.519> they<00:02:42.610> probably<00:02:42.790> have

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
work with you and they probably have

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.240 
work with you and they probably have
something<00:02:43.239> that<00:02:43.450> suits<00:02:43.599> your<00:02:43.750> needs<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.829> and<00:02:45.160> i

will<00:02:45.400> put<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.610> link<00:02:45.730> down<00:02:46.440> there<00:02:47.440> i<00:02:47.799> got<00:02:48.160> that

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
will put the link down there i got that

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.009 
will put the link down there i got that
in<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.519> mall<00:02:48.760> but<00:02:49.030> not<00:02:49.299> all<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.540> malls<00:02:49.810> have

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
in the mall but not all the malls have

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.170 
in the mall but not all the malls have
sometimes<00:02:50.410> they<00:02:50.500> have<00:02:50.590> like<00:02:50.769> kiosk<00:02:51.129> is<00:02:51.370> kiosks

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
sometimes they have like kiosk is kiosks

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.089 
sometimes they have like kiosk is kiosks
another<00:02:52.690> reason<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.049> get<00:02:53.170> them<00:02:53.319> is<00:02:53.440> because<00:02:53.620> in

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
another reason to get them is because in

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.309 
another reason to get them is because in
my<00:02:54.340> opinion<00:02:54.400> they<00:02:54.790> are<00:02:54.819> quicker<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.569> easier

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
my opinion they are quicker and easier

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.740 
my opinion they are quicker and easier
than<00:02:57.160> doing<00:02:57.370> your<00:02:57.579> own<00:02:57.609> hair<00:02:57.970> if<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.510> have

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
than doing your own hair if you have

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.390 
than doing your own hair if you have
hair<00:02:59.109> that<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.379> don't<00:02:59.620> naturally<00:03:00.069> like<00:03:00.250> how

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
hair that you don't naturally like how

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.949 
hair that you don't naturally like how
it<00:03:00.519> is<00:03:00.579> now<00:03:00.760> if<00:03:00.879> your<00:03:01.000> hair<00:03:01.180> is<00:03:01.209> naturally<00:03:01.690> sick

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
it is now if your hair is naturally sick

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.949 
it is now if your hair is naturally sick
and<00:03:02.200> long<00:03:03.129> then<00:03:03.879> it's<00:03:04.180> not<00:03:04.390> quicker<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.930> use

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
and long then it's not quicker to use

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.410 
and long then it's not quicker to use
extension<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:05.680> with<00:03:06.459> my<00:03:06.640> hair<00:03:06.879> it's<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.150> much

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
extension so with my hair it's so much

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.330 
extension so with my hair it's so much
quicker<00:03:07.660> instead<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.260> using<00:03:08.500> tons<00:03:08.829> of<00:03:09.010> moose<00:03:09.190> I

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
quicker instead of using tons of moose I

come<00:03:20.560> back<00:03:20.709> up<00:03:20.919> and<00:03:21.280> then<00:03:21.790> they<00:03:21.970> have<00:03:22.150> to

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
come back up and then they have to

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.059 
come back up and then they have to
straighten<00:03:22.720> it<00:03:22.900> because<00:03:23.290> their<00:03:23.560> hair<00:03:23.739> is<00:03:23.829> wavy

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
and then they want to curl it so this

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.440 
and then they want to curl it so this
takes<00:03:26.500> like<00:03:26.799> forever<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.519> do<00:03:27.669> so<00:03:28.000> instead<00:03:28.389> of

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
takes like forever to do so instead of

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.349 
takes like forever to do so instead of
doing<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:28.870> I<00:03:29.290> just<00:03:30.250> would<00:03:30.549> rather<00:03:30.760> let<00:03:31.209> it

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
doing that I just would rather let it

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.390 
doing that I just would rather let it
air<00:03:31.569> dry<00:03:31.599> which<00:03:32.049> is<00:03:32.169> also<00:03:32.319> healthier<00:03:32.859> instead

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
air dry which is also healthier instead

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.729 
air dry which is also healthier instead
of<00:03:33.519> applying<00:03:33.819> all<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.180> heat<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.660> then<00:03:35.319> just

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
of applying all that heat and then just

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.890 
of applying all that heat and then just
