00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
that if you return the most weather

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.710 
that if you return the most weather
returns<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.020> most<00:02:19.640> like<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:22.160> account<00:02:23.720> other

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
returns the most like a account other

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.260 
returns the most like a account other
times<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.470> most<00:02:25.680> fractal<00:02:26.250> said<00:02:26.610> they<00:02:27.030> got<00:02:27.209> a

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
times the most fractal said they got a

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.260 
times the most fractal said they got a
hero<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:28.860> I'm<00:02:29.280> just<00:02:29.489> gonna<00:02:29.670> go<00:02:31.940> i'm<00:02:32.940> gonna<00:02:33.090> go
