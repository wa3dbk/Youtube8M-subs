00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
to Cod think it's a month out here and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.990 
to Cod think it's a month out here and
there's<00:00:34.170> one<00:00:34.320> down<00:00:34.469> here<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.790> offhand

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
there's one down here just just offhand

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.049 
there's one down here just just offhand
but<00:00:36.420> there's<00:00:36.660> only<00:00:36.750> out<00:00:37.020> there<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:38.940> what

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
but there's only out there and so what

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.209 
but there's only out there and so what
you<00:00:39.180> do<00:00:39.739> check<00:00:40.739> your<00:00:40.920> shin<00:00:41.460> instep<00:00:41.969> which<00:00:42.450> is

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
you do check your shin instep which is

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.910 
you do check your shin instep which is
okay<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.850> part<00:00:45.149> there<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.930> above<00:00:46.860> your

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
okay that part there just above your

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.020 
okay that part there just above your
ankle<00:00:47.190> cut<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:49.010> part<00:00:50.010> that's<00:00:50.460> under

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
ankle cut that in part that's under

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.319 
ankle cut that in part that's under
there<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:52.110> hook<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.410> back<00:00:52.590> your<00:00:52.860> leg<00:00:53.149> to<00:00:54.149> be

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
there you hook the back your leg to be

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:03.219 
there you hook the back your leg to be
knee<00:00:54.570> or<00:00:54.840> slightly<00:00:55.350> above<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:56.480> this<00:01:01.460> like<00:01:02.460> that

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
knee or slightly above on this like that

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:09.080 
knee or slightly above on this like that
so<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.619> theory<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:06.409> fairly<00:01:07.409> strong<00:01:07.680> legs<00:01:07.979> /<00:01:08.189> guy

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
so in theory I fairly strong legs / guy

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.969 
so in theory I fairly strong legs / guy
16<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:09.960> there<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.470> should<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.740> able<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
16 but it's there you should be able to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.399 
16 but it's there you should be able to
lift<00:01:11.100> yourself<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.820> your<00:01:11.939> legs<00:01:12.409> like

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
lift yourself up in just your legs like

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.490 
lift yourself up in just your legs like
that<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.810> down<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> 45<00:01:16.680> incline

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
that so I have it down on a 45 incline

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.410 
that so I have it down on a 45 incline
all<00:01:19.500> basically<00:01:20.000> there's<00:01:21.000> number<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.270> ways<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
all basically there's number of ways you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.219 
all basically there's number of ways you
can<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.920> if<00:01:22.920> you're<00:01:23.040> bad<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.430> sit<00:01:23.610> ups

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
can do it if you're bad at sit ups

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.080 
can do it if you're bad at sit ups

your mother grip back up oh so that's
your<00:03:06.850> standard<00:03:07.150> setup<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:08.830> third<00:03:09.190> thing<00:03:09.310> is

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.880 

inclines<00:03:18.640> which<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:19.090> basically<00:03:19.890> standard

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
inclines which is basically standard

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.400 
inclines which is basically standard
crunches<00:03:21.280> so<00:03:21.610> same<00:03:21.880> thing<00:03:22.170> here<00:03:25.290> let's<00:03:26.290> go

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
crunches so same thing here let's go

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.900 
crunches so same thing here let's go
entire<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.890> make<00:03:27.040> some<00:03:27.220> lot<00:03:27.400> longer<00:03:27.610> than<00:03:27.820> the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
entire to make some lot longer than the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:38.300 
entire to make some lot longer than the
board<00:03:28.120> would

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.510 

so<00:03:39.310> it's<00:03:39.430> your<00:03:39.550> basic<00:03:39.760> at<00:03:40.150> work
