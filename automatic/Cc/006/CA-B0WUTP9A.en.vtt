more awesome tips coming your way and
today's<00:00:25.920> one<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.490> good<00:00:27.029> one

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
today's one is a good one

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.109 
today's one is a good one
we're<00:00:27.810> gonna<00:00:27.900> look<00:00:28.109> at<00:00:28.289> using<00:00:28.849> reverb<00:00:29.849> with

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
we're gonna look at using reverb with

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.600 
we're gonna look at using reverb with
pre<00:00:30.510> delay<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.080> your<00:00:31.349> snare<00:00:31.740> drum<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
pre delay on your snare drum and the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.630 
pre delay on your snare drum and the
idea<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.000> being<00:00:33.300> if<00:00:33.540> you're<00:00:34.350> having<00:00:34.500> reverb<00:00:35.460> on

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
idea of being if you're having reverb on

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.370 
idea of being if you're having reverb on
your<00:00:35.820> snare<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.420> maybe<00:00:36.630> give<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.960> some<00:00:37.140> space

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
your snare to maybe give it some space

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.440 
your snare to maybe give it some space
so<00:00:38.100> when<00:00:38.250> they're<00:00:38.399> cracking<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> snare<00:00:39.300> it

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
so when they're cracking on the snare it

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.240 
so when they're cracking on the snare it
sounds<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.140> rings<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.950> space

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
sounds like it just rings in a space

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250 
sounds like it just rings in a space
because<00:00:41.700> probably<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.360> didn't<00:00:42.660> record<00:00:43.079> your

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
because probably you didn't record your

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.500 
because probably you didn't record your
drums<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> nice<00:00:44.010> big<00:00:44.430> space<00:00:44.910> where<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.270> got

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
drums in a nice big space where you got

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.270 
drums in a nice big space where you got
that<00:00:45.539> sound<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.410> we're<00:00:46.530> all<00:00:46.680> looking<00:00:46.860> for

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
that sound that we're all looking for

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.369 
that sound that we're all looking for
most<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.000> us<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.300> small<00:00:48.600> home<00:00:48.780> studio<00:00:48.809> so

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
most of us have small home studio so

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.049 
most of us have small home studio so
maybe<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.890> bedroom<00:00:50.100> maybe<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
maybe it's in a bedroom maybe it's a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.180 
maybe it's in a bedroom maybe it's a
living<00:00:51.270> room<00:00:51.390> whatever<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.530> case<00:00:52.739> we're

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
living room whatever the case we're

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.860 
living room whatever the case we're
going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.370> use<00:00:53.430> some<00:00:53.789> post-processing<00:00:54.300> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
going to use some post-processing and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.689 
going to use some post-processing and
maybe<00:00:55.020> reverb<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.739> something<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.219> will<00:00:56.340> reach

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
maybe reverb is something you will reach

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.569 
maybe reverb is something you will reach
for<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.680> may<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:58.949> fighting<00:00:59.280> with

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
for if you do you may be fighting with

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.450 
for if you do you may be fighting with
all<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.940> decay<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.739> washing<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:01.920> too<00:01:02.309> much

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
all the decay and washing out too much

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.189 
all the decay and washing out too much
you<00:01:02.670> trying<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> find<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.180> balance<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.780> want

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you trying to find a balance of I want

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.630 
you trying to find a balance of I want
it<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.379> hear<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> reverb<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.189> don't<00:01:05.339> want

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it to hear the reverb but I don't want

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.010 
it to hear the reverb but I don't want
to<00:01:05.880> hear<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> reverb<00:01:06.420> at<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> same<00:01:06.750> time

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
to hear the reverb at the same time

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.350 
to hear the reverb at the same time
using<00:01:07.680> pre<00:01:08.010> delay<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.549> great<00:01:08.880> tip<00:01:09.119> let<00:01:09.299> me

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
using pre delay is a great tip let me

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.330 
using pre delay is a great tip let me
show<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.540> how<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.689> do<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.710> I've<00:01:10.890> got<00:01:11.070> just

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
overheads and I've got a reverb right

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.080 
overheads and I've got a reverb right
here<00:01:16.110> onto<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.979> factory<00:01:17.400> default<00:01:17.700> setting

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
here onto just a factory default setting

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.090 
here onto just a factory default setting
with<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> hundred<00:01:18.600> percent<00:01:18.689> wet<00:01:19.140> room<00:01:19.770> size<00:01:20.070> I

with a hundred percent wet room size I
don't<00:01:20.490> even<00:01:20.549> know<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:20.880> room<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:22.159> I've

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
don't even know what room it is and I've

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.570 
don't even know what room it is and I've
got<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.430> send<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.570> snare<00:01:25.439> drum<00:01:25.500> only<00:01:25.860> so

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
got to send on the snare drum only so

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.310 
got to send on the snare drum only so
only<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.030> snare<00:01:27.270> drum<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.659> being<00:01:27.869> sent<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
only the snare drum is being sent to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.499 
only the snare drum is being sent to
this<00:01:28.710> reverb<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.909> good<00:01:30.090> amount<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.360> it's

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
this reverb and a good amount of it's

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.899 
this reverb and a good amount of it's
being<00:01:30.720> sent<00:01:31.159> but<00:01:32.159> take<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> listen<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.670> what's

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
being sent but take a listen to what's

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.609 
being sent but take a listen to what's
happening<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> typical<00:01:34.290> reverb

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
happening just with the typical reverb

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:42.870 
happening just with the typical reverb
setting

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.890 

all<00:01:43.880> right<00:01:43.970> then<00:01:44.270> that<00:01:44.390> doesn't<00:01:44.600> sound

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
all right then that doesn't sound

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.170 
all right then that doesn't sound
natural<00:01:45.369> obviously<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:46.490> could<00:01:46.670> dial<00:01:46.940> back

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
natural obviously you could dial back

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:56.499 
natural obviously you could dial back
the<00:01:47.240> size<00:01:47.630> of<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:47.960> room<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.729> that's<00:01:56.210> better

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
the size of the room and that's better

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.060 
the size of the room and that's better
but<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.020> kind<00:01:57.320> of<00:01:57.410> don't<00:01:57.530> really<00:01:57.619> hear<00:01:57.950> the

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
but I kind of don't really hear the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.840 
but I kind of don't really hear the
reverb<00:01:58.430> anymore<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.750> a<00:02:00.080> compromise<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.369> use

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
reverb anymore so a compromise is to use

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.330 
reverb anymore so a compromise is to use
pre<00:02:02.270> delay<00:02:02.600> now<00:02:03.140> pre<00:02:03.440> delay<00:02:03.710> on<00:02:03.920> this<00:02:04.009> reverb

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
pre delay now pre delay on this reverb

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.700 
pre delay now pre delay on this reverb
it's<00:02:04.520> right<00:02:04.700> up<00:02:04.820> here<00:02:04.970> on<00:02:05.090> this<00:02:05.270> knob<00:02:05.450> is<00:02:05.720> is

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
it's right up here on this knob is is

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.919 
it's right up here on this knob is is
what<00:02:07.070> it<00:02:07.159> sounds<00:02:07.490> like<00:02:07.550> it<00:02:07.790> makes<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.209> delay<00:02:08.660> of

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
what it sounds like it makes a delay of

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.779 
what it sounds like it makes a delay of
whatever<00:02:09.440> goes<00:02:09.770> through<00:02:10.070> it<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:10.369> in<00:02:10.459> our<00:02:10.550> case

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
whatever goes through it so in our case

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.820 
whatever goes through it so in our case
if<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.090> hit<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.390> snare<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.380> crank<00:02:12.680> the

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
if you hit the snare and you crank the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.350 
if you hit the snare and you crank the
pre<00:02:13.010> delay<00:02:13.250> you're<00:02:13.430> going<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.610> hear<00:02:13.850> an<00:02:13.970> exact

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
pre delay you're going to hear an exact

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.690 
pre delay you're going to hear an exact
copy<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.050> let<00:02:15.230> me<00:02:15.320> turn<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:16.100> room<00:02:16.280> size<00:02:16.519> all

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
copy of it let me turn the room size all

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.400 
copy of it let me turn the room size all
the<00:02:16.730> way<00:02:16.880> down<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.269> I'm<00:02:17.959> going<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.110> turn<00:02:18.230> the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the way down and I'm going to turn the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.710 
the way down and I'm going to turn the
pre<00:02:18.590> delay<00:02:18.860> all<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.370> way<00:02:19.459> up<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.090> all<00:02:20.300> we're

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
pre delay all the way up so all we're

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.750 
pre delay all the way up so all we're
not<00:02:20.810> going<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:20.959> hear<00:02:21.080> any<00:02:21.260> room<00:02:21.760> resonance

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
not going to hear any room resonance

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.560 
not going to hear any room resonance
we're<00:02:22.880> just<00:02:23.000> going<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.150> hear<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.420> delay

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
we're just going to hear the delay

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:31.800 
we're just going to hear the delay
listen<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:29.260> okay<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:30.530> an<00:02:30.709> exact<00:02:31.100> delay

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
listen to this okay it's an exact delay

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.350 
listen to this okay it's an exact delay
so<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.470> idea<00:02:33.800> of<00:02:33.980> this<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.690> send<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:36.019> delay

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
so the idea of this is send a delay

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.710 
so the idea of this is send a delay
pre-delay<00:02:38.739> through<00:02:39.739> your<00:02:40.430> reverb<00:02:40.850> all<00:02:41.120> in<00:02:41.570> one

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
pre-delay through your reverb all in one

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.020 
pre-delay through your reverb all in one
unit<00:02:42.079> okay<00:02:42.680> without<00:02:43.160> getting<00:02:43.489> technical<00:02:43.790> let

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
unit okay without getting technical let

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.250 
unit okay without getting technical let
me<00:02:44.120> just<00:02:44.269> show<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.450> what<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.660> sounds<00:02:44.750> like<00:02:45.110> I'm

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
me just show you what it sounds like I'm

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.560 
me just show you what it sounds like I'm
going<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.440> bring<00:02:45.829> up<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:47.060> room<00:02:47.269> size<00:02:47.540> a

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
going to bring up the room size a

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.039 
going to bring up the room size a
hundred<00:02:48.200> percent<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:50.150> pre<00:02:50.329> delay<00:02:50.540> 100%

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
hundred percent and the pre delay 100%

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.180 
hundred percent and the pre delay 100%
just<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:51.230> we<00:02:51.320> can<00:02:51.410> hear<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.680> I'm<00:02:51.799> going<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:51.980> dial

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
just so we can hear it I'm going to dial

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.690 
just so we can hear it I'm going to dial
it<00:02:52.370> back

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.940 

it's<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.940> delay<00:02:59.420> copy<00:02:59.930> that's<00:03:00.260> getting<00:03:00.680> sent

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
it's the delay copy that's getting sent

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.150 
it's the delay copy that's getting sent
to<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.160> reverb<00:03:01.580> alright<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:02.690> let<00:03:02.900> me<00:03:03.050> dial<00:03:03.380> the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
to the reverb alright so let me dial the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:13.059 
to the reverb alright so let me dial the
pre<00:03:04.370> delay<00:03:04.580> back<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:10.720> now<00:03:11.720> let<00:03:12.440> me<00:03:12.470> turn<00:03:12.770> the

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
pre delay back and now let me turn the

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:32.680 
pre delay back and now let me turn the
room<00:03:13.280> size<00:03:13.520> down<00:03:31.239> do<00:03:32.239> you<00:03:32.330> kind<00:03:32.450> of<00:03:32.570> hear

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
room size down do you kind of hear

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.150 
room size down do you kind of hear
what's<00:03:32.870> happening<00:03:32.959> we're<00:03:33.470> losing<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:33.980> lot<00:03:34.130> of

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
what's happening we're losing a lot of

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.540 
what's happening we're losing a lot of
the<00:03:34.370> decay<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:35.180> long<00:03:35.510> drawn-out<00:03:36.200> space<00:03:37.070> but

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
the decay the long drawn-out space but

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.210 
the decay the long drawn-out space but
we're<00:03:37.700> still<00:03:38.090> getting<00:03:38.600> because<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:38.989> this<00:03:39.410> pre

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
we're still getting because of this pre

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.190 
we're still getting because of this pre
delay<00:03:40.580> it<00:03:40.819> gives<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.300> ear<00:03:41.540> or<00:03:41.720> trick<00:03:42.019> of

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
delay it gives the ear or trick of

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.920 
delay it gives the ear or trick of
hearing<00:03:42.709> it<00:03:43.310> resonate<00:03:44.090> for<00:03:44.269> a<00:03:44.300> second<00:03:44.720> without

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
hearing it resonate for a second without

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.720 
hearing it resonate for a second without
the<00:03:45.110> long<00:03:45.319> drawn-out<00:03:45.620> delay<00:03:46.040> listen<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.640> it

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
the long drawn-out delay listen to it

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:59.979 
the long drawn-out delay listen to it
again<00:03:52.030> we'll<00:03:53.030> bypass<00:03:58.209> so<00:03:59.209> no<00:03:59.450> sense<00:03:59.660> of<00:03:59.840> space

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
again we'll bypass so no sense of space

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:08.530 
again we'll bypass so no sense of space
no<00:04:00.410> reverb<00:04:00.650> use<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.579> pre<00:04:01.790> delay<00:04:07.420> sounds<00:04:08.420> like

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
no reverb use the pre delay sounds like

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.180 
no reverb use the pre delay sounds like
it's<00:04:08.720> in<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:08.870> nice<00:04:09.079> room<00:04:09.410> right<00:04:09.739> without<00:04:10.040> it

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
it's in a nice room right without it

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.069 
it's in a nice room right without it
sounding<00:04:10.340> like<00:04:10.610> a<00:04:10.640> fake<00:04:11.000> reverb<00:04:11.690> which<00:04:11.840> we<00:04:11.959> had

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
sounding like a fake reverb which we had

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:21.789 
sounding like a fake reverb which we had
before<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:19.239> find<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.450> using<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:21.109> healthy<00:04:21.590> dose

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
before I find that using a healthy dose

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.770 
before I find that using a healthy dose
of<00:04:22.039> pre<00:04:22.310> delay<00:04:22.640> mixed<00:04:23.090> in<00:04:23.210> with<00:04:23.330> a<00:04:23.390> smaller

of pre delay mixed in with a smaller
room<00:04:24.080> size<00:04:24.440> can<00:04:25.250> get<00:04:25.580> you<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:26.000> space<00:04:26.479> that

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
room size can get you the space that

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.240 
room size can get you the space that
your<00:04:26.990> ear<00:04:27.260> wants<00:04:27.560> to<00:04:27.680> hear<00:04:27.830> with<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.010> snare

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
your ear wants to hear with the snare

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.820 
your ear wants to hear with the snare
drum<00:04:28.490> every<00:04:28.820> time<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:29.150> gets<00:04:29.270> cracked<00:04:29.830> without

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
creating a wash of decaying sound that

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.570 
creating a wash of decaying sound that
gets<00:04:35.650> muddled<00:04:36.650> into<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:36.950> rest<00:04:37.130> of<00:04:37.220> your<00:04:37.280> mix

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
gets muddled into the rest of your mix

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.430

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
don't neglect pre delay as a way to

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.430 
don't neglect pre delay as a way to
create<00:04:49.550> that<00:04:50.030> sense<00:04:50.210> of<00:04:50.390> space<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:50.930> a<00:04:50.990> short
