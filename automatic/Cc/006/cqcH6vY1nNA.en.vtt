00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.480
 the initiative to have done the clinic 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.770
 comes in fact against a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.260
 need for some people to 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.869
 information on this type of 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.390
 run had no way to find I 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.500
 is a means of trying to help these 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.470
 people who goes through a process 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.669
 understanding of why you should 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.940
 run because you should avoid 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.890
 heel to start pizarro you 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.300
 start treading where it is related 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.850
 with a series of lesions 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.300
 most of the injuries in the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.579
 many of them have some relationship with you 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.059
 he if despite accompanying the heel does not 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.800
 is a is something that was made for 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.289
 absorb the impact 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.989
 so you see well it's nobody's pula 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.550
 rope using the heel or with 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.100
 articulation this face in the second 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.199
 checked you jump from a wall you 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.820
 will bend your knee you will not stay 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.909
 was stretched and left with the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.860
 heel absorb all the impact are you 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.500
 can not jump rope being of that ladder 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.420
 your heel then it is not natural that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.590
 our body look for the heel to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.590
 to resolve any kind of impact 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.530
 is rest has the will of what 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.149
 We change feedback is you have the 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.070
 feedback has an answer 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.170
 Instant your body than you are 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.970
 doing right or wrong then it helps 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.580
 much in adjusting your correct posture 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.649
 with him the minimalist he is good at 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.590
 protect your foot 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.939
 I think a legal protection is you 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.250
 But I think that the rest is good for 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.869
 you always look at him you must occur 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.369
 in this way you speak curious minimal 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.619
 this as an option for the day that you 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.369
 do not want to run the hot asphalt is a 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.020
 very negative actor occurred at the end of 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.630
 three in the afternoon it can not 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.539
 run neither sidewalk nor asphalt in yes I 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.850
 I think running barefoot or better yet 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.679
 or I run barefoot time everyone 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.509
 I was also not thinkable and neither did I 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.920
 I think people will decide to pick up 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.730
 without play you can run I started to run 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.530
 barefoot around 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.030
 I think rest is important for 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.010
 people reconnect with the way 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.590
 correct way of running and trying to 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.000
 that they had to be aware of them in 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.760
 what they did when they were children 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.280
 How do you play hide and seek? 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.280
 the child is a natural way of running 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.439
 the note
