down a so I think a is the brake so here
you<00:01:13.070> see<00:01:13.100> how<00:01:13.429> helpful<00:01:13.850> this<00:01:14.060> is<00:01:14.119> we're<00:01:14.390> going

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.539 
you see how helpful this is we're going
forward<00:01:14.780> we're<00:01:14.869> going<00:01:14.990> forward<00:01:15.229> I<00:01:15.259> press<00:01:15.469> a<00:01:15.619> No

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.910 
forward we're going forward I press a No
okay<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:17.329> doesn't<00:01:17.539> work<00:01:17.749> now<00:01:17.929> apparently<00:01:18.859> a

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
okay that doesn't work now apparently a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.639 
okay that doesn't work now apparently a
it<00:01:19.880> like<00:01:20.090> stops<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.659> bus<00:01:20.810> from<00:01:21.049> going<00:01:21.380> but<00:01:21.560> if

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
it like stops the bus from going but if

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.620 
it like stops the bus from going but if
you<00:01:21.770> press<00:01:22.009> a<00:01:22.219> while<00:01:22.579> going<00:01:23.060> it<00:01:23.149> doesn't<00:01:23.450> stop

you press a while going it doesn't stop
the<00:01:23.749> bus<00:01:23.929> so<00:01:24.649> I'm<00:01:25.039> thinking<00:01:25.609> a<00:01:25.729> is<00:01:25.789> probably

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.209 
the bus so I'm thinking a is probably
more<00:01:26.329> like<00:01:26.509> a<00:01:26.539> horn<00:01:26.929> that<00:01:27.259> also<00:01:27.590> prevents<00:01:28.069> your

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
more like a horn that also prevents your

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.029 
more like a horn that also prevents your
bus<00:01:28.460> from<00:01:28.729> starting<00:01:29.210> um<00:01:29.590> if<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:30.740> looked<00:01:30.950> at

bus from starting um if you looked at

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.489 
bus from starting um if you looked at
the<00:01:31.130> bottom<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.729> says<00:01:31.759> positio<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:32.689> X<00:01:32.869> actual

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
the bottom it says positio and X actual

let's<00:01:58.369> just<00:01:58.639> hold<00:01:59.090> down<00:01:59.359> the<00:01:59.659> button<00:01:59.810> I'm

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
let's just hold down the button I'm

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.449 
let's just hold down the button I'm
going<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.469> speed<00:02:00.679> this<00:02:00.799> up<00:02:00.979> we're<00:02:01.219> not<00:02:01.249> going

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
going to speed this up we're not going

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.999 
going to speed this up we're not going
to<00:02:01.549> go<00:02:02.299> forward<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:02.899> entire<00:02:03.229> time<00:02:03.560> I'm<00:02:03.829> going

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
to go forward the entire time I'm going

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.099 
to go forward the entire time I'm going
to<00:02:04.069> speed<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:04.490> footage<00:02:04.850> up<00:02:05.029> and<00:02:05.209> see<00:02:05.659> how<00:02:05.840> far

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
to speed this footage up and see how far

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:07.959 
to speed this footage up and see how far
we<00:02:06.170> can<00:02:06.439> go<00:02:06.560> before<00:02:06.770> we<00:02:07.100> reach<00:02:07.130> something<00:02:07.639> okay

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
we can go before we reach something okay

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.520 
we can go before we reach something okay
starting<00:02:08.750> now

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
starting now

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.699 
starting now

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
hamster wheel makes perfect sense I mean

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.740 
hamster wheel makes perfect sense I mean
it<00:03:01.579> makes<00:03:01.700> more<00:03:01.909> sense<00:03:02.209> than<00:03:02.299> what<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.599> game

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
it makes more sense than what the game

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.009 
it makes more sense than what the game
actually<00:03:02.959> is<00:03:03.379> just<00:03:04.370> holding<00:03:05.120> down<00:03:05.359> right

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
actually is just holding down right

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.770 
actually is just holding down right
as<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:06.650> bus<00:03:07.150> repeatedly<00:03:08.150> goes<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.540> right

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
as the bus repeatedly goes to the right

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.539 
as the bus repeatedly goes to the right
sand<00:03:09.139> comes<00:03:09.409> out<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.769> left<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.219> this

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
sand comes out of the left and this

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.009 
sand comes out of the left and this
continues<00:03:11.450> indefinitely<00:03:12.139> for<00:03:12.829> all<00:03:13.040> time

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.520 
feet is the furthest we can go on a
school<00:03:43.250> bus<00:03:43.459> I<00:03:43.790> assume<00:03:44.120> but<00:03:44.569> then<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:45.019> starts

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
school bus I assume but then it starts

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.129 
school bus I assume but then it starts
over<00:03:45.680> again<00:03:45.859> so<00:03:46.189> I'm<00:03:46.310> thinking<00:03:46.729> if<00:03:47.689> we<00:03:47.930> keep

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
over again so I'm thinking if we keep

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.530 
over again so I'm thinking if we keep
going<00:03:48.349> right<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:49.280> after<00:03:49.519> we<00:03:49.790> get<00:03:49.939> to<00:03:50.000> sixty

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
going right and after we get to sixty

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.899 
going right and after we get to sixty
five<00:03:50.750> thousand<00:03:51.229> five<00:03:51.409> hundred<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:52.609> the

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
five thousand five hundred the the

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.960 
five thousand five hundred the the
counter<00:03:53.299> is<00:03:53.389> just<00:03:53.569> going<00:03:53.689> to<00:03:53.750> restart<00:03:54.229> so<00:03:54.970> I

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
counter is just going to restart so I

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.179 
counter is just going to restart so I
guess<00:03:56.389> maybe<00:03:56.659> the<00:03:56.870> point<00:03:57.109> of<00:03:57.259> the<00:03:57.349> game<00:03:57.500> is<00:03:57.739> to

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
guess maybe the point of the game is to

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.159 
guess maybe the point of the game is to
get<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.549> sixty<00:03:59.000> five<00:03:59.209> thousand<00:03:59.720> five<00:03:59.959> hundred

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
get to sixty five thousand five hundred

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.039 
get to sixty five thousand five hundred
feet<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.949> then<00:04:01.669> you<00:04:01.790> just<00:04:02.000> claim<00:04:02.299> that<00:04:02.569> you

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
feet and then you just claim that you

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.659 
feet and then you just claim that you
won<00:04:03.229> the<00:04:03.409> game<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.949> then<00:04:04.069> the<00:04:04.189> game<00:04:04.340> starts

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
won the game and then the game starts

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.030 
won the game and then the game starts
all<00:04:04.790> over<00:04:04.819> and<00:04:05.269> I<00:04:05.479> think<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:06.019> don't<00:04:06.079> know<00:04:06.290> what

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
all over and I think I don't know what

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.009 
all over and I think I don't know what
if<00:04:07.099> we<00:04:07.159> go<00:04:07.280> backwards<00:04:07.759> you<00:04:08.509> notice<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.870> bus

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
if we go backwards you notice the bus

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.710 
if we go backwards you notice the bus
goes<00:04:09.290> forward<00:04:09.829> at<00:04:10.129> the<00:04:10.370> same<00:04:10.549> speed<00:04:10.939> as<00:04:11.180> it

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
goes forward at the same speed as it

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.570 
goes forward at the same speed as it
does<00:04:11.989> backwards

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
does backwards

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.870 
does backwards
same<00:04:14.300> exact<00:04:14.660> speed<00:04:14.900> I<00:04:15.400> don't<00:04:16.400> even<00:04:16.489> know<00:04:16.670> why

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
same exact speed I don't even know why

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.840 
same exact speed I don't even know why
