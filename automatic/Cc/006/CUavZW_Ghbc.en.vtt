00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.240
 the largest Zurich Airport 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.830
 swiss airport is a plaque 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.700
 essential turning point in the traffic 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.160
 European air 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.570
 every year some 25 million 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.570
 passengers borrow this airport 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.610
 the terminal 2 has just been 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.080
 major modernization works 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.090
 today it is on average 5000 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.410
 luggage that will be delivered daily 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.710
 with 52 new branches 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.710
 Registration 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.230
 in the baggage logistics system 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.840
 of the terminal 2 the light barriers 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.390
 smart reflexes and detectors next 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.399
 botmeur gen contributes greatly to 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.170
 guarantee the reliability of the transport of 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.170
 luggage up to sorting out 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.089
 you 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.610
 the new smart light barriers 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.680
 reflex without reflectors solves the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.030
 problem of the luggage stickers that 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.530
 were often stuck on the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.930
 reflector of the light barrier 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.340
 used before which gave rise 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.340
 to switching errors 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.719
 when bags and suitcases 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.850
 disappear from the field of vision of 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.189
 passengers the next gen sensors 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.619
 take over and ensure the seizure 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.179
 luggage on the few 2 km that the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.630
 course through the catacombs of 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.630
 airport 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.780
 the new performance class in 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.830
 detector technology 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.360
 optoelectronics ensures a 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.650
 permanent operation and without 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.050
 disturbance of the installation 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.060
 the high signal reserves of the 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.890
 detectors increases the security of 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.800
 operation of the entire system 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.840
 in addition the next gen detectors get 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.860
 distinguished by faster assembly and 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.000
 great planning flexibility 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.800
 here is another ambitious project 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.900
 perfectly carried out during which 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.470
 Bomer has proven his qualities of 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.470
 trusted partners 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.700
 a sensor technology at the tip of the 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.050
 progress guarantee that your luggage 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.050
 will travel with you 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.540
 Bomer wishes his customers 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.540
 pleasant and relaxing holiday 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.750
