it<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:43.890> quite<00:00:44.160> rough<00:00:44.690> but<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.840> is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
it it's quite rough but this is

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.690 
it it's quite rough but this is
obviously<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> wrong<00:00:46.770> colour<00:00:47.070> book<00:00:47.280> because

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
obviously the wrong colour book because

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
nearly the same colour and that is much

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.260 
nearly the same colour and that is much
much<00:00:54.059> darker<00:00:54.390> you'll<00:00:55.199> also<00:00:55.379> find<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.789> sneaky

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
much darker you'll also find the sneaky

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.330 
much darker you'll also find the sneaky
people<00:00:57.690> will<00:00:57.930> try<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.559> cut<00:00:58.859> them<00:00:59.010> out<00:00:59.160> of

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
people will try and cut them out of

flop<00:01:10.470> around<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:11.909> not<00:01:12.330> right<00:01:12.540> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
flop around and it's just not right and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.109 
flop around and it's just not right and
it's<00:01:13.049> also<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.770> right<00:01:14.040> color<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.970> we

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
it's also not the right color but we

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.230 
it's also not the right color but we
have<00:01:15.330> seen<00:01:15.630> ones<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.500> been<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:16.950> this

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
have seen ones that have been like this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
also things like the weapon this little

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.710 
also things like the weapon this little
fellow<00:01:25.680> was<00:01:25.890> packaged<00:01:26.340> up<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.240> weapon

that<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.259> wrong<00:01:28.439> colour<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:29.340> should<00:01:29.640> have

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that is the wrong colour it should have

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.230 
that is the wrong colour it should have
been<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> very<00:01:30.299> dark<00:01:30.869> almost<00:01:31.140> black<00:01:31.560> plastic

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
been a very dark almost black plastic

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.240 
been a very dark almost black plastic
plus<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.630> reproduction<00:01:34.350> weapons<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.070> made

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
plus the reproduction weapons and made

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.090 
plus the reproduction weapons and made
out<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.700> plastic<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.450> much<00:01:36.900> different

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
out of a plastic that is much different

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.090 
out of a plastic that is much different
to<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.610> earlier<00:01:38.909> plastics<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.009> people<00:01:41.009> have

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
to the earlier plastics and people have

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.410 
to the earlier plastics and people have
said<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> me<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.090> tell<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
said to me that you can tell the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.810 
said to me that you can tell the
difference<00:01:42.810> by<00:01:43.049> floating<00:01:43.439> them<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.979> water<00:01:44.280> one

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
difference by floating them in water one

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.480 
difference by floating them in water one
will<00:01:45.030> sink<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.630> one<00:01:45.780> will<00:01:46.020> float<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:47.100> isn't

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
will sink and one will float this isn't

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.270 
will sink and one will float this isn't
conclusive<00:01:47.899> but<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> best<00:01:49.680> way<00:01:49.950> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
conclusive but I think the best way to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.060 
conclusive but I think the best way to
tell<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.970> actually<00:01:51.869> when<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.259> drop<00:01:52.590> them<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.040> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
tell is actually when you drop them on a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
tell is actually when you drop them on a
hard<00:01:53.369> surface

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
hard surface

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.499 
hard surface
an<00:01:54.829> original<00:01:55.829> weapon<00:01:56.490> will<00:01:56.729> hardly<00:01:57.060> make<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
an original weapon will hardly make a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.649 
an original weapon will hardly make a
noise<00:01:57.680> whereas<00:01:58.680> modern<00:01:59.159> plastics<00:01:59.850> there<00:02:00.509> have

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
noise whereas modern plastics there have

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.330 
noise whereas modern plastics there have
different<00:02:00.990> properties<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.770> when<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.009> drop

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
different properties and when you drop
