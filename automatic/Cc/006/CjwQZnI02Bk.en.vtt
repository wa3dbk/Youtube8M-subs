00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
a nice triple feed here in search to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.240 
a nice triple feed here in search to
start<00:00:39.390> off<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.570> game<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:40.620> focus<00:00:41.070> is

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
start off the game but focus is

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.290 
start off the game but focus is
something<00:00:41.640> that's<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:41.850> something<00:00:42.090> that

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
something that's just something that

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.910 
something that's just something that
people<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.719> not<00:00:42.870> use<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.320> much<00:00:43.500> room<00:00:43.649> over

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920

people do not use that much room over
three<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.129> i<00:00:44.219> think<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.489> actually<00:00:44.610> really

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
three and i think it's actually really

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.700 
three and i think it's actually really
beneficial<00:00:45.149> especially<00:00:45.690> for<00:00:46.050> using<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.530> say

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
beneficial especially for using like say

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.860 
beneficial especially for using like say
an<00:00:46.829> mk14<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:47.640> semi-automatic<00:00:48.360> gun<00:00:48.480> or

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
an mk14 like semi-automatic gun or

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.360 
an mk14 like semi-automatic gun or
possibly<00:00:49.230> three<00:00:49.289> round<00:00:49.680> burst<00:00:49.890> weapon<00:00:50.250> like

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
possibly three round burst weapon like

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.850 
possibly three round burst weapon like
the<00:00:50.489> m16<00:00:50.879> or<00:00:50.910> type<00:00:51.120> 95<00:00:51.300> what<00:00:51.960> focus<00:00:52.350> does<00:00:52.590> is

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the m16 or type 95 what focus does is

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.799 
the m16 or type 95 what focus does is
when<00:00:53.280> you're<00:00:53.430> getting<00:00:53.489> shot<00:00:53.640> at<00:00:54.090> your<00:00:54.570> gun

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
when you're getting shot at your gun

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.510 
when you're getting shot at your gun
flinches<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.620> shoots<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.039> straight<00:00:56.309> up<00:00:56.340> in

flinches and shoots like straight up in
the<00:00:56.550> air<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.000> kind<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.180> hard<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> stay<00:00:57.510> on

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the air and it's kind of hard to stay on

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.790 
the air and it's kind of hard to stay on
target<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.379> focused<00:00:58.559> that

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800

doesn't happen as much and it can cause

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.709 
doesn't happen as much and it can cause

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you know head the head and you might be

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.679 
you know head the head and you might be
Bjelica<00:01:08.520> out<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:08.909> top<00:01:09.090> depends<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.510> how<00:01:09.630> you

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
can shoot better so i'm taking around

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.609 
can shoot better so i'm taking around
proficiencies<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:12.689> I've<00:01:12.900> found<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.200> impact

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
proficiencies but I've found that impact

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.050 
proficiencies but I've found that impact
on<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> m16<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.310> pretty<00:01:14.549> great<00:01:14.760> especially

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
on the m16 is pretty great especially

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.340 
on the m16 is pretty great especially
for<00:01:15.240> search<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.020> ball<00:01:16.170> bang

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350

people and you shoot through balls and

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.499 
people and you shoot through balls and
you<00:01:18.210> know<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:19.140> know<00:01:19.229> more<00:01:19.680> penetrable

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
you know you know more penetrable

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.340 
you know you know more penetrable
materials<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.659> things<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.140> it's

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
materials and things like that so it's

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.380 
materials and things like that so it's
pretty<00:01:22.470> good<00:01:22.680> let's<00:01:23.159> talk<00:01:23.340> about<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.640> m16<00:01:23.970> so

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
pretty good let's talk about this m16 so
