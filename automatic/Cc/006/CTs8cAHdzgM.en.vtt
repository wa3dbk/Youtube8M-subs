00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello with you again anton with and today 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.500
 would like to talk about some things 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.899
 which occurred 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.719
 as you see i have a bunch of players 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.210
 300 with something players and as you can see 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.759
 some were about granite and 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.039
 80 or the only player that I have 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.160
 there was a crash in the club this is kevin de bruine 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.570
 although I think that Santi Cazorla 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.140
 jefferson diana khala too 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.849
 be upgrades but so here's what yesterday 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.250
 happened called day upgrades 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.619
 Today I want to show you the most 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.020
 fifa loyal players ultimate team 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.820
 15 i'm sure you still know 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.469
 because the type has already released all these 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.739
 lists but I'll show you where to find 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.180
 more detailed information about them well 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.219
 so here we are on this site 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.600
 which is called fucked dot com 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.489
 and here you can see all the rites 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.260
 which we have here as you see 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.719
 the best cards that was 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.820
 deceived it was the world how you see it 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.590
 stats have even become slightly better 93 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.609
 dribbling eighty two hits 73 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.609
 posting and 59 physics and his card with 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.680
 readdik 89 generally became the divine self 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.880
 Of course not not played but I'm sure that she 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.369
 just become divine 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.010
 as you can see, the second player was aguero and 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.810
 He, too, like was the super teen 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.610
 the player and his uniform will just be 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.570
 great for me the biggest 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.759
 what a surprise it got 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.950
 upgrade because you know i'm not sure 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.320
 what was supposed to get upgrade 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.000
 with all the players of Dortmund Borussia 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.630
 because dortmund borussia is now 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.939
 you know yourself on the 17th place so I don 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.549
 I am sure that when he should 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.530
 get know what else i'm glad what 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.780
 kevin de breine got this great 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.500
 Now look Galina his card in 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.950
 on average 85 she has 81 paces 87 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.130
 dribbling 877 strikes 88 passing to 74 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.979
 physics and 48 defense it's just 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.020
 great card for both kama and 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.080
 as you can see pop would also improve 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.610
 Now 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.080
 if for example look at the second 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.880
 inform us fields pop will be that damn it them 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.310
 the shape is just gorgeous though not 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.979
 I understand why they did so pace 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.480
 improved but children did not get 78 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:16.270
 I don’t understand this 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.490
 forms which for example also have 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.460
 upgrade left only 2 silver them 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.820
 the forms that got this upgrade damn 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.010
 and 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.350
 the biggest surprise is that everyone put 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.760
 crowded on kira who will be open 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.130
 somewhere to 72 74 but as it turned out on 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.130
 building years and code and codes 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.100
 although in my yes in my so give 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.140
 called koja got their reforms and 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.020
 they are now upgrades which is not bad either 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.350
 for example, because there will be no such super 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.520
 heaps of silver inform and know for me 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.640
 the most deserved 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.610
 not inform and is considered a player under 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.250
 title hurricane yes because you know 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.620
 hurricane is just a lot now 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.810
 sits and here is his card which is just 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.420
 improved and now she will be even more 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.500
 more nice because look 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.330
 he had 7159 oldest 9 having hit 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.430
 from posting it all improved as 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.170
 at least 10 times and now this card 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.600
 just divine as well as his 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.700
 game today for example 2 more cards 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.110
 which too were considered magnificent 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.590
 as for us it is considered 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.450
 Anders Anatolian card know he 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.380
 plays him very well 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.330
 liverpool and so i'm sure that 12/12 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.150
 on his blow them too will be very very 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.010
 not bad damn a lot of any players 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.380
 got about hryvnia but of the most famous 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.930
 players this from her to berlin which 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.090
 just shot everyone and everything and the most 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.550
 interesting upgrade son today 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.890
 this is this dude called dock 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.140
 he used to be one of the worst 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.510
 left behind midfielders on this or 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.920
 yielding certainly only are we now 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.019
 as you see his card has become 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.690
 silver and it's just gorgeous 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.860
 upgrade since the best upgrade from 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.410
 fifa 14 fifa 15 it was 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.260
 I think upgrades he and sisto and he 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:10.310
 the upgrade was 21 and then the upgrade to 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.710
 as many as 25 this is simply breathtakingly this 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.540
 just breathtakingly for example see 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.180
 such an upgrade so I don’t 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.910
 disappointed eminem but my opinion on it 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.769
 what for example i thought some 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.950
 players who are not here, too, could be 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.980
 apgreyzhu such well Arkadiusz Milik I 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.290
 I think it deserved and still know how 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.420
 no i would like to see about 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.360
 sinful santi cazorla because signs 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.700
 looking at his stats for example santi 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.080
 cazorla he is pretty good 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.480
 acts as for central 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.370
 midfielder staff some people 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.470
 They say that he is the second player after 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.320
 alexis sanchez and if alexis 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.169
 Sanchez got a nice upgrade from her 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.320
 and Santi Cazorla on my must also well 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.690
 still i had still jefferson yes you don't 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.240
 say that all the time I hear it to 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.040
 my informal club but really 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.050
 thought jeff and sleigh did not hear about 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.660
 I have never heard such players before 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.490
 to be such an awesome player he is not 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.370
 caught as information completely by accident 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.530
 but then I thought Jason must 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.020
 get an upgrade he just scored a goal 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.300
 gave 5se becoming like a left-back this 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.400
 unbelievable if he died down then he 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.430
 would be cheap David alaby i 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.510
 sure and taiga well and find out the last 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.470
 what can i think of it for example upgrade 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.350
 and Diana and Khala 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.060
 because yourself if any of you know 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.000
 this is the man who plays for vogue 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.770
 and this is another different information so i 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.850
 I want to tell you why I think his 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.300
 could upgrade 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.280
 because he damn for the last 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.700
 several boy his form was like that 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.890
 same 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.520
 awesome like bass to sleep he 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:52.430
 scored 12 goals in my last 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.560
 I think I don't remember 6 or 7 matches 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.419
 but 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.430
 he just has great form right now 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.710
 and if they were about gray at him at least 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.770
 four then that would be great 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.050
 well that was an opinion about 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.300
 Upgrades I believe that uninstall upgrades 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.550
 on some, it was also possible to upgrade 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.680
 I do not know yet whether to upgrade and 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.440
 because they say that maybe in here 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.389
 this second wave of upgrades and so we 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.430
 can see a few more inform 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.110
 so no need to rush with you us and 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.770
 ns that was my opinion about 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.389
 upgrades 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.490
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:28.889
 subscribe put likes and remember 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.889
