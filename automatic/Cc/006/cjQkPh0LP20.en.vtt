00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.859
 when that hunger strikes and they 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.560
 Make a quick but tasty treat. 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.800
 If this will hit you and I 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.510
 I bring a perfect recipe for that day 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.600
 today I will teach you to do the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.090
 pasta with sausage is super cool 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.489
 The pasta at the beginning of class is 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.950
 moving in child in each small 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.860
 You're going to love this idea because I 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.629
 I'm sure they will if and if 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.640
 have fun with this dish 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.800
 You'll see if they want to learn the easy way. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.410
 easy just keep watching the video 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.960
 Come on, I'll start cutting faust. 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.039
 I'll cut more or less with a finger 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:08.070
 width 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:16.470
 So let's get out of here. I could not. 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:19.290
 do that profit now and I will break 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.170
 do not mean it 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.080
 you can break into two parts or 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.990
 three I'm going to break only two because I 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.490
 I think it 's prettier and now the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.290
 People are going to start putting the pasta 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.380
 inside the sausage 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.490
 We'll put 10 dark brown to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.820
 People just have to respect the pasta. 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.820
 with sausage 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:08.350
 Now I'm going to put some oil in the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:10.200
 hot water that is already boiling and salt 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.860
 taste 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:23.920
 I'm going to put our sausages 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:27.850
 just put in the water very carefully to 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.610
 do not get hurt in them and in that if you 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.970
 are asking for help for their 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.970
 countries 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.440
 with the sausages 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.780
 I'll take a look, you can do the 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.280
 sauce the way you want August 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.990
 but add and I like it a lot 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:02.340
 very good 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:04.770
 hunger is beating to be cute 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:18.300

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:23.600
