a castle for whatever reason but the
most<00:00:31.500> telling<00:00:31.710> moment<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> film<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
most telling moment that the film was a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.120 
most telling moment that the film was a
reinterpretation<00:00:33.710> rather<00:00:34.710> than<00:00:35.010> an

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
reinterpretation rather than an

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.979 
reinterpretation rather than an

rather cartoonish betrayal of the

rather cartoonish betrayal of the
Frankenstein<00:00:49.289> character<00:00:49.649> almost<00:00:50.219> like<00:00:50.340> a

parody of Victor although I may just be
