00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.919 
won't cover things like the characters
and<00:00:12.179> stages<00:00:12.599> as<00:00:13.049> those<00:00:13.500> are<00:00:13.679> just<00:00:13.799> Givens

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
battle damage start without a Scouter

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.939 
battle damage start without a Scouter
and<00:00:23.279> many<00:00:23.789> different<00:00:24.240> auras<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.350> why<00:00:25.740> isn't

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
and many different auras so why isn't

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.650 
and many different auras so why isn't
there<00:00:26.250> an<00:00:26.369> item<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.760> start<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.300> battle

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
there an item to start with battle

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.960 
there an item to start with battle
damage<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.680> would<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.099> complete<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.789> list

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
damage this would just complete the list

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.420 
damage this would just complete the list
of<00:00:30.240> cosmetic<00:00:30.960> items<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.470> add<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.949> game<00:00:32.160> on

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
of cosmetic items to add to the game on

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.729 
of cosmetic items to add to the game on
top<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.480> there<00:00:33.780> should<00:00:33.989> be<00:00:34.110> two<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.530> them

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
top of that there should be two of them

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.680 
top of that there should be two of them
one<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:35.250> light<00:00:35.640> damage<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.300> other<00:00:36.420> for

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
one for light damage and the other for

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.630 
one for light damage and the other for
heavy<00:00:36.870> damage<00:00:37.320> there<00:00:37.890> are<00:00:38.040> two<00:00:38.190> different

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
heavy damage there are two different

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.670 
heavy damage there are two different
levels<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.690> should<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.110> option<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
levels so we should have the option to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.030 
levels so we should have the option to
have<00:00:41.129> both<00:00:41.460> from<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> start<00:00:42.739> this<00:00:43.739> doesn't

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
have both from the start this doesn't

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.190 
have both from the start this doesn't
affect<00:00:44.430> stats<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.030> any<00:00:45.180> way<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.780> there<00:00:46.079> really

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
affect stats in any way so there really

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.790 
affect stats in any way so there really
is<00:00:46.440> no<00:00:46.620> point<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:47.190> having<00:00:47.610> them<00:00:48.680> speaking<00:00:49.680> of

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
is no point not having them speaking of

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.770 
is no point not having them speaking of
items<00:00:50.160> another<00:00:50.670> thing<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.120> would<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.600> see

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
items another thing I would like to see

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
equipped I know this sounds weird but

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.130

items<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.829> online<00:00:59.250> making<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.820> whole<00:01:00.030> bunch<00:01:00.270> of

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
items for online making a whole bunch of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.229 
items for online making a whole bunch of
godly<00:01:00.899> items<00:01:01.199> would<00:01:01.469> screw<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.190> up<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:03.120> if

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
godly items would screw that up but if

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.700 
godly items would screw that up but if
you<00:01:03.270> made<00:01:03.600> items<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.170> simply<00:01:04.530> make

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
you made items that simply make

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.710 
you made items that simply make
characters<00:01:05.040> weaker<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:06.150> could<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.420> much

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
characters weaker you could have much

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.539 
characters weaker you could have much
more<00:01:06.960> control<00:01:07.140> over<00:01:07.470> how<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.950> set<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:08.520> your

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
more control over how you set up your

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.640 
more control over how you set up your
custom<00:01:09.180> characters<00:01:09.630> without<00:01:09.869> screwing<00:01:10.439> over

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
custom characters without screwing over

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.390 
custom characters without screwing over
online<00:01:12.110> another<00:01:13.110> thing<00:01:13.380> about<00:01:13.530> setups<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
online another thing about setups is the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.190 
online another thing about setups is the
option<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.790> simply<00:01:15.270> change<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.810> ultimate

like you can supers this would be much

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.320 
like you can supers this would be much
simpler<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.530> easier<00:01:19.710> than<00:01:20.159> having<00:01:20.189> set<00:01:20.909> items

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330

it<00:01:56.460> sucks<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.180> needs<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.750> fixed<00:01:58.140> as<00:01:58.610> for<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
it sucks it needs to be fixed as for the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.690 
it sucks it needs to be fixed as for the
camera<00:02:00.119> fairly<00:02:00.899> easy<00:02:01.079> fix<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:01.710> zoom<00:02:02.490> out<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
camera fairly easy fix just zoom out a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.789 
camera fairly easy fix just zoom out a
little<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.570> simple<00:02:04.049> change<00:02:04.350> would<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.619> an

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
little that simple change would be an

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.550 
little that simple change would be an
improvement<00:02:05.149> but<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.630> no<00:02:06.840> one<00:02:06.869> says<00:02:07.320> I'm

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
improvement but just so no one says I'm

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.680 
improvement but just so no one says I'm
contradicting<00:02:08.069> myself<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.940> still<00:02:09.390> don't<00:02:09.629> see

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
contradicting myself I still don't see

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.979 
contradicting myself I still don't see
the<00:02:09.959> camera<00:02:10.229> as<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> big<00:02:10.950> problem<00:02:11.690> that<00:02:12.690> pretty

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
the camera as a big problem that pretty

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.730 
the camera as a big problem that pretty
much<00:02:13.200> sums<00:02:13.440> up

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
much sums up

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.290 
much sums up
my<00:02:13.830> list<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.250> things<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.700> would<00:02:14.820> like<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.000> see

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
my list of things I would like to see

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.210 
my list of things I would like to see
change<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.900> most<00:02:16.110> apart<00:02:16.890> from<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.190> obvious

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
change the most apart from the obvious

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.460 
change the most apart from the obvious
things<00:02:17.850> like<00:02:18.030> more<00:02:18.540> mini<00:02:18.780> games<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.320> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
things like more mini games so the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.080 
things like more mini games so the
punching<00:02:19.890> machine<00:02:20.190> doesn't<00:02:20.460> feel<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:20.910> out<00:02:21.060> of

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
punching machine doesn't feel so out of

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.840 
punching machine doesn't feel so out of
place<00:02:21.530> also<00:02:22.530> since<00:02:22.830> there<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.220> only<00:02:23.340> one

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
place also since there is only one

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.000 
place also since there is only one
little<00:02:24.240> skin<00:02:24.570> with<00:02:24.780> like<00:02:24.930> for<00:02:25.320> screenshots

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
little skin with like for screenshots

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.520 
little skin with like for screenshots
known<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.760> really<00:02:27.450> can't<00:02:27.720> comment<00:02:27.990> on<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.350> game

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
known I really can't comment on the game

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.560 
known I really can't comment on the game
itself<00:02:28.860> right<00:02:29.100> now<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.790> will<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:30.240> simply

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570
