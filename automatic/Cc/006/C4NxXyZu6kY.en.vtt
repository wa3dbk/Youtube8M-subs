after the bass if you're in a lake full
of<00:01:57.609> shadows<00:01:57.849> I'll<00:01:58.119> just<00:01:58.270> hammer<00:01:58.689> on<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.049> but

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
of shadows I'll just hammer on that but

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.589 
of shadows I'll just hammer on that but
even<00:02:00.009> if<00:02:00.219> you're<00:02:00.369> not<00:02:00.520> it's<00:02:00.819> a<00:02:00.880> great<00:02:01.209> bait<00:02:01.450> to

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
even if you're not it's a great bait to

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:03.479 
even if you're not it's a great bait to
fish<00:02:01.779> in<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.139> around<00:02:02.289> that<00:02:02.529> grass<00:02:02.770> draw<00:02:03.279> that

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:03.489 
fish in and around that grass draw that

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:07.679 
fish in and around that grass draw that
reaction<00:02:03.849> by<00:02:04.299> e<00:02:05.159> next<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:07.270> going<00:02:07.419> to<00:02:07.479> be<00:02:07.569> the

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
reaction by e next it's going to be the

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:08.940 
reaction by e next it's going to be the
fluke<00:02:07.959> that's<00:02:08.259> probably<00:02:08.619> your<00:02:08.739> best

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950
