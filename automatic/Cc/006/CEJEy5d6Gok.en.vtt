00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
thing about it is miami city is so much

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.540 
thing about it is miami city is so much
more<00:00:46.339> better<00:00:46.909> than<00:00:47.030> rico<00:00:47.600> when<00:00:47.780> it<00:00:47.899> comes<00:00:48.140> to

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
more better than rico when it comes to

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.819 
more better than rico when it comes to
weapons<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:49.850> getting<00:00:50.120> Emma<00:00:50.479> because<00:00:51.289> Enrico

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
weapons and getting Emma because Enrico

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.919 
weapons and getting Emma because Enrico
they<00:00:52.280> try<00:00:52.519> to<00:00:52.579> make<00:00:52.789> you<00:00:52.909> buy<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.269> ammo<00:00:53.659> with

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
they try to make you buy the ammo with

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.629 
they try to make you buy the ammo with
real<00:00:54.170> money<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:54.530> let<00:00:54.800> get<00:00:54.979> respect<00:00:55.460> because

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:55.639 
real money and let get respect because

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:57.549 
real money and let get respect because
you<00:00:55.789> have<00:00:55.909> to<00:00:55.999> get<00:00:56.089> respect<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.629> unlock<00:00:56.989> levels

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
you have to get respect to unlock levels

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.039 
you have to get respect to unlock levels
to<00:00:57.739> be<00:00:57.829> able<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:58.129> buy<00:00:58.339> the<00:00:58.399> ammo<00:00:58.789> and<00:00:59.179> they<00:00:59.659> try

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.049 
to be able to buy the ammo and they try

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:02.739 
to be able to buy the ammo and they try
to<00:01:00.109> get<00:01:00.649> you<00:01:00.859> to<00:01:00.889> buy<00:01:01.399> it<00:01:01.460> with<00:01:01.760> real<00:01:02.120> money<00:01:02.420> and

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:02.749 
to get you to buy it with real money and

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.740 
to get you to buy it with real money and
so<00:01:03.379> then<00:01:04.129> Miami<00:01:04.729> they<00:01:05.000> don't<00:01:05.180> try<00:01:05.330> to<00:01:05.360> do<00:01:05.570> that

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
so then Miami they don't try to do that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.240 
so then Miami they don't try to do that
you<00:01:05.870> pretty<00:01:06.049> much<00:01:06.140> unlock<00:01:06.530> guns<00:01:06.770> quick<00:01:07.100> and

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
you pretty much unlock guns quick and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.700 
you pretty much unlock guns quick and
you<00:01:07.310> can<00:01:07.340> buy<00:01:07.580> ammo<00:01:07.970> pretty<00:01:08.180> much<00:01:08.330> right<00:01:08.630> away

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
you can buy ammo pretty much right away

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.859 
you can buy ammo pretty much right away
so<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:09.740> mean<00:01:10.100> I<00:01:10.130> think<00:01:10.250> Miami's<00:01:10.909> better<00:01:11.270> because

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
so I mean I think Miami's better because

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.779 
so I mean I think Miami's better because
of<00:01:11.899> that<00:01:12.110> it<00:01:12.560> really<00:01:13.100> pisses<00:01:13.369> me<00:01:13.610> off<00:01:13.640> that

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
of that it really pisses me off that

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.270 
of that it really pisses me off that
Rico<00:01:14.299> tries<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:14.780> get<00:01:14.930> you<00:01:15.049> some<00:01:15.409> real<00:01:15.649> money<00:01:15.979> in

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
Rico tries to get you some real money in

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.980 
Rico tries to get you some real money in
the<00:01:16.759> game<00:01:16.939> that<00:01:16.969> you<00:01:17.270> have<00:01:17.360> already<00:01:17.630> bought

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
the game that you have already bought

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.350 
the game that you have already bought
just<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:18.530> can<00:01:18.710> unlock<00:01:18.829> amo<00:01:19.310> quicker<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.090> it's

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
just you can unlock amo quicker and it's

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.179 
just you can unlock amo quicker and it's
pretty<00:01:20.600> shitty<00:01:20.930> because<00:01:21.380> of<00:01:21.500> that<00:01:21.649> ice<00:01:21.799> been

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
pretty shitty because of that ice been

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:23.560 
pretty shitty because of that ice been
playing<00:01:22.399> for<00:01:22.640> an<00:01:22.729> hour<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:22.939> a<00:01:23.000> half<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.359> I<00:01:23.420> can

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
playing for an hour and a half and I can

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.929 
playing for an hour and a half and I can
still<00:01:23.840> only<00:01:23.990> by<00:01:24.320> pistol<00:01:24.859> ammo<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.340> I'll<00:01:25.729> play

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
still only by pistol ammo and I'll play

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.090 
still only by pistol ammo and I'll play
Miami<00:01:26.570> for<00:01:26.750> 30<00:01:26.960> minutes<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:27.469> I'm<00:01:27.799> able<00:01:27.950> to

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
Miami for 30 minutes and I'm able to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.889 
Miami for 30 minutes and I'm able to
pretty<00:01:28.310> much<00:01:28.490> unlock<00:01:29.090> everything<00:01:29.479> from

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
pretty much unlock everything from

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.599 
pretty much unlock everything from
flamethrowers<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.649> rocket<00:01:30.979> launcher<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:31.490> in

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
flamethrowers to rocket launcher so in

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:32.980 
flamethrowers to rocket launcher so in
the<00:01:31.729> end<00:01:31.880> I<00:01:32.030> think<00:01:32.060> Miami's<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.659> lot<00:01:32.869> better

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
the end I think Miami's a lot better

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.380 
the end I think Miami's a lot better
game<00:01:33.350> but<00:01:33.920> Rico<00:01:34.310> does<00:01:34.670> have<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:34.909> few<00:01:35.149> better

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390

is<00:01:46.609> no<00:01:46.789> matter<00:01:47.030> what<00:01:47.390> they're<00:01:47.719> both<00:01:48.049> motion

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
is no matter what they're both motion

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.160 
is no matter what they're both motion
control<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.729> cannot<00:01:50.060> change<00:01:50.119> this<00:01:50.840> like<00:01:51.079> you

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
control you cannot change this like you

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.560 
control you cannot change this like you
can<00:01:51.380> with<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.590> bikes<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.670> really<00:01:52.999> kills<00:01:53.390> it

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
can with a bikes and it really kills it

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.810 
can with a bikes and it really kills it
for<00:01:53.600> me<00:01:53.869> like<00:01:54.380> especially<00:01:54.549> cording<00:01:55.549> it<00:01:55.670> makes

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
for me like especially cording it makes

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.840 
for me like especially cording it makes
it<00:01:55.969> extremely<00:01:56.329> difficult<00:01:57.130> but<00:01:58.130> flying<00:01:58.549> around

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
it extremely difficult but flying around

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.499 
it extremely difficult but flying around
is<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.119> lot<00:01:59.359> better<00:01:59.600> on<00:01:59.689> rio<00:02:00.109> than<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.649> is<00:02:00.799> on

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
is a lot better on rio than it is on

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.359 
is a lot better on rio than it is on
miami<00:02:02.509> but<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.409> thing<00:02:03.560> about<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.890> is<00:02:03.979> miami

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
miami but the thing about it is miami

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.429 
miami but the thing about it is miami
you'll<00:02:04.640> be<00:02:04.729> able<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:04.999> find<00:02:05.240> planes<00:02:05.749> just<00:02:05.990> lying

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439

you'll be able to find planes just lying
around<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:07.009> i<00:02:07.100> guess<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:07.460> can<00:02:07.640> do<00:02:07.819> the<00:02:07.909> same

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119
