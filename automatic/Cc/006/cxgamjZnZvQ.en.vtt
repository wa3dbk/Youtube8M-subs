let's<00:00:13.170> check<00:00:13.349> out<00:00:13.469> our<00:00:13.500> controls<00:00:14.630> we<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.809> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
let's check out our controls we have a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.080 
let's check out our controls we have a
level<00:00:16.470> knob<00:00:16.650> for<00:00:17.039> our<00:00:17.130> overall<00:00:17.400> volume<00:00:17.910> a

overdrive and a tone knob to go from
dark<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.699> bright<00:00:24.060> across<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> tone<00:00:24.900> spectrum

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
dark to bright across the tone spectrum

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.679 
dark to bright across the tone spectrum
also<00:00:26.310> because<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.880> part<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> drive<00:00:27.449> 3

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
also because this is part of the drive 3

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.890 
also because this is part of the drive 3
series<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> 3-way<00:00:28.949> switch<00:00:29.449> all<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
series we have a 3-way switch all the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.299 
series we have a 3-way switch all the
way<00:00:30.929> up<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> screen<00:00:31.740> position<00:00:31.920> we're

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
way up in the screen position we're

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.120 
way up in the screen position we're
using<00:00:32.460> LED<00:00:33.120> clipping<00:00:33.570> down<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> warm

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
using LED clipping down in the warm

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.920 
using LED clipping down in the warm
position<00:00:35.579> we're<00:00:35.730> using<00:00:35.850> diode<00:00:36.360> clipping<00:00:36.750> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
position we're using diode clipping and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
position we're using diode clipping and
boost<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> middle<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> combination<00:00:39.180> of

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
boost in the middle is a combination of

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.799 
boost in the middle is a combination of
both<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.430> get<00:00:41.550> us<00:00:41.610> started<00:00:41.700> we're<00:00:42.660> going<00:00:42.750> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
both so to get us started we're going to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.020 
both so to get us started we're going to
start<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.320> traditional<00:00:44.040> overdrive

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
start with a traditional overdrive

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.729 
start with a traditional overdrive
setting<00:00:45.649> our<00:00:46.649> tone<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.930> dialed<00:00:48.930> back<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.440> about

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
setting our tone is dialed back to about

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.389 
setting our tone is dialed back to about
one<00:00:50.070> o'clock<00:00:50.329> our<00:00:51.329> drive<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.840> at<00:00:52.230> about<00:00:52.500> 10

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
one o'clock our drive is at about 10

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.569 
one o'clock our drive is at about 10
o'clock<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.300> our<00:00:55.110> drive<00:00:55.350> 3<00:00:55.590> switch<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.070> set<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
o'clock and our drive 3 switch is set to

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.430 
o'clock and our drive 3 switch is set to
scream<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.539> over<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> clean

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
scream and this is over a clean

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:24.410 
scream and this is over a clean
amplifier<00:00:59.340> signal

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.430 

all<00:01:25.420> right<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.750> second<00:01:26.080> thing<00:01:26.200> we're<00:01:26.320> going

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
all right the second thing we're going

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.190 
all right the second thing we're going
to<00:01:26.500> dial<00:01:26.740> up<00:01:26.860> is<00:01:27.010> a<00:01:27.040> saturated<00:01:27.700> overdrive<00:01:28.390> so

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
to dial up is a saturated overdrive so

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.710 
to dial up is a saturated overdrive so
we'll<00:01:29.350> give<00:01:29.470> ourselves<00:01:29.620> a<00:01:29.950> little<00:01:30.070> more<00:01:30.280> level

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
we'll give ourselves a little more level

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.220 
we'll give ourselves a little more level
bring<00:01:31.720> our<00:01:31.930> tone<00:01:32.470> up<00:01:32.770> and<00:01:33.690> also<00:01:34.690> bring<00:01:35.080> our

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
bring our tone up and also bring our

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.500 
bring our tone up and also bring our
drive<00:01:35.560> up<00:01:35.830> and<00:01:36.010> we're<00:01:37.000> going<00:01:37.120> to<00:01:37.180> use<00:01:37.300> the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
drive up and we're going to use the

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.390 
drive up and we're going to use the
middle<00:01:37.750> boost<00:01:38.170> position<00:01:38.710> on<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.920> drive<00:01:39.130> three

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
middle boost position on the drive three

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:57.570 
middle boost position on the drive three
switch

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.250 

Oh

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.400 

you

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.690 

okay<00:02:11.410> in<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.650> third<00:02:11.920> setting<00:02:12.340> we're<00:02:12.580> gonna

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
okay in the third setting we're gonna

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.110 
okay in the third setting we're gonna
check<00:02:13.030> out<00:02:13.240> is<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.510> top<00:02:14.080> boost<00:02:14.500> overdrive<00:02:15.130> so

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
check out is a top boost overdrive so

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.199 
check out is a top boost overdrive so
let's<00:02:16.810> give<00:02:16.959> ourselves<00:02:17.080> some<00:02:17.440> more<00:02:17.590> level

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
let's give ourselves some more level

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.230 
let's give ourselves some more level
dial<00:02:19.209> back<00:02:19.480> our<00:02:19.780> drive<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.860> leave<00:02:21.730> our<00:02:21.970> tone

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
dial back our drive and leave our tone

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.790 
dial back our drive and leave our tone
high<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.810> we're<00:02:22.959> gonna<00:02:23.080> switch<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.590> drive

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
high and we're gonna switch the drive

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:51.230 
high and we're gonna switch the drive
three<00:02:24.069> switch<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.610> warm

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.520 

so<00:02:52.240> one<00:02:52.390> thing<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.660> may<00:02:52.780> have<00:02:52.810> noticed<00:02:53.319> is

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
so one thing you may have noticed is

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.250 
so one thing you may have noticed is
that<00:02:54.100> this<00:02:54.340> pedal<00:02:54.760> comes<00:02:55.090> with<00:02:55.360> two<00:02:55.690> extra

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
that this pedal comes with two extra

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.860 
that this pedal comes with two extra
chips<00:02:56.590> which<00:02:57.280> taint<00:02:57.640> which<00:02:57.910> change<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.630> tone

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
chips which taint which change the tone

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.830 
chips which taint which change the tone
qualities<00:02:59.380> of<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.650> pedal<00:02:59.920> itself<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.690> can

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
qualities of the pedal itself so you can

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.470 
qualities of the pedal itself so you can
swap<00:03:02.170> them<00:03:02.350> out<00:03:02.640> enjoy<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.819> options<00:03:04.240> and

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
swap them out enjoy the options and

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.360 
swap them out enjoy the options and
