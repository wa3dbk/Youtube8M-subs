00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.400
 this video is not really relevant idea 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:06.500
 write was born to me absolutely 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.719
 spontaneously the fact is that already enough 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.509
 long ago and recorded a video in which expressed 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.089
 their bewilderment that users 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.110
 put on their home computers 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.689
 professional or maximum 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.970
 editions of windows 7 still in 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.369
 comments to this video on youtube people 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.769
 write their opinion on this and in 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.560
 In general, it boils down to the following 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.660
 first for free and vinegar is sweet therefore 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.310
 if we take it to the maximum but in 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.289
 second some users claim 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.149
 that the Internet can only be found 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:37.670
 maximum or professional 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.920
 wording windows with the first item like 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.899
 everything would be clear though not entirely logical but 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.969
 about it a little later but the second argument 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.940
 about the lack of images on the Internet 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.570
 disks of other windows editions 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.460
 totally inconsistent 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.899
 reality and only demonstrates 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.329
 that the user who declares 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.440
 like so far just have not learned 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.469
 use google 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.989
 or an index now about the freebies they say 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.550
 for free you need to set the maximum speed in 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.250
 tom video I compared the maximum 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.320
 windows version with an excavator but today 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.880
 it occurred to me that such a comparison is not 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.070
 quite correct after all 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.380
 operating system 1 has only 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.030
 a modification so i want again 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.009
 state your opinion on an example 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.140
 endangered sevens because the family 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.579
 this operating system is quite extensive 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.829
 and so the greatest misconception 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.890
 users is that they 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.090
 professionalism and maximum 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.909
 associating something like wipe 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.460
 and deluxe argument is usually level 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.920
 something like fret vs ferrari but it 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.990
 extremely incorrect comparison to compare 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.420
 need something on one platform and not by 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.280
 luxury nasty and in terms of functionality 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.770
 all vladu after broadcast you immediately 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.630
 see and feel the difference but 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.689
 going from the maximum to the home version 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.280
 in the outcome is unlikely to notice something more 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.990
 I am sure that it is overwhelming 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.450
 most users wo n't see 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.009
 absolutely no difference and even through 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.600
 month enough dense use 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.969
 operating system 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.039
 so here is my comparison in pictures 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.560
 the initial version of windows 7 i would 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.960
 presented the form of the car most basic 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.729
 picking is nothing here 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.160
 the most necessary 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.490
 functional home base version 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.620
 has some extra abs 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.880
 and although in fact she is not far from 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.250
 initial version 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.870
 home enhanced version of windows 7 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.390
 has everything you need for a comfortable 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.310
 use and complete work on 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.740
 home computer that is for 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.820
 performing all everyday tasks this 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.280
 Absolutely enough and solution for 99.9 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.240
 percent of ordinary users 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.830
 corporate version of windows 7 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.890
 designed for installation on a computer 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.630
 and organizations it is so peculiar 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.690
 workhorse which is focused on 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.550
 large corporate networks and having 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.770
 very much in common with professional 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.430
 professional windows 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.000
 windows 7 has an extended edition 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.190
 highly specialized functionality 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.660
 which is absolutely not needed at home 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.430
 computer is professional here 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.650
 manifested in exactly 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.120
 useless on home computer 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.490
 functions like data encryption 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.620
 connectivity to a domain or 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.960
 windows xp emulation mode 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.300
 There are users who do not understand 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.430
 windows encryption principles stating that 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.230
 This feature is very useful and just for the sake of 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.390
 is it worth it to put a professional 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.280
 maximum operating system I would 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.470
 advised to encrypt all such Ilim 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.510
 how to deal with this feature 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.340
 windows since the likelihood of losing everything 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.770
 computer encrypted data in 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.730
 the case of an operating system failure is close 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.410
 to one hundred percent 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.700
 better use the container 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.800
 encryption using free 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.900
 programs true crypt but what about 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.440
 windows xp emulation can only say 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.630
 one 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.610
 put on your computer virtual 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.920
 machine if you still have programs 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.920
 who can't work in windows 7 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.990
 windows xp emulation mode in windows 7 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.490
 absolutely not perfect and no way 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.100
 guarantees the correct operation of the program 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.260
 there are no more utilities in it 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.900
 professional editions windows 7 no 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.730
 Well, in conclusion, the maximum edition 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.950
 windows 7 operating system 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.470
 I think that from the photo and everything is clear and 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.180
 comments here are unnecessary in fact 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.860
 by this i wanted to say what choice 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.380
 operating system for home 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.840
 computer is similar to choosing a car for 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.760
 everyday needs if you are not a doctor or 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.500
 another specialist that is professional 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.660
 who needs for his work 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.260
 specific tools in our case 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.720
 program 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.810
 but you still need a cumbersome 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.060
 all ambulance 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.010
 as they say drink vinegar for free and 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.960
 set the maximum you 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.580
 and tenths and opportunities will not be 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.590
 use and it 's not your thing 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.660
 ignorance of this functional and in its 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.480
 absolutely inapplicable at home 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.220
 conditions repeat just pointless it 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.139
 have on your home computer with a view 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.180
 once dealt with him since he 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.710
 just not meant for everyday 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.930
 work on a regular home computer 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.120
 all these possibilities are simply nowhere 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.620
 apply in general then like a car on 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.510
 recent photos are not really 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.270
 intended for a daily trip to 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.889
 work or parking in the yard is 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.810
 specialized tool for 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.030
 perform specific tasks 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.100
 statement like the fact that all versions 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.650
 except as much as possible are trimmed 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.690
 this is also a big mistake of course 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.310
 you can say so because you remember 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.080
 some say to glass half 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.030
 empty and others say he is 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.950
 half full here is the same 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.470
 picture but from my point of view 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.100
 correct says not about trimmed sti 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.650
 vice versa 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.389
 about expanding functionality in home 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.310
 extended edition windows has it all 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.530
 necessary to work on the usual 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.419
 home computer that is not connected 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.030
 in a large computer network having 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.890
 domain organization in corporate 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.140
 professional maximum versions 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.350
 added functionality allowing to work 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.479
 in large corporate networks and 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.970
 administer them again this whole 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.770
 additional functionality never 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.640
 will be in demand on the usual home 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.590
 computer 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.870
 another misconception which is 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.300
 unfounded and unsubstantiated 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.400
 this statement is about that as much as possible and 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.740
 professional operating room version 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.680
 windows systems better performance 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.350
 where did this myth so picked up come from 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.460
 I do not know users 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.710
 performance does not depend on 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.690
 operating system editions it can 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.400
 depend only on the configuration of your 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.950
 computer that is from the power 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.990
 processor and RAM 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.700
 the truth is that 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.760
 professional version unlike 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.280
 home extended supports up to 192 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.590
 gigabytes of ram vs 16 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.750
 gigabytes in home extended therefore 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.820
 if the computer has more than 16 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.530
 gigabytes of RAM you need 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.419
 install professional edition 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.550
 but don't forget that windows 7 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.440
 appeared more than five years ago and at that 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.420
 time 16 gigabyte operational 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.730
 anti on home computer was something 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.750
 fantastic though now very 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.060
 small number of users 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.490
 can brag of such volume 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.170
 RAM on my computer I 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.940
 I am sure that the vast majority of these 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.870
 users have long since switched to 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.030
 windows 8 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.590
 Well, summing up I will say that for reasonable 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.780
 people who do not suffer from complex 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.240
 inferiority or wounded 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.040
 self-esteem in the vast majority 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.710
 cases home is quite suitable 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.990
 extended edition windows 7 out there 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.570
 everything you need and there is nothing superfluous 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.100
 and of course the question which is also to me 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.830
 users periodically set 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.900
 and what do I care about what exactly 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.480
 who has the operating system installed 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.310
 I will answer absolutely no matter what 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.530
 the operating system is installed exactly 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.090
 on your computer I just think that 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.280
 any competent user understands 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.720
 all the absurdity of a situation like that is 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.490
 set maximum or 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.500
 professional windows version on your 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.330
 computer if the person that is, if 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.850
 the user is so stupid 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.590
 no other way just to say comes to 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.180
