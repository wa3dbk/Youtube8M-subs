we're doing a review of the Canon 24 to

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.530 
we're doing a review of the Canon 24 to
105<00:00:04.920> f/4<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:06.270> usm<00:00:07.170> so<00:00:08.040> this<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.550> canon<00:00:08.940> 24

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
105 f/4 is usm so this is the canon 24

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.209 
105 f/4 is usm so this is the canon 24
to<00:00:09.809> 105<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.889> usm<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.700> has<00:00:12.269> 18<00:00:13.019> elements<00:00:13.380> with<00:00:13.769> 13

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
to 105 is usm it has 18 elements with 13

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.730 
to 105 is usm it has 18 elements with 13
groups<00:00:14.490> with<00:00:14.969> one<00:00:15.240> super<00:00:15.719> UD<00:00:16.139> front<00:00:16.470> element

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
groups with one super UD front element

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.859 
groups with one super UD front element
so<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.730> overall<00:00:18.090> build<00:00:18.300> quality<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.720> this

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
so the overall build quality of this

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.620 
so the overall build quality of this
lens<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.289> really<00:00:19.619> great<00:00:19.949> it's<00:00:20.580> heavy<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.180> it

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630

lens is really great it's heavy and it
just<00:00:21.930> stands<00:00:22.529> up<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.830> whatever<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.160> throught

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
just stands up to whatever you throught

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.220 
just stands up to whatever you throught
it<00:00:23.430> as<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.060> would<00:00:24.150> expect<00:00:24.269> from<00:00:24.689> an<00:00:24.840> L<00:00:24.960> lens

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
it as you would expect from an L lens

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.640 
it as you would expect from an L lens
and<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:26.730> optical<00:00:27.599> quality<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.140> really<00:00:28.349> great

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
and the optical quality is really great

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.800

there<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.590> no<00:00:32.009> color<00:00:32.279> fringing<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.820> have<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.030> try

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
there is no color fringing I have to try

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.060 
there is no color fringing I have to try
to<00:00:33.270> make<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.660> color<00:00:33.870> fringe<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.469> just

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
to make this color fringe and it's just

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.400 
to make this color fringe and it's just
not<00:00:35.190> possible<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:36.510> some<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> flaws<00:00:37.140> with

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
not possible so some of the flaws with

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.900 
not possible so some of the flaws with
this<00:00:37.590> lens<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.870> it<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.079> an<00:00:40.260> f4<00:00:40.710> lens<00:00:40.910> which

this lens is that it is an f4 lens which

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.479 
this lens is that it is an f4 lens which
isn't<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.930> good<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.379> low-light<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.950> I've

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
