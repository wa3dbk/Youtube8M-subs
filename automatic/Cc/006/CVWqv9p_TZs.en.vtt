00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.920
 mayonnaise unfortunately classic mayo 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.840
 very high-calorie and we all want and tasty 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.970

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.800
 mayonnaise cannot be called mayonnaise 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.000
 real mayo must be at least 50 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.920
 percent fat 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.020

 and its caloric content is much lower 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.280
