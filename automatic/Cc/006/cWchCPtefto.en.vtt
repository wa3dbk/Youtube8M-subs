00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.540
 1000 only live on the motorcycle linz 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.580
 2014 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.380
 I am standing here with the bridgestone 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.559
 harald kessler hair 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.049
 Despite the use in the motogp, there was a long time 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.000
 not ending sector of bridgestone 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.820
 Then there was the v 0 1 and have now 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.760
 already the 02 to the mature plants so 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.340
 say something of formula 1 is last up 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.769
 come to the market that a premium 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.420
 sleek of both for the supersport as well 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.399
 also for the 1000 kubik class goes the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.770
 convinced of the price performance ratio 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.780
 has a very very good product now 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.239
 we have got premium product for 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.680
 the really fast racer 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.780
 So he really says he leaves 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.510
 time hunting and how to have the ultimate 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.039
 warned the motogp so now 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.690
 not just marketing history but 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.690
 It is really a chef developer 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.350
 called europe from the gp in the series 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.539
 come 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.579
 the technologies of the halves are used by the technologies 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.399
 bring extreme tardiness and that was 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.370
 Also bring very high longevity 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.500
 while it is seen at formula 1 there 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.350
 at the beginning ok said the holes the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.310
 profile depth is very low is the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.170
 keep it long 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.040
 The mature one really has one 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.750
 very high customer numbers existed and and 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.880
 everyone said that it was incredible like us 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.560
 other tires for this war today and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 before 02 it is now in the pipeline 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.460
 here comes the next two 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.590
 weeks on the market we have too 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.020
 a lot of demand even though it is only 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.270
 has given a few internal tests with 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.009
 Arne Death and a Moto2 pilot in the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.869
 spain has tested and we expect 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.909
 us that he is not much for us now 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.180
 only products make unit numbers but 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.950
 We can also offer a third-state premium 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.900
 offer tires for a dealer of 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.850
 series a 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.390
 is therefore very important building block for 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.040
 us high longevity high performance 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.310
 has also moved something in price 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.130
 between 401 and 402 a little so may 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.740
 v 0 1 costs even 300 euros 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.660
 and that costs 330 euros for the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.730
 end customers on sale as compared to 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.690
 the competitors still relatively moderate 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.149
 the price up to between 50 and 80 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.369
 cheaper than the comparable one 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.830
 Competitor and I have heard 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.720
 do you know where to work far away women and 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.640
 two are the thousands script is like 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.350
 do you see that that is absolutely that he is 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.850
 I also heard that specifically for the 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.530
 flu was developed 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.320
 but you can also use it outside of 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.520
 cheer the race okay national one 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.910
 both open and then let's see who 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.910
 is faster
