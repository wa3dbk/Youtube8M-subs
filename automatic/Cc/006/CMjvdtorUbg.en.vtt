00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.800
 to 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.760
 point 3 is the armed is like how 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.630
 anti generates force as load the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.200
 strength here let's see 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:57.300
 as the arm racket is prepared 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.580
 the force has to come out from the ground 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.660
 that's why it's important that a good 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.660
 leg flexion 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.360
 it is fine the armed is correct 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.640
 the arm that he does is the current one is the 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.500
 modern formerly when preparing the elbow 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.060
 it stayed closer to the body but 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.030
 now as the rackets are so 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.330
 good you can separate more elbow and 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.970
 there is enough lever the arm is working 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.530
 pretty well what I do one thing that 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.440
 I see that here you start to see the game 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.510
 of feet right in the armed one begins to 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.540
 see how they place their feet 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.910
 grip forces you to be in position 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.060
 open is an impact that has to be 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:55.670
 higher than normal and then the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.130
 Semi-side position does not work 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.830
 they are placed sideways sometimes 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.220
 times in front and stamped inaugurates 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.759
 bound balance more or less ascending 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.920
 always always when sticking the force comes out 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.319
 up has the other option 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.060
 also to go forward with the 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.860
 right leg but let's observe 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.830
 here you start to see the game of 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.450
 feet between point 3 which is this which is 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.180
 the armed the 4 that is the impact or better 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.190
 said the progress towards impact and 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.970
 impact you have to see the feet like 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:37.010
 work we are going to fix a lot since 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:39.290
 in this this blow there is balance 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.930
 dynamic is not the serve that we are in 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.390
 the static position here must see 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.770
 much the footwork can be very 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.620
 important 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.159
 ah 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.159
 ah 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.659
 ah
