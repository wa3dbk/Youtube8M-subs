grand piano there are so many important

process<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.580> emulating<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> piano<00:01:30.479> sound

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
process of emulating the piano sound

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.830 
process of emulating the piano sound
from<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.110> single<00:01:31.470> key<00:01:32.060> we<00:01:33.060> created<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:33.600> sound

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
from a single key we created the sound

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.990 
from a single key we created the sound
from<00:01:34.020> scratch<00:01:34.410> so<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:34.950> needed<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.400> single<00:01:35.729> piano

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
from scratch so we needed a single piano

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.810 
from scratch so we needed a single piano
wire<00:01:36.330> and<00:01:36.600> hammer<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.830> is<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.070> really<00:01:38.460> pure

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
wire and hammer this is a really pure

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.420 
wire and hammer this is a really pure
and<00:01:39.060> quiet<00:01:39.360> sound<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.320> make<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.619> sound<00:01:40.860> louder

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and quiet sound to make the sound louder

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.219 
and quiet sound to make the sound louder
larger<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.850> more<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> traditional<00:01:42.600> piano

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
larger and more like a traditional piano

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.420 
larger and more like a traditional piano
we<00:01:43.830> needed<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.220> add<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> soundboard<00:01:46.280> we<00:01:47.280> can

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
we needed to add a soundboard we can

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.980 
we needed to add a soundboard we can
even<00:01:47.580> mute<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.030> strings<00:01:48.330> to<00:01:48.540> achieve<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
even mute the strings to achieve the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.600 
even mute the strings to achieve the
sound<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.500> piano<00:01:49.649> mechanism<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.520> to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
sound of the piano mechanism and to

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.219 
sound of the piano mechanism and to
determine<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.090> attack<00:01:51.420> point<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> hammer

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
determine the attack point of the hammer

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
determine the attack point of the hammer
to<00:01:52.830> complete<00:01:53.160> the<00:01:53.310> sound<00:01:53.550> we<00:01:53.970> also<00:01:54.149> emulate

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
to complete the sound we also emulate

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.810 
to complete the sound we also emulate
the<00:01:54.720> 2nd<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.229> 3rd<00:01:55.410> piano<00:01:55.800> wires<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.460> the

the 2nd and 3rd piano wires and the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.800 
the 2nd and 3rd piano wires and the
damper<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.330> mute<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.600> strings<00:01:59.330> this<00:02:00.330> process

damper to mute the strings this process

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.630 
damper to mute the strings this process
is<00:02:00.990> very<00:02:01.200> different<00:02:01.680> from<00:02:01.800> sampling<00:02:02.250> as<00:02:02.490> we
