plants ones Ayub me also known as

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.410 
plants ones Ayub me also known as
chilean<00:00:15.780> guava<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:17.510> babaco<00:00:19.010> now<00:00:20.119> these<00:00:21.119> might

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
chilean guava and babaco now these might

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.960 
chilean guava and babaco now these might
be<00:00:21.630> doable<00:00:21.960> for<00:00:22.140> me<00:00:22.500> up<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.949> Newington<00:00:23.160> because

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
be doable for me up in Newington because

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.480 
be doable for me up in Newington because
they're<00:00:24.420> cold<00:00:25.430> tolerant<00:00:26.430> now<00:00:28.070> under<00:00:29.070> no<00:00:29.220> false

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
they're cold tolerant now under no false

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.040 
they're cold tolerant now under no false
impression<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.179> these<00:00:30.480> are<00:00:30.630> going<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.869> be

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
impression that these are going to be

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.370 
impression that these are going to be
able<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.500> last<00:00:31.769> outside<00:00:32.750> in<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.899> New<00:00:34.020> England

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
able to last outside in a New England

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.520 
able to last outside in a New England
winter<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:34.980> they<00:00:35.760> come<00:00:36.090> from<00:00:36.530> subtropical

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
winter but they come from subtropical

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.889 
winter but they come from subtropical
climate<00:00:37.980> they<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.879> take<00:00:39.090> cool<00:00:39.540> conditions

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
climate they can take cool conditions

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.209 
climate they can take cool conditions
and<00:00:40.940> they<00:00:41.940> both<00:00:42.329> probably<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:43.200> pretty<00:00:43.230> good<00:00:43.649> in

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and they both probably do pretty good in

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.889 
and they both probably do pretty good in
pots<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.510> grow<00:00:45.899> them<00:00:46.170> inside<00:00:47.210> now<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
pots so I can grow them inside now the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.270 
pots so I can grow them inside now the
pavakah<00:00:49.320> actually<00:00:50.539> likes<00:00:51.539> cool<00:00:52.280> temperatures

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
pavakah actually likes cool temperatures

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.459 
pavakah actually likes cool temperatures
grows<00:00:53.610> at<00:00:53.820> high<00:00:53.969> altitudes<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:57.120> first

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
grows at high altitudes and the first

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.209 
grows at high altitudes and the first
cooler<00:00:58.469> temperatures<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.719> it<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.930> take<00:01:01.219> down

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
cooler temperatures so it can take down

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.310 
cooler temperatures so it can take down
to<00:01:02.489> 28<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.270> brief<00:01:03.539> periods<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:04.229> time<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:06.320> and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
to 28 for brief periods of time but and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.480 
to 28 for brief periods of time but and
it<00:01:07.530> also<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.460> uh<00:01:08.750> it's<00:01:09.750> more<00:01:10.020> adapted<00:01:10.799> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
it also is uh it's more adapted to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.950 
it also is uh it's more adapted to
growing<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.930> pot<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.970> would<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.270> good<00:01:15.540> for

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
growing in a pot so it would be good for

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.100 
growing in a pot so it would be good for
a<00:01:16.290> window<00:01:16.970> let's<00:01:17.970> get<00:01:18.180> these<00:01:18.330> out<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.780> box

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
a window let's get these out of the box

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.609 
a window let's get these out of the box
here<00:01:19.939> let's<00:01:20.939> see<00:01:21.090> what<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.360> have

here let's see what we have
again<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.650> bought<00:01:22.950> these<00:01:23.130> from<00:01:23.369> Raintree

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
again I bought these from Raintree

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.580 
again I bought these from Raintree
nursery<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:27.240> let's<00:01:27.420> see<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.810> go<00:01:28.220> okay<00:01:29.220> oh

known as a New Zealand cranberry and

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.600 
known as a New Zealand cranberry and
it's<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.850> guess<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.329> an<00:01:48.509> evergreen

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
it's a I guess it's it's an evergreen

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.249 
it's a I guess it's it's an evergreen
and<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> very<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:54.090> French<00:01:54.420> how<00:01:55.229> you

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
and it's got a very that French how you

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.080 
and it's got a very that French how you
propagate<00:01:55.740> these<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.430> branch<00:01:56.700> here<00:01:57.000> is

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
propagate these but this branch here is

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.209 
propagate these but this branch here is
broken<00:01:57.570> off<00:01:58.820> well<00:01:59.840> but

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.590 

john<00:02:04.219> was<00:02:04.399> saying<00:02:04.429> that<00:02:05.000> he's<00:02:05.149> trying<00:02:05.450> these

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
john was saying that he's trying these

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.419 
john was saying that he's trying these
berries<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.200> they<00:02:06.289> said<00:02:06.500> almost<00:02:06.829> tasted<00:02:07.250> like

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
berries and they said almost tasted like

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.150 
berries and they said almost tasted like
skittles<00:02:08.090> i<00:02:08.420> guess<00:02:08.629> very<00:02:09.700> intense<00:02:10.700> burst<00:02:11.090> of

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
skittles i guess very intense burst of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.070 
skittles i guess very intense burst of
flavor<00:02:13.390> now<00:02:14.390> here<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.220> bottle<00:02:17.080> this

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
flavor now here is the bottle this

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.740 
flavor now here is the bottle this
almost<00:02:18.500> looks<00:02:18.799> like<00:02:19.090> believe<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.299> would<00:02:20.450> find

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
almost looks like believe you would find

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.839 
almost looks like believe you would find
on<00:02:21.049> a<00:02:21.379> fig<00:02:22.370> tree<00:02:22.400> actually<00:02:25.690> -<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:27.849> shredded

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
on a fig tree actually - the shredded

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:38.020 
on a fig tree actually - the shredded
paper<00:02:35.709> so<00:02:36.709> we<00:02:36.799> can<00:02:36.980> see<00:02:37.190> him<00:02:37.280> back<00:02:37.459> up<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.849> little

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
paper so we can see him back up a little

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.680 
paper so we can see him back up a little
bit<00:02:38.180> here<00:02:38.360> see<00:02:38.569> what<00:02:38.690> these<00:02:38.840> plants<00:02:39.260> look<00:02:39.440> like

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.069 

so<00:02:44.690> this<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.989> very<00:02:45.200> interesting<00:02:45.500> plants<00:02:46.280> here

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.789 

now<00:02:51.079> the<00:02:51.140> Pavano<00:02:51.950> has<00:02:52.250> all<00:02:52.549> female<00:02:53.150> flowers<00:02:53.870> so

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
now the Pavano has all female flowers so

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:01.089 
now the Pavano has all female flowers so
it<00:02:55.040> produces<00:02:55.900> fruit<00:02:58.840> without<00:02:59.840> seeds<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.980> the

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
it produces fruit without seeds and the

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:08.140 
it produces fruit without seeds and the
skin<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.489> edible<00:03:05.859> and<00:03:06.859> the<00:03:07.459> tree<00:03:07.700> lasts<00:03:08.060> about

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
skin is edible and the tree lasts about

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.500 
skin is edible and the tree lasts about
just<00:03:09.079> eight<00:03:09.260> years<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:10.130> then<00:03:10.400> it'll<00:03:11.299> put

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
just eight years and then it'll put

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.180 
just eight years and then it'll put
roots<00:03:11.810> out<00:03:12.109> and<00:03:14.170> another<00:03:15.170> side<00:03:15.500> chute<00:03:15.859> will

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
roots out and another side chute will

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.009 
roots out and another side chute will
grow<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.760> I<00:03:16.910> guess<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.209> cut<00:03:17.480> off<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.870> main

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
grow and I guess you cut off the main

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.379 
grow and I guess you cut off the main
trunk<00:03:18.500> eventually<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:21.250> plant<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.970> can<00:03:23.120> you

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
trunk eventually and plant you can you

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.289 
trunk eventually and plant you can you
can<00:03:23.569> actually<00:03:23.690> plant<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.790> little<00:03:25.910> pieces

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
can actually plant the little pieces

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.620 
can actually plant the little pieces
that<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:26.750> cut<00:03:27.019> off<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:28.220> I<00:03:28.340> guess<00:03:28.630> they'll

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
that you cut off and I guess they'll

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.360 
that you cut off and I guess they'll
sprout<00:03:29.989> new<00:03:30.290> plants<00:03:31.060> but<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.540> can<00:03:33.260> get<00:03:33.470> quite

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
sprout new plants but you can get quite

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.069 
sprout new plants but you can get quite
a<00:03:34.430> bit<00:03:34.669> of<00:03:34.760> fruit<00:03:35.000> off<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.419> these<00:03:35.510> trees<00:03:35.900> I

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
a bit of fruit off of these trees I

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.800 
a bit of fruit off of these trees I
guess<00:03:36.349> and<00:03:36.590> then<00:03:36.680> very<00:03:36.919> very<00:03:37.810> interesting

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
guess and then very very interesting

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.559 
guess and then very very interesting
fruit<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.269> guess<00:03:42.880> I'll<00:03:43.880> give<00:03:44.060> these<00:03:44.239> a<00:03:44.269> try

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
fruit so I guess I'll give these a try

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.699 
fruit so I guess I'll give these a try
and<00:03:44.660> see<00:03:45.139> what<00:03:46.299> see<00:03:47.299> if<00:03:47.359> these<00:03:47.510> surviving<00:03:48.230> in

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
and see what see if these surviving in

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.800 
and see what see if these surviving in
New<00:03:48.859> England<00:03:48.889> and<00:03:49.400> in<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.880> window<00:03:50.209> type<00:03:50.599> of

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
New England and in a window type of

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.379 
New England and in a window type of
environment<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.840> tobacco<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:56.000> thought<00:03:56.359> to

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
environment the tobacco is thought to

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:01.300 
environment the tobacco is thought to
originate<00:03:57.169> it<00:03:57.380> in<00:03:59.380> like<00:04:00.380> I<00:04:00.410> guess<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.889> central

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
originate it in like I guess the central

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.860 
originate it in like I guess the central
there's<00:04:01.669> some<00:04:01.880> southern<00:04:02.269> Central<00:04:02.690> Highlands

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
there's some southern Central Highlands

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.050 
there's some southern Central Highlands
in<00:04:03.290> Ecuador<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:05.560> they<00:04:06.560> they've<00:04:07.340> grown<00:04:07.819> this

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
in Ecuador and they they've grown this

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.440 
in Ecuador and they they've grown this
successfully<00:04:08.810> in<00:04:08.900> Italy<00:04:09.230> Israel<00:04:10.329> and<00:04:11.329> of

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
successfully in Italy Israel and of

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.179 
successfully in Italy Israel and of
course<00:04:11.689> Central<00:04:12.079> America<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.739> I<00:04:12.799> think<00:04:12.829> in

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:13.189 
course Central America and I think in

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.300 
course Central America and I think in
greenhouses<00:04:13.670> in<00:04:14.000> California

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
greenhouses in California

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.260 
greenhouses in California
so<00:04:17.310> give<00:04:17.519> it<00:04:17.579> a<00:04:17.669> try<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:20.450> of<00:04:21.450> course<00:04:21.720> this

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
so give it a try and of course this

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:33.530 
so give it a try and of course this
evening<00:04:24.620> or<00:04:25.700> I<00:04:28.310> think<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:32.240> appuchi

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
evening or I think the appuchi

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.950 
evening or I think the appuchi
or<00:04:34.350> Mapuche<00:04:34.980> Indians<00:04:35.120> Johnson<00:04:36.120> Unni<00:04:36.419> I<00:04:36.600> don't

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
or Mapuche Indians Johnson Unni I don't

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.140 
or Mapuche Indians Johnson Unni I don't
think<00:04:37.139> they<00:04:37.260> pronounce<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.830> G<00:04:39.050> this<00:04:40.050> is<00:04:40.260> from

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
think they pronounce the G this is from

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.750 
think they pronounce the G this is from
this<00:04:42.150> is<00:04:42.210> from<00:04:42.510> Chile

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
this is from Chile

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.200 
this is from Chile
so<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:45.540> vodka<00:04:46.440> also<00:04:46.830> was<00:04:46.980> related<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:48.090> the

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
so the vodka also was related to the

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.629 
so the vodka also was related to the
papaya<00:04:48.979> but<00:04:49.979> I<00:04:50.040> guess<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:50.310> papaya<00:04:51.200> needs<00:04:52.200> a<00:04:52.639> lot

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
papaya but I guess a papaya needs a lot

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.700 
papaya but I guess a papaya needs a lot
of<00:04:53.760> soil<00:04:54.000> it's<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:54.389> tree<00:04:54.750> and<00:04:57.500> it<00:04:58.500> needs

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
of soil it's a tree and it needs

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.159 
of soil it's a tree and it needs
constant<00:04:59.010> temperatures<00:04:59.820> and<00:05:00.090> moisture<00:05:00.540> to

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
constant temperatures and moisture to

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.980 
constant temperatures and moisture to
grow<00:05:01.320> successfully<00:05:02.270> whereas<00:05:03.270> this<00:05:03.450> grows<00:05:03.840> on

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
grow successfully whereas this grows on

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.020 
grow successfully whereas this grows on
a<00:05:04.050> cooler<00:05:04.410> climate<00:05:04.680> and<00:05:05.220> it's<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.700> smaller

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
a cooler climate and it's a smaller

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.210 
a cooler climate and it's a smaller
plant<00:05:06.419> so<00:05:07.169> that's<00:05:07.350> why<00:05:07.530> I'm<00:05:07.680> thinking<00:05:07.710> you're

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
plant so that's why I'm thinking you're

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.070 
plant so that's why I'm thinking you're
gonna<00:05:08.280> have<00:05:08.520> something<00:05:08.880> or<00:05:09.540> I'm<00:05:09.690> going<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:09.990> be

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
gonna have something or I'm going to be

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.680 
gonna have something or I'm going to be
able<00:05:10.169> to<00:05:10.290> have<00:05:10.410> some<00:05:10.620> success<00:05:10.800> growing<00:05:11.310> this

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
able to have some success growing this

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.180 
able to have some success growing this
in<00:05:12.690> the<00:05:12.810> southern<00:05:13.139> facing<00:05:13.530> window<00:05:13.830> at<00:05:14.010> least

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
in the southern facing window at least

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.750 
in the southern facing window at least
in<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.430> wintertime<00:05:15.020> and<00:05:16.400> this<00:05:17.400> being<00:05:17.639> an

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
in the wintertime and this being an

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.310 
in the wintertime and this being an
evergreen<00:05:18.030> does<00:05:18.840> you<00:05:19.020> unique<00:05:21.169> just<00:05:22.169> be

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
evergreen does you unique just be

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.400 
evergreen does you unique just be
interesting<00:05:22.919> to<00:05:23.039> see<00:05:23.280> how<00:05:23.580> this<00:05:23.820> grows<00:05:24.410> here

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
interesting to see how this grows here

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.219 
interesting to see how this grows here
in<00:05:25.560> New<00:05:25.710> England<00:05:25.740> so<00:05:27.950> those<00:05:28.950> are<00:05:29.130> two<00:05:29.370> new<00:05:30.229> do

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
in New England so those are two new do

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.760 
in New England so those are two new do
the<00:05:31.380> plants<00:05:31.860> that<00:05:32.990> I'm<00:05:33.990> going<00:05:34.229> to<00:05:34.320> try<00:05:34.500> out

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
the plants that I'm going to try out

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.050 
the plants that I'm going to try out
here<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.340> very<00:05:35.789> interesting<00:05:36.539> and<00:05:37.039> unique

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
here and very interesting and unique

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.590 
here and very interesting and unique
plants<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:40.310> thought<00:05:41.310> you<00:05:41.910> might<00:05:41.940> want<00:05:42.300> to<00:05:42.360> see

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
plants and thought you might want to see

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.430 
plants and thought you might want to see
these<00:05:42.780> and<00:05:44.720> maybe<00:05:45.720> you<00:05:45.900> want<00:05:46.080> to<00:05:46.169> give<00:05:46.320> them<00:05:46.410> a

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
these and maybe you want to give them a

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.610 
these and maybe you want to give them a
try<00:05:46.650> to<00:05:46.710> see<00:05:47.190> if<00:05:47.280> you<00:05:47.310> can<00:05:47.520> grow<00:05:47.700> them<00:05:48.620> because

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
try to see if you can grow them because

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.900 
try to see if you can grow them because
I<00:05:49.710> don't<00:05:49.800> think<00:05:49.919> you're<00:05:50.130> gonna<00:05:50.220> find<00:05:50.490> these<00:05:50.760> in

I don't think you're gonna find these in

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.950 
I don't think you're gonna find these in
your<00:05:50.940> local<00:05:51.060> grocery<00:05:51.780> store<00:05:53.090> at<00:05:54.090> least<00:05:54.240> not<00:05:54.930> on
