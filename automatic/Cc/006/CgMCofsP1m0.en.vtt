00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hello

 and today I'll show you how 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:14.969
 I give the shadow and the light in this loop is 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:20.430
 first here I've gone red 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:25.400
 Scarlet is all over the lazio now I came 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:32.759
 burned earth or make the markings 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:40.410
 tie with between which also will 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:42.680
 round a little more than here 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.680
 also 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:59.710
 here where you will put down that part here 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:01.260
 You have to pull here, too. 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.720
 under 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.119
 people the secret of shadow and light is 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.810
 put the shadow on everything that stands for 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:13.660
 Down to you that is a beginner who does not 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.180
 have notion of where they can go about 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.460
 light 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:24.220
 looks abrinq usually adobe that stays 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:28.960
 underneath is this one, the sound stays by 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.950
 just here in a little shade is 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.950
 to highlight 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:42.070
 Have you started on what you discovered 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:46.600
 many people are asking me is like 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:50.080
 make light and shadow 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.729
 I did it I'll get a brush myself 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.180
 I made a convince pin, now I'm going to get it. 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:02:00.640
 Another brush here for me is to find a 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.760
 pretty cool zink brush 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.580
 the tiger feels the 141 series of the 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:11.200
 tiger the number 6 brush cut off and 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:15.880
 shakhtar you think to find the here 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:20.070
 tiger 141 number 6 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.070
 I'll disguise this shadow 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:29.980
 here I pull down I go 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.709
 pull up because here to highlight 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.600
 the light here on the top and here as 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.709
 it's on the inside you have to give 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.709
 depth here 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.280
 and only the military disguise 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:01.750
 Look what I 'm going to do right now. 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.750
 I'm going to play now 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.659
 played on his, let's get him to put 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.260
 the light 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:11.360
 I'm going to make it red 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.730
 I started with scarlet red after 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.360
 I came with the land the boss is to 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.659
 shadow and now I'm going for a bright red 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:25.849
 I do not think that tone is too red. 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:28.269
 Gorgeous year gives volume now with camera and 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.269
 alive 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:55.220
 Here is what I'm showing here giving 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.220
 volume here right? 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.489
 there are people who do not know where I am 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:09.510
 I put on glasses, it's lost, right? 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:14.519
 this is going to help a little, this is the 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.560
 The way that I do is as always. 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:21.660
 When I finish, I'll post it already. 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.789
 I tried this baby and it's with my hair 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.330
 blondes, nor is this one here 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:29.940
 with black hair when I'm done 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:43.080
 I'll show you they were at the post. 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:47.550
 Okay, well, if you approve then, then. 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:50.820
 It's more or less like this, it's fine and if 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.630
 do not yet give the haunting the light is the one that 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.650
 it's already there 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:05:01.500
 For the moment, her little face made the 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:06.180
 pacifier with wine and white wine tone 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.650
 is under white and here it will be 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.900
 her black hair her clothes will be 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.130
 red but have not yet finished 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.310
 station 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.370

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.370
