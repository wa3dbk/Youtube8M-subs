all the cabling it needs so yeah I just
want<00:01:26.659> to<00:01:26.869> keep<00:01:27.020> this<00:01:27.170> video<00:01:27.409> short<00:01:28.479> I<00:01:31.720> must<00:01:32.720> say

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
want to keep this video short I must say

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.890 
want to keep this video short I must say
it's<00:01:33.229> taking<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:33.890> lot<00:01:34.310> of<00:01:34.369> time<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.330> install<00:01:35.540> all

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
it's taking a lot of time to install all

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.080 
it's taking a lot of time to install all
the<00:01:35.930> games<00:01:36.439> and<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.740> applications<00:01:37.490> back<00:01:37.820> I

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
the games and the applications back I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.080 
the games and the applications back I
had<00:01:38.540> it<00:01:38.659> configured<00:01:39.490> perfectly<00:01:40.490> but<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.850> only

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
had it configured perfectly but the only

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.499 
had it configured perfectly but the only
downside<00:01:41.840> wants<00:01:42.170> is<00:01:42.290> that<00:01:42.759> my<00:01:43.759> hard<00:01:44.000> drive<00:01:44.330> was

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
downside wants is that my hard drive was

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.380 
downside wants is that my hard drive was
so<00:01:44.750> little<00:01:45.100> 320<00:01:46.100> gigabytes<00:01:46.640> is<00:01:46.909> just<00:01:47.210> that

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
so little 320 gigabytes is just that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.340 
so little 320 gigabytes is just that
it's<00:01:47.570> not<00:01:47.780> enough<00:01:48.049> to<00:01:49.329> to<00:01:50.329> do<00:01:50.509> everything<00:01:50.960> you

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
it's not enough to to do everything you

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.640 
it's not enough to to do everything you
know<00:01:51.470> vo<00:01:51.799> it<00:01:52.130> takes<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:53.030> lot<00:01:53.240> of<00:01:53.270> space<00:01:53.689> and<00:01:54.049> I

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
know vo it takes a lot of space and I

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.980 
know vo it takes a lot of space and I
need<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.100> space<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.400> do<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:56.360> know<00:01:56.630> more

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
need the space to do you know more

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.100 
need the space to do you know more
