now<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.090> have<00:00:09.269> an<00:00:09.389> image<00:00:09.889> which<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:12.349> I<00:00:13.549> made<00:00:14.549> this

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
now I have an image which is I made this

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.279 
now I have an image which is I made this
mushroom<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.179> really<00:00:15.480> can't<00:00:15.780> yesterday

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.080 

relatively<00:00:19.289> pleased<00:00:19.500> with<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.830> but<00:00:20.609> not<00:00:20.789> happy

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
relatively pleased with it but not happy

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.099 
relatively pleased with it but not happy
with<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.630> round<00:00:22.590> whoops

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
with is this round whoops

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.439 
with is this round whoops
it's<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.230> bit<00:00:25.350> boring<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.830> flat<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.449> pleasant

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
it's a bit boring and flat and pleasant

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.880 
it's a bit boring and flat and pleasant
so<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> thought<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.920> would<00:00:29.070> be<00:00:29.570> coming<00:00:30.570> plan<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
so I thought it would be coming plan to

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.780 
so I thought it would be coming plan to
make<00:00:32.759> something<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.329> 3d<00:00:33.899> count<00:00:34.520> now<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.550> could

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
make something in 3d count now I could

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.270 
make something in 3d count now I could
just<00:00:35.820> use<00:00:36.239> views<00:00:36.600> edited<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.070> I

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
just use views edited to do this but I

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.799 
just use views edited to do this but I
think<00:00:38.370> I've<00:00:38.670> got<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> bit<00:00:39.030> more<00:00:39.180> control<00:00:39.600> here

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
think I've got a bit more control here

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.920 
think I've got a bit more control here
so<00:00:40.520> some<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:42.500> starts<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> stop<00:00:43.829> primitive

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
so some of that starts to stop primitive

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.299 
so some of that starts to stop primitive
cube

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:01:00.020 

percent

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.560 

I'm<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:00.900> really<00:01:01.050> looking<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.620> anything

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
I'm not really looking for anything

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.470 
I'm not really looking for anything

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
Ortiz award like like a path might be a

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.760 
Ortiz award like like a path might be a
few<00:01:10.170> kind<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.590> pop<00:01:11.190> your<00:01:11.370> bits<00:01:12.500> we<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:15.770> so

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
few kind of pop your bits we get so

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.200 
few kind of pop your bits we get so
first<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.160> all<00:01:17.250> gonna<00:01:17.580> pop<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.360> pathway<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.800 

strudel<00:01:24.650> put<00:01:25.650> my<00:01:25.830> hard<00:01:26.130> edged<00:01:26.400> brush<00:01:28.280> smaller

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
strudel put my hard edged brush smaller

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.540 
strudel put my hard edged brush smaller
if<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.990> go<00:01:31.170> through<00:01:31.440> that<00:01:31.620> obviously<00:01:32.100> that's

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
if I go through that obviously that's

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.740 
if I go through that obviously that's
the<00:01:32.670> wrong<00:01:32.820> way<00:01:33.030> around<00:01:34.190> so<00:01:35.190> control<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.600> get

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the wrong way around so control to get

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.730 
the wrong way around so control to get
the

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.980 

so<00:01:42.070> just<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.430> little<00:01:42.520> one<00:01:42.820> come<00:01:43.210> off

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
so just a little one come off

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.090 
so just a little one come off
don't<00:01:45.409> you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
don't you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.080 
don't you
you<00:01:47.610> know<00:01:49.370> that<00:01:50.370> depending<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.850> how<00:01:50.970> this

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
you know that depending on how this

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.640 
you know that depending on how this
turns<00:01:51.330> out<00:01:51.510> I<00:01:51.570> may<00:01:51.840> actually<00:01:51.990> changed<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
turns out I may actually changed the

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.830 
turns out I may actually changed the
position<00:01:52.800> of<00:01:53.250> my<00:01:55.100> mushrooms<00:01:56.100> here<00:01:56.550> so<00:01:57.510> I<00:01:57.540> can

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
position of my mushrooms here so I can

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.740 
position of my mushrooms here so I can
fit<00:01:58.110> around<00:01:58.260> it<00:01:58.620> nicely

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.190 

I'm<00:02:03.290> soft<00:02:03.590> open<00:02:03.890> virtue

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
I'm soft open virtue

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.430 
I'm soft open virtue
it's<00:02:05.320> gonna<00:02:05.500> be<00:02:05.680> some<00:02:05.860> general<00:02:07.200> person<00:02:08.200> around

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
it's gonna be some general person around

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.150 
it's gonna be some general person around
the<00:02:08.950> softer<00:02:09.369> brush

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.060 

I<00:02:15.000> know<00:02:15.420> if<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.540> tell<00:02:15.750> us<00:02:15.810> what<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:16.500> select

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.050 

now<00:02:23.070> I<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:24.120> looks<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.780> bit<00:02:24.810> kind<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.230> extreme

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
now I this looks a bit kind of extreme

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.950 
now I this looks a bit kind of extreme

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:14.600 

taking<00:02:54.620> those<00:02:54.769> nasty<00:02:55.370> hard<00:02:55.640> edges

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.120 

is<00:03:15.090> worth<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.570> added<00:03:15.960> bonus<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.560> effective

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
is worth the added bonus of effective

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.160 
is worth the added bonus of effective
lifting<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.760> some<00:03:18.360> of<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.510> mushrooms<00:03:18.840> up<00:03:18.990> and

I'm hopefully these squares going to be

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:30.640 

okay<00:05:25.080> so<00:05:25.139> my<00:05:25.319> rough<00:05:25.860> shape<00:05:26.099> in<00:05:27.289> we're<00:05:28.289> gonna

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.170 

apologize<00:05:31.650> it<00:05:32.189> to<00:05:32.400> get<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.699> near<00:05:32.849> thing

apologize it to get the near thing
little<00:05:33.539> painting<00:05:34.520> so<00:05:35.520> we're<00:05:35.669> headed<00:05:35.939> to<00:05:36.090> reach

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
little painting so we're headed to reach

little painting so we're headed to reach
up<00:05:36.539> higher<00:05:36.750> up<00:05:36.900> to<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.680> camera

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
up higher up to the camera

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.370 
up higher up to the camera
strikes<00:05:40.639> think<00:05:41.090> and<00:05:41.600> this<00:05:41.690> isn't<00:05:42.020> gonna<00:05:42.169> be

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
strikes think and this isn't gonna be

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.140 
strikes think and this isn't gonna be
too<00:05:42.410> arduous<00:05:42.830> so<00:05:43.490> we're<00:05:43.610> just<00:05:43.759> going<00:05:43.910> to<00:05:43.940> draw

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
too arduous so we're just going to draw

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:51.719 
too arduous so we're just going to draw
a<00:05:44.620> box<00:05:45.620> around<00:05:45.860> the<00:05:46.310> edge<00:05:48.669> now<00:05:49.669> drawing

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
a box around the edge now drawing

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.809 
a box around the edge now drawing
outside<00:05:52.729> of<00:05:53.000> the<00:05:53.150> big<00:05:53.840> bubbles<00:05:54.639> then<00:05:55.639> I'll

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
outside of the big bubbles then I'll

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:00.879 
outside of the big bubbles then I'll
select<00:05:56.030> some<00:05:57.020> geometry<00:05:57.259> underneath<00:05:57.979> it

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.730 

so<00:06:01.789> I'm<00:06:01.879> just<00:06:02.030> going<00:06:02.180> to<00:06:02.240> get<00:06:02.360> me<00:06:02.509> four<00:06:03.379> things

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
so I'm just going to get me four things

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.740 
so I'm just going to get me four things
in<00:06:03.889> there<00:06:04.099> roughly<00:06:06.460> two<00:06:07.460> looks<00:06:08.060> a<00:06:08.240> few<00:06:08.509> times

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
in there roughly two looks a few times

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.559 
in there roughly two looks a few times
and<00:06:09.080> it<00:06:09.199> speeds<00:06:10.039> it<00:06:10.400> up<00:06:12.909> and<00:06:13.909> then<00:06:14.060> let's<00:06:14.330> crush

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:14.569 
and it speeds it up and then let's crush

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.110 
and it speeds it up and then let's crush
my<00:06:14.780> subdividing

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.590 

that's<00:06:19.570> of<00:06:19.780> living<00:06:20.169> verbs<00:06:23.010> so<00:06:24.010> that's

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
that's of living verbs so that's

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.200 
that's of living verbs so that's
capturing<00:06:26.010> the<00:06:27.010> reasonable<00:06:27.460> number<00:06:28.150> of

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
capturing the reasonable number of

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.629 
capturing the reasonable number of
details<00:06:28.660> any<00:06:29.560> more<00:06:29.770> than<00:06:29.919> that<00:06:30.070> we<00:06:30.250> might<00:06:30.460> be<00:06:30.610> a

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
details any more than that we might be a

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.480 
details any more than that we might be a
bit<00:06:30.820> much<00:06:31.800> let's<00:06:32.800> just<00:06:32.979> take<00:06:33.130> a<00:06:33.190> minute<00:06:33.850> to<00:06:33.970> see

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
bit much let's just take a minute to see

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.830 
bit much let's just take a minute to see
if<00:06:36.490> you've<00:06:36.639> got<00:06:36.729> a<00:06:36.760> thousand<00:06:37.180> faces<00:06:37.360> at<00:06:37.750> the

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
if you've got a thousand faces at the

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.260 
if you've got a thousand faces at the
minute<00:06:38.110> maybe

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
minute maybe

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.380 
minute maybe
but<00:06:41.270> four<00:06:41.480> thousand<00:06:41.960> faces<00:06:43.180> you<00:06:44.180> know<00:06:44.210> it

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.390 
but four thousand faces you know it

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.330 
but four thousand faces you know it
depends<00:06:44.720> on<00:06:44.900> here<00:06:45.170> really<00:06:45.320> you<00:06:45.860> know<00:06:45.980> what<00:06:46.280> do

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
depends on here really you know what do

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.480 
depends on here really you know what do
you<00:06:46.430> don't<00:06:46.990> you<00:06:47.990> know<00:06:48.140> it's<00:06:48.320> be<00:06:48.470> super<00:06:48.860> super

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490 
you don't you know it's be super super

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.580 
you don't you know it's be super super
though<00:06:49.850> I<00:06:50.060> don't<00:06:50.240> think<00:06:50.330> four<00:06:50.630> thousand<00:06:51.080> is<00:06:51.200> to

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
though I don't think four thousand is to

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:57.070 
though I don't think four thousand is to
city<00:06:53.410> but<00:06:54.410> if<00:06:54.500> it's<00:06:54.680> if<00:06:55.610> it<00:06:55.790> was<00:06:55.910> such<00:06:56.030> right<00:06:56.300> in

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
city but if it's if it was such right in

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.830 
city but if it's if it was such right in
the<00:06:57.170> very<00:06:57.380> background<00:06:58.450> could<00:06:59.450> probably<00:06:59.630> get

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
the very background could probably get

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:11.240 
the very background could probably get
away<00:06:59.930> with<00:07:00.050> even<00:07:00.530> while<00:07:03.250> so

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:24.499 

I<00:07:12.830> should<00:07:13.830> say<00:07:16.610> that's<00:07:20.000> big<00:07:21.000> texture<00:07:23.330> up<00:07:24.330> this

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:24.509 
I should say that's big texture up this

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:31.089 
I should say that's big texture up this
mountain<00:07:25.080> too

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:31.099 

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:41.070 

not<00:07:32.099> to<00:07:32.219> leave<00:07:32.430> it<00:07:32.580> as<00:07:32.669> a<00:07:32.819> this<00:07:33.379> side

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.640 

so<00:07:42.080> let's<00:07:42.230> go<00:07:42.410> for<00:07:42.980> the<00:07:43.070> really<00:07:43.550> famous<00:07:44.650> that's

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:45.650 
so let's go for the really famous that's

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.510 
so let's go for the really famous that's
what<00:07:45.830> they<00:07:46.010> see<00:07:46.070> myself

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:57.900 

you

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:57.910 

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.970 

you
