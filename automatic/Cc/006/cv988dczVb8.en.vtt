so<00:02:12.970> we've<00:02:13.300> got<00:02:13.510> quite<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.050> ray<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:14.590> cypress<00:02:15.069> here

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
so we've got quite a ray of cypress here

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.540 
so we've got quite a ray of cypress here
it's<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.240> was<00:02:16.840> asked<00:02:17.709> that<00:02:17.920> we<00:02:18.130> get<00:02:18.310> clear

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
it's a was asked that we get clear

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.760 
it's a was asked that we get clear
Cypress<00:02:18.970> which<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.420> almost<00:02:19.569> impossible<00:02:19.870> but<00:02:20.590> I

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
Cypress which is almost impossible but I

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.170 
Cypress which is almost impossible but I
think<00:02:21.040> we<00:02:21.130> did<00:02:21.280> pretty<00:02:21.310> good<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.849> we<00:02:22.060> were

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
think we did pretty good and we were

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.260 
think we did pretty good and we were
given<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.630> allowance<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.650> knots<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.849> we<00:02:25.060> could

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
given a allowance of knots that we could

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
given a allowance of knots that we could
show<00:02:25.540> in<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.890> house<00:02:27.810> some<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.930> boards

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
show in the house some of the boards

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.990 
show in the house some of the boards
were<00:02:29.470> 12<00:02:29.830> inches<00:02:30.040> wide<00:02:30.280> which<00:02:30.550> means<00:02:30.760> old

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
were 12 inches wide which means old

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.140 
were 12 inches wide which means old
older<00:02:31.540> growth<00:02:31.780> some<00:02:32.319> were<00:02:32.470> narrow<00:02:33.030> some<00:02:34.030> of

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
older growth some were narrow some of

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.030 
older growth some were narrow some of
the<00:02:34.239> profiles<00:02:34.780> some<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.260> jams<00:02:35.530> were<00:02:35.800> three

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
the profiles some of the jams were three

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.160 
the profiles some of the jams were three
inches<00:02:36.310> thick<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:37.600> were<00:02:37.720> able<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:38.020> get

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
inches thick and we were able to get

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.870 
inches thick and we were able to get
some<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:38.620> them<00:02:38.769> that<00:02:38.950> way<00:02:39.130> some<00:02:39.519> one<00:02:39.640> had<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.850> be

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
some of them that way some one had to be

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.330 
some of them that way some one had to be
glued<00:02:40.209> up<00:02:40.620> but<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.739> hardest<00:02:42.010> part<00:02:42.250> was

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
glued up but the hardest part was

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.589 
glued up but the hardest part was
working<00:02:42.610> with<00:02:42.730> Cypress<00:02:43.120> as<00:02:43.239> any<00:02:43.390> other

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
working with Cypress as any other

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.540 
working with Cypress as any other
woodworker<00:02:44.019> would<00:02:44.170> know<00:02:44.319> is<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.370> wood

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
woodworker would know is that the wood

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.390 
woodworker would know is that the wood
is<00:02:45.700> like<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.880> sponge<00:02:46.239> it<00:02:46.660> loves<00:02:47.380> water<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:48.010> wants

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
is like a sponge it loves water it wants

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.910 
is like a sponge it loves water it wants
water<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.900> does<00:02:50.080> not<00:02:50.260> like<00:02:50.440> being<00:02:50.470> dried

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
water and it does not like being dried

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.430 
water and it does not like being dried
out<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.420> was<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.569> real<00:02:52.720> challenge<00:02:53.200> to

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
out and so it was a real challenge to

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.559 
out and so it was a real challenge to
get<00:02:53.560> flat<00:02:54.250> boards<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.910> keep<00:02:55.120> them<00:02:55.330> that<00:02:55.510> way

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
get flat boards and keep them that way

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.170 
get flat boards and keep them that way
especially<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.980> doors<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.610> jams<00:02:57.970> that

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
especially on the doors the jams that

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.199 
especially on the doors the jams that
kind<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.510> thing<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.620> Cypress<00:03:00.130> as<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.430> choice

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
kind of thing so Cypress as a choice

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.789 
kind of thing so Cypress as a choice
wood<00:03:01.480> for<00:03:01.720> this<00:03:01.840> project<00:03:02.260> was<00:03:02.440> actually<00:03:02.590> a

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
wood for this project was actually a

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.970 
wood for this project was actually a
good<00:03:03.040> choice<00:03:03.250> because<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.970> its<00:03:04.980> natural

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
good choice because of its natural

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.660 
good choice because of its natural
habitat<00:03:06.489> here<00:03:07.450> in<00:03:07.569> Florida<00:03:07.989> as<00:03:08.230> well<00:03:09.130> as<00:03:09.430> its

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
habitat here in Florida as well as its

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.479 
habitat here in Florida as well as its
bug<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.299> rot<00:03:10.480> resistance<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:12.010> Cypress

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
bug and rot resistance the Cypress

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.250 
bug and rot resistance the Cypress
actually<00:03:12.790> fits<00:03:13.030> with<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.330> rites<00:03:13.510> idea<00:03:13.900> that

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
actually fits with the rites idea that

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.350 
actually fits with the rites idea that
the<00:03:15.160> materials<00:03:15.670> for<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.880> Usonian<00:03:16.120> home

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
the materials for the Usonian home

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.420 
the materials for the Usonian home
should<00:03:16.660> be<00:03:16.750> sourced<00:03:17.109> locally<00:03:17.200> I've<00:03:17.950> had<00:03:18.190> quite

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
should be sourced locally I've had quite

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.039 
should be sourced locally I've had quite
a<00:03:18.459> few<00:03:18.609> people<00:03:18.880> ask<00:03:19.090> me<00:03:19.299> you<00:03:19.630> know<00:03:19.660> where<00:03:19.930> did

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
a few people ask me you know where did

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.479 
a few people ask me you know where did
you<00:03:20.109> buy<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.290> doors<00:03:20.560> or<00:03:20.920> where<00:03:21.130> did<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.340> buy

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
you buy the doors or where did you buy

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.460 
you buy the doors or where did you buy
the<00:03:21.549> whatever<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.359> I<00:03:22.600> have<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.959> remind<00:03:23.230> and

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
the whatever and I have to remind and

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.319 
the whatever and I have to remind and
look<00:03:23.680> it's<00:03:24.280> all<00:03:24.549> custom-made

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
look it's all custom-made

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.190 
look it's all custom-made
everything<00:03:26.320> came<00:03:26.650> from<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:27.010> rough<00:03:27.190> sawn<00:03:27.459> board

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
everything came from a rough sawn board

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.690 
everything came from a rough sawn board
so<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.260> think<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.530> most<00:03:29.680> gratifying<00:03:30.160> part<00:03:30.579> of

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
so I think the most gratifying part of

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.509 
so I think the most gratifying part of
the<00:03:30.760> whole<00:03:30.880> project<00:03:31.090> for<00:03:31.480> me<00:03:31.630> is<00:03:31.870> that<00:03:32.220> it's<00:03:33.220> a

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
the whole project for me is that it's a

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.390 
the whole project for me is that it's a
local<00:03:33.970> project<00:03:34.150> in<00:03:34.570> my<00:03:34.750> hometown<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.709> we've

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
local project in my hometown and we've

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.130 
local project in my hometown and we've
