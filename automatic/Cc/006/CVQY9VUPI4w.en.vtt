learning to be a lab technician because

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.949 
learning to be a lab technician because
that's<00:02:32.640> sort<00:02:32.819> of<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.030> low<00:02:33.180> wind<00:02:33.420> they<00:02:33.690> think

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
that's sort of the low wind they think

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.979 
that's sort of the low wind they think
but<00:02:34.860> it's<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.519> trimming<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.209> dyes<00:02:36.480> that

very important if you don't get the

very important if you don't get the
margins<00:02:39.450> correct<00:02:39.840> then<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.200> doesn't<00:02:40.500> really

margins correct then it doesn't really

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.530 
margins correct then it doesn't really

this laboratory I've been doing this for
30<00:03:05.549> years<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:07.290> feel<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.549> accuracy<00:03:09.360> and

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
30 years and I feel the the accuracy and

30 years and I feel the the accuracy and

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
the precision that we put out is really
