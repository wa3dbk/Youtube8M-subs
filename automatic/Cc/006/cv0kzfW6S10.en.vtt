00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 and this is all zuzzurelloni he has 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.839
 recovered with this new gameplay 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.330
 today I immediately start by telling you precisely 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.500

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.340
 looking at a 63 gas in flawless only 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.529
 without dying 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.600
 and then bring this gameplay back because 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.820
 they are made 63 gastric in six minutes 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.580
 I still had the minutes 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.600
 sorry 4 math is not 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.160
 an opinion 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.130
 I still have 4 minutes to do another 27 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.530
 gastric to get to 90 ma 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.050
 clearly this to the companion thickness 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.820
 soft that the projects must do but not 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.829
 I can't speak scec the player 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.410
 arrive all the time setting 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.539
 so precisely the gameplay could be 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.730
 something really exceptional but ne 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.950
 a great shit came out today 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.949
 precisely then given frost carriers 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.379
 second episodes of the richest wall has 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.399
 really a time interval too 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.449
 however elevated from the first episode 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.480
 I hope I can enjoy it anyway 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.670
 let's start right away with the first question 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.860
 at the end he puts it bertoletti manuel 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.360
 writes you say you could have one 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.280
 career court but be recognized a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.630
 worldwide pop stalking or more 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.240
 long stay a big one only in the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.790
 Italian community then we bring 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.480
 compact that 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.480
 on youtube it is not that there is not a goddess 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.370
 is that I will remain no one remains anymore 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.790
 of that much so in my opinion 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.350
 I'd rather have a short career but 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.340
 be recognized worldwide 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.470
 however we say that if to be Italian-speaking 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.670
 it's not a big thing because 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.729
 probably there if they would stay 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.910
 inactive not understanding what he says then 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:47.360
 there is a bit the negative positive side of 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:50.450
 every option lorenzo fi does not believe us there 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.670

 I hope I say it is so expensive 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.200
 slightly higher maintenance and precisely 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.810

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.910
 like children in the mental sense 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.770
 then we say that we are on another 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.810
 but on the other hand if it means children 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.580

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.050
 something to learn from the videos I bring 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.640
 I can have the 2,500 members of 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.340
