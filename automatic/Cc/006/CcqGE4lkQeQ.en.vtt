why<00:00:02.190> should<00:00:02.460> we<00:00:02.580> care<00:00:02.790> about<00:00:02.850> shots

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:05.360 
why should we care about shots

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.960 
why should we care about shots
sharks<00:00:06.200> have<00:00:06.350> been<00:00:06.410> in<00:00:06.680> our<00:00:06.799> oceans<00:00:07.220> for<00:00:07.520> over

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
sharks have been in our oceans for over

sharks have been in our oceans for over
400<00:00:08.719> million<00:00:09.050> years<00:00:09.559> and<00:00:10.190> during<00:00:10.490> that<00:00:10.639> time

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
400 million years and during that time

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.970 
400 million years and during that time
they've<00:00:11.389> survived<00:00:11.750> five<00:00:12.080> major<00:00:12.590> mass

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
they've survived five major mass

they faced threats to their survival

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.400 
they faced threats to their survival
like<00:00:18.080> they<00:00:18.230> do<00:00:18.410> today<00:00:18.939> in<00:00:19.939> fact<00:00:20.410> scientists

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
like they do today in fact scientists

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.950 
like they do today in fact scientists
estimate<00:00:21.560> that<00:00:21.949> an<00:00:22.460> average<00:00:22.670> of<00:00:23.000> 100<00:00:23.660> million

naturally<00:00:30.439> recover<00:00:31.360> so<00:00:32.360> why<00:00:32.570> is<00:00:32.629> this

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
naturally recover so why is this

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.380 
naturally recover so why is this
happening

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390
