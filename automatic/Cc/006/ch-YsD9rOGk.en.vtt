half 2 inch and a quarter adapter but as
you<00:00:26.099> can<00:00:26.250> see<00:00:27.529> I've<00:00:28.529> ground<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.429> edges<00:00:29.849> off<00:00:30.090> so

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
you can see I've ground the edges off so

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.389 
you can see I've ground the edges off so
these<00:00:31.140> two<00:00:31.320> are<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.500> same<00:00:31.590> basically<00:00:32.279> without

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
these two are the same basically without

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.799 
these two are the same basically without
this<00:00:32.790> okay<00:00:33.690> let's<00:00:34.290> see<00:00:34.440> why<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.739> minute<00:00:35.809> this

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
this okay let's see why in a minute this

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.840 
this okay let's see why in a minute this
is<00:00:36.989> an<00:00:37.140> inch<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.500> quarter<00:00:37.680> piece<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.670> pipe

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
is an inch and a quarter piece of pipe

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.470 
is an inch and a quarter piece of pipe
with<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> bevel<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.460> inside<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.300> not

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
with a bevel on it on the inside to not

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.040 
with a bevel on it on the inside to not
be<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> lot<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.230> enough<00:00:44.629> for<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.809> ping-pong

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
be a lot just enough for the ping-pong

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.200 
be a lot just enough for the ping-pong
ball<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:47.039> seat<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.700> that's<00:00:47.850> what's<00:00:48.030> going

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
ball to seat in it that's what's going

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.750 
ball to seat in it that's what's going
to<00:00:48.239> seal<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.539> okay<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> would<00:00:50.280> cut<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> bevel

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
to seal it okay so I would cut a bevel

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.549 
to seal it okay so I would cut a bevel
in<00:00:50.969> there<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.180> don't<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.379> but

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
in there you don't have to do that but

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.420 
in there you don't have to do that but
it's<00:00:52.680> going<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> make<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.980> little<00:00:53.160> bit<00:00:53.309> better

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
it's going to make a little bit better

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.080 
it's going to make a little bit better
seal<00:00:53.760> if<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.410> now<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
seal if you do now this and this is the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.180 
seal if you do now this and this is the
same<00:00:57.300> thing<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.320> 2<00:00:58.500> inch<00:00:58.649> 2<00:00:58.829> inch<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.129> 1/2

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
same thing this is 2 inch 2 inch and 1/2

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.060 
same thing this is 2 inch 2 inch and 1/2
again<00:00:59.760> now<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:01.140> 2<00:01:01.289> inches<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.739> outside

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
again now it's 2 inches on the outside

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.340 
again now it's 2 inches on the outside
here<00:01:02.309> now<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.730> 2<00:01:02.910> inch<00:01:03.350> threaded

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
here now this is a 2 inch threaded

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.440 
here now this is a 2 inch threaded
adapter<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.040> fits<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.390> ok<00:01:08.450> this

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
adapter so it fits in like that ok this

adapter so it fits in like that ok this
is<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> piece<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.020> inch<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.100> half<00:01:11.130> pipe<00:01:12.080> that

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
is a piece of inch and a half pipe that

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.620 
is a piece of inch and a half pipe that
fits<00:01:13.700> right<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.299> now<00:01:15.509> it's

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
otherwise I won't be able to get it

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.950 
otherwise I won't be able to get it
apart<00:01:46.619> now<00:01:46.970> here's<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.030> other<00:01:48.270> adapter<00:01:48.810> that

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
apart now here's that other adapter that

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.830 
apart now here's that other adapter that
I<00:01:48.990> changed<00:01:49.380> see<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.619> adapter<00:01:50.540> will<00:01:51.540> normally

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
I changed see this adapter will normally

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.910 
I changed see this adapter will normally
fit<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.470> we<00:01:52.530> got<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.799> this

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
fit like that but we got to have this

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.609 
fit like that but we got to have this
off<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.329> other<00:01:55.020> diverter

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
off of here so on the other diverter

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.340 
off of here so on the other diverter
that<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.920> showed<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.610> prior<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.570> another<00:01:57.810> video

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that I showed you prior in another video

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.740 
that I showed you prior in another video
I<00:01:58.409> actually<00:01:58.710> cut<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.340> half<00:01:59.479> that<00:02:00.479> really

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
I actually cut this in half that really

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.929 
I actually cut this in half that really
isn't<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> best<00:02:01.140> thing<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.380> do<00:02:01.640> just<00:02:02.640> grind

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
isn't the best thing to do just grind

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.240 
isn't the best thing to do just grind
the<00:02:03.090> edges<00:02:03.119> off<00:02:03.540> then<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.619> fits<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.070> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the edges off then it fits in like that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.330 
the edges off then it fits in like that
ok<00:02:06.240> then<00:02:06.840> your<00:02:06.990> quarter<00:02:07.350> inch<00:02:07.500> pipe<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.160> going

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
ok then your quarter inch pipe is going

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.650 
ok then your quarter inch pipe is going
to<00:02:08.399> go<00:02:08.520> inside<00:02:08.789> there<00:02:09.000> because<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.450> inch

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
to go inside there because this is inch

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.449 
to go inside there because this is inch
and<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> half<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.140> inch<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.830> quarter<00:02:11.039> sorry

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
and a half to inch and a quarter sorry

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.290 
and a half to inch and a quarter sorry
not<00:02:11.580> quarter<00:02:11.819> inch<00:02:11.940> but

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
not quarter inch but

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.650 
not quarter inch but
order<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:13.230> like<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:14.150> now<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.480> going<00:02:15.600> to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
order in like that now this is going to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.050 
order in like that now this is going to
fit<00:02:15.870> over<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.290> outside<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:17.060> adapter

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
fit over the outside of this adapter

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.370 
fit over the outside of this adapter
that's<00:02:18.240> all<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.480> ground<00:02:18.780> those<00:02:18.900> things<00:02:19.140> off

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
that's all you ground those things off

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.030 
that's all you ground those things off
like<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.970> goes<00:02:20.970> like<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.680> since<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
like that goes like that since this is a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.770 
like that goes like that since this is a
2<00:02:23.280> inch<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.880> 2<00:02:24.060> inch<00:02:24.210> on<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.420> outside

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
2 inch and this is 2 inch on the outside

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.860 
2 inch and this is 2 inch on the outside
it<00:02:25.290> fits<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.710> like<00:02:25.890> that

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
it fits on like that

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.990 
it fits on like that
now<00:02:27.870> this<00:02:28.050> pipe<00:02:28.320> slides<00:02:29.070> inside<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.670> there

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
now this pipe slides inside of there

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.910 
now this pipe slides inside of there
that's<00:02:30.780> that's<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.230> one<00:02:31.350> part<00:02:31.590> we're<00:02:31.800> going

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
that's that's the one part we're going

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.110 
that's that's the one part we're going
to<00:02:31.980> glue<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.520> only<00:02:32.670> part<00:02:32.910> we're<00:02:33.000> going

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
to glue it's the only part we're going

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.270 
to glue it's the only part we're going
to<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.300> now<00:02:33.960> before<00:02:34.200> we<00:02:34.440> put<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.650> together<00:02:34.830> we

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
to do now before we put this together we

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.950 
to do now before we put this together we
just<00:02:35.310> drop<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.700> ping-pong<00:02:35.850> ball<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.450> because

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
just drop the ping-pong ball you because

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.840 
just drop the ping-pong ball you because
of<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.140> pipe<00:02:37.380> in<00:02:37.590> there<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:37.920> we<00:02:38.010> had<00:02:38.190> that

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
of that pipe in there that we had that

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.850 
of that pipe in there that we had that
we<00:02:39.030> beveled<00:02:39.450> ping-pong<00:02:40.140> ball<00:02:40.350> does<00:02:40.560> not<00:02:40.590> go

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
we beveled ping-pong ball does not go

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.060 
we beveled ping-pong ball does not go
through<00:02:41.540> creates<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.630> seal<00:02:42.870> now<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:43.740> put<00:02:43.980> the

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
through creates a seal now we put the

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.680 
through creates a seal now we put the
slip<00:02:44.310> cap<00:02:44.520> on<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.790> bottom<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.180> keep<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.390> ball

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
slip cap on the bottom to keep the ball

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.470 
slip cap on the bottom to keep the ball
from<00:02:45.840> falling<00:02:46.020> out<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.680> that's<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.480> that's

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
from falling out and that's it that's

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.780 
from falling out and that's it that's
basically<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.170> part<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:50.190> diverter<00:02:50.520> that

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
basically the part of the diverter that

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.840 
basically the part of the diverter that
does<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.470> diverting<00:02:52.470> what<00:02:52.770> it<00:02:52.860> does<00:02:53.070> is<00:02:53.340> there

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
does the diverting what it does is there

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.330 
does the diverting what it does is there
be<00:02:54.030> holes<00:02:54.300> in<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.660> pipe<00:02:54.930> here<00:02:55.320> be<00:02:55.890> holes<00:02:56.100> down

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
be holes in this pipe here be holes down

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.880 
be holes in this pipe here be holes down
here<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:56.820> as<00:02:57.000> water<00:02:57.720> comes<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.110> here<00:02:58.140> just<00:02:58.470> goes

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
here so as water comes in here just goes

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.290 
here so as water comes in here just goes
in<00:02:59.040> there<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.400> fills<00:02:59.700> up<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.970> barrel

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
in there and just fills up the barrel

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.060 
in there and just fills up the barrel
when<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.600> barrel<00:03:00.870> fills<00:03:01.110> up<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.560> water<00:03:01.800> comes

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
when the barrel fills up the water comes

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.520 
when the barrel fills up the water comes
up<00:03:02.190> like<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.000> as<00:03:03.960> soon<00:03:03.990> as<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.230> reaches

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
up like this and as soon as it reaches

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.170 
up like this and as soon as it reaches
here<00:03:04.770> then<00:03:04.980> starts<00:03:05.280> inside<00:03:05.730> this<00:03:05.910> pipe

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
here then starts inside this pipe

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.790 
here then starts inside this pipe
filling<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.780> pipe<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:07.260> makes<00:03:07.680> the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
filling a pipe and that makes the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.460 
filling a pipe and that makes the
ping-pong<00:03:08.010> ball<00:03:08.460> float<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.690> floats<00:03:09.990> up<00:03:10.290> as

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
ping-pong ball float and it floats up as

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.830 
ping-pong ball float and it floats up as
the<00:03:10.860> water<00:03:11.040> fills<00:03:11.370> when<00:03:12.300> he<00:03:12.390> gets<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.690> right

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
the water fills when he gets to right

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.290 
the water fills when he gets to right
here<00:03:13.050> inside<00:03:13.410> there<00:03:13.710> it<00:03:14.010> seals<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:15.060> this

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
here inside there it seals and this

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.920 
here inside there it seals and this
fills<00:03:15.600> up<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:17.090> freshwater<00:03:18.090> flows<00:03:18.480> out<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.720> by

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
fills up and freshwater flows out and by

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.020 
fills up and freshwater flows out and by
the<00:03:18.959> time<00:03:19.050> you<00:03:19.380> filled<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.770> 55-gallon<00:03:20.310> barrel

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
the time you filled a 55-gallon barrel

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.900 
the time you filled a 55-gallon barrel
you've<00:03:21.720> washed<00:03:22.050> a<00:03:22.380> lot<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.560> rough<00:03:22.830> so<00:03:23.400> that's

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
you've washed a lot of rough so that's
