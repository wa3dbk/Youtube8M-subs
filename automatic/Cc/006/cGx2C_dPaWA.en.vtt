direct and as brief as possible so you
can<00:01:04.530> see<00:01:04.799> how<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.700> system<00:01:06.180> has<00:01:06.900> been

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
can see how the system has been

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.679 
can see how the system has been
integrated<00:01:07.710> into<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.130> head<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.150> how<00:01:09.510> it's

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
integrated into this head and how it's

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.039 
integrated into this head and how it's
warm<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.320> how<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.310> works<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> first<00:01:12.900> thing

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
warm and how it works so the first thing
