00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
WARNING: Atlantic Survival is a series' gonna teach you how to survive in the wilderness.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.940
For safety reasons, the fields are well know.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.380
Never mistake reality with fiction.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.320
Always look for all informations about the trek you intend to visit And contact the responsable angencies.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.880
Imagine a post apocalyptic world

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.240
where chaos settled

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.840
and world governments fell

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.400
A world where you relies only in your own skills to survive

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.800
A world where firearms are rarities

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.600
remaining only primitive weapons

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.200
where would you go

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.820
which weapon would you choose?

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.940
Well, I have chose the place and my weapon

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.460
And now I will show you my abilities

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.360
The hatchet is a complete tool for survival

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.480
with it you can build shelters,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.620
hunt animals

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.380
and defend yourself

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.240
BASIC THROWING

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.740
Let's start to a meter and a half away

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.020
to calculate the grip and strength

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140
Now four meters away

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.780
keep your feet apart shoulder-width

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.860
give a step back, focus on the target and throw

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.140
Thre initial rule is

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.580
right leg forward, right arm throw

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.200
Let's see in slow motion

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.860
To show it isn't luck, but technique, I'll throw it five times in a row, without turning the camera off.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.580
Let's increase the difficulty level

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.720
CROUCHED

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.600
It is the same rule to arms and legs

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.400
Again in slow motion

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.360
REFLEX

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Now the rule changes

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.840
Note the opposition of the legs to the arms

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.660
you have a few seconds to turn, look and throw

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.900
FORWARD ROLL

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.300
Let's go to the maximum difficulty level

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.240
Again, in slow motion

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.960
Remember, practice leads to perfection

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.960
