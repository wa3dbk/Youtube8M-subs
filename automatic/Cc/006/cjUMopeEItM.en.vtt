 we have to make apple cakes 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.270
 Butter 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:10.830

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:15.090

 I studied a lot yesterday then we have here 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.240
 Butter 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.780
 webÃ³ and instead of sugar lady what 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.569
 we are going to use is piloncillo is but if I 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.179
 melted and gives a delicious flavor to 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.780

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.069
 also a little bit of muscovado sugar 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.319
 exactly then we are going to add 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:50.329
 our molten piloncillo as it melts 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:52.280
 well then directly on the stove 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.440
 so 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.430
 we mix add wholemeal flour 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.430
 regular wheat flour 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.720
 already has true face of cupcakes is a 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.210
 little cake imagines is half the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.500
 recipe for a cake because nothing else will be 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.720
 the base we are going to put the powders 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.750
 delicious and magical that cinnamon is a 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.410
 little nutmeg or clove and powder 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.180
 to bake then those powders the 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.590
 let's add to the cake 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:32.690
 and do not know how it smells delicious and here 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.550
 let's add apple 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.500
 green apple we are going to remove the skin 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.680
 and this manzanita 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.819
 It has a delicious texture that will creak 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.700
 well rich at the time of how good you 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:52.420
 start doing it 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.970
 ready, check it out, we have a very good 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.480
 previously greased and floured mold 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.770
 let's add our rich mix 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.790
 true 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:07.230
 I like it 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:09.720
 you know we are going to distribute this 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.030
 mix let's put it in the oven at 350 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.680
 degrees for approximately 25 minutes 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.890
 after 25 minutes 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.530
 what we have is this result that is 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.629
 good an apple pie already 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.090
 you can eat it directly lady huh 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:30.470
 with a little side 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.640
 look here here we see the result 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.640
 so that it does not give an idea 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.030
 then now let's make the layer of 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.640
 cheese 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.190
 here we have cream cheese it 's like it's going 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.190
 making a cold cheesecake 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.640
 without baking let's add the milk 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.640
 condensed 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.300
 that what is going to give sweetness to our 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.300
 cheesecake 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.010
 add half cream 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.530
 and while we beat 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.130
 what we are going to do is to hydrate the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.560
 retina 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.280
 good to remember that it is to hydrate it in 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.370
 cold water 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.970
 by approximately 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.970
 minutes 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:35.129
 three minutes meanwhile we're going to 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.129
 add vanilla extract 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.830
 we are also going to add here is if not 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.930
 I want to make the mixer so 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.230
 can do in the blender there is no 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.410
 no problem as it is hydrated the 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.900
 Grenetina has already seen how it was hydrated 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.750
 very fast now we are going to dissolve it in 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.360
 Hot water 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.700
 this step is very important lady 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.639
 because if we do not do it, it's not going to 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.750
 rate our cake 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:07.650
 ready we have there 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.680
 we add as I say also what can 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.680
 do 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.780
 in the blender 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:21.150
 very well 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:25.340
 our base is ready now we are going to 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.740
 pour in our apple pie 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.410
 well and we're going to put it in the refrigerator 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.130
 for approximately 3 hours 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:37.400
 what is true and it is simple, it seems that 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.460
 It is very complicated but it is not clear 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.419
 I'm going to give you a piece for everyone 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.479
 and good now the last touch we are going to 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:51.110
 make caramelized apples we're going to 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:53.360
 melt butter add the apple 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.600
 that is green apple of the cidh and is 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.360
 we remove the skin 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.520
 Oh , how rich they are in fact Apples 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.540
 you can put a little aside and it's a 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.690
 wonder 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:10.550
 exactly luisito sugar so that it 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.550
 do exactly fly 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.780
 and a little bit of cinnamon 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:23.000
 the sugar muscabada or if not brown sugar 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.000
 it's brown sugar 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.890
 brown sugar and that's where you go 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.010
 English classes really want to show off 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:34.500
 the box and then let him cook 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:37.260
 about three minutes and let them cool 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.720
 completely after they get cold 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.780
