Hi, everybody. Beauty Ksu channel is with you.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.980
As always I check all recipes of beauty on myself. When you have no opportunity

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.860
to go to the master and to make a pedicure,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.889
you can make very good bath at home.

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.960
And as soon as I do it we shall know how good it is.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.870
To prepare this bath we need:

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.300
½ a glass of baking soda and grated soap - ½ of a bar.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.400
I took baby soap, as it doesn't dry skin so much.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.369
You should fill the basin with hot water, then throw soda and soap in it,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.329
mix it all and soar feet until the water is warm.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.230
But not more than 15 minutes.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.559
Then you should clean your heels with a holystone, smear any nourishing cream and that's it.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.890
Such bath softens skin of feet and heels very well,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.059
allows to get rid of cracks, calluses and corns.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.780
Also I want to tell that in order to make your heels look beautiful and smooth always -

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.829
don't cut off the skin which appears

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.940
on the heels using sharp objects and it is obligatory to grease

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.940
the heels with nutritious cream 2 times a day.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:16.360
And of course to do masks and baths.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.330
That's all, 10 minutes have passed. The water cooled down a little.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:27.370
After that I will wipe feet with a towel and I will clean them with a brush.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.060
The heels became pink, soft and smooth after this bath.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.810
Therefore I advise it everyone, don't be lazy.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.130
Such bath should be done once a week during winter time,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.400
and it is necessary to do masks and baths 2 times a week in the summer

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.110
and spring period when the heels are open and the environment influence is more negative.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.900
