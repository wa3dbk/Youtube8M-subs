00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.760
 fashion accessory glasses for the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.080
 see in the parades 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.150
 the bezel becomes a real 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.040
 fashion accessory and fashion models 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.910
 seize this phenomenon well choose 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.460
 his glasses a puzzle 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.380
 response with david benech founder of 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.630
 small durable have choose well from 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.000
 to do something new 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.550
 first of all you have to try it 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.720
 also know the image we want to give 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.070
 of self because there are two pairs of 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.980
 glasses that can go very very 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.829
 well a person and yet when we 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.160
 lets consider a shot she looks 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.860
 very very serious and very authoritarian 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.190
 and a second pair of glasses that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.990
 makes quotation marks foolish and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.700
 yet both are fine but 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.770
 the pair of glasses determines the image 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.240
 we want to give of theory 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.250
 and practice so I tested some 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.510
 glasses with tanguy the rounded square 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.920
 not easy to make a choice 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.320
 luckily david is here to guide me 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.870
 glasses a little fun already in the 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.890
 shape before the color we will take a 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.830
 pair of him put a little bit 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.430
 Butterfly a little fine for not too much 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.430
 change of face 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.340
 ahmed al different spirit we see 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.750
 clearly different 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.990
 taught the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.350
 I was in the patho mario stasi 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.060
 never 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.369
 I love it's then emmanuel's turn 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.689
 to find the perfect pair of glasses and 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.400
 it's a difficult mission 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.420
 she explains to us why before me I 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.909
 wears glasses since I'm old 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.040
 of living I often had glasses 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.119
 Rectangular resin very bad 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.310
 remember my first pair of 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.409
 glasses that was white butterfly 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.360
 so I'm pretty refractory to the world 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.770
 and we can finally I do not know what 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.920

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:16.150
 am here to value a white who 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:19.480
 you would be good there basically he 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.870
 must choose the part of m finally if she 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.870
 rests 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.140
 teva yassa champions of that one 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.830

 your face will be missing so I do not 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:44.769
