 pact may be equivalent to 10 tonnes depending on the size time 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.630
 of the animal 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.840
 In Brazil, collisions involving birds and airplanes are not rare.

 statistics of the cenipa the center of investigation and prevention of 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.400
 aeronautical accidents 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.590
 show that at least 500 accidents 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.470
 are recorded per year 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.590
 for the air traffic expert who in the West represents the birds 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.910
 a period unites all airports in the world 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.820
 our most dangerous urubu 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.450
 does not weigh so much that a pound and a half - can reach 2 3 the clash between the middle 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.660
 almost 10 tonnes depending on the speed 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.770
 take-off is a time when more occur in countries of origin 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.460
 the visit and airplanes most of the time are precisely just materials 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.340
 the african team 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.660
 the majority 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.399
 these images show 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.749
 birds being sucked by the turbine the plane was still near the ground when 

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:17.890
 the first explosion occurs 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.320
 soon after the takeoff the fire in the turbine if the stability of the airplane but 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.460
 the pilot was able to return to the airport in July 2007 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.190
 an accident in the interior of sÃ£o paulo almost provoked a tragedy 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.390
 the vulture struck an airplane that was 200 miles per hour and

 hit the pilot's face in full he fainted for a few moments but 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.750
 was able to recover and land the aircraft the impact equivalent to a 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.840
 tonne left the pilot refused 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.430
 Another collision with the AVIC placed passengers at risk of a flight from the

 rio de janeiro to belem in par 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.130
 everything very mature minister wants to give at the moment the airplane was preparing 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.000
 to take off one of the ways to reduce accidents 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.090
 in avoiding the concentration of garbage in places near landings slopes and 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.279
 take-off 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.890
 mainly in Deraa is preventive and has q

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.719
 as is the case of fascism 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.439
 the credential selection lost by 3 to 1
