00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.670
 hi people thanks for turning on 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.069
 I already have that in a video 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.140
 attitude I have already shown you 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.269
 a complete review delivered a 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.790
 benchmark comparison made towards features 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.250
 and tricks and an unboxing to google 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.010
 nexus 5 in this video want us something 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.360
 look at another as though reached 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.940
 the developer option 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.560
 These are a little bit from the beginning 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.939
 hidden and not really easy 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.130
 reached I want to tell you but 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.080
 really show because there is a whole 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.260
 interesting feature now it starts 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.390
 I wish you much fun on the left 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.800
 side you will find the system settings 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.540
 as they normally do 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.090
 look and also on the google nexus 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.070
 five delivery conditions look like her 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.360
 Look to the right, we have developers 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.920
 options we find on the left 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.780
 not here you can but here 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.750
 relatively easy to activate 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.520
 He goes over the tablet and then 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.379
 if you find the build number below 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.480
 I now click on it appears 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.160
 I know the third time down here 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.780
 the message in three steps are the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.640
 developer I'll click on it again 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.639
 is there in two steps in one 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.079
 Step by step and now I'm developing something 

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:09.630
 Exactly means that I'll go again 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:11.399
 a piece out and then you will find 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.259
 here the developer option like that 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.549
 works is exactly the same way 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.109
 and wise synonymous with google nexus 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.759
 what can we swim there now 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.039
 Let's have a look 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.619
 So let's just start the 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.079
 Developer options are natural 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.849
 in the settings then at the bottom 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.590
 Developer options and now look 

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:30.749
 Let's see what they can do 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.789
 because there are many points of course 

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:34.950
 the whole thing for developers 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.659
 That's why it's the same 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.700
 hidden but we can still 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.789
 look what we find here you can 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.840
 the read ok desktop backup password 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.729
 we can invest 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.829
 all active can that is the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.899
 display always stays with the loading 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.909
 online I say that's it 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.189
 will never be put into hibernation 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.799
 We can fix the running time 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.679
 then choose between albig and art 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.389
 are possibilities to the battery-term 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.819
 I'll say more to extend or 

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:05.459
 less accurate is the impact I can 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.719
 do not call you there to test that 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.939
 is really very much for me now 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.709
 hard I say this just once so make it 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:13.500
 then just understand exactly 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.270
 bluetooth has prof 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.800
 the whole thing is already sighted 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.180
 really to developers who know exactly 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.980
 what it is about 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.720
 I can not tell you much about that 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.310
 I did not develop with hat but it 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.860
 There are just a lot of people around 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.540
 want to know what's going on and that 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.970
 the only exciting thing I find is 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.010
 this point below always indicating where 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.750
 you're behind and exactly 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.430
 I wanted to show you that because I have 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.810
 I've already seen that in other video 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.330
 many people are interested in it 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.660
 that's why this video in which I 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.220
 again want to go into much details 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.040
 Now just puts so all the points 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.959
 you find there I think we explain 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.340
 then it can also be up here by itself 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.050
 By the way, we are the developer option 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.150
 turn individual on and off again 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.920
 that is, if you have to call the menu 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.770
 they are not automatic too 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.650
 Enabled to leave wrong locations 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.600
 debugging app set wireless 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.120
 transmission and now you see the point 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.070
 Show touches that means where I am 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.320
 my finger rear axle is exactly 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.870
 this point she turned her 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.880
 he can not turn it on and on 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.010
 is back there you will find then 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.380
 also the pointer option overlay with 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.480
 current data will be packed then so 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.510
 she could also track a trail 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.280
 confess yes and above will be exactly 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.970
 the values ​​was spent in mine 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.620
 finger is straight then you can me 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.080
 do not know what you can do with it 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.220
 but you see that works on everyone 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.400
 case surfaces update layout 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.799
 borders rtl layout enforce scale 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.730
 window animation how is there the 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.340
 animation were not at 210 times 05 times 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.049
 can you be anything here 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.540
 secondary displays simulate gpu 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.320
 force rendering and a lot more 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.880
 more lets you get these points through you 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.440
 can activate them individually or 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.150
 disable partially and if you the 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.160
 then read off I'll do it all 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.790
 slower then you see some 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.110
 developer option all possible I am 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.900
 you know she's really feeling really good 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.519
 very detailed but it is easy 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.049
 People are unbelievable for that 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.320
 interested and also that should 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.060
 shown naturally 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.590
 makes from here can then's it 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.490
 already with this video these are the 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.650
 Developer option 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.000
 Now you know how to get her about them 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.530
 how to turn them on and off and how 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.510
 this little point down here 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.890
 somehow he gets a nice one 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.140
 bauble is it works of course 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.680
 not only menu but also here 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.080
 any home screens or 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.190
 well somewhere in every application the 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.140
 you have now as a profit 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.190
 thank you very much for your help 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.190
 time is good
