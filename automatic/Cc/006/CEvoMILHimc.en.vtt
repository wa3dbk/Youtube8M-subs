00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
is just kind of some of my initial

but I figured I may as well just use the

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.670 
but I figured I may as well just use the
crap<00:01:03.909> out<00:01:04.150> of<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.390> before<00:01:04.540> i<00:01:04.869> unlock<00:01:05.409> hidden

vibration as its charging up which is a
little<00:01:29.170> bit<00:01:29.380> peculiar<00:01:30.030> now<00:01:31.030> it<00:01:31.180> doesn't<00:01:31.540> do
