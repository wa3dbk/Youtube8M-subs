00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:04.719
 at 1 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.149
 relative 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.310
 during previous broadcasts 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.050
 I told you that the goal is double the goal the rampart to the pyramidal bugle 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.060
 been a band that I knew but did not know if they 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.070
 were edible or not 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.180
 a slight effect of research 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.590
 and bluetooth 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.530
 he signs rampant buffalo 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.280
 and edible 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.280
 it can be eat in salad 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.590
 this plant mickey club is good it is well known what there is no 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.620
 doubt the most beautiful effect 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.230
 credit is king but it's very bitter 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.830
 so it's already reserved for people who are used to eating 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.880
 wild plants 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.160
 because sometimes it could be for someone who does not have the 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.240
 mouth that is done so far two ends it could be very 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.800
 but the bug 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.800
 and edible 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.020
 and to use the words of a grandpa I knew 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.120
 all that is bitter and why 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.310
 finally I do not know if it's true finally generally ancient cited plants 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.060
 bitter are good for times 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.080
 so we guess and that the goal but why good 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.080
 always is it if it is edible 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.290
 Yes 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.410
 traorÃ© 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.360
 then 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.630
 absolutely not edible 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.370
 the magnificent ones 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.680
 columbine 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.450
 we use a target 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.450
 many colors even in the wild the safest 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.429
 the difficulty 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.199
 2010the site 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:20.949
 the chopper 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:24.229
 for the weed fanatics 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:25.639
 you see that 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.639
 you have no shame 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.129
 we have a fleet 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.989
 from the clover family 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.689
 inherent dangers the real name 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.279
 I will not say anything 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.119
 but it's like estimated 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:51.390
 excellent we made the choice of white clover 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.390
 mountain but I'm at apax and not far either 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.859
 and really very good 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.229
 leaf 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.009
 and edible is no problem 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:05.699
 it's a little stiff 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.699
 really merchant 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.239
 so she a grass 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.239
 to order now 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.699
 we do not see very often 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:24.349
 the no bird 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.349
 gold apparently no bird does not support fertilizer 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:32.149
 so when you put two years in a meadow but the oseo bread trend 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:34.269
 to disappear 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.319
 sipa in the air nature 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.759
 and he's still here 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.089
 it's very very pretty 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:44.019
 and when I was little giant and eating raw vegetables 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.019
 at the level more head it must be said that it is not terrible 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:50.350
 she the well conducted stygia scholarship 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.969
 the fact that these calls a day day 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.969
 mel I took myself for a euro or what 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:57.739
 on the decline 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.479
 that the old at home recalls the mud 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.559
 antler wood has a reputation for being 

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:05.909
 very very strong 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.909
 of the family he is signed d 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.729
 and acacias 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:17.389
 gold edible doped acacia flower the pool fleet annoy them too 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.590
 but there toxic 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.590
 the laburnum 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:30.999
 so usually it's shrubs 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.240
 relatively skinny 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.129
 like the one who will appropriate 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:38.879
 and compared to a world unfortunately for palestine is not 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.539
 what it is not easily accessible 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.520
 but arriving in the bay of sum 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.909
 which is really rare 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.069
 and it's an art that likes to push in the snow in the pebble 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:50.389
 or more mountains 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.389
 earlier in rocky places 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.469
 shortly before 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:05.039
 luck because we have the martagon lily more than a protected plant 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.439
 it seems that the blow 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.499
 hubert that the talent of the onion 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:14.770
 and edible 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.770
 no three as if they were not we will not eat the protected plants 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.010
 look at him so he wrote pests 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.759
 a charming critter who is nibbling 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.370
 look it's a little bit ate the haye 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.300
 someone else in the family 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.300
 look 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:40.999
 wodiÃ© disappointed 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.379
 firefighters you see what these say no 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:47.379
 to rub the artois 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.639
 baptized their croteau cissed the amf 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.389
 it's not saying too much 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.869
 lang with and tears 

00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:59.479
 nico scopic 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.479
 not microscopic but really tiny 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:08.659
 crate beth she is very beautiful 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:19.130
 a nice chin feast 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.660
 now a private plant an animal more the image of plants than men 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.270
 have caused
