hole<00:01:35.479> in<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.659> top<00:01:37.310> earlier<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.490> actually<00:01:39.030> cut

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
hole in the top earlier on actually cut

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.719 
hole in the top earlier on actually cut
an<00:01:39.479> extra<00:01:39.720> box<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> had<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.340> optional

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
an extra box that I had this is optional

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.330 
an extra box that I had this is optional
of<00:01:41.790> course<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.930> then<00:01:43.439> becomes<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
of course for that then becomes the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.429 
of course for that then becomes the
spoiler<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.479> put<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> spoiler<00:01:46.229> on

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
spoiler so you can put the spoiler on

something<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.640> little<00:01:50.850> bit<00:01:50.970> different<00:01:51.360> now

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
something a little bit different now

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.039 
something a little bit different now
grab<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.009> lids<00:01:53.579> these<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.630> be<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> wheel

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
grab the lids these can be the wheel

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.450 
grab the lids these can be the wheel
what<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.500> do<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:56.119> push<00:01:57.119> those<00:01:57.420> all<00:01:57.780> out<00:01:58.460> little

what I do is push those all out little

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.289 
what I do is push those all out little
triangles<00:01:59.759> there<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> straw<00:02:01.049> can<00:02:01.259> fit<00:02:01.500> him

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
triangles there so the straw can fit him

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.310 
triangles there so the straw can fit him
easy

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.639 

okay<00:02:06.280> so<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.580> put<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:06.910> two<00:02:07.150> smaller<00:02:07.510> wheels<00:02:08.290> on

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.670 
okay so I put the two smaller wheels on
the<00:02:08.830> top<00:02:09.330> again<00:02:10.330> get<00:02:10.600> some<00:02:10.750> more<00:02:10.960> sticky<00:02:11.380> tape

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
the top again get some more sticky tape

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.070 
the top again get some more sticky tape
and<00:02:12.690> just<00:02:13.690> wrap<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.410> around<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:15.840> probably<00:02:16.840> got<00:02:17.020> a

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
and just wrap it around I probably got a

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.860 
and just wrap it around I probably got a
little<00:02:17.200> bit<00:02:17.410> too<00:02:18.000> much<00:02:19.000> but<00:02:19.330> anyway<00:02:19.690> that's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
little bit too much but anyway that's

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.230 
little bit too much but anyway that's

in<00:02:22.360> place<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.630> bit<00:02:22.960> better<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.850> do<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.030> same

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
in place a bit better and do the same

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:35.910 
in place a bit better and do the same
with<00:02:25.510> each<00:02:25.690> side<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.290> can<00:02:35.410> see<00:02:35.560> there<00:02:35.800> the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
with each side as you can see there the
