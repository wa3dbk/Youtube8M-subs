00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.170 
I'm expecting my profits to a 10% move
on<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> stock<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.960> yield<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.520> 100%<00:01:32.520> return<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.909> my

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
on a stock can yield a 100% return on my

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.539 
on a stock can yield a 100% return on my
option<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:34.590> happen<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.159> two<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.520> three

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
option that can happen in two or three

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.850 
option that can happen in two or three
weeks<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.090> time<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:37.079> that's<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.470> case<00:01:37.680> I

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
weeks of time and if that's the case I

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.710 
weeks of time and if that's the case I
monitor<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> market<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.180> very<00:01:39.210> small

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
monitor the market in a very small

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.440 
monitor the market in a very small
amount<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.110> time<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:41.159> also<00:01:41.310> capture<00:01:41.670> more

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
amount of time I can also capture more

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.929 
amount of time I can also capture more
moves<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.560> smaller<00:01:43.950> moves<00:01:44.220> rather<00:01:44.430> more

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
moves or smaller moves rather more

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.990 
moves or smaller moves rather more
frequently<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:47.189> person<00:01:47.759> would

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
frequently and so that person would

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.609 
frequently and so that person would
probably<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.840> monitor<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.320> market

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
probably have to monitor the market

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.289 
probably have to monitor the market
maybe<00:01:49.710> an<00:01:49.860> hour<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> half<00:01:50.520> no<00:01:50.970> more<00:01:51.149> than

maybe an hour and a half no more than

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.730 
maybe an hour and a half no more than
two<00:01:51.450> hours<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> evening<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.530> you're

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
following the market more than an hour

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
half to two hours you're watching it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.929 
half to two hours you're watching it

the<00:04:19.919> reality<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.640> that<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:21.390> know<00:04:21.510> their

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
the reality is that you know their

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.810 
the reality is that you know their

are going up there are some that are
going<00:04:25.470> down<00:04:25.680> so<00:04:26.039> we<00:04:26.460> don't<00:04:26.669> really<00:04:26.849> use

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
going down so we don't really use

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.260 
going down so we don't really use

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069 
that's just the way it works so we don't
