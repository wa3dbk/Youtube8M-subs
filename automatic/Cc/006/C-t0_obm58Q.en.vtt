00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:20.090
 I think what is r person n in the designer branch 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:25.340
 r 1 is the first year 1998 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.680
 That I mean Ta' made is that dna in time when that appeared to 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.830
 that 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:34.410
 A poor nose screen 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:42.300
 It is one big point of the heart that is rising afterward 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:43.590
 Sometimes in Well rest is of its most characteristic became a multi with director making progress technology 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.120
 Came for the first time 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.120
 About that 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.980
 I think this is the point that will be the first eye catch How about this 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:59.989
 Do we inherited in that various models 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:04.460
 Because that was done in that Sendai too, let's achieve with a different expression 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.620
 I wonder if Well various designers to Fu that it has created a version of a variety of successive 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.070
 I think but 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.980
 say r has changed from the days of zr 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:21.030
 It was a very big thing called the generation change of maa . 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:25.170
 Well there first f set, but at that time or rather that racer replica 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.300
 Ikuka and how much to having to racing machine that was running at the circuit 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:33.080
 Even though I think the kana was Well one of the propositions of Tteyuu is 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:37.160
 But on long public roads it is long distance movement etc 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.110
 Not yet expired missing from want Toka Well that production in the bullet in the right kind of meaning 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:45.500
 I think there was a part 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.780
 However, there are some rules that you must follow when you say that the action runs 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.290
 I think the part is not good 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.630
 Next r 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.390
 Is it 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:02:01.700
 I think the enthusiasm was different The lightweight slim that r 1 made up 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.869
 Compact It's a new kind of winding road vegetarian with concentration of trout 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.880
 Good concept 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.890
 I think that I brought the shape atmosphere to yamaha, but the concept is 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:17.660
 I wonder if it changes 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:22.310
 It focused on the moment Well of one corner of the corner from various stage shigin 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.310
 I think that I thought that the designer at that time had to be in such a form 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.370
 right 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:33.099
 I think that I wonder if it is connected to the now of that form 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:39.040
 So'm very courageous to say the concept waving at once action from that era racer 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:40.900
 I say designers another great way be considered by you it is by it such a point of view, such that say 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.040
 Jump by 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.390
 Empathy is the hit because I think Fu that kana not you do If you do not it anymore 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.640
 Because we can do it together 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.640
 r 1 I think it might be possible 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.250
 And moody fine fine style me
