00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.290
 hi, this genre is the major 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.629
 novice photographer choose show 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.059
 wedding portfolio hall month of the big 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.340
 came to an end I promised to show how 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.370
 this is how flowers are made 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.440
 I used them as decoration for 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.140
 on this site you can post a day 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.220
 We there initially wanted to sheep 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.320
 make them a bridal bouquet but not 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.590
 a bouquet turned out something 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.090
 other use as decoration 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.730
 just recently learned how to 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.520
 doing it is done very easily in order 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.649
 to make such twigs here look 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.219
 we need her closer like this 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.610
 here are the twigs 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:48.360
 thread and scissors and here is such a paper 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.629
 she is called strong she is so 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:57.629
 thin and a little bit of the ball that we do 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:00.510
 we cut off a strip of about 6 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.969
 centimeters and about 6 cm long 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.720
 no we cut off a whole strip and 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:16.710
 then cut into small pieces 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:19.729
 a strip width of 6 cm is such a strip 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:27.799
 we cut it approximately here on such here 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.799
 a length of 6 cm in length may be from seven 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.030
 we get such rectangles 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.780
 what we do next we add up 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.610
 in half then again in half and then 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.960
 we take a little corner and that's because they are a little bit 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:50.159
 we crush for this little corner and we crush 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.770
 need to do so that it is a little bit 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.460
 fluffed up and was so creative 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.140
 a mess 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.570
 little flower creative mess we have 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.009
 it turns out such a strange thing and then 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.009
 we take our twig 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:14.010
 and dress this little corner of a twig 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.019
 dress approximately centimeter or floor 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:23.190
 centimeter but she is rather one 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:24.269
 centimeter for you pyramid and somewhere on 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:31.129
 half a centimeter 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:31.129
 them between the handle on the tip of such a twig 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.420
 Mickey is desirable to use 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.360
 some set like a twig 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.069
 so that they do not stand out from the general 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.069
 any brown green 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.240
 navat you do not regret a lot because 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.560
 to 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.560
 to be reliable 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.990
 when awarded as needed 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.990
 tying up 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.200
 owe 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.260
 It turns out that such a flower can be 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:43.690
 fluff do a little more 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:47.540
 thicker disclosure can also be wet 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.430
 end of the glue pva slightly dipped but 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.010
 do not overdo it because in one 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.920
 place and make too much strong 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.260
 the paper is very delicate and he is just all 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.480
 the flower fell apart and the same we 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.450
 do all the tips that are 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:07.849
 coins we worked a little 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.890
 we get here such chain how to do 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.599
 tiptoe 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.430
 the master class was completed and you were with him 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.810
 the novice photographer himself, Jeanne Major 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.810
