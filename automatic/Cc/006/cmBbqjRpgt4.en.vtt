hey what's going on everybody so and

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.600 
hey what's going on everybody so and
this<00:00:16.660> video<00:00:16.990> we<00:00:17.290> are<00:00:17.320> doing<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:17.770> materialist

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
this video we are doing the materialist

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.910 
this video we are doing the materialist
range<00:00:18.880> at<00:00:19.210> the<00:00:19.270> speaker<00:00:19.810> and<00:00:20.170> pretty<00:00:20.890> much

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
range at the speaker and pretty much

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.859 
range at the speaker and pretty much
what<00:00:21.310> you<00:00:21.400> do<00:00:21.580> is<00:00:21.640> you<00:00:21.880> turn<00:00:22.090> ascendant<00:00:22.810> shards

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
what you do is you turn ascendant shards

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.040 
what you do is you turn ascendant shards
in<00:00:23.529> two<00:00:23.740> modes<00:00:23.950> of<00:00:24.160> light<00:00:24.430> to<00:00:25.090> senate<00:00:25.689> shorts

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
in two modes of light to senate shorts

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.780 
in two modes of light to senate shorts
as<00:00:26.200> one<00:00:26.439> mode<00:00:26.619> of<00:00:26.650> light<00:00:26.920> and<00:00:27.130> then<00:00:27.400> you<00:00:27.610> could

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
as one mode of light and then you could

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.390 
as one mode of light and then you could
turn<00:00:28.000> your<00:00:28.360> ascendant<00:00:28.750> energy<00:00:29.320> into<00:00:30.160> a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
turn your ascendant energy into a

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.790 
turn your ascendant energy into a
sending<00:00:30.820> shards<00:00:31.090> and<00:00:31.510> then<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.110> shards<00:00:32.500> into

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
sending shards and then the shards into

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.430 
sending shards and then the shards into
the<00:00:32.890> motive<00:00:33.190> light<00:00:33.370> and<00:00:33.670> then<00:00:34.449> you<00:00:35.020> just<00:00:35.260> get

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
the motive light and then you just get

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.610 
the motive light and then you just get
tons<00:00:35.920> and<00:00:36.340> tons<00:00:36.730> of<00:00:37.150> Mo<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.780> light<00:00:37.989> it<00:00:38.260> felt

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
tons and tons of Mo to light it felt

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.439 
tons and tons of Mo to light it felt
like<00:00:38.830> my<00:00:38.860> birthday<00:00:39.220> while<00:00:39.610> doing<00:00:39.910> this<00:00:40.150> I'll

gosh it's so yummy I just Isle of Mull

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.460 
gosh it's so yummy I just Isle of Mull
to<00:00:49.420> light<00:00:49.629> their<00:00:49.809> probably<00:00:50.229> one<00:00:50.350> of<00:00:50.379> my

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
to light their probably one of my

them<00:01:01.150> how<00:01:01.330> great<00:01:01.570> is<00:01:01.870> that<00:01:01.900> and<00:01:02.290> then<00:01:02.379> I<00:01:02.500> mean

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
them how great is that and then I mean

them how great is that and then I mean
you<00:01:02.799> can<00:01:02.949> do<00:01:03.040> material<00:01:03.850> exchange<00:01:04.180> with<00:01:04.390> rating

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
you can do material exchange with rating

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.350 
you can do material exchange with rating
char's<00:01:05.680> I'm<00:01:05.950> sure<00:01:06.130> radiant<00:01:06.580> shard<00:01:06.820> goes<00:01:07.030> into

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
char's I'm sure radiant shard goes into

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.020 
char's I'm sure radiant shard goes into
multiplied<00:01:07.870> as<00:01:08.020> well<00:01:08.260> maybe<00:01:08.950> one<00:01:09.340> shard<00:01:09.760> to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
multiplied as well maybe one shard to

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.660 
multiplied as well maybe one shard to
motor<00:01:10.510> life<00:01:10.690> radiant<00:01:11.260> then<00:01:11.500> writing<00:01:11.920> energy

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
motor life radiant then writing energy

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.810 
motor life radiant then writing energy
to<00:01:13.570> writing<00:01:14.560> shards<00:01:15.010> kind<00:01:15.340> of<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.520> same<00:01:15.760> thing

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
to writing shards kind of the same thing

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.670 
to writing shards kind of the same thing
here<00:01:16.479> and<00:01:16.720> then<00:01:16.840> I<00:01:16.930> know<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.200> can<00:01:17.350> do<00:01:17.440> strange

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
here and then I know you can do strange

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.960 
here and then I know you can do strange
coins<00:01:18.160> into<00:01:19.950> multiply<00:01:20.950> that's<00:01:21.400> too<00:01:21.640> strange

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
coins into multiply that's too strange

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.850 
coins into multiply that's too strange
coins<00:01:22.210> for<00:01:22.540> my<00:01:22.660> white<00:01:22.930> but<00:01:23.260> I'm<00:01:23.410> keeping<00:01:23.590> my

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
coins for my white but I'm keeping my

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.620 
coins for my white but I'm keeping my
strange<00:01:24.160> coins<00:01:24.430> because<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:24.820> might<00:01:25.360> want<00:01:25.540> to

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
strange coins because I might want to

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.330 
strange coins because I might want to
buy<00:01:25.780> some<00:01:25.990> weapon<00:01:26.350> dunno<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:26.740> probably<00:01:27.010> could

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
buy some weapon dunno I probably could

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.600 
buy some weapon dunno I probably could
put<00:01:28.060> some<00:01:28.360> of<00:01:28.480> those<00:01:28.600> in<00:01:28.870> to<00:01:29.550> multiply<00:01:30.550> it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
put some of those in to multiply it

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.490 
put some of those in to multiply it
because<00:01:30.790> I<00:01:30.880> don't<00:01:31.060> need<00:01:31.150> like<00:01:31.510> 200<00:01:31.780> and<00:01:32.380> have

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
because I don't need like 200 and have

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.830 
because I don't need like 200 and have
like<00:01:32.650> 200<00:01:33.160> or<00:01:33.220> 300<00:01:33.460> strange<00:01:34.030> coins<00:01:34.270> which<00:01:34.660> is<00:01:34.810> a

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
like 200 or 300 strange coins which is a

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.050 
like 200 or 300 strange coins which is a
solid<00:01:35.530> amount<00:01:35.620> I<00:01:36.040> mean<00:01:36.490> there's<00:01:36.640> only<00:01:36.730> one

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
solid amount I mean there's only one

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.210 
solid amount I mean there's only one
weapon<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.480> week<00:01:37.660> so<00:01:37.840> as<00:01:37.960> long<00:01:38.050> as<00:01:38.110> i<00:01:38.290> have<00:01:38.320> like

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
weapon a week so as long as i have like

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.390 
weapon a week so as long as i have like
17<00:01:39.880> most<00:01:40.570> of<00:01:40.660> light<00:01:40.840> going<00:01:41.500> into<00:01:41.830> Thursday

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
17 most of light going into Thursday

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.770 
17 most of light going into Thursday
then<00:01:42.670> I'm<00:01:42.790> showing<00:01:43.120> because<00:01:43.330> I<00:01:43.390> only<00:01:43.510> really

I only did my ascendant materials my

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.400 
I only did my ascendant materials my
head<00:01:49.630> around<00:01:49.870> 300<00:01:50.680> in<00:01:51.280> like<00:01:51.850> 50<00:01:52.330> each<00:01:52.720> give<00:01:53.380> or

take like 20 so right now I'm just
spending<00:01:56.920> 50<00:01:57.400> glimmer<00:01:57.670> per<00:01:58.090> transfer<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:59.140> I

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
spending 50 glimmer per transfer and I

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.290 
spending 50 glimmer per transfer and I
started<00:01:59.650> out<00:01:59.770> with<00:01:59.890> tooth<00:02:00.280> out<00:02:00.700> twenty-five

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
started out with tooth out twenty-five

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.540 
started out with tooth out twenty-five
thousand<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.050> it<00:02:02.440> brings<00:02:02.590> me<00:02:02.830> down<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:03.280> about

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550
