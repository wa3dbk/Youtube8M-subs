with the circle right well team

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.170 
with the circle right well team
deathmatch<00:00:22.710> looking<00:00:23.400> at<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.550> mini-map<00:00:23.880> right

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
deathmatch looking at the mini-map right

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.640 
deathmatch looking at the mini-map right
now<00:00:24.330> it's<00:00:24.600> important<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.109> spread<00:00:25.320> out<00:00:25.529> from

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
now it's important to spread out from

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.230 
now it's important to spread out from
your<00:00:25.800> teammates<00:00:26.189> because<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.670> don't<00:00:27.000> want<00:00:27.060> to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
your teammates because you don't want to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.670 
your teammates because you don't want to
get<00:00:27.330> danger<00:00:27.660> close<00:00:27.869> especially<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> map

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
get danger close especially in a map

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.800 
get danger close especially in a map
like<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> spread<00:00:30.090> out<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.269> think<00:00:30.480> about

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
like this so I spread out I think about

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.569 
like this so I spread out I think about
the<00:00:30.929> initial<00:00:31.289> interception<00:00:31.800> point<00:00:31.980> because

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the initial interception point because

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.580 
the initial interception point because
racking<00:00:33.239> up<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.510> killstreaks<00:00:33.960> initially<00:00:34.410> is

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
racking up the killstreaks initially is

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.200 
racking up the killstreaks initially is
what<00:00:34.829> separates<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.340> good<00:00:35.579> team<00:00:35.850> deathmatch

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
what separates a good team deathmatch

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.069 
what separates a good team deathmatch
win<00:00:36.450> rest<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.380> our<00:00:37.469> lives<00:00:37.559> ya<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.750> ya<00:00:39.750> didn't

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
get killstreaks can turn an average

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.389 
get killstreaks can turn an average
player<00:00:42.690> into<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> great<00:00:43.469> one<00:00:43.649> we've<00:00:44.250> got

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
obviously so above the line is when

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.260 
obviously so above the line is when
you're<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.190> running<00:00:56.340> full<00:00:56.579> metal<00:00:56.789> jacket<00:00:57.120> and

you're not running full metal jacket and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.599 
you're not running full metal jacket and

you can cover those two threat areas and

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.040 
you can cover those two threat areas and
this<00:00:59.789> was<00:00:59.969> actually<00:01:00.149> from<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> subscriber

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
this was actually from a subscriber

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.830 
this was actually from a subscriber
match<00:01:01.320> where<00:01:01.620> they<00:01:01.800> requested<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.940> full<00:01:03.629> metal

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
match where they requested a full metal

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.020 
match where they requested a full metal
jacket<00:01:04.140> within<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> terminal<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.939> was

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
jacket within the terminal and that was

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.670 
jacket within the terminal and that was
just<00:01:06.180> pointing<00:01:06.299> out<00:01:06.479> some<00:01:06.659> areas<00:01:06.930> alright

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
just pointing out some areas alright

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.429 
just pointing out some areas alright
awesome<00:01:08.010> grenade<00:01:08.670> throw<00:01:08.880> by<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.090> way<00:01:09.439> yeah

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
awesome grenade throw by the way yeah

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.780 
awesome grenade throw by the way yeah
the<00:01:10.619> strafe<00:01:10.860> throw<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.130> quite<00:01:11.369> good<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.729> think

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the strafe throw is quite good I think

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.399 
the strafe throw is quite good I think
it's<00:01:12.030> some<00:01:12.180> game<00:01:12.390> coding<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.900> allows<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
it's some game coding that allows you to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.600 
it's some game coding that allows you to
do<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.740> even<00:01:13.860> though<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.130> looks<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.460> I'm

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
do it even though it looks like I'm

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.490 
do it even though it looks like I'm
going<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.909> miss<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.420> people<00:01:16.140> should<00:01:16.200> try<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
going to miss but people should try it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.620 
going to miss but people should try it
out<00:01:16.650> yeah<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.970> what<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.210> think<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.479> read

out yeah so what do you think and read
this<00:01:18.780> point<00:01:19.430> well<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.460> was<00:01:20.670> waiting<00:01:21.000> for<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
this point well I was waiting for the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.600 
this point well I was waiting for the
enemy<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.110> reload<00:01:22.680> taking<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.220> look<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
enemy to reload taking a look at the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.160 
enemy to reload taking a look at the
mini-map<00:01:24.060> seeing<00:01:24.570> where<00:01:24.689> my<00:01:24.720> teammates

mini-map seeing where my teammates
position<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.799> that's<00:01:25.950> what<00:01:26.220> made<00:01:26.759> me<00:01:26.790> realize

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
so the red circle was their potential

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.460 
so the red circle was their potential
spawn<00:02:52.180> point<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.689> the<00:02:52.780> green<00:02:52.959> circle<00:02:53.139> is

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
spawn point and the green circle is

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.589 
spawn point and the green circle is
where<00:02:53.500> our<00:02:53.709> teammates<00:02:54.400> were<00:02:54.549> so<00:02:55.060> that's<00:02:55.450> all

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
where our teammates were so that's all

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
that that allows me to work out where

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.509 
that that allows me to work out where
they<00:02:57.310> can<00:02:57.430> spawn<00:02:58.200> however<00:02:59.200> i<00:02:59.530> ended<00:03:00.430> up

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
they can spawn however i ended up

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.729 
they can spawn however i ended up
dropping<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:01.569> outside<00:03:01.959> because<00:03:02.260> that's<00:03:02.620> where

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
dropping it outside because that's where

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.710 
dropping it outside because that's where
the<00:03:02.769> red<00:03:02.980> dot<00:03:03.159> was<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:04.060> as<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.299> can<00:03:04.419> see<00:03:04.450> it

whole<00:03:07.299> team<00:03:07.569> rushes<00:03:08.049> up<00:03:08.230> where<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.739> sea<00:03:08.919> for

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
whole team rushes up where the sea for

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.399 
whole team rushes up where the sea for
they<00:03:09.400> would<00:03:09.669> actually<00:03:10.060> be<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.599> it<00:03:11.079> allows<00:03:11.260> me

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
they would actually be and it allows me

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.250 
they would actually be and it allows me
to<00:03:11.470> pick<00:03:11.590> up<00:03:11.739> for<00:03:11.950> five<00:03:12.519> or<00:03:12.549> six<00:03:12.790> kills<00:03:13.060> yep<00:03:13.780> so

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
to pick up for five or six kills yep so

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.750 
to pick up for five or six kills yep so

exact<00:03:44.169> so<00:03:44.409> so<00:03:45.400> what<00:03:45.639> i<00:03:45.669> did<00:03:45.970> on<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.120> map<00:03:46.449> was

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
exact so so what i did on that map was

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.869 
exact so so what i did on that map was
to<00:03:46.989> educate<00:03:47.290> people<00:03:47.709> how<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.340> at<00:03:48.609> least<00:03:48.760> think

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
to educate people how to at least think

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.610 
to educate people how to at least think
about<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:49.449> you<00:03:49.870> have<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:50.049> look<00:03:50.199> where<00:03:50.319> your<00:03:50.440> team

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
about it you have a look where your team

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.439 
about it you have a look where your team
are<00:03:50.829> and<00:03:51.069> you<00:03:51.459> can<00:03:51.609> come<00:03:51.849> up<00:03:51.970> with<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.180> pretty

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
are and you can come up with a pretty

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.149 
are and you can come up with a pretty
good<00:03:52.750> educated<00:03:53.139> guess<00:03:53.470> where<00:03:53.919> you're<00:03:54.040> going

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
good educated guess where you're going

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.259 
good educated guess where you're going
to<00:03:54.220> drop<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.519> if<00:03:54.639> you<00:03:54.729> don't<00:03:54.879> have<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.030> UAV

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
to drop it if you don't have a UAV

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.300 
to drop it if you don't have a UAV
available<00:03:55.930> yep<00:03:56.199> oftentimes<00:03:56.650> your<00:03:57.010> team<00:03:57.159> is

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
available yep oftentimes your team is

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.649 
available yep oftentimes your team is
going<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.519> add<00:03:57.669> half<00:03:57.879> or<00:03:58.060> two-thirds<00:03:58.209> of<00:03:58.540> the

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
going to add half or two-thirds of the

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.390 
going to add half or two-thirds of the
map<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:59.290> it<00:03:59.470> gives<00:03:59.829> you<00:03:59.919> a<00:03:59.979> good<00:04:00.159> guess

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
map and it gives you a good guess

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.920 
map and it gives you a good guess
especially<00:04:01.060> if<00:04:01.120> you<00:04:01.180> pay<00:04:01.329> attention<00:04:01.449> to<00:04:01.780> where

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
especially if you pay attention to where

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.020 
especially if you pay attention to where
you<00:04:02.049> spawn<00:04:02.260> as<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:03.310> where<00:04:03.549> this<00:04:03.669> other<00:04:03.879> guys

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
you spawn as to where this other guys

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.539 
you spawn as to where this other guys
are<00:04:04.180> going<00:04:04.329> to<00:04:04.389> come<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.599> life<00:04:05.010> right<00:04:06.010> and

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
are going to come to life right and

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
know people are running the higher

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.729 
know people are running the higher
sensitivities<00:04:10.449> like<00:04:10.659> this<00:04:10.810> seven<00:04:11.199> days<00:04:11.470> or

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
sensitivities like this seven days or

sensitivities like this seven days or
even<00:04:11.859> seeks<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:13.180> could<00:04:13.419> also<00:04:13.540> be<00:04:13.659> worthwhile

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
even seeks it could also be worthwhile

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.319 
even seeks it could also be worthwhile
to<00:04:14.139> just<00:04:14.560> jump<00:04:15.159> into<00:04:15.310> options<00:04:15.519> as<00:04:15.879> the<00:04:16.030> top<00:04:16.180> is

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
to just jump into options as the top is

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.490 
to just jump into options as the top is
being<00:04:16.509> launched<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.019> bring<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.259> back<00:04:17.289> the

being launched and bring it back the

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.050 
being launched and bring it back the
amber<00:04:17.680> three<00:04:17.919> and<00:04:18.130> they<00:04:18.759> can<00:04:18.940> actually

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
amber three and they can actually

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.909 
amber three and they can actually
improve<00:04:19.299> your<00:04:19.570> aiming<00:04:19.720> on<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.049> tropicana<00:04:20.440> so

close<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.669> becomes<00:04:34.970> a<00:04:35.120> ninja<00:04:35.479> plus<00:04:35.630> pro<00:04:35.900> I

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
close that becomes a ninja plus pro I

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.350 
close that becomes a ninja plus pro I
think<00:04:36.320> it<00:04:36.470> becomes<00:04:36.740> a<00:04:36.889> bigger<00:04:37.070> deal<00:04:37.360> yeah

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
think it becomes a bigger deal yeah

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.090 
think it becomes a bigger deal yeah
exactly<00:04:38.750> that's<00:04:39.260> a<00:04:39.470> good<00:04:39.590> point<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.040> that's

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
exactly that's a good point and that's

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.980 
exactly that's a good point and that's
that's<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.699> really<00:04:41.090> good<00:04:41.210> legitimate<00:04:41.690> reason

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
that's a really good legitimate reason

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.900 
that's a really good legitimate reason
to<00:04:42.020> use<00:04:42.199> one<00:04:42.410> man<00:04:42.560> arm<00:04:42.740> as<00:04:43.010> well<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.490> swap<00:04:43.729> out

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
to use one man arm as well to swap out

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.060 
to use one man arm as well to swap out
to<00:04:44.210> a<00:04:44.240> dangerous<00:04:44.570> pro<00:04:45.050> before<00:04:45.320> dropping<00:04:45.860> your

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
to a dangerous pro before dropping your

the<00:05:15.500> mini<00:05:15.650> map<00:05:15.800> shows<00:05:16.100> the<00:05:16.130> same<00:05:16.430> thing

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
the mini map shows the same thing

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.790 
the mini map shows the same thing
there's<00:05:17.150> no<00:05:17.270> point<00:05:17.539> throwing<00:05:17.870> a<00:05:17.930> stun<00:05:18.169> so<00:05:18.650> let

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
there's no point throwing a stun so let

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.590 
there's no point throwing a stun so let
me<00:05:18.830> that's<00:05:19.340> how<00:05:19.789> the<00:05:19.850> enemy<00:05:20.150> run<00:05:20.300> into<00:05:20.510> my

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
me that's how the enemy run into my

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.480 
me that's how the enemy run into my
semtex<00:05:20.990> and<00:05:21.229> it<00:05:21.560> was<00:05:21.680> a<00:05:21.710> nice<00:05:21.919> double<00:05:22.160> that

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
semtex and it was a nice double that

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.610 
semtex and it was a nice double that
came<00:05:22.970> from<00:05:23.060> it<00:05:23.240> so<00:05:23.690> it's<00:05:23.810> about<00:05:23.870> thinking<00:05:24.229> what

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
came from it so it's about thinking what

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.020 
came from it so it's about thinking what
your<00:05:24.740> teammates<00:05:25.100> are<00:05:25.250> doing<00:05:25.550> and<00:05:25.729> then<00:05:25.820> using

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.520 
tips and advice in your future videos no
but<00:05:47.360> i<00:05:47.389> probably<00:05:47.630> should<00:05:47.960> slow<00:05:48.139> down<00:05:48.169> and

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
but i probably should slow down and

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.629 
but i probably should slow down and
never<00:05:48.620> use<00:05:48.950> every<00:05:49.610> day<00:05:50.889> yeah<00:05:51.889> yeah<00:05:52.160> I've<00:05:52.490> had
