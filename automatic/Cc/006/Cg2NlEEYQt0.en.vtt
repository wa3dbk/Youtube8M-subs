on today's episode of doodle draw art

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.559 
on today's episode of doodle draw art
we're<00:00:02.820> going<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.090> draw<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.419> firetruck<00:00:05.569> we're

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
we're going to draw a firetruck we're

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.880 
we're going to draw a firetruck we're
gonna<00:00:06.660> start<00:00:06.990> off<00:00:07.140> with<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.350> big<00:00:07.589> long

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
gonna start off with a big long

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.410 
gonna start off with a big long
rectangle<00:00:10.490> this<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.730> back<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.120> truck

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
rectangle this is the back of the truck

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.810 
rectangle this is the back of the truck
where<00:00:12.660> all<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> equipment<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.700> and<00:00:14.700> then

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
where all the equipment is and then

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.279 
where all the equipment is and then
we'll<00:00:15.000> make<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.179> smaller<00:00:15.509> rectangle<00:00:15.780> at<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
we'll make a smaller rectangle at the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.779 
we'll make a smaller rectangle at the
front<00:00:16.699> for<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.730> cab<00:00:18.230> and<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:20.130> little<00:00:20.400> rectangle

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
front for the cab and a little rectangle

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.390 
front for the cab and a little rectangle
for<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.570> engine<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.590> triangle<00:00:22.980> for<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
for the engine and a triangle for the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.509 
for the engine and a triangle for the
windshield<00:00:24.650> and<00:00:25.650> then<00:00:25.830> at<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.160> top<00:00:26.310> we're

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
windshield and then at the top we're

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.880 
windshield and then at the top we're
going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.760> put<00:00:26.910> two<00:00:27.150> domes<00:00:27.750> where<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
going to put two domes where the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.999 
going to put two domes where the
emergency<00:00:29.550> lights<00:00:29.789> are<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:31.380> we'll<00:00:31.560> draw<00:00:31.740> two

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
emergency lights are and we'll draw two

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.280 
emergency lights are and we'll draw two
wheels<00:00:32.279> roughly<00:00:32.969> underneath<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.780> same<00:00:34.050> place

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
wheels roughly underneath the same place

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:45.490 
wheels roughly underneath the same place
where<00:00:34.559> we've<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.739> drawn<00:00:35.190> those<00:00:35.399> domes

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.290 

and<00:00:46.130> now<00:00:46.250> we're<00:00:46.400> gonna<00:00:46.490> work<00:00:46.730> on<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.060> ladder

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
and now we're gonna work on the ladder

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.110 
and now we're gonna work on the ladder
this<00:00:47.600> is<00:00:47.750> a<00:00:47.780> ladder<00:00:48.080> truck<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.700> ladder<00:00:49.940> is

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
this is a ladder truck so the ladder is

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.850 
this is a ladder truck so the ladder is
going<00:00:50.360> to<00:00:50.450> have<00:00:52.360> long<00:00:53.360> lines<00:00:54.400> and<00:00:55.400> then<00:00:56.860> some

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
going to have long lines and then some

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.950 
going to have long lines and then some
rungs<00:00:59.230> and<00:01:00.230> some<00:01:00.910> crisscross<00:01:01.910> lines<00:01:02.270> for<00:01:02.720> the

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
rungs and some crisscross lines for the

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.660 
rungs and some crisscross lines for the
supports<00:01:03.590> you<00:01:03.890> don't<00:01:04.190> have<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:04.460> draw<00:01:04.610> the

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
supports you don't have to draw the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.030 
supports you don't have to draw the
crisscross<00:01:05.089> lines<00:01:05.590> makes<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.740> a<00:01:06.770> little<00:01:06.860> more

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
crisscross lines makes it a little more

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.840 
crisscross lines makes it a little more
complicated<00:01:07.720> or<00:01:08.720> you<00:01:08.810> can<00:01:09.310> and<00:01:10.310> this<00:01:10.580> is<00:01:10.730> the

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
complicated or you can and this is the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.340 
complicated or you can and this is the
part<00:01:11.030> that<00:01:11.180> holds<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.570> ladder<00:01:11.750> up<00:01:11.960> when<00:01:12.200> it's

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
part that holds the ladder up when it's

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.490 
part that holds the ladder up when it's
boosted<00:01:13.240> now<00:01:14.240> I'm<00:01:14.330> just<00:01:14.450> gonna<00:01:14.540> outline<00:01:15.110> all

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
boosted now I'm just gonna outline all

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.710 
boosted now I'm just gonna outline all
of<00:01:15.710> these<00:01:16.120> lines<00:01:17.120> that<00:01:17.270> I<00:01:17.360> drew<00:01:17.390> for<00:01:17.690> the

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
of these lines that I drew for the

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.960 
of these lines that I drew for the
ladder<00:01:17.990> by<00:01:18.229> making<00:01:18.590> them<00:01:18.740> thicker<00:01:19.070> on<00:01:19.580> all<00:01:19.790> the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
ladder by making them thicker on all the

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.020 
ladder by making them thicker on all the
sides

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
sides

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.020 
sides
alright<00:01:23.650> so<00:01:24.650> it's<00:01:24.800> time<00:01:25.010> for<00:01:25.040> us<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.400> fill<00:01:25.850> in

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
alright so it's time for us to fill in

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.640 
alright so it's time for us to fill in
more<00:01:26.210> detail<00:01:26.600> those<00:01:26.750> were<00:01:26.930> all<00:01:27.110> our<00:01:27.260> sketch

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
more detail those were all our sketch

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.680 
more detail those were all our sketch
marks<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:28.250> now<00:01:28.369> I'm<00:01:28.490> going<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:28.670> use<00:01:28.940> a<00:01:29.270> lot<00:01:29.660> of

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
marks so now I'm going to use a lot of

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.990 
marks so now I'm going to use a lot of
firmer<00:01:30.020> pressure<00:01:30.380> on<00:01:30.590> my<00:01:30.710> pencil<00:01:31.190> and<00:01:31.430> I'm

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
firmer pressure on my pencil and I'm

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.359 
firmer pressure on my pencil and I'm
going<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.300> make<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.780> lines<00:01:33.020> here<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:33.410> will

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
going to make the lines here that will

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.630 
going to make the lines here that will
be<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.580> ones<00:01:34.759> I<00:01:34.940> trace<00:01:35.330> over<00:01:36.310> so<00:01:37.310> all<00:01:37.340> the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
be the ones I trace over so all the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.580 
be the ones I trace over so all the
rungs<00:01:37.910> are<00:01:38.240> pointing<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.020> front<00:01:39.320> so

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
rungs are pointing to the front so

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.490 
rungs are pointing to the front so
they're<00:01:40.009> drawn<00:01:40.460> straight<00:01:40.880> through<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:45.170> then

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
they're drawn straight through and then

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.550 
they're drawn straight through and then
in<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.280> background<00:01:46.550> we<00:01:47.060> have<00:01:47.240> these

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
in the background we have these

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.590 
in the background we have these
crossways<00:01:48.560> support<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:49.490> they<00:01:49.730> do<00:01:50.420> not

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
crossways support so they do not

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.160 
crossways support so they do not
interrupt<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:52.130> rungs<00:01:52.400> and<00:01:52.940> then<00:01:53.750> I'll<00:01:53.900> draw

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
interrupt the rungs and then I'll draw

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.149 
interrupt the rungs and then I'll draw
and<00:01:54.320> stop<00:01:54.610> draw<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:55.760> stop<00:01:56.030> draw<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.750> stop<00:01:57.159> all

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
and stop draw and stop draw and stop all

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.560 
and stop draw and stop draw and stop all
along<00:01:58.520> there

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
along there

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.150 
along there
and<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.690> is<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> very<00:02:01.230> front<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.800> it<00:02:01.920> cuts

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
and this is at the very front so it cuts

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.960 
and this is at the very front so it cuts
off<00:02:02.310> everything<00:02:02.910> behind<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:08.520> then<00:02:08.850> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
off everything behind it and then the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.380 
off everything behind it and then the
bottom<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.990> letter<00:02:10.289> great<00:02:11.130> okay<00:02:11.790> that's

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
bottom of the letter great okay that's

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:20.180 
bottom of the letter great okay that's
the<00:02:12.540> hard<00:02:12.720> part<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:18.540> now<00:02:18.570> we<00:02:18.750> can<00:02:18.990> work<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:19.410> the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
the hard part so now we can work on the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.920 
the hard part so now we can work on the
main<00:02:20.459> part<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.940> truck<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.660> I'm<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.840> gonna

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
main part of the truck so I'm just gonna

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.610 
main part of the truck so I'm just gonna
outline<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:23.190> back<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.790> truck<00:02:24.290> go<00:02:25.290> over

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
outline the back of the truck go over

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.320 
outline the back of the truck go over
the<00:02:25.709> wheels<00:02:27.680> nice<00:02:28.680> big<00:02:28.980> circle<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.670> hubcap

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
the wheels nice big circle and hubcap
