7:00 this morning we've drifted about
five<00:03:13.709> nautical<00:03:14.010> miles<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:15.540> we're<00:03:15.720> always

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
five nautical miles and we're always

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.720 
five nautical miles and we're always
moving<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.650> wind<00:03:16.859> is<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.129> main<00:03:17.310> factor

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
moving in the wind is the main factor

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.819 
moving in the wind is the main factor
that<00:03:17.760> tire<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.329> pushes<00:03:18.690> us<00:03:18.840> most<00:03:19.409> people<00:03:19.500> are

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
that tire that pushes us most people are

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.849 
that tire that pushes us most people are
not<00:03:19.980> used<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.060> eye<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.709> usually<00:03:22.709> they

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
not used to the eye so usually they

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.830 
not used to the eye so usually they
stick<00:03:23.220> with<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.519> guide<00:03:23.730> for<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.030> first<00:03:24.329> hour

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
stick with the guide for the first hour

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.149 
stick with the guide for the first hour
or<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:25.409> then<00:03:26.129> they<00:03:26.459> get<00:03:26.879> a<00:03:26.940> little<00:03:27.060> bit<00:03:27.389> more

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 
or so then they get a little bit more

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.160 
or so then they get a little bit more
Courage's<00:03:29.159> and<00:03:29.370> they<00:03:30.120> go<00:03:30.299> away<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:31.139> we

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
Courage's and they go away so we

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.229 
Courage's and they go away so we

know where their pups are and that seems

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.599 
know where their pups are and that seems
to<00:04:18.630> be<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.810> combination<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.620> initially<00:04:20.280> smell

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
to be a combination of initially smell

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.659 
to be a combination of initially smell
and<00:04:20.909> then<00:04:21.359> also<00:04:21.599> the<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.289> pups<00:04:22.530> cries<00:04:22.889> so

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.520 
and then also the the pups cries so
between<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.120> two<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.449> those<00:04:24.599> they<00:04:24.930> can<00:04:24.990> figure

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
between the two of those they can figure

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.710

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
out which is their pup so even if they

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.909 
out which is their pup so even if they
come<00:04:27.870> up<00:04:27.990> from<00:04:28.080> a<00:04:28.229> different<00:04:28.530> hole<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:28.860> they

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
come up from a different hole and they

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.409 
come up from a different hole and they
have<00:04:29.039> to<00:04:29.190> go<00:04:29.280> an<00:04:29.460> extra<00:04:29.550> few<00:04:29.940> meters<00:04:30.210> across
