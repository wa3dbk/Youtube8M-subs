whether the costeaus key things does

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.760 
whether the costeaus key things does
that<00:01:23.130> require<00:01:23.299> even<00:01:24.299> change<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.079> guess<00:01:25.500> more

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
that require even change I guess more

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.959 
that require even change I guess more
