that's the incase icon it's going to be

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.210 
that's the incase icon it's going to be
the<00:01:36.810> most<00:01:36.930> protective<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.740> these<00:01:37.979> five

the most protective of these five

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.490 
the most protective of these five
sleeves<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.390> also<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.079> be<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> most

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
sleeves it is also going to be the most

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.830 
sleeves it is also going to be the most
expensive<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:42.030> hand<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.450> depends<00:01:42.810> on

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
expensive so just hand it depends on

material that it just kind of falls and
stays<00:02:11.489> closed<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.810> give<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.050> some<00:02:13.080> good

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
stays closed going to give it some good

going to protect your MacBook really
well<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.550> like<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.270> say<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.540> does<00:02:22.720> not<00:02:22.750> have

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
well and like I say it does not have

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.870 
well and like I say it does not have
zippers<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.709> it's<00:02:23.830> going<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.130> keep<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.370> from

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
zippers so it's going to keep that from

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.330 
zippers so it's going to keep that from
getting<00:02:25.209> scratched<00:02:25.830> next<00:02:26.830> up<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:27.100> is<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
getting scratched next up this is the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
does the next one as well this these are

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.570 
does the next one as well this these are
kind<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.420> more<00:02:34.600> simple<00:02:34.900> type<00:02:35.319> sleeves<00:02:35.890> it<00:02:36.310> too
