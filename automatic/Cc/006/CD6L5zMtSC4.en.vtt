 The End of Season 1: An Overview 

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:27.947
 Greetings Nephalem, welcome to the end of the current season. 

00:00:28.297 --> 00:00:32.668
 My name is Matt Amy, or Araxom, and I'm in charge of the Diablo III Support Forum. 

00:00:32.818 --> 00:00:36.126
 The season is nearing the end and it's time to get the leaderboards 

00:00:36.126 --> 00:00:37.848
 and complete your season progress. 

00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:41.043
 I will briefly explain what this means for your rewards and heroes 

00:00:41.293 --> 00:00:44.315
 and what awaits you between seasons in the game. 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.411
 Transmission of the season progress 

00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:52.573
 If you've played this season, you've leveled up new heroes, 

00:00:52.723 --> 00:00:55.295
 discovered new treasures and reached higher levels of paragons. 

00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:57.793
 What happens to these hard-earned rewards? 

00:00:57.943 --> 00:00:59.649
 I have good news for you: 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.230
 What you have collected remains with you. 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.106
 Heroes, Gold, Paragon Experience, Blood Shard, Equipment, Artisan Steps, 

00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:10.003
 Crafting recipes, loot extensions and achievements 

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:12.535
 are all taken over into non-seasonal progress. 

00:01:14.085 --> 00:01:16.735
 Remember that your progress is in a hardcore season 

00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:20.572
 then benefit your non-seasonal hardcore hero. 

00:01:20.722 --> 00:01:24.422
 Likewise, advances in a normal season are then available to your normal heroes. 

00:01:24.572 --> 00:01:28.259
 Most advances like Paragon experience, gold and craft recipes 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.902
 are automatically applied and added to non-seasonal advances. 

00:01:32.202 --> 00:01:34.258
 For others it's more complicated. 

00:01:34.308 --> 00:01:36.968
 Blood splinters are also transmitted, for example 

00:01:37.118 --> 00:01:38.969
 if that would exceed the limit. 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.569
 You can not collect more splinters, 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.520
 until the number is below the limit again, 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.820
 but you can spend it between the seasons. 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.025
 Artisan stages, loot enhancements and achievements are only transferred 

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:53.192
 if they have not been unlocked by non seasonal heroes. 

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:55.547
 Have they already been collected, 

00:01:55.697 --> 00:01:57.730
 they bring no additional benefits. 

00:01:58.244 --> 00:02:00.783
 If you sign up after the end of the season with the 

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:02.329
 new non-seasonal hero asks: 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.140
 "Hey Araxom, has a sweetheart goblin plundered my account?" 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.448
 No panic! We've updated the mail system in-game, 

00:02:08.598 --> 00:02:10.515
 to simplify access to your prey. 

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:13.591
 Click on the letter icon in the lower left corner of the screen, 

00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:14.676
 to open your mail. 

00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:17.638
 From the first character login to the end of the season 

00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:20.630
 you have 30 days to claim the delivered items. 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.918
 Click on the message with the desired item 

00:02:24.068 --> 00:02:25.114
 and then on demand. 

00:02:25.164 --> 00:02:26.759
 They are filed in your inventory, 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.635
 So make sure you have enough space! 

00:02:28.736 --> 00:02:31.861
 leaderboards 

00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:36.096
 At the end of the season, all season bestsellers will be reset 

00:02:36.246 --> 00:02:37.558
 and immortalized your records. 

00:02:37.808 --> 00:02:40.358
 Your placement in the leaderboards is still on 

00:02:40.508 --> 00:02:43.569
 available at any time, both in the game and on the website. 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.304
 After the end of further seasons you can navigate between the lists and look 

00:02:47.454 --> 00:02:51.042
 as friends or the best 1000 competitors have cut off in previous seasons. 

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:54.689
 The non-seasonal leaderboard for Big Nephalemportals is not 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.805
 seasonal and remains active, ie this challenge 

00:02:58.055 --> 00:02:59.150
 remain open to you. 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.051
 We'll let you know when these leaderboards are reset. 

00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:05.923
 Season Progress 

00:03:06.673 --> 00:03:09.012
 Do not forget that heroes who take part in the season, 

00:03:09.162 --> 00:03:10.693
 receive exclusive rewards! 

00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:13.459
 You get parts of a special Transmogrification set, 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.437
 if you bring a character to level 70 during a season. 

00:03:16.587 --> 00:03:18.788
 In each season additional parts become available. 

00:03:18.988 --> 00:03:22.094
 The season is still up, it's not too late to play up your character, 

00:03:22.344 --> 00:03:26.370
 Achieve achievements and collect seasonal exclusive transmogrifications! 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:29.114
 This is all about Horadrian teachings for today, Nephalem. 

00:03:29.164 --> 00:03:31.360
