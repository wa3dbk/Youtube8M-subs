00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:14.809
 hey people that means it is otherwise happy here 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.250
 Three little tips for you 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.790
 can also improve and look there 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.790
 the snake 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.480
 180 kilo light weight first told 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.180
 can I bring you give because it's about 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.849
 the stand was yes that is particularly flat 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.860
 shoes are not running shoes running shoes 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.660
 too spongy really a shallow 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.040
 shoes with the lawn became flat 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.949
 right on the ground is yours 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:57.129
 do not consider inward or outward 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:01:00.059
 if it ever happens and then it comes to me 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.059
 that the rod 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.990
 The city ​​is approximately in the middle of 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.990
 foot and then it goes down 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.360
 then on the fourth try you have to 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.020
 Of course, this varies from person to person 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.659
 to person 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.440
 you can of course cross that 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.820
 wooden cross live or in double attack 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.250
 Anyway, my name is mine 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.130
 Tip number one was the goal 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.140
 Number two is for everyone sending if you 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.140
 you go position in the crossroads 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:45.259
 we usually do what you do 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.750
 do you want that for her you know what her if 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.360
 you go by all 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.030
 the brics skin and then results in 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.320
 back if we do not like wood for 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.700
 position means that is the tried 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.080
 its position to come 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.050
 have then however already stress 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.640
 that means mini cross pulls her 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.000
 get in the position before you hit 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.000
 can 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.110
 on 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.110
 What 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.410
 and so that at the same time with the 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.340
 good high peter that's kind of the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.340
 revision lever 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.380
 right here is so looks for example 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.850
 in front of the page and third 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.180
 it can still interact with it 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.180
 easier 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.150
 look not only of our dialect 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:45.150
 but is also a torso in 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.730
 a good position 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.970
 that leads must 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.390
 The problem is you later and then the 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:00.909
 yesterday, however, must be from the beginning 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:04.410
 yes, the whole thing already had a lot 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:08.220
