00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.210
 and flour 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.210
 and we have 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.809
 how they come out obviously already has its 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.240
 first medal a bronze let's see the 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.570
 What a good ball this gymnast like me 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.570
 like 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:53.190
 at her feet at her feet ladies at the end 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.650
 your feet that exercise has done what 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.310
 emotion everything I was here that did not 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.650
 I wanted to breathe that delight and feel 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.840
 the music and delicacy sweetness 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:12.580
 delicacy to know that a soul 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:15.370
 while the interpretation is a figure that 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.790
 extent that amplitude that jumps that 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.190
 power the handling of the ball has 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.930
 there's been there I have to go but very 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.970
 intelligent has lengthened a little more the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.490
 arms had to be inserted while 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.440
 is collecting the ball because it is 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.820
 in a moment of rotation with the wheel 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.060
 lateral and we are doing very well very well 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.830
 embedded is very smart very look 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.560
 look in his place does not lose sight of the 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.140
 perfect ball collecting here the 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.700
 launch in the jump there goes a 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.350
 a little too long he also lacks a 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.310
 little bit the back leg but let's go 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.140
 which is to put a but 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.760
 and this bearing and I think that of the 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.290
 Sometimes most complete I've seen it 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.690
 normally it picks it up below the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.890
 hamstring and today has come almost up to 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.640
 Achilles tendon 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:11.520
 what good is very good note 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.520
 He had 17 866 17 800
