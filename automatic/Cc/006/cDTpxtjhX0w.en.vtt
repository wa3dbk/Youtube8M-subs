00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:04.140
 Politicians come out and find that just as well as artist actors 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.679
 and Musicians Homosexuality has long been accepted only in football in particular 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.539
 among professionals who are sure to hug and kiss so heartily after every goal 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.150
 she still big problem the silence of the men of this book he 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.470
 The book by two authors from Kaiserslautern is called this now 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.470
 have published and they want exactly with these 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.019
 Kampker's creativity that such a man can spool out does not seem to fit 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.450
 in the cliché of professional football 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.400
 As a hopeful offspring for the Bundesliga, Markus Urban was in 2007 on 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.220
 today and broke his career from the years of hide-and-seek 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.220
 his homosexuality finished him, why 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.710
 To become a percent 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.550
 to be devalued 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.300
 So everything is middle school 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.180
 was assisted in the 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.240
 disgusting 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.770
 therefore I go every 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.140
 "All class 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.300
 and to be for the others 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.340
 required 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.710
 This reports the team Attenhofen can be football 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.690
 here the Briton can seem to start the race 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.619
 his career had ended his move to the 2 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:16.810
 made unknown 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.950
 the subsequent chase at the end of 1998 even led to suicide 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.800
 In German football, there has not been a Bundesliga pro Garth yet 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.720
 although this for the best German football-Schulz and help 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.810
 promises 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.170
 I welcome it in a classically different way from Stoke Leichtfried here in the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.680
 Studio and analysts from Kaiserslautern 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.670
 and publisher a few weeks ago first bus that Joe Biden 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.650
 the men 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.450
 subtitle 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.090
 on homosexuality in German football but equally bad 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.650
 why, anyway, no one actually 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.110
 to come out from professionals 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.740
 it is a difficult question though 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.110
 she is actually relatively easy to answer when looking at the 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.210
 Situation with regard to german football pitches then look at then 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.120
 It's really the last and most macho world in the Meyer cabins 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.970
 Percent in our society may still be comparable 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.960
 The volunteer fire department but here are just hard men percent 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.199
 asked sound 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.579
 Emma all percent what is different and everything in bit 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.469
 in the suspicion percent in the suspected device per cent to be softened 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.269
 Pröll will be tabooed, so no one dares to do that 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.840
 percent off just because he's too scared to cover 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.079
 Hit the whole little reaction as he saw years of an example 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.359
 from England he just got a good deal of cover from the cover 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.739
 and he was afterwards 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.739
 driven into suicide, they are not one step further, we are now 14 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:44.739
 Years after that 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.760
 well maybe in the past few years, it has certainly one or the other 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.620
 changed 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.329
 so if you look it is also about centimeters 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.930
 Sam the thousand turn "That is agony in the environment of the clubs more and more school 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.989
 it employ groupings therefore forming this theme in the stadiums 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.510
 Those who are responsible for tolerance often cause someone to worry 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:07.629
 dfb president Theo Zwanziger clearly takes a position against discrimination 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.400
 around and exclusion one can already say that one is step further 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.949
 Perhaps, however, to witness now Geneva the tingling case is not 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.900
 compelling to compare with the Bundesliga on the other side there are just 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.229
 Examples in the opening credits have seen it as clearly as Markus Urban 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:27.199
 That they still exist in this sphere of football still certain inhibitions only 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.029
 There are still some reservations and this is just a homosexual athlete 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:34.389
 do not make it easy to stand up for your personality if there is one 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.599
 this taboo like the hard that the mast of her this taboo 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.259
 Breaking it apart is really dead for sure we'll see that for 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:44.590
 the pigs percent Schuon 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.849
 whole asked 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.599
 n1 Dahlen in a great role model 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.329
 Percent actually you dare this step 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.969
 he starts to the problem 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:58.459
 and in the youth time lens star percent young people discover themselves 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.269
 also discover their sexual identity 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.110
 here and there for terms such as Schulz Ende, of course, as a swearword 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.480
 for being used 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.480
 Percent and there would be, according to the whole celebrities 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:11.769
 Now they have researched 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.269
 in the international team 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.069
 in the football league also in lower classes Visenso in the 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.739
 Bundesliga 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.099
 the response has been to their their beginning actor dealing with the 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.980
 For example, clubs with homosexuality is 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.520
 the conclusion was not for us and then trained questionnaire sent 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.080
 36 bundesliga clubs by the way but do not drill the sponsors of 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.610
 National team around as I said the conclusion was that he then me from the 36 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.719
 clubs 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:41.469
 to have found at all 12 - middle to answers and power canceled 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:46.069
 that is, out of 36 professional clubs, only four percent have clubs by percent 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.839
 Position on the subject of homophobia and homosexuality in German 

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:54.089
 Football is not very similar but it was also in the 

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:58.089
 Environment of the sponsors of the national team which also involves vegetables 

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.629
 touch-sensitive I call that now some contact fears 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:05.090
 Parallel cosmopolitanism Basler cosmopolitanism one German 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:08.089
 Entrepreneur attributes to the international company vegetable broth and 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:11.709
 It has obviously not been lowered with the subject of homosexuality 

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:14.199
 School footballers from the national team to the county league 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:14.790
 under 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.160
 is that in consequence, it is still a very 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.020
 hypocritical world we have that was all propagated it is not 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.419
 but to be very special blame 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:24.680
 not outet 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.479
 she appreciates it seems domestic and 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.379
 I'm even the percent many so that percent resigned to synonymous with the 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.680
 with the fact that nowhere is a 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.110
 gives a gay footballer 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.479
 but we also have many 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.650
 mt- Photos Baumann said the saying just let the topic where 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.240
 Sketches of the taboo zone 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.930
 Let's risk football so we are right now 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.840
 you know it but you have been stopped with so know exactly displeasure 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.059
 only who outes there 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:55.889
 um and then because maybe percent of those football mixers somewhere 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.210
 Football is going to be from now on 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.110
 I think it's good that these pieces could have brought home from the taboo 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.090
 that represents the festival he represents 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.800
 Westerwelle
