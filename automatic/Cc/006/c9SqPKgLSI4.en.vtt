they're<00:05:19.960> all<00:05:20.110> royalty<00:05:20.560> license<00:05:21.040> free<00:05:21.250> samples

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.260 

pick<00:05:57.440> up<00:05:57.590> and<00:05:57.770> shake<00:05:57.920> it<00:05:57.950> this<00:05:58.730> feature<00:05:58.970> here

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
pick up and shake it this feature here

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.640 
pick up and shake it this feature here
is<00:05:59.300> called<00:05:59.510> the<00:05:59.570> shake<00:05:59.750> feature<00:05:59.960> so<00:06:00.260> I'll<00:06:00.380> make

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
is called the shake feature so I'll make

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:35.209 
is called the shake feature so I'll make
a<00:06:01.130> beat<00:06:01.400> here

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:35.219 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:37.919 

so<00:06:36.219> what<00:06:36.369> that<00:06:36.399> does<00:06:36.729> is<00:06:36.759> that<00:06:37.059> randomizes<00:06:37.779> it

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:37.929 
so what that does is that randomizes it

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:40.469 
so what that does is that randomizes it
once<00:06:38.079> you<00:06:38.199> shake<00:06:38.379> it<00:06:38.439> it<00:06:39.009> makes<00:06:39.249> this<00:06:39.479> crazy

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 
once you shake it it makes this crazy

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.850 
once you shake it it makes this crazy
weird<00:06:40.779> chicken<00:06:41.049> sound<00:06:42.719> and<00:06:43.719> then<00:06:44.709> it

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
weird chicken sound and then it

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.829 
weird chicken sound and then it
randomizes<00:06:45.219> all<00:06:45.549> the<00:06:45.669> samples<00:06:45.849> and<00:06:46.209> each

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:46.839 
randomizes all the samples and each

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:50.159 
randomizes all the samples and each
sample<00:06:47.429> there's<00:06:48.429> three<00:06:48.759> different<00:06:49.169> samples

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
sample there's three different samples
