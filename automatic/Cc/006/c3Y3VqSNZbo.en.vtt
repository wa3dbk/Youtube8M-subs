 youtube is good today I bring you a 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:25.420
 video where I'll leave you some games 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.640
 few requirements I will leave five games 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.689
 well the first one is the first one we're going to 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.059
 talk about ago of empire the good one 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:38.770
 to me this game I put it here of five 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:42.400
 last because I liked it a lot because 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.559
 the graph is not very good but from this 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.640
 game this game is very good and it was this 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:51.339
 game was released on October 26 , 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.309
 1997 and in the game you can also have 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.309
 12 civilizations good that makes the 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.450
 game be good that you do not have or do not have 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.260
 good graphics 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.260
 here I have 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.260
 we have the acre of empires 2 that we are 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.350
 the second part of the game of the saga 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.200
 of the game good to me this game I liked 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.730
 more because it has better graphics like 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.340
 it's in the other batch it kept very good 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.740
 graphics for better or better a little 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.290
 the graphic and I also like the campaign 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.760
 what he has but what I like most is 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:32.440
 How I love how castles put 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:36.010
 the castles and put on the sides the 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.590
 elite archers and remember other 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.430
 injuries in other civilizations are not 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.080
 archers but they are is elite skates and 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.160
 you also have giant catapults 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.160
 good, I have nothing more to say 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.979
 then that women seldom 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.310
 twice or once I do not remember 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.440
 but I thought it was very good in the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.560
 game was not also in 2000 that 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.229
 have of 2004 they published it and good 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.750
 2014 have published a mind that 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.480
 new game but a non-space does not 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.459
 I played that there was a vision may 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.200
 characterized by the construction of 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.660
 cities requirement for trade the 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.410
 construction of some buildings 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.870
 resources with my metal wood wealth 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.040
 Knowledge and oil are inexhaustible 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.709
 but there is a limited number of 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.410
 collectors by source of resources 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.660
 in which includes a space campaign to 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.020
 the conquest of the world that allows 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.099
 remove the entire planet in this mode the 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.810
 player will have the possibility and the 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.060
 possibility of forging alliances with 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.580
 civilizations in addition for every 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.500
 territory had the player be able to do 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.200
 studies unique and good resources 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.709
 calculations that will count when playing 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.130
 a new scenario within the game 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.660
 with that everything 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.660
 good technique planet 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.480
 I play here as the second because this 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.959
 is one of the best that I played and 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.299
 I think a new strategy 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.190
 talking about this game because the 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.870
 games every day almost all 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.000
 days go by all the time the games are 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.200
 hang this game is too good 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.670
 tells the story 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.730
 of the human being the empire of the world 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.910
 from prehistory to our era 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:42.010
 is and the game in the creators games 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:46.040
 as they designed the future 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.739
 the campaign of the Greeks now appears 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.109
 Alexander Magnus and those heroes who are 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.590
 there the story of Troy is also 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:58.250
 in the greece russia do not go that the 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:02.750
 future and they also took an expansion 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:06.650
 that talks about about usa to atlantic 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.830
 and things like that and in the station too 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:14.270
 They also took out a 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.950
 a new cloud territory pre territory 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.900
 it is not on earth but in space 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.450
 they are beyond in space wineries 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.490
 it becomes considered one of the names 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.850
 that's why I say you're crazy like putting it 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.800
 here but good also in this game 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:35.440
 has like each each 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.930
 each person in common too much like 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.750
 let's say that fourths they have are not 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.300
 to look like but they have placed 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.529
 each character but as a power and 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.899
 has the new prophet 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:52.099
 the prophet do as volcanoes that 

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:54.139
 they showed people that everything 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:56.409
 well you can say but this game has 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:00.939
 too much for me the new game 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.939
 now we go with the number one 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.960
 to my mind you play me I love this 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.560
 game because not as common as everything is 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.070
 what 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:24.810
 racing and all that but arm the little soldier 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:27.120
 of plastic and one of the green soldiers 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.130
 and fight against us browns and I 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.130
 also like the scenario that an opel 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.490
 in the yard and how that strategy is very 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:38.030
 very good the game 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.900
 this in the game that started everything 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.569
 a sergeant a general I remember very well 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:47.900
 he was good to have the greens and everything was 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:50.569
 peace peace peace but then but they were 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.400
 a battle against the browns and you 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.400
 they yanked excessively 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:03.330
 and then the soldiers did 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.550
 Greens grabbed him and took him to the 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.230
 doctors but when he came out he went crazy 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.630
 because they have broken his head they left 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:12.830
 image of good 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.660
 but the brown ball the little bit like 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.920
 crazy and start doing like a re 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.180
 ability and relevance are more 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.940
 great since they call you so that tula 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.680
 the head in it and the last ones you have 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.410
 to get to the room of the good houses 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.889
 and you also have to have to save 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.330
 the elderly who are with toys 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:37.229
