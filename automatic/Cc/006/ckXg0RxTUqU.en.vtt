00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
use milk or you could use this and all

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.580 
use milk or you could use this and all
this<00:02:52.269> is<00:02:52.450> just<00:02:52.480> like<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:53.080> wouldn't<00:02:53.500> even

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
this is just like I wouldn't even

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.289 
this is just like I wouldn't even
measure<00:02:53.860> this<00:02:54.070> out<00:02:54.220> but<00:02:54.519> if<00:02:54.760> you're<00:02:55.060> curious

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
measure this out but if you're curious

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.570 
measure this out but if you're curious
we're<00:02:55.840> putting<00:02:56.140> in<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.320> quarter<00:02:56.620> cup<00:02:56.650> okay<00:02:57.100> but

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
we're putting in a quarter cup okay but

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
we're putting in a quarter cup okay but
doing<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:57.880> for<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.120> guys

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
doing it for you guys

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600 
doing it for you guys
and<00:02:59.560> we<00:02:59.650> were<00:02:59.709> thinking<00:02:59.830> of<00:03:00.070> using<00:03:00.160> almond

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
and we were thinking of using almond

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.710 
and we were thinking of using almond
milk<00:03:00.790> because<00:03:01.030> that's<00:03:01.150> what<00:03:01.239> we<00:03:01.330> have<00:03:01.540> the

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
milk because that's what we have the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.420 
milk because that's what we have the
were<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.870> little<00:03:02.080> unsure<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.500> like<00:03:02.739> how<00:03:03.370> the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
were a little unsure of like how the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.820 
were a little unsure of like how the
flavor<00:03:03.700> might<00:03:03.970> turn<00:03:04.120> out<00:03:04.150> with<00:03:04.390> almond<00:03:04.840> but<00:03:05.590> if

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
flavor might turn out with almond but if

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.009 
flavor might turn out with almond but if
you<00:03:05.980> do<00:03:06.340> try<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:07.060> should<00:03:07.209> let<00:03:07.360> us<00:03:07.390> know<00:03:07.510> so

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
you do try it you should let us know so

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.530 
you do try it you should let us know so
that<00:03:08.049> we<00:03:08.170> know<00:03:08.470> for<00:03:08.769> next<00:03:08.980> time

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
that we know for next time

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.800 
that we know for next time
now<00:03:10.709> we<00:03:11.709> put<00:03:11.860> on<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.100> blades<00:03:12.370> of<00:03:12.489> death<00:03:12.810> this

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
now we put on the blades of death this

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.570 
now we put on the blades of death this
is<00:03:13.870> how<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.140> magic<00:03:14.590> bullet<00:03:14.739> works<00:03:15.040> if<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.370> don't

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
is how a magic bullet works if you don't

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.190 
is how a magic bullet works if you don't
no<00:03:16.500> no<00:03:17.500> no<00:03:17.830> no<00:03:18.400> you<00:03:18.580> know<00:03:18.820> I<00:03:19.269> would<00:03:19.959> like<00:03:20.079> to

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
no no no no you know I would like to

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.680 
no no no no you know I would like to
shake<00:03:20.380> it<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.530> little<00:03:20.650> bit<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.730> all<00:03:21.880> you

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
shake it a little bit so that it all you

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.569 
shake it a little bit so that it all you
do<00:03:22.810> like<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:22.989> pre<00:03:23.230> blend<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:24.130> is<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.340> pre

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
do like a pre blend this is the pre

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:46.000 
do like a pre blend this is the pre
blend<00:03:24.820> guys<00:03:25.030> oh<00:03:25.360> my<00:03:25.780> god<00:03:25.959> stop<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.500> this<00:03:26.890> looks

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.740 

so<00:03:47.010> pulse<00:03:47.460> technique<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.060> better<00:03:48.300> than<00:03:48.540> just

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
so pulse technique is better than just

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.970 
so pulse technique is better than just
like<00:03:48.900> holding<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.380> down<00:03:49.500> for<00:03:49.560> like<00:03:49.830> five

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
like holding it down for like five

00:03:49.980 --> 00:04:02.150 
like holding it down for like five
minutes<00:03:50.100> it's<00:03:50.400> better<00:03:50.550> to<00:03:50.700> like<00:03:50.850> oh<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:01.890> after

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
minutes it's better to like oh so after

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.370 
minutes it's better to like oh so after
posting<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:02.670> for<00:04:02.910> about<00:04:03.000> half<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:04.350> minute

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
posting it for about half a minute

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.560 
posting it for about half a minute
whatever<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.490> think<00:04:05.730> looks<00:04:05.760> good<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.300> get<00:04:06.390> it

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570
