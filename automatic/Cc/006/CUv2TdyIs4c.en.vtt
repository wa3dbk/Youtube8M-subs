today this time again we're going to

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.720 
today this time again we're going to
start<00:00:16.199> putting<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.650> in<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.830> ponytail<00:00:17.070> we're

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
start putting it in a ponytail we're

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.580 
start putting it in a ponytail we're
wrapping<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.090> little<00:00:18.300> piece<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.570> hair<00:00:18.990> just

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
wrapping a little piece of hair just

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.400 
wrapping a little piece of hair just
around<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.070> band<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.670> hide<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.330> if<00:00:22.170> you

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
around the band to hide it and if you

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.170 
around the band to hide it and if you
don't<00:00:22.590> know<00:00:22.740> how<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.949> do<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.150> my

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
don't know how to do this it's in my

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.929 
don't know how to do this it's in my
previous<00:00:24.720> video<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.500> bun<00:00:25.800> video<00:00:26.220> as<00:00:26.490> well<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
previous video the bun video as well the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.450 
previous video the bun video as well the
twisted<00:00:27.420> bun<00:00:27.599> video<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.039> time<00:00:29.070> we're

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
twisted bun video so this time we're

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.009 
twisted bun video so this time we're
actually<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.029> braid<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.630> we're

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
actually going to braid it and we're

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.930 
actually going to braid it and we're
just<00:00:31.199> doing<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.470> very<00:00:31.650> simple<00:00:32.189> three<00:00:32.579> strand

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
just doing a very simple three strand

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.819 
just doing a very simple three strand
braid<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.570> we<00:00:33.690> divide<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.079> hair<00:00:34.440> into<00:00:34.500> three

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
braid so we divide the hair into three

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.340 
braid so we divide the hair into three
even<00:00:35.760> sections<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.450> then<00:00:36.870> we're<00:00:36.989> going<00:00:37.170> to

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
even sections and then we're going to

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.010 
even sections and then we're going to
start<00:00:37.620> braiding<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.370> i<00:00:38.610> will<00:00:39.570> put<00:00:39.750> another

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
start braiding this i will put another

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.290 
start braiding this i will put another
video<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.890> how<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> five<00:00:41.820> strand

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
video up and how to do a five strand

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
video up and how to do a five strand
braid<00:00:42.750> as<00:00:42.960> well<00:00:43.290> which<00:00:43.590> looks<00:00:43.829> really<00:00:44.250> really

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
braid as well which looks really really

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.580 
braid as well which looks really really
pretty<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.270> bun<00:00:45.600> sort<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.530> shape<00:00:46.860> as<00:00:47.370> well

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
pretty in this bun sort of shape as well

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.090 
pretty in this bun sort of shape as well
so<00:00:50.780> which<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.989> make<00:00:52.230> sure<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.800> nice<00:00:53.070> and

smooth can if you want secure the ends
with<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:03.290> hairband<00:01:06.560> ok<00:01:07.560> now<00:01:07.770> what<00:01:07.920> we're<00:01:08.070> going

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
with a hairband ok now what we're going

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.010 
with a hairband ok now what we're going
to<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.760> exactly<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.450> same<00:01:09.659> as<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:09.960> did

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
to do is exactly the same as we did

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.590 
to do is exactly the same as we did
before<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.220> other<00:01:11.369> video<00:01:11.760> we're<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
before in the other video we're going to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.539 
before in the other video we're going to
start<00:01:12.990> twisting<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:15.049> hair<00:01:16.049> around<00:01:16.549> just

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
start twisting this hair around just

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.990 
start twisting this hair around just
like<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:19.189> I'm<00:01:20.189> actually<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.759> take

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
like that and I'm actually going to take

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.160 
like that and I'm actually going to take
out<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> hammer<00:01:21.509> now<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.780> what<00:01:24.990> we've<00:01:25.140> got

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
out the hammer now so what we've got

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.830 
out the hammer now so what we've got
left<00:01:25.560> now<00:01:25.710> here<00:01:26.250> which<00:01:26.490> wasn't<00:01:26.790> braided<00:01:27.600> very

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
left now here which wasn't braided very

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.480 
left now here which wasn't braided very
well<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.979> actually<00:01:29.340> push<00:01:31.490> just

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
well we can actually push just

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.429 
well we can actually push just
underneath<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.780> secure<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.380> with

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
underneath like that and secure it with

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:43.880 
underneath like that and secure it with
a<00:01:34.560> few<00:01:34.829> pins<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:42.320> if<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.560> seen<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
a few pins and if you have seen the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.160 
a few pins and if you have seen the
other<00:01:44.040> video<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:45.060> easiest<00:01:45.390> way<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> secure

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
other video the easiest way to secure

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.770 
other video the easiest way to secure
anything<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.030> it's<00:01:48.030> by<00:01:48.210> sliding<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.689> a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
anything like that it's by sliding in a

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.160 
anything like that it's by sliding in a
pin<00:01:49.020> twisting<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.740> around<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:51.149> sliding<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.049> up

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
pin twisting it around and sliding it up

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.410 
pin twisting it around and sliding it up
so<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.649> way<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.100> won't<00:01:53.280> fall<00:01:53.610> out<00:01:53.640> at<00:01:54.000> all<00:01:54.180> so

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
so this way it won't fall out at all so

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.840 
so this way it won't fall out at all so
you<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.350> continue<00:01:55.710> doing<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.280> all<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.820> way

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
you just continue doing this all the way

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:05.670 
you just continue doing this all the way
around

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.190 

and<00:02:07.000> then<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.119> can<00:02:08.300> either<00:02:08.539> leave<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:08.990> like

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
and then you can either leave it like

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.590 
and then you can either leave it like
this<00:02:09.229> it's<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.800> nice<00:02:10.009> high<00:02:10.280> bun<00:02:10.580> or<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.390> can

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
this it's a nice high bun or you can

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.600 
this it's a nice high bun or you can
again<00:02:11.920> get<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:13.480> with<00:02:14.480> your<00:02:14.660> tail<00:02:14.930> comb<00:02:15.319> and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
again get in with your tail comb and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.440 
again get in with your tail comb and
just<00:02:16.610> pull<00:02:17.440> both<00:02:18.440> little<00:02:18.830> braided<00:02:19.610> parts<00:02:20.260> out

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
just pull both little braided parts out

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.930 
just pull both little braided parts out
just<00:02:23.450> slightly<00:02:23.750> just<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.440> give<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:25.040> little

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
just slightly just to give it a little

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.610 
just slightly just to give it a little
bit<00:02:26.120> more<00:02:26.390> height<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.050> a<00:02:27.110> little<00:02:27.350> bit<00:02:27.440> more
