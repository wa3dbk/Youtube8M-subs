00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello how are you I am the kill soldiers 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.460
 here I bring you another white video 2 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.130
 this time I will show you a 99 casualties 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.000
 on the hijack map of this booster 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.910
 using the pw 157 with the muffler 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.070
 and quick cartridge and adjustable stock 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.660
 then the first one because I bring as 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.310
 can see to the right is the ghost 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.429
 because we just need to be 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.380
 out of bibi trains scavenger engineer 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.810
 I have changed engineer in times of exter 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.550
 and simply because of the fact that I do not 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.710
 has fixed that the outside and does not work in 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.660
 the essences what happens is that it is not 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.640
 that serves us but that this one does not 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.980
 you need because the essences point 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.050
 fast without having any this boat to 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.230
 thaksin that helps you aim fast that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.030
 it simply serves for this life 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.920
 machine guns and the pinches as 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.719
 they call the assault rifles then 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.519
 this is a game where I was playing 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.129
 that with my channel my channel brought 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.170
 blackberry that but this one I did not want them 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.690
 show the whole game because the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.910
 mega gas had very big this all very 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.040
 long and for the wood has also erased 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.710
 so I just wanted to show you 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.869
 the last thing that was where I got my 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.420
 six that was the state and the work always 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.790
 how do you use them on this map then 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.070
 the demolition mode you well know 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.080
 which is very easy is simply scared 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.869
 because they appear on one side of the map 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.759
 it's not like breaking three that change this 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.310
 in black ops 1 in black ops 2 is the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.440
 same chingadera that stays in a single 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.030
 place then what I and my face what 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.220
 we did was that he stayed for a 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.229
 side and another but we just leave 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.509
 get out of your sword even if you walk 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.060
 inside your spa while you're alive and 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.619
 that can keep you there and the guts 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.240
 they are not going to change the place like 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.420
 I told them it's not going to change the sports 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.460
 then here on this map if they are well 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.560
 happened but this one I recommend bringing 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.380
 a software without a gun like this one that is 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.210
 just kill well have a shit of 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.100
 pinches bullets and does not move so much 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.970
 then that is one of the qualities 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.369
 that has this the pe of w 57 that you 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.500
 it helps a lot because there are weapons that 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.080
 they have a little bit less bullets like 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.899
 more ms and and you just can not 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.730
 kill sometimes 23 guys with a cartridge 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.040
 this one maybe this luckily will kill 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.780
 or three if they are attached 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.819
 gÃ¼eyes ni was like a collateral guy 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.519
 so here are some tips that I can give you 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.220
 give to use this pinche score if 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.620
 is that you just look at the radar and 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.629
 Look sorry, look at the map look at this 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.060
 the little monkeys look at the little triangles 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.890
 the red zone and that 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.290
 they will simply be there or if they do not look 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.390
 none of those simply crushes nl 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.579
 one and now blue chingadera and so 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.590
 You can see them if they are yellow 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.930
 means they are enemies and they are color 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.569
 Black means they are friends then 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.670
 here this already after I took my workshop 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.640
 This blowjob can give you some 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.920
 tips with this mom is that they do not move 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.660
 whether it is going to be like this map 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.940
 here you are simply going to leave them in a 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.400
 place this and until they're going to 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.560
 destroy then what I wanted to do 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.930
 on this map was to be the kind of scare 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.310
 but with the workshop then first what 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.019
 what I did is that he was getting 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.230
 half towards the edges so that if 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.549
 just this the culeros this one does not 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.410
 come out of the banks and so 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.019
 you can just kill more guys 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.030
 I'm faster and better then 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.819
 some tips that I can give you for this 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.040
 map if they are playing this here 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.230
 is that they just do not steal them up 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.730
 do not spend so much in the middle this 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.590
 where is the domination because the 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.269
 they are going to kill that what I tell them in 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.819
 all the fucking videos that I upload 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.880
 when they play domination then here 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.340
 we are in demolition and the truth is that 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.769
 I've had a lot of fun with the 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.329
 game but a simply thing that does not 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.269
 I liked that he was always with the 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.579
 cars always with most of the 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.010
 enemies leave and then they stay with 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.260
 123 guys from the other team and just 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.569
 I do not kill then it is very difficult this 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.579
 kill weyes like that if the guards go to 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.530
 to be dating I do not know if you also 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.230
 they are taking out so the exaltos but 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.180
 I'm going to try to get more gameplays 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.819
 because the way if I take stella 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.709
 australis and saco workshops and that but it 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.930
 the children of the vera come out then not 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.870
 I understand why chingaos is nasal and 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.760
 you go out and I can not grab this 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.130
 gameplays for you to bring them 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.260
 because at least they play word for 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.330
 have better this 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.730
 better downs and better gameplays for 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.250
 show them but this here is over the 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.900
 video I hope you liked it 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.780
 share the favorite online video us 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.200
 we see this morning have a nice day 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.200
 goodbye
