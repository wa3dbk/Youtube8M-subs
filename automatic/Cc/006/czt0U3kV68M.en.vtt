00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.440
 Today I show you as I do 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.820
 perfect breakfast once and that 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.880
 egg white and the egg yolk liquid 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.340
 we need and the size l 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.010
 if you take another size is 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.930
 probably the time I choose 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.050
 not suitable because it would have to try 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.470
 so bigger bright from 63 to 73 grams 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.539
 heavy 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.610
 we'll show you a kitchen clock 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.940
 five minutes and 30 seconds 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.790
 and to the pot the matching lid and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.370
 Now I'll open the stove 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.260
 full power and if yours up 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.050
 swim then the eggs are no more 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.230
 so fresh and here we go was me 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.809
 and wait until the water boils 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.989
 as weird little bubbles slowly 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.780
 high and the ultimate in this 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.420
 method is to say exactly 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.399
 Now the water is boiling and it is the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.479
 Instantly because we wait now 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:10.140
 now you can hear it like it 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.390
 Noise by itself gives the water 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.190
 the temperature has reached sees the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.740
 almost 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.840
 otherwise we have to pay close attention to that 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.210
 one can say exactly now that cooks 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.760
 water when he blows up so big 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.130
 rise as long as we go out now 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.390
 I would say cooking here now was that 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:40.460
 already on the water keeps on mind 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:42.900
 cover it orhan and from the heart 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.450
 the should go as soon as possible 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:50.130
 these three actions cover it mr 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.579
 Turn on the clock a bit and now the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.560
 Run time and do nothing 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.560
 Lid must remain buy 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.990
 Now the last ten seconds are running 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.180
 backwards and now we have to go now 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.899
 take care and we limit the eggs 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.899
 immediately 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.020
 so now let's have a look 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.020
 announce result 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:42.730
 is not that perfect I think so 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.730
 wonderful fun while copying
