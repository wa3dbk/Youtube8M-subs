00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.910
 hello all welcome to this tutorial 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.470
 express of beauty news in which 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.160
 we will learn to make this look super 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:19.570
 simple fuchsia and black eyeliner 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.570
 come with me so they can see how it's done 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.279
 my eye is already prepared use a 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.949
 first and some shadows and now step of 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.750
 immediately to the delineated I am using a 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.759
 fuchsia eyeliner that is actually 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.579
 for lips but here in this case I would 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.980
 I am using in the eyes start 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.500
 with small strokes and I go little by little 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.500
 marking the entire shape of the eyelid 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.240
 I start to mark the outer line that 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.040
 is going to give you this cut effect 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.730
 and I'm filling in all the spaces that 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.730
 they are staying 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.440
 what is important here is that they have their 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.720
 tip by hand so they can retouch the 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.270
 tip of the pencil when necessary and 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.979
 that go little by little swelling 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.979
 little the line that we are doing 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.120
 then we went to the black eyeliner in 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.480
 this case I'm using an eyeliner in 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.430
 maybelline gel on an art brush 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.950
 it may sound a bit strange but it 's a 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.120
 art brush and what I'm doing are 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.820
 very finite strokes 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.920
 until I'm completing the line 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.210
 now I start to fill in the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.210
 tail of this delineated 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.080
 through the middle of the fuchsia I'm going towards 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.400
 in and then I start filling 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.090
 all the spaces that are left 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.090
 In between 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.100
 what is important here is that we take 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.130
 our time and let's do it step by step 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.770
 to make it right 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.229
 then with a fuchsia shadow in this case 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.939
 any one without brand I'm reinforcing 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.170
 the eyeliner to make it look more 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:06.460
 intense in that we are lashes and 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.470
 of course infallible apply mask 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.840
 I'm using in this case a bobby 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.840
 braun call is not much more expensive 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.170
 I comb my eyebrows and I'm going to fill them with 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.710
 a gray color that is what always 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.710
 I use 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.510
 when they are finished we return them 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.150
 to comb so that the color melts with 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.310
 the natural and good hair like this is already 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.020
 finished this look super easy to make 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.140
 You can combine it with other colors of 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.940
 blue gold eyeliner even golden like this 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.980
 is that I hope they do and that what 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.510
 look for a special occasion if 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.400
