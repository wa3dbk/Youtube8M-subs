00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.679 
and that is to actually help to enhance
the<00:01:57.210> quality<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.290> male<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.009> female

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
the quality of the male and female

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.670 
the quality of the male and female
sexual<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:01.759> fluids<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.030> those<00:02:03.750> fluids<00:02:04.170> are

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
sexual of fluids and those fluids are

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.590 
sexual of fluids and those fluids are
actually<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.549> reproductive<00:02:06.180> fluids<00:02:06.509> are

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
actually the reproductive fluids are

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.290 
actually the reproductive fluids are
actually<00:02:06.960> reabsorbed<00:02:07.860> lymphatic<00:02:08.849> li<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
actually reabsorbed lymphatic li and

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.720 
actually reabsorbed lymphatic li and
then<00:02:09.989> they<00:02:10.229> enter<00:02:10.560> into<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.860> bloodstream<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
then they enter into the bloodstream and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.730 
then they enter into the bloodstream and
actually<00:02:12.180> feed<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.510> brain

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
actually feed the brain

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.550 
actually feed the brain
so<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:14.820> good<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:16.730> very<00:02:17.730> aware<00:02:18.180> and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
so it's good to be a very aware and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.540 
so it's good to be a very aware and
making<00:02:19.560> sure<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.890> you're<00:02:20.010> living<00:02:20.250> a

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
making sure that you're living a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.830 
making sure that you're living a
balanced<00:02:21.540> life<00:02:21.930> when<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.530> comes<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.840> intimacy

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
balanced life when it comes to intimacy

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.880 
balanced life when it comes to intimacy
because<00:02:25.830> many<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.400> men<00:02:26.730> will<00:02:27.630> really<00:02:28.560> go

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
because many a men will really go

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.550 
because many a men will really go
through<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.280> process<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:30.300> depletion<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
through a process of depletion and the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.440 
through a process of depletion and the
brain<00:02:31.770> nerves<00:02:32.160> get<00:02:32.430> depleted<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.240> way<00:02:33.420> so

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
brain nerves get depleted in that way so

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.440 
brain nerves get depleted in that way so
I<00:02:33.900> always<00:02:34.740> keep<00:02:34.950> myself<00:02:35.160> up<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.850> up<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.270> V

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
I always keep myself up and up on the V

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.940 
I always keep myself up and up on the V
pollens<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.350> don't<00:02:37.590> have<00:02:37.710> to

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
pollens so that I don't have to

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.770 
pollens so that I don't have to
experience<00:02:38.490> any<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.880> brain<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.540> nerve

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
experience any of that brain and nerve

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.840 
experience any of that brain and nerve
degeneration<00:02:40.110> which<00:02:40.920> comes<00:02:41.190> from<00:02:41.400> too<00:02:41.640> much

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
degeneration which comes from too much

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.230 
degeneration which comes from too much
of<00:02:42.830> activity<00:02:43.830> I'll<00:02:44.250> leave<00:02:44.460> it<00:02:44.550> at<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.670> this

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
of activity I'll leave it at that this

of activity I'll leave it at that this
