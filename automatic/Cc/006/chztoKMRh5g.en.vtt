three<00:00:21.180> three<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.779> only<00:00:22.369> firmware<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.550> is

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
three three is the only firmware that is

three three is the only firmware that is
supported<00:00:24.090> thus<00:00:24.240> far<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.170> there's<00:00:25.350> still<00:00:25.470> kind

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
supported thus far so there's still kind

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.200 
supported thus far so there's still kind
of<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.859> gray<00:00:26.039> area<00:00:26.070> around<00:00:26.609> whether<00:00:26.910> or<00:00:27.090> not

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
some of the older firmware will be

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.290 
some of the older firmware will be
supportive<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.340> know<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.640> does<00:00:29.849> work<00:00:30.090> with

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
supportive but I know it does work with

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.630 
supportive but I know it does work with
433<00:00:31.199> which<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:31.679> I'm<00:00:31.769> running<00:00:32.040> here<00:00:32.070> so
