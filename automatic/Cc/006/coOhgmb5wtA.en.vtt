smoothing<00:01:29.820> from<00:01:30.630> Ella's<00:01:30.960> L<00:01:31.610> which<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.790> really

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
smoothing from Ella's L which is really

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.930 
smoothing from Ella's L which is really
an<00:01:33.270> asset<00:01:33.570> when<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.799> go<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> little<00:01:35.189> quicker

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
an asset when you go a little quicker

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.960 
an asset when you go a little quicker
so<00:01:37.840> basically<00:01:38.290> all<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.650> painting<00:01:39.070> is<00:01:39.280> is<00:01:39.550> fine

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
so basically all the painting is is fine

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.810 
so basically all the painting is is fine
but<00:01:40.540> it's<00:01:40.690> not<00:01:40.840> an<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.110> it's<00:01:41.500> more<00:01:41.710> like<00:01:41.890> a<00:01:41.920> B<00:01:42.790> or

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
but it's not an a it's more like a B or

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.450 
but it's not an a it's more like a B or
B<00:01:43.150> minus<00:01:43.630> because<00:01:43.990> if<00:01:44.110> there's<00:01:44.290> little<00:01:44.770> little

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
B minus because if there's little little

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.560 
B minus because if there's little little
masks<00:01:45.910> maybe<00:01:46.150> you<00:01:46.300> can<00:01:46.510> see<00:01:46.840> this<00:01:47.170> as<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:49.420> can

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
masks maybe you can see this as you can

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.860
