00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.689 

alright<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.559> what<00:00:55.680> we're<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.250> do<00:00:56.460> then

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
alright so what we're going to do then

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.750 
alright so what we're going to do then
is<00:00:57.920> technically<00:00:58.920> none<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> particle

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
is technically none of the particle

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.099 
is technically none of the particle
effects<00:00:59.969> are<00:01:00.120> different<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.660> spells<00:01:00.899> are

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
effects are different for spells are

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.900 
effects are different for spells are
they<00:01:01.559> look<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.010> same<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.640> know<00:01:02.730> I'm<00:01:02.789> just

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
they look the same but you know I'm just

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.009 
they look the same but you know I'm just
going<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.059> go<00:01:03.120> show<00:01:03.390> them<00:01:03.449> off<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.870> look

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
going to go show them off so you look

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.270 
going to go show them off so you look
what<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.559> see<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> new<00:01:05.070> model

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
what you can see what the new model

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.539 
what you can see what the new model
looks<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.760> while<00:01:06.330> casting<00:01:06.600> these<00:01:06.869> spells

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
looks like while casting these spells

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.350 
looks like while casting these spells
the<00:01:08.549> W<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.900> Q<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.340> snake<00:01:11.610> fangs<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
the W is the Q is the snake fangs and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.170 
the W is the Q is the snake fangs and
twin<00:01:12.810> Fang<00:01:13.549> may<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.610> well<00:01:14.760> go<00:01:14.909> use<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
twin Fang may as well go use the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.390 
twin Fang may as well go use the
all-time<00:01:15.869> misfortune<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.740> suppose<00:01:17.009> she's<00:01:17.220> down

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
all-time misfortune I suppose she's down

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.070 
all-time misfortune I suppose she's down
here<00:01:17.430> somewhere<00:01:17.790> though<00:01:18.030> she<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.990> we're

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
here somewhere though she is so we're

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.359 
here somewhere though she is so we're
just<00:01:19.110> going<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.380> run<00:01:19.560> down<00:01:19.799> here<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.520> quick

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
just going to run down here really quick

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.560 
just going to run down here really quick
cast<00:01:23.369> all<00:01:23.580> our<00:01:23.610> spells<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.210> go<00:01:24.360> get<00:01:24.479> her

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
cast all our spells and go get her

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.179 
cast all our spells and go get her
killed<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.140> then<00:01:25.500> probably<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.890> recall

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
killed and then probably do a recall

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.870 
killed and then probably do a recall
animation<00:01:26.700> some<00:01:28.369> you<00:01:29.369> know<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.579> don't<00:01:29.670> need

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
animation some you know we don't need

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.929 
animation some you know we don't need
her<00:01:30.000> which<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:31.710> long<00:01:31.860> nose<00:01:32.100> there<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:37.939> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
her which is the long nose there and the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.069 
her which is the long nose there and the
fastest<00:01:39.329> way<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.479> get<00:01:39.630> her<00:01:39.720> killed<00:01:39.930> is

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
fastest way to get her killed is

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.990 
fastest way to get her killed is
probably<00:01:40.320> dragon<00:01:40.799> what's<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
probably dragon what's up here so is the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.109 
probably dragon what's up here so is the
death<00:01:42.150> animation<00:01:42.659> then<00:01:42.899> recall<00:01:43.229> animation<00:01:44.119> if

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
death animation then recall animation if

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.460 
death animation then recall animation if
she<00:01:45.270> even<00:01:45.329> has<00:01:45.570> what<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:45.720> call<00:01:45.780> an<00:01:46.020> i<00:01:46.079> should<00:01:46.350> go

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
she even has what we call an i should go

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.620 
she even has what we call an i should go
to<00:01:46.530> think<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.890> don't<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.040> if<00:01:47.130> she<00:01:47.220> does

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
to think of it I don't know if she does

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.750 
to think of it I don't know if she does
yeah<00:01:48.630> what

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.770 

oh<00:01:53.830> she<00:01:54.830> definitely<00:01:54.920> does<00:01:55.220> not<00:01:55.250> have<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.270> recon

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
oh she definitely does not have a recon

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.610 
oh she definitely does not have a recon
mission<00:01:56.930> I<00:01:57.260> don't<00:01:57.440> think<00:01:59.290> let's<00:02:00.290> recall
