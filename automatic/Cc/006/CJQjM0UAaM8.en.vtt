00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.570 
I look at the Australian players I
probably<00:01:04.470> got<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.710> bit<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.010> biased<00:01:05.369> view

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
probably got a bit of a biased view

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.210 
probably got a bit of a biased view
because<00:01:05.820> i<00:01:06.240> was<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.689> team<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:08.010> came

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
to know what the strengths are our

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.600 
to know what the strengths are our
defense<00:01:10.560> tends<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.950> always<00:01:10.979> drop<00:01:11.400> off<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
defense tends to always drop off a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.890 
defense tends to always drop off a
little<00:01:11.820> bit<00:01:11.970> when<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.180> play<00:01:12.330> against<00:01:12.540> faster

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
little bit when you play against faster

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.570

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
rather than an 18 months time and you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.740 
rather than an 18 months time and you
know<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.700> tweaking<00:01:57.060> with<00:01:57.210> things<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
know it's just tweaking with things and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.709 
know it's just tweaking with things and
the<00:01:58.320> team's<00:01:58.560> constantly<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.610> we<00:02:00.270> unless

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the team's constantly you know we unless

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.240 
the team's constantly you know we unless
you're<00:02:00.960> having<00:02:01.290> players<00:02:01.560> week<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.219> week

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
you're having players week in and week

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.999 
you're having players week in and week
out<00:02:02.549> you're<00:02:03.270> constantly<00:02:03.659> hum<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.890> know

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
out you're constantly hum to you know

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.029 
out you're constantly hum to you know
real<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.909> if<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.270> like<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.719> as<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.740> say<00:02:08.009> I

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
real and if you like and as I say I

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.369 
real and if you like and as I say I
think<00:02:08.310> after<00:02:08.459> halftime<00:02:08.869> we<00:02:09.869> looked<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.259> lot

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
think after halftime we looked a lot

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.730 
think after halftime we looked a lot
tighter<00:02:10.730> defensively

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
tighter defensively

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.500 
tighter defensively
we<00:02:12.800> have<00:02:12.950> different<00:02:13.280> players<00:02:13.460> who<00:02:13.910> are<00:02:14.240> so

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
we have different players who are so

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.450 
we have different players who are so
comfortable<00:02:14.840> on<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.260> ball<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.710> think<00:02:15.950> with

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
comfortable on the ball and I think with

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.220 
comfortable on the ball and I think with
the<00:02:16.610> evolution<00:02:17.030> of<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.240> game<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.780> can't<00:02:17.990> have

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
the evolution of the game you can't have

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.870 
the evolution of the game you can't have
just<00:02:18.260> defenders<00:02:18.950> who<00:02:19.070> go<00:02:19.190> in<00:02:19.310> for<00:02:19.460> tacos<00:02:19.760> you

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
just defenders who go in for tacos you

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.220 
just defenders who go in for tacos you
can't<00:02:20.060> have<00:02:20.240> defenders<00:02:20.600> who<00:02:20.720> don't<00:02:20.870> want<00:02:21.110> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
can't have defenders who don't want the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.600 
can't have defenders who don't want the
ball<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.560> need<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.770> be<00:02:21.860> able<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.130> create<00:02:22.280> out

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
ball you need to be able to create out

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.180 
ball you need to be able to create out
of<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.820> back<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.240> have<00:02:23.450> players<00:02:23.690> like

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
of the back so you have players like

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.130 
of the back so you have players like
like<00:02:25.190> crystal<00:02:25.550> done<00:02:25.730> like<00:02:26.180> Meghan

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
like crystal done like Meghan

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.020 
like crystal done like Meghan
Klingenberg<00:02:27.260> not<00:02:28.040> very<00:02:28.340> much<00:02:28.490> experience<00:02:28.940> but

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
Klingenberg not very much experience but

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.460 
Klingenberg not very much experience but
they<00:02:29.240> want<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.750> ball<00:02:29.900> at<00:02:29.990> their<00:02:30.080> feet<00:02:30.260> and

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
they want the ball at their feet and

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.930 
they want the ball at their feet and
they<00:02:30.590> will<00:02:30.710> connect<00:02:31.040> passes<00:02:31.430> five-yard

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
they will connect passes five-yard

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.280 
they will connect passes five-yard
classes<00:02:32.360> they<00:02:32.510> don't<00:02:32.660> just<00:02:32.780> get<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.050> ball<00:02:33.170> and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
classes they don't just get the ball and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.680 
classes they don't just get the ball and
bang<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.470> long<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.250> think<00:02:34.610> it's<00:02:34.850> um<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.420> shows

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
bang it long so I think it's um it shows

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.180 
bang it long so I think it's um it shows
what<00:02:35.810> kind<00:02:35.990> of<00:02:36.020> style<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.380> Defense<00:02:36.740> he<00:02:36.920> wants

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
what kind of style of Defense he wants

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.680 
what kind of style of Defense he wants
by<00:02:37.310> bringing<00:02:37.610> in<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.880> particular<00:02:38.480> players

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
by bringing in the particular players

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
it's really just continued to grow and

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.310 
it's really just continued to grow and
you<00:03:01.460> know<00:03:01.580> it's<00:03:02.120> proud<00:03:02.450> walking<00:03:02.900> on<00:03:03.020> two<00:03:03.170> out
