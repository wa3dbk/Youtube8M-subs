a<00:00:23.689> slapshot<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> discreet<00:00:25.680> skill<00:00:26.039> because

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
a slapshot is a discreet skill because

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.490 
a slapshot is a discreet skill because
it<00:00:26.550> has<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> definite<00:00:27.270> beginning<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.960> end<00:00:28.230> it

it has a definite beginning and end it
is<00:00:28.890> an<00:00:29.039> open<00:00:29.310> skill<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.759> a<00:00:29.849> game<00:00:30.060> situation

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
is an open skill in a game situation

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.330 
is an open skill in a game situation
because<00:00:31.079> the<00:00:31.259> player<00:00:31.500> would<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.829> responding

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
because the player would be responding

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.340 
because the player would be responding
to<00:00:32.489> an<00:00:32.579> unpredictable<00:00:33.210> changing<00:00:33.809> environment

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
to an unpredictable changing environment

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.860 
to an unpredictable changing environment
where<00:00:34.739> they<00:00:34.829> have<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.160> make<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> quick<00:00:35.640> decision

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
where they have to make a quick decision

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.150 
where they have to make a quick decision
for<00:00:36.870> example<00:00:37.350> when<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.770> where<00:00:37.920> they<00:00:38.040> are

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
for example when and where they are

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.799 
for example when and where they are
going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.460> shoot<00:00:38.699> based<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> position<00:00:39.480> of

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
closed skill in a practice setting

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.990 
closed skill in a practice setting
because<00:00:43.949> it<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.220> done<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.580> a<00:00:44.670> predictable

because it is done in a predictable

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.820 
because it is done in a predictable
environment<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:46.080> athlete<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.530> make<00:00:46.680> the

decisions as we observe these two
athletes<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.420> compare<00:00:51.809> three<00:00:52.079> different

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
athletes we can compare three different

athletes we can compare three different
phases<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.980> complete<00:00:53.339> the<00:00:53.489> skill<00:00:53.760> this

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
phases that complete the skill this

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.360 
phases that complete the skill this
includes<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> preparation<00:00:55.410> phase<00:00:55.559> execution

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
includes the preparation phase execution

includes the preparation phase execution
phase<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.850> follow-through<00:00:57.210> phase<00:00:57.629> for

phase and follow-through phase for
example<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> backswing<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.579> appropriation
