00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
rather large damaged bone the reason why

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.610 
rather large damaged bone the reason why
i<00:02:40.550> viaggi<00:02:40.850> balance<00:02:41.480> from<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.720> first<00:02:41.990> place<00:02:42.260> is

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
i viaggi balance from the first place is

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.010 
i viaggi balance from the first place is
the<00:02:43.070> fact<00:02:43.520> that<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.730> has<00:02:43.880> extremely<00:02:44.270> high<00:02:44.420> RPM

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
the fact that it has extremely high RPM

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.740 
the fact that it has extremely high RPM
where<00:02:45.710> we<00:02:45.890> grow<00:02:46.100> but<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.730> damage<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.210> below

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
where we grow but the damage is below

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.320 
where we grow but the damage is below
fertilizer<00:02:48.380> epithelial<00:02:49.190> power<00:02:49.570> alright<00:02:50.570> this

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
fertilizer epithelial power alright this

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.530 
fertilizer epithelial power alright this
again<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:54.950> think<00:02:55.670> so<00:02:55.970> those<00:02:56.120> from<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.540> game
