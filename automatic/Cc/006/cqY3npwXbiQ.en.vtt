00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.620 
don't have two lamb to do this now what
it'll<00:02:37.890> do<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.190> if<00:02:38.519> I<00:02:38.640> press<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.090> switch<00:02:41.630> this

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
it'll do is if I press the switch this

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.370 
it'll do is if I press the switch this
is<00:02:42.780> actually<00:02:43.109> how<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.260> fly<00:02:43.620> inverted<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:46.260> when

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
is actually how you fly inverted so when

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.470 
is actually how you fly inverted so when
you<00:02:46.500> press<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.920> switch<00:02:46.950> as<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:47.910> saw<00:02:48.180> me<00:02:48.329> did

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
you press the switch as you saw me did

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.980 
you press the switch as you saw me did
before<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:48.959> I'll<00:02:49.019> do<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.230> again<00:02:49.320> here

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.560 

whatever<00:02:53.800> way<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.100> bang<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.670> stick<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.330> quad

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
whatever way you bang the stick the quad

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.810 
whatever way you bang the stick the quad
will<00:02:55.780> flip<00:02:56.020> over<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:56.470> direction<00:02:56.710> so<00:02:57.250> do<00:02:57.670> this

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
will flip over that direction so do this

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:11.530 
will flip over that direction so do this
again<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:03.010> now<00:03:03.190> I'm<00:03:03.280> flying<00:03:03.580> inverted

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.520 

and<00:03:12.540> if<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.780> see<00:03:12.930> me<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.140> press<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.500> button

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
and if you see me I press the button

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.619 
and if you see me I press the button
again

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
again

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.160 
again
that's<00:03:15.629> what<00:03:15.780> flips<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.140> back<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.810> these<00:03:18.989> are

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
that's what flips it back so these are

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.420 
that's what flips it back so these are
the<00:03:19.260> first<00:03:19.440> two<00:03:19.709> modes<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:20.099> you<00:03:20.160> should

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
the first two modes that you should

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.509 
the first two modes that you should
practice<00:03:20.910> in<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.480> should<00:03:21.540> practice<00:03:21.870> in

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
practice in and you should practice in

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.880 
practice in and you should practice in
light<00:03:23.519> left<00:03:23.819> edge<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.450> as<00:03:25.170> you're<00:03:25.319> seeing<00:03:25.530> here

here I'm hovering those in and this is
the<00:03:46.200> intermediate<00:03:46.470> mode<00:03:47.069> so<00:03:47.459> as<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.700> said<00:03:51.500> you

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
the intermediate mode so as I said you

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.960 
the intermediate mode so as I said you
want<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.769> learn<00:03:52.950> how<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.220> fly<00:03:53.700> in<00:03:53.879> all

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
want to learn how to fly in all

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.670 
want to learn how to fly in all
orientations<00:03:54.239> before<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.349> actually<00:03:57.680> advance

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
orientations before you actually advance

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.670 
orientations before you actually advance
to<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.250> most<00:03:59.750> difficult<00:04:00.750> which<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.290> 3d

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
to the most difficult which is the 3d

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.220 
to the most difficult which is the 3d
mode<00:04:01.890> so<00:04:02.370> as<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.209> said<00:04:03.420> before<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:03.930> want<00:04:04.110> to<00:04:04.170> go

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:15.020 
they'll be very comfortable flying your
quad<00:04:06.530> in<00:04:07.530> all<00:04:08.099> directions<00:04:13.340> what<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.370> would<00:04:14.609> tell

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
quad in all directions what I would tell

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.289 
quad in all directions what I would tell
you<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.239> learn<00:04:15.359> how<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.540> practice<00:04:15.780> too<00:04:16.289> is

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
you to learn how to practice too is

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:24.850 
you to learn how to practice too is
practice<00:04:18.299> line<00:04:18.570> inverted<00:04:19.200> to

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:32.920 

in<00:04:25.340> all<00:04:25.610> directions<00:04:25.789> like<00:04:26.389> knows<00:04:26.780> in<00:04:31.930> learn

in all directions like knows in learn
learn<00:04:33.680> basic<00:04:34.219> orientation<00:04:35.030> a<00:04:35.270> little<00:04:35.930> micro

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:36.319 
learn basic orientation a little micro

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:46.790 
learn basic orientation a little micro
quad<00:04:36.560> here

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.189 

and<00:04:47.280> then<00:04:47.610> once<00:04:48.030> you<00:04:48.210> feel<00:04:48.479> comfortable<00:04:48.660> doing

and then once you feel comfortable doing

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:56.089 
and then once you feel comfortable doing
that<00:04:49.349> do<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.340> little<00:04:50.520> nose<00:04:50.729> in<00:04:50.970> here<00:04:54.919> so<00:04:55.919> you<00:04:56.069> can

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
that do a little nose in here so you can

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:02.480 
that do a little nose in here so you can
even<00:04:56.520> flip<00:04:56.789> it<00:04:56.970> inverted<00:04:57.449> nose<00:04:57.629> in<00:05:01.280> just<00:05:02.280> get

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
even flip it inverted nose in just get

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.010 
even flip it inverted nose in just get
very<00:05:02.520> very<00:05:03.000> used<00:05:03.780> to<00:05:03.930> flying<00:05:04.289> the<00:05:04.500> quad<00:05:05.870> in<00:05:06.870> all

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
very very used to flying the quad in all

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.369 
very very used to flying the quad in all
directions<00:05:10.940> before<00:05:11.940> you<00:05:12.300> advance<00:05:12.599> on<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:13.199> the

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:13.379 
directions before you advance on to the

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:18.040 
directions before you advance on to the
third<00:05:13.650> level<00:05:13.860> so<00:05:14.639> I<00:05:14.940> hope<00:05:15.629> this<00:05:15.840> video<00:05:16.139> helps

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050
