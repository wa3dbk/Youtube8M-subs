00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
intuitive device we had an earlier

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.980 
intuitive device we had an earlier
version<00:01:40.490> last<00:01:40.880> year<00:01:41.119> but<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.390> years<00:01:41.659> is<00:01:41.840> so

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
version last year but this years is so

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.130 
version last year but this years is so
much<00:01:42.140> better<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.590> has<00:01:43.189> a<00:01:43.810> simple<00:01:44.810> wheel

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
much better it has a simple wheel

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.800 
much better it has a simple wheel
