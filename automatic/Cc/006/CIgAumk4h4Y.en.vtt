when<00:00:09.330> we're<00:00:09.480> looking<00:00:09.780> at<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.990> subject<00:00:10.260> for<00:00:10.650> a

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
when we're looking at a subject for a

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.270 
when we're looking at a subject for a
painting

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
painting

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.100 
painting
we're<00:00:11.400> often<00:00:11.550> captivated<00:00:12.389> by<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.570> center<00:00:13.019> of

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
we're often captivated by the center of

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.259 
we're often captivated by the center of
interest<00:00:13.530> it's<00:00:14.309> only<00:00:14.549> natural<00:00:14.820> then<00:00:15.240> that

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
interest it's only natural then that

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.240 
interest it's only natural then that
when<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:15.660> come<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.870> paint<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.440> we<00:00:16.710> want<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.100> get

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
when we come to paint it we want to get

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.580 
when we come to paint it we want to get
straight<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.910> detail<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:19.020> get<00:00:19.199> our<00:00:19.320> little

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
straight to the detail to get our little

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.560 
straight to the detail to get our little
brushes<00:00:19.949> out<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.369> work<00:00:20.699> on<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.060> until<00:00:21.420> it's

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
brushes out and work on this until it's

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.470 
brushes out and work on this until it's
just<00:00:21.600> right<00:00:22.310> sometimes<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.550> works<00:00:23.789> but<00:00:24.359> I've

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
just right sometimes that works but I've

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.970 
just right sometimes that works but I've
often<00:00:24.630> found<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.080> if<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.380> start<00:00:25.680> with<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
often found that if I start with the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.070 
often found that if I start with the
detail<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:27.119> rest<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> painting<00:00:27.960> will

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
detail the rest of the painting will

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.529 
detail the rest of the painting will
suffer<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.670> reason<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.330> I

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
suffer for it the reason for this I

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.930 
suffer for it the reason for this I
think<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:30.990> our<00:00:31.590> center<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.219> interest<00:00:32.610> is

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
think is that our center of interest is

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.700 
think is that our center of interest is
one<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.329> driving<00:00:33.630> forces<00:00:33.960> behind<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
one of the driving forces behind the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.340 
one of the driving forces behind the
painting<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.370> once<00:00:36.210> that's<00:00:36.510> done<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.079> like

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
painting and once that's done it's like

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.440 
painting and once that's done it's like
oh<00:00:37.620> well<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> guess<00:00:38.370> I'll<00:00:38.520> just<00:00:38.790> put<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.270> rest

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
oh well I guess I'll just put the rest

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.139 
oh well I guess I'll just put the rest
in<00:00:39.660> now<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.530> easy<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.070> lose<00:00:41.219> enthusiasm<00:00:42.030> for

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
in now it's easy to lose enthusiasm for

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.510 
in now it's easy to lose enthusiasm for
the<00:00:42.239> painting<00:00:42.719> when<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.680> focal<00:00:44.070> point<00:00:44.340> has

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the painting when the focal point has

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.940 
the painting when the focal point has
already<00:00:44.850> been<00:00:45.030> painted<00:00:45.410> also<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.590> easy<00:00:46.770> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
already been painted also it's easy to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.610 
already been painted also it's easy to
overdo<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> detail<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.270> focal<00:00:48.629> area<00:00:48.930> by

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
overdo the detail in a focal area by

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.650 
overdo the detail in a focal area by
pouring<00:00:50.070> all<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.399> starting<00:00:51.000> out<00:00:51.149> energy

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
pouring all that starting out energy

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.200 
pouring all that starting out energy
into<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:53.129> way<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.309> paint<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.760> lot<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.059> my<00:00:54.180> work

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
into it the way I paint a lot of my work

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.900 
into it the way I paint a lot of my work
is<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.899> opposite<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.550> think<00:00:56.579> of

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
is the opposite of this and I think of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.880 
is the opposite of this and I think of
it<00:00:57.000> as<00:00:57.210> setting<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.660> stage<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.559> actors

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
it as setting the stage for the actors

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.770 
it as setting the stage for the actors
to<00:00:58.920> work<00:00:59.219> upon<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.210> atmospheric

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
to work upon and the atmospheric

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.569 
to work upon and the atmospheric
perspective<00:01:00.930> lesson<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.770> referred<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.430> as

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
perspective lesson I referred to it as

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.670 
perspective lesson I referred to it as
smoothing<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> cushion<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> crown

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
smoothing the cushion for the crown

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.760 
smoothing the cushion for the crown
jewels<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.339> sit<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.869> basically<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.229> saving

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
jewels to sit on basically it's saving

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.250 
jewels to sit on basically it's saving
your<00:01:08.070> pudding<00:01:08.310> till<00:01:08.700> last<00:01:09.000> which<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.960> know<00:01:10.020> is

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
your pudding till last which I know is

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.289 
your pudding till last which I know is
hard<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.740> sometimes<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.909> know<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
hard to do sometimes you know you're a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.609 
hard to do sometimes you know you're a
grown-up<00:01:12.600> now<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.380> eat<00:01:13.500> your

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
grown-up now and you can eat your

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.950 
grown-up now and you can eat your
pudding<00:01:13.799> first<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.430> want<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:15.720> it

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
pudding first if you want to but it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.780 
pudding first if you want to but it
tastes<00:01:16.439> even<00:01:16.590> better<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.610> wait<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
tastes even better if you have to wait a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.810 
tastes even better if you have to wait a
bit<00:01:17.970> longer<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.830> use<00:01:20.070> big<00:01:20.340> brushes

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
bit longer for it so I use big brushes

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.880 
bit longer for it so I use big brushes
to<00:01:21.000> start<00:01:21.270> out<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.600> big<00:01:22.049> brushes<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.650> loose

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
to start out with big brushes and loose

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.130 
to start out with big brushes and loose
paint<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.180> loose<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
paint I can be as loose as I like to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.499 
paint I can be as loose as I like to
start<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.670> refine<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.270> as<00:01:27.390> I

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
start with because I can refine it as I

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.010 
start with because I can refine it as I
go<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:28.530> much<00:01:28.920> easier<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.729> refine<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.600> focal

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
go it's much easier to refine the focal

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.380 
go it's much easier to refine the focal
area<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.560> loose<00:01:31.799> painting<00:01:32.280> than<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.210> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
area of a loose painting than it is to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.149 
area of a loose painting than it is to
make<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.600> tight<00:01:33.990> painting<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> painterly

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
make a tight painting have a painterly

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.880 
make a tight painting have a painterly
look<00:01:35.570> my<00:01:36.570> rule<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.810> thumb<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.200> choosing<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
look my rule of thumb for choosing a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.039 
look my rule of thumb for choosing a
brush<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.640> find<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.090> biggest<00:01:39.329> one<00:01:39.840> you

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
brush is to find the biggest one you

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.469 
brush is to find the biggest one you
would<00:01:40.200> normally<00:01:40.560> use<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.850> use<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.270> next

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
would normally use and then use the next

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.230 
would normally use and then use the next
biggest<00:01:43.189> so<00:01:44.189> long<00:01:44.340> as<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.759> good<00:01:44.939> brush

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
biggest so long as it's a good brush

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.120 
biggest so long as it's a good brush
which<00:01:45.509> keeps<00:01:45.810> its<00:01:45.960> shape<00:01:46.020> you'll<00:01:46.740> still<00:01:47.040> be

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
which keeps its shape you'll still be

and this makes it more interesting for
them<00:02:27.700> as<00:02:27.820> well<00:02:28.030> because<00:02:28.209> it's<00:02:28.780> not<00:02:28.930> all

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
them as well because it's not all

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.600 
them as well because it's not all
spelled<00:02:29.590> out<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:29.950> them
