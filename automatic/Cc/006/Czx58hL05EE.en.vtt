00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:11.680
 Welcome to a pond for warhammer 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:15.370
 This is the second part of the first part 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.760
 I have the cork follow now right 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.340
 cut and the plastic cartal space 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.340
 cut to size and the whole already 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.510
 Now I have to do it properly 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.779
 let it dry and now it is called 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:36.250
 Next, apply the glue 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:39.820
 follow here on the corbrand and that 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.219
 Sprinkle sent and what I in 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.660
 In the meantime I had still done 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:48.219
 yes announced that this basket 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.600
 wreath pulled a bit together 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:54.730
 I had the white enderli 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.969
 thus emerged the supernumerary 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.610
 plastic carton quasi I have with 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:06.100
 cut off a cutter so that the 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:09.909
 now the clean again matches the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.119
 Bronx get sick and the base and then nothing 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.880
 survives more or so yes today 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.909
 we need brushes and can do it 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.840
 theoretically from a one knew then 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.909
 of course, line sand or others 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.429
 streusaterial what you put up there 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:34.240
 wanted this story here that I 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:38.859
 only later as a storage area for 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.219
 you will do that after the pool 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:49.259
 why do I do that then I do 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:54.929
 Later , the leyen is coming 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:57.159
 I take in one hand the puddles 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.520
 So it's not here on the newspaper 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.119
 otherwise it will only do everything 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.239
 stick together and so and wear 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.030
 with the other hand right out of here 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:13.080
 tube first 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.080
 a bit thin on 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.440
 of course I would like to avoid now 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.410
 the lamb on the later 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.630
 water surface this inner area 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:32.830
 but I just try the basket 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:42.880
 wreath the year the shore represents with 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:47.320
 to build the suffering so not yet 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.120
 but all now I wanted the whole 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.380
 only with the brush a bit 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.450
 she wants to be able to distribute in sontheim 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.490
 to take her really cheap brush 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.720
 just like you get to elementary school 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:06.820
 extend any brush for 50 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:10.960
 cent or so and then I pass away 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:14.820
 that now as evenly and as possible 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:18.490
 do not try to get under the edge 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.580
 so that I do not come under the base 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.620
 with the glue because otherwise afterwards too 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.460
 st may stick 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.990
 and then I would have under my base 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.230
 also still sand and that is natural 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:36.580
 not what I want and that would be 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.550
 also the stand on the table of 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.760
 change this whole project again 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.270
 in one direction was actually when 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.270
 I would like to have 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.350
 I distribute it first and you see 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.350
 the timelapse 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.180
 so that was the first step that was the 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.290
 new history which is now at 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:05.070
 short side the brush should be as possible 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.820
 Rinse out in a timely manner is best 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.090
 warm water 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:14.470
 and then he stays for a while 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.670
 get here now just like that 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.190
 now comes the clou with this 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.160
 history 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:24.900
 that should be relatively small so that 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.400
 can put the pool on it and 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.790
 anyway to the edge of the place 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.290
 I 'm just avoiding that now 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.080
 if somehow on the sides 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.210
 little bit of suffering running under space 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.940
 should or so it's directly one 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:44.790
 sticking newspaper but that's what I have 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:55.150
 just some distance and now 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:06:00.190
 I take my velvet and if possible 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:03.460
 of course, so that's all that wild before 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:07.720
 with lame a blacksmith radio total 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.170
 get caught and do not recommend anything 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.170
 life goes 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:24.400
 but to have you big this is how it works here 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:27.160
 happens too little because that's what 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:34.360
 does not stick that falls anyway 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:41.290
 easy again from now I leave that 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:44.320
 whole stand and dry and then if 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:47.530
 it is dry i can shake it off 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.750
 and the total surpluses will be in the 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.590
 newspaper 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.890
 folded up and just again 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.030
 returned 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:07:00.610
 and the next step would be already 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:05.560
 times I would now that I watch at 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:08.100
 this 0 5 mm plastic carton that there 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.950
 but only slight curvature takes place 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:14.130
 really maybe the next time 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:17.500
 equal to a millimeter plastic card 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:21.280
 Do the whole thing that I believe 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:26.350
 the safe side is good in part 3 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:29.040
 then the painting and until the next 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.040
 bye bye
