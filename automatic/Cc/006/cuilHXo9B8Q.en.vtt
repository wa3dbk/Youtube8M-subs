my hair the first steps of this process
is<00:00:09.000> actually<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.599> separate<00:00:10.110> my<00:00:10.320> hair<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.710> so

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
is actually to separate my hair and so

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.640 
is actually to separate my hair and so
for<00:00:11.190> separate<00:00:11.759> sections<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.480> always<00:00:13.259> do<00:00:13.500> this

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
for separate sections I always do this

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.109 
for separate sections I always do this
before<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.160> wash<00:00:14.610> my<00:00:15.269> hair<00:00:15.560> I<00:00:16.560> will<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.880> hang

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
before I wash my hair I will this hang

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.730 
before I wash my hair I will this hang
go<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.570> shower<00:00:18.779> with<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> wide<00:00:19.410> tooth<00:00:19.710> comb

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
go in the shower with a wide tooth comb

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.220 
go in the shower with a wide tooth comb
but<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.400> always<00:00:20.670> do<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.300> first<00:00:21.689> because<00:00:22.080> it

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
but I always do this first because it

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.920 
but I always do this first because it
makes<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.560> little<00:00:22.680> bit<00:00:22.890> easier<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.930> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
makes it a little bit easier and the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.630 
makes it a little bit easier and the
shampoo<00:00:25.320> will<00:00:25.470> kind<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.800> match<00:00:26.039> your<00:00:26.279> hair<00:00:26.460> up

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
shampoo will kind of match your hair up

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.790 
shampoo will kind of match your hair up
a<00:00:26.789> little<00:00:26.970> bit<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> lot<00:00:28.170> better<00:00:28.349> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
a little bit so this is a lot better to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.679 
a little bit so this is a lot better to
kind<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.310> gently<00:00:29.730> detangle<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.539> your

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
fingers first and then follow up with

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.430 
fingers first and then follow up with
the<00:00:33.000> comb<00:00:33.210> once<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.780> conditioner<00:00:34.350> in

your hair so the first thing you want to

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.600

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
now I'm choosing to use coconut butter

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.350 
now I'm choosing to use coconut butter
this<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.340> definitely<00:00:41.730> different<00:00:42.270> from

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
this is definitely different from

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.540 
this is definitely different from
coconut<00:00:42.809> oil<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.590> made<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.190> full

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
coconut oil as is made out of the full

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.729 
coconut oil as is made out of the full
coconut<00:00:45.239> poke<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> oil<00:00:46.530> that's

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
coconut poke not just the oil that's

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.860 
coconut poke not just the oil that's
separated<00:00:47.309> from<00:00:47.489> me<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> first<00:00:48.719> thing

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
separated from me so the first thing

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.319 
separated from me so the first thing
that<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.079> do<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.590> take<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.309> section<00:00:50.940> and

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
that I do is I take that one section and

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.010 
that I do is I take that one section and
I<00:00:51.719> totally<00:00:52.289> saturate<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.489> section<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
I totally saturate that section with the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.020 
I totally saturate that section with the
coconut<00:00:55.469> butter<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:56.100> makes<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.520> easier<00:00:56.910> for

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
coconut butter it makes it easier for

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.260 
coconut butter it makes it easier for
your<00:00:57.360> strands<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.960> glide<00:00:58.230> through<00:00:58.590> each<00:00:58.770> other

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
your strands to glide through each other

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.729 
your strands to glide through each other
without<00:01:00.270> getting<00:01:00.780> tangled<00:01:01.050> up<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
without getting tangled up in the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.460 
without getting tangled up in the
process<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.430> then<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> separated<00:01:03.809> gently<00:01:04.260> with

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
process and then I separated gently with

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.280 
process and then I separated gently with
my<00:01:04.619> fingers<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:06.060> I'm<00:01:06.479> going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.810> separate<00:01:07.170> it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290

my fingers and I'm going to separate it
into<00:01:07.439> three<00:01:07.619> sections<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:09.390> work<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.930> smaller

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
into three sections to work in smaller

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
that could be trapped I can actually

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.950 
that could be trapped I can actually
pull<00:01:50.020> those<00:01:50.260> shares<00:01:50.920> right<00:01:51.670> out<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.690> so<00:01:52.840> I'll

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
pull those shares right out and so I'll

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.250 
pull those shares right out and so I'll
start<00:01:53.050> on<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.560> top<00:01:53.830> only<00:01:54.100> because<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.840> top<00:01:56.110> of

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
start on the top only because the top of

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.380 
start on the top only because the top of
my<00:01:56.410> hair<00:01:56.619> at<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.950> root<00:01:57.220> side<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:57.880> know<00:01:58.000> play

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
my hair at the root side you know play

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.719 
my hair at the root side you know play
with<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:58.690> so<00:01:58.900> much<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.380> make<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.740> bigger<00:01:59.950> that

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
with you so much to make it bigger that

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.190 
with you so much to make it bigger that
it<00:02:00.880> actually<00:02:01.030> gives<00:02:01.330> really<00:02:01.570> tangled<00:02:02.110> up

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
it actually gives really tangled up

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.770 
it actually gives really tangled up
there<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:03.009> so<00:02:03.220> I<00:02:03.250> go<00:02:03.610> start<00:02:04.240> from<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.540> very

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
there and so I go start from the very

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.130 
there and so I go start from the very
top<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.110> I<00:02:05.350> just<00:02:05.619> glad<00:02:06.250> my<00:02:06.520> fingers<00:02:07.090> down<00:02:07.330> over

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
top and I just glad my fingers down over

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.620 
top and I just glad my fingers down over
each<00:02:08.350> hair<00:02:08.619> strand<00:02:08.790> that<00:02:09.790> allows<00:02:10.119> me<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:10.600> I

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
each hair strand that allows me so I

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.720 
each hair strand that allows me so I
really<00:02:11.050> feel<00:02:11.230> my<00:02:11.470> strands<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.070> so<00:02:12.190> really<00:02:12.400> you

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
really feel my strands and so really you

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.060 
really feel my strands and so really you
know<00:02:12.910> catch<00:02:13.420> any<00:02:13.690> knots<00:02:14.020> that<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.410> may<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.830> and

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
know catch any knots that I may have and

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.800 
know catch any knots that I may have and
so<00:02:15.160> as<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.489> can<00:02:15.610> see<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.850> caught<00:02:16.120> him<00:02:16.239> not<00:02:16.450> here

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
so as you can see I caught him not here

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.600 
so as you can see I caught him not here
and<00:02:17.110> I'm<00:02:17.560> gonna<00:02:17.770> you<00:02:18.130> know<00:02:18.250> work<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.670> out<00:02:20.610> it's

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
and I'm gonna you know work it out it's

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.340 
and I'm gonna you know work it out it's
almost<00:02:21.730> like<00:02:22.090> if<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.420> were<00:02:22.600> styling<00:02:23.200> your

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
almost like if you were styling your

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.990 
almost like if you were styling your
hair<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.739> just<00:02:23.890> wanted<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.310> separate<00:02:24.850> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
hair you just wanted to separate the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.800 
hair you just wanted to separate the
curls<00:02:25.209> from<00:02:25.480> each<00:02:25.690> other<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:28.390> do<00:02:28.450> this

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
curls from each other and I do this

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.110 
curls from each other and I do this
until<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.530> feel<00:02:29.890> very<00:02:30.430> comfortable<00:02:30.989> with<00:02:33.120> very

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
until I feel very comfortable with very

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.880 
until I feel very comfortable with very
comfortable<00:02:34.450> there<00:02:34.959> I've<00:02:35.140> gotten<00:02:35.560> like<00:02:35.739> all

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
comfortable there I've gotten like all

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.830 
comfortable there I've gotten like all
of<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.220> knots<00:02:37.090> out<00:02:37.360> in<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:38.260> section<00:02:39.720> some<00:02:40.720> of

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
of the knots out in that section some of

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.080 
of the knots out in that section some of
the<00:02:40.930> benefits<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.730> detangling<00:02:42.730> with<00:02:42.910> your

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
the benefits of detangling with your

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.150 
the benefits of detangling with your
fingers<00:02:43.510> first<00:02:43.810> especially<00:02:44.410> before<00:02:44.560> using<00:02:44.950> a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
fingers first especially before using a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.460 
fingers first especially before using a
comb<00:02:45.370> if<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.670> choose<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:45.970> do<00:02:46.299> that<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:46.810> it

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
comb if you choose to do that is it

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.229 
comb if you choose to do that is it
gently<00:02:47.709> removes<00:02:47.799> any<00:02:48.340> tangles<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:49.060> shade

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
gently removes any tangles and shade

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.680 
gently removes any tangles and shade
here<00:02:49.660> I've<00:02:50.470> gotten<00:02:50.739> less<00:02:51.010> breakage<00:02:51.580> with<00:02:52.450> this

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
here I've gotten less breakage with this

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.660 
here I've gotten less breakage with this
you<00:02:53.080> know<00:02:53.200> cuz<00:02:53.350> sometimes<00:02:53.380> when<00:02:53.769> using<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.340> comb

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
you know cuz sometimes when using a comb

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.520 
you know cuz sometimes when using a comb
you're<00:02:54.910> really<00:02:55.239> just<00:02:55.540> pulling<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.080> snapping

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
you're really just pulling and snapping

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.140 
you're really just pulling and snapping
your<00:02:56.560> strands<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.190> might<00:02:57.370> not<00:02:57.519> necessarily<00:02:57.670> be

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
your strands it might not necessarily be

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.570 
your strands it might not necessarily be
detangling<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:59.049> but<00:02:59.650> with<00:02:59.799> my<00:02:59.950> fingers<00:03:00.430> I

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
detangling it but with my fingers I

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.250 
detangling it but with my fingers I
could<00:03:00.790> fill<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.209> tangles<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.810> can<00:03:02.019> feel

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
could fill the tangles and I can feel

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.960 
could fill the tangles and I can feel
things<00:03:02.500> that<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.799> wouldn't<00:03:03.160> necessarily<00:03:03.280> feel

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
things that I wouldn't necessarily feel

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.199 
things that I wouldn't necessarily feel
with<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.299> comb<00:03:05.519> another<00:03:06.519> reason<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:06.850> like<00:03:07.030> this

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
with a comb another reason I like this

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.789 
with a comb another reason I like this
is<00:03:07.390> because<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:07.690> can<00:03:07.840> feel<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.230> split<00:03:08.560> ends

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
is because you can feel the split ends

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.800 
is because you can feel the split ends
and<00:03:08.980> those<00:03:09.250> like<00:03:09.519> little<00:03:09.730> single<00:03:10.510> strand

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
and those like little single strand

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.229 
and those like little single strand
knots<00:03:10.989> that<00:03:11.230> you<00:03:11.290> make<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.769> so<00:03:12.459> what<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:12.760> do<00:03:12.880> is

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
knots that you make it so what I do is

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.840 
knots that you make it so what I do is
if<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.630> catch<00:03:14.230> any<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.560> those<00:03:14.860> in<00:03:15.130> there<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.610> use

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
if I catch any of those in there I use

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.880 
if I catch any of those in there I use
that<00:03:16.150> as<00:03:16.299> my<00:03:16.329> opportunity<00:03:16.690> it's<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:17.799> know

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
that as my opportunity it's you know

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.830 
that as my opportunity it's you know
snip<00:03:18.250> those<00:03:18.459> eyes<00:03:18.700> I<00:03:18.730> see<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.510> comb

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
snip those eyes I see it and a comb

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.150 
snip those eyes I see it and a comb
would<00:03:20.079> just<00:03:20.290> rip<00:03:20.560> right<00:03:20.590> through<00:03:20.860> this

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
would just rip right through this

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.970 
would just rip right through this
section<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.480> allows<00:03:22.810> me<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.440> not<00:03:23.620> rip

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
section and this allows me to not rip

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.009 
section and this allows me to not rip
through<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.280> section<00:03:24.670> at<00:03:24.790> all<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.269> also<00:03:25.660> by

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
through the section at all and also by

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.590 
through the section at all and also by
doing<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.829> makes<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.400> so<00:03:27.670> much<00:03:27.940> easier<00:03:28.239> to

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
doing this it makes it so much easier to

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.900 
doing this it makes it so much easier to
shampoo<00:03:29.410> my<00:03:29.620> hair<00:03:29.650> my<00:03:30.100> hair<00:03:30.130> is<00:03:30.340> not<00:03:30.549> getting

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
shampoo my hair my hair is not getting

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.420 
shampoo my hair my hair is not getting
matted<00:03:31.420> with<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.720> shampoo<00:03:32.140> in<00:03:32.320> there<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:33.040> it

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
matted with the shampoo in there and it

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.910 
matted with the shampoo in there and it
also<00:03:33.610> makes<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.180> easier<00:03:34.450> once<00:03:35.110> I<00:03:35.320> grab<00:03:35.620> my

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
also makes it easier once I grab my

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.960 
also makes it easier once I grab my
conditioner<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.209> detangle<00:03:37.989> so<00:03:38.919> once<00:03:39.280> i<00:03:39.519> have

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
conditioner and detangle so once i have

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.670 
conditioner and detangle so once i have
done<00:03:40.239> detangle<00:03:40.840> in<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:41.109> full<00:03:41.380> section

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
done detangle in that full section

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.069 
done detangle in that full section
I<00:03:42.739> just<00:03:43.069> twist<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.640> up<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:44.060> so<00:03:44.269> in<00:03:44.629> this<00:03:44.870> one

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
I just twist it up and so in this one

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.649 
I just twist it up and so in this one
section<00:03:45.319> I'm<00:03:45.590> going<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.859> end<00:03:46.069> up<00:03:46.250> with<00:03:46.459> about

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
section I'm going to end up with about

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.270 
section I'm going to end up with about
three<00:03:47.659> twists<00:03:48.109> it<00:03:48.439> does<00:03:48.680> take<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:48.920> little<00:03:49.099> bit

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
three twists it does take a little bit

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.470 
three twists it does take a little bit
longer<00:03:49.640> it's<00:03:49.939> a<00:03:49.969> little<00:03:50.209> bit<00:03:50.329> more

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
longer it's a little bit more

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.809 
longer it's a little bit more
time-consuming<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.980> add<00:03:52.159> this<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.670> your

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
time-consuming to add this to your

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.690 
time-consuming to add this to your
process<00:03:53.299> but<00:03:53.329> I<00:03:53.599> add<00:03:53.930> this<00:03:54.170> process<00:03:54.680> when<00:03:54.980> I<00:03:55.010> do

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
process but I add this process when I do

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.750 
process but I add this process when I do
my<00:03:55.879> hot<00:03:56.120> oil<00:03:56.359> treatments<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.230> I've<00:03:58.040> benefited

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
my hot oil treatments and I've benefited

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.690 
my hot oil treatments and I've benefited
so<00:03:58.939> much<00:03:59.000> from<00:03:59.239> this<00:04:00.019> it<00:04:00.230> allows<00:04:00.469> me<00:04:00.769> to<00:04:00.980> retain

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
so much from this it allows me to retain

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.030 
so much from this it allows me to retain
my<00:04:01.939> length<00:04:02.209> that<00:04:02.900> I'm<00:04:03.049> getting<00:04:03.439> and<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:03.739> allows

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
my length that I'm getting and it allows

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.929 
my length that I'm getting and it allows
me<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.549> be<00:04:04.900> gentle<00:04:06.159> instead<00:04:07.159> of<00:04:07.310> just<00:04:07.519> taking<00:04:07.700> a

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:07.939
