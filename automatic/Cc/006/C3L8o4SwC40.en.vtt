00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.700
 Sir, there have been a lot of gossips about the rings lately. 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.000
 We received news that Cevizlibağ and many students were waiting in front of the campus. 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.700
 The word is not dissatisfied with many of them and an action is spreading from ear to mouth. 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.100
 The fact that they have tweeted into the ring until his lungs fade, proves that. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.200
 Most of them did not come to class, why did they come? 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.600
 Sir ... Visas ... 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.700
 1 week to visas ... 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.400
 They come to school and collect lecture notes. Some of them are going to the library. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.400
 Everybody, except the senior. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 How many money do these rings? 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.500
 This is YTU! It's not a playground! 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.300
 Many students dream of this school. 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 What do we do if they know about this? 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.400
 We can't wash the child's dreams, it doesn't suit us. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.400
 Campus is the most popular place in Istanbul ... 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.400
 Metro, tram, metrobus are all there! 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.100
 Why can't they reach school when there are so many possibilities? 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.800
 Sir, the problem is to reach the faculties ... 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.900
 What's going on? 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.800
 But sir, winter is coming! 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.600
 Leave the winter, campus 4 seasons cold already ... 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.600
 I'm tired of seeing a ring tweet. 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.100
 It's like they were born with Ringle! 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.700
 They're coming to school, it's not clear to ride the ring ... 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.000
 When he won the school, he was doing well with his name under the name of YTU. 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.300
 When they didn't get to school, was everything bad? 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.500
 They're all big people ... 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 What, so we should take it to our schools and take it to the faculties? 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.500
 We were timely students ... 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.800
 Every morning in the snow, we would walk from Tophane to Yildiz. 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.000
 We never wanted a ring! 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.100
 We were thankful that we had to go up and become YTU students. 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.900
 Neither the conscience nor the municipal bus! 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.000
 They're gonna need a day-to-day tram ... 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.000
 Well, what do they do and criticize him! 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.800
 Don't worry, dear, you want architecture, she's in Besiktas ... 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.800
 You're one of the first students in Davutpaşa ... 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.000
 You didn't even have the right way on campus in your time. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 I wish these new ones would be like you ... 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.000
 Let's go get him to eat in his refectory. 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.300
 Though it's new, they don't like the food either! 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.000
 Anyway, we'il eat in Hokka, we'il cut some girls.
