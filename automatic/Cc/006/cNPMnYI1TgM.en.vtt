00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.050
 I'm going to charge you for the air that 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.050
 breathe is perfect 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.410
 with you or we decide to fall 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.730
 surprise then you have to leave here 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.530
 because I'm the re now and we know that 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.040
 you no longer have the trident, so no 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.580
 you have powers yes and give me that crown was 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.640
 of my dad ready and there is fear 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.710
 You can not get me out of here or not 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.130
 hans do not worry you do not have to 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.130
 move 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.410
 and I think he deserves it 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.390
 and now what are we going to do with him I think 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.900
 that must be thawed in a very 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.440
 very far from here good since that is all 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.440
 of yours 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.769

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.769
 at sea 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.950
 I hope that nothing bad happens to you because I 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.230
 I think he deserves it 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.769
 what do you think they're just going to eat the 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.720
