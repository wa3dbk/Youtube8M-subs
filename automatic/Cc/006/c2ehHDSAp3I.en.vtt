00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
that open your after effect and make a

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:49.640 
that open your after effect and make a
new<00:00:39.790> composition<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:41.610> name<00:00:42.610> it<00:00:42.760> as<00:00:42.910> 3d<00:00:43.570> text

to look like a 3d effect so enhance to

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.430 
to look like a 3d effect so enhance to
the<00:02:05.709> maximum<00:02:06.219> level<00:02:06.249> to<00:02:06.749> to<00:02:07.749> a<00:02:07.779> satisfaction

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
the maximum level to to a satisfaction

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.280 
the maximum level to to a satisfaction
so<00:02:08.740> I<00:02:08.770> mean<00:02:09.119> if<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:10.240> are<00:02:10.270> satisfied<00:02:10.479> with<00:02:10.929> the

so I mean if you are satisfied with the

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.370 
so I mean if you are satisfied with the
background<00:02:11.920> text<00:02:12.220> over<00:02:12.430> here<00:02:12.490> you<00:02:12.849> know<00:02:13.380> then

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
background text over here you know then

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.899 
background text over here you know then
it<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.650> okay<00:02:14.980> with<00:02:15.069> that<00:02:15.250> just<00:02:15.519> leave<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:15.790> the

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
it is okay with that just leave it the

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.740 
it is okay with that just leave it the
value<00:02:16.209> under<00:02:16.510> like<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.110> improve<00:02:17.590> even<00:02:17.739> more

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
value under like to improve even more

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.930 
value under like to improve even more
yeah<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:19.959> think<00:02:20.230> this<00:02:20.349> is<00:02:20.470> enough

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
yeah I think this is enough

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.630 
yeah I think this is enough
so<00:02:21.940> once<00:02:22.120> you've<00:02:22.240> done<00:02:22.480> with<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.750> shape<00:02:22.930> that

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
so once you've done with the shape that

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.030 
so once you've done with the shape that
you<00:02:24.640> have<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:25.000> make<00:02:25.510> this<00:02:25.660> force<00:02:26.319> strength

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
you have to make this force strength

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.510 
you have to make this force strength
equal<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.790> zero<00:02:28.350> this<00:02:29.350> is<00:02:29.470> why<00:02:29.680> because<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.340> will

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
equal to zero this is why because I will

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.620 
equal to zero this is why because I will
show<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.760> if<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.150> if<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.569> is<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:32.140> default<00:02:32.709> value

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
show you if you if it is a default value

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.059 
show you if you if it is a default value
I'm<00:02:34.630> playing<00:02:35.080> right<00:02:35.290> now<00:02:35.470> in<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.680> timeline

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
I'm playing right now in the timeline

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.910 
I'm playing right now in the timeline
you<00:02:36.250> see<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:36.810> getting<00:02:37.810> shattered<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.590> Texas

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
you see that getting shattered the Texas

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.860 
you see that getting shattered the Texas
chattering<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:39.790> then<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.180> text<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.510> falling

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
chattering and then the text is falling

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.500 
chattering and then the text is falling
down<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:41.980> have<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.220> make<00:02:42.520> this<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:43.120> stop

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
down and you have to make this to stop

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.430 
down and you have to make this to stop
so<00:02:43.900> instead<00:02:44.410> of<00:02:44.500> doing<00:02:44.830> so<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.970> have<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.270> do

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
so instead of doing so you have to do

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.190 
so instead of doing so you have to do
change<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.530> value<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.890> zero<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.930> then<00:02:49.930> in

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
change this value to zero and then in

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.810 
change this value to zero and then in
the<00:02:50.319> same<00:02:50.530> way<00:02:50.739> for<00:02:51.040> force<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.610> also<00:02:52.920> yeah<00:02:53.920> once

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
the same way for force to also yeah once

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.930 
the same way for force to also yeah once
if<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.000> all<00:02:55.180> done<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.440> text<00:02:56.980> never<00:02:57.700> gets

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
if you all done that the text never gets

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.199 
if you all done that the text never gets
shattered<00:02:58.150> but<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.930> falls<00:02:59.260> down<00:02:59.760> but<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:01.180> have

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
shattered but it falls down but you have

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.449 
shattered but it falls down but you have
to<00:03:01.450> do<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:03.060> make<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.239> gravity<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:05.290> zero<00:03:05.650> so

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
to do is make this gravity to zero so

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.400 
to do is make this gravity to zero so
that<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.760> text<00:03:07.120> will<00:03:07.360> never<00:03:07.630> fall<00:03:07.930> down<00:03:08.910> see

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
that the text will never fall down see

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.580 
that the text will never fall down see
yep

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
yep

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.380 
yep
the<00:03:11.709> text<00:03:11.950> will<00:03:12.100> stay<00:03:12.280> up<00:03:12.430> there<00:03:12.670> now<00:03:13.090> if<00:03:13.269> you

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
the text will stay up there now if you

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.890 
the text will stay up there now if you
can<00:03:13.570> see<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.080> it<00:03:14.560> is<00:03:14.709> all<00:03:14.980> already<00:03:15.430> now<00:03:16.330> in<00:03:16.600> 3d

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
can see that it is all already now in 3d

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.590 
can see that it is all already now in 3d
but<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.680> doesn't<00:03:18.100> look<00:03:18.340> like<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:18.880> mean<00:03:19.269> a

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
but it doesn't look like I mean a

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.840 
but it doesn't look like I mean a
complete<00:03:20.140> satisfaction<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:21.370> work<00:03:21.580> with<00:03:21.760> the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
complete satisfaction to work with the

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.660 
complete satisfaction to work with the
text<00:03:22.140> because<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:23.260> have<00:03:23.440> some<00:03:23.709> gaps<00:03:24.430> over

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
text because you have some gaps over

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.750 
text because you have some gaps over
here<00:03:25.360> make<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:26.140> feel<00:03:26.320> like<00:03:26.470> that<00:03:26.530> so<00:03:27.459> what<00:03:27.700> you

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
here make you feel like that so what you

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.069 
here make you feel like that so what you
have<00:03:27.910> to<00:03:28.030> do<00:03:28.180> is<00:03:30.239> just<00:03:31.239> to<00:03:31.360> try<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.570> now<00:03:31.900> I'm

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
have to do is just to try to now I'm

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.810 
have to do is just to try to now I'm
trying<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.530> rotate<00:03:32.769> this<00:03:33.190> so<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.519> you<00:03:33.640> can

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
trying to rotate this so that you can

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.150 
trying to rotate this so that you can
clearly<00:03:34.600> see<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.500> 3d<00:03:35.860> effect<00:03:37.470> yeah<00:03:38.500> now<00:03:39.100> you

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
clearly see the 3d effect yeah now you

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.180 
clearly see the 3d effect yeah now you
see<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:41.380> make<00:03:41.500> it<00:03:41.620> even<00:03:41.739> more<00:03:41.890> beautiful

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
see that to make it even more beautiful

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.400 
see that to make it even more beautiful
now<00:03:42.700> so<00:03:43.000> what<00:03:43.180> have<00:03:43.360> done<00:03:43.390> is<00:03:43.840> just<00:03:44.079> a

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
now so what have done is just a

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.780 
now so what have done is just a
duplicated<00:03:45.070> this<00:03:45.310> text<00:03:46.180> layer<00:03:46.329> and<00:03:47.160> then<00:03:48.160> once

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
duplicated this text layer and then once

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.500 
duplicated this text layer and then once
you've<00:03:48.940> done<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.320> you<00:03:50.320> have<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:51.299> make<00:03:52.299> this

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
you've done that you have to make this

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.740 
you've done that you have to make this
go<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.110> shape<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.560> then<00:03:53.820> make<00:03:54.820> this<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.239> 3d

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
go to the shape and then make this to 3d

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.819 
go to the shape and then make this to 3d
text<00:03:56.019> -<00:03:56.640> yep<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:57.910> think<00:03:58.870> yeah<00:03:59.110> that's<00:03:59.500> enough

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
text - yep I think yeah that's enough

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.890 
text - yep I think yeah that's enough
now<00:04:00.010> what<00:04:00.220> we<00:04:00.370> have<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.549> do<00:04:00.790> is<00:04:02.489> go<00:04:03.489> for<00:04:03.900> blood

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
now what we have to do is go for blood

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.759 
now what we have to do is go for blood
and<00:04:05.200> then<00:04:05.769> search<00:04:06.489> for<00:04:06.519> box<00:04:07.450> blur<00:04:07.840> this<00:04:08.590> is

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
and then search for box blur this is

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.740 
and then search for box blur this is
what<00:04:09.010> effect<00:04:09.370> I<00:04:09.459> am<00:04:09.489> using<00:04:11.070> as<00:04:12.269> if<00:04:13.269> you<00:04:13.360> can<00:04:13.510> see

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
what effect I am using as if you can see

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.870 
what effect I am using as if you can see
what<00:04:14.290> is<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.470> usage<00:04:14.769> of<00:04:14.920> this<00:04:15.160> is<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.700> it

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
what is the usage of this is that it

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.750 
what is the usage of this is that it
will<00:04:16.120> cover<00:04:16.479> all<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:16.959> unfilled<00:04:17.530> text<00:04:18.489> I<00:04:18.609> mean

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
will cover all this unfilled text I mean

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.520 
will cover all this unfilled text I mean
unfilled<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.359> gaps<00:04:19.660> over<00:04:19.930> there<00:04:20.200> so<00:04:20.350> that<00:04:20.500> I

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
unfilled the gaps over there so that I

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.830 
unfilled the gaps over there so that I
it<00:04:20.709> will<00:04:20.890> look<00:04:21.160> that<00:04:21.519> takes<00:04:21.700> you're<00:04:22.570> more

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
it will look that takes you're more

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.969 
it will look that takes you're more
beautiful<00:04:23.020> so<00:04:23.890> I'm<00:04:24.130> going<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.550> show<00:04:24.760> you<00:04:24.789> that

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
beautiful so I'm going to show you that

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.719 
beautiful so I'm going to show you that
make<00:04:26.979> this<00:04:27.190> radius<00:04:27.610> one<00:04:28.390> and<00:04:29.460> there<00:04:30.460> isn't

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
make this radius one and there isn't

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.170 
make this radius one and there isn't
this<00:04:30.910> with<00:04:31.330> eight<00:04:31.919> yeah

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
this with eight yeah

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.500 
this with eight yeah
now<00:04:33.540> if<00:04:33.660> you<00:04:33.750> can<00:04:33.900> see<00:04:34.199> that<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.740> blood<00:04:35.010> is

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
now if you can see that the blood is

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.480 
now if you can see that the blood is
filling<00:04:36.510> up<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:36.810> background<00:04:37.620> unfilled<00:04:38.310> the

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
filling up that background unfilled the

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.640 
filling up that background unfilled the
absence<00:04:39.030> of<00:04:39.120> things<00:04:39.449> so<00:04:40.020> what<00:04:40.169> you<00:04:40.260> have<00:04:40.380> to<00:04:40.500> do

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650
