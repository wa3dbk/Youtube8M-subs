00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
guys right here it might look a little

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.430 
guys right here it might look a little
bit<00:06:50.400> dull<00:06:50.669> so<00:06:50.910> that's<00:06:51.090> why<00:06:51.300> I<00:06:51.330> go<00:06:51.720> to<00:06:51.780> create

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
bit dull so that's why I go to create

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.300 
bit dull so that's why I go to create
and<00:06:52.919> then<00:06:53.160> I<00:06:53.190> go<00:06:53.669> to<00:06:53.699> physical<00:06:54.660> sky<00:06:55.020> and<00:06:55.410> yeah

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
and then I go to physical sky and yeah

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.219 
and then I go to physical sky and yeah
it<00:06:56.430> makes<00:06:56.580> it<00:06:56.790> much<00:06:56.910> brighter<00:06:57.270> and<00:06:57.479> cool<00:06:57.900> and

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:58.229 
it makes it much brighter and cool and

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:00.800 
it makes it much brighter and cool and
yes<00:06:58.680> look<00:06:59.639> at<00:06:59.699> that<00:06:59.880> makes<00:07:00.300> it<00:07:00.479> much<00:07:00.600> more

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
yes look at that makes it much more

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.870 
yes look at that makes it much more
brighter<00:07:01.139> and<00:07:01.440> cool<00:07:01.770> and<00:07:02.070> realistic<00:07:02.699> and

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
brighter and cool and realistic and

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.430 
brighter and cool and realistic and
stuff<00:07:03.120> like<00:07:03.330> that<00:07:03.540> but<00:07:03.870> it<00:07:04.020> takes<00:07:04.169> a<00:07:04.320> little

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
stuff like that but it takes a little

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.900 
stuff like that but it takes a little
bit<00:07:04.590> longer<00:07:04.830> to<00:07:05.100> actually<00:07:05.220> render<00:07:05.550> because

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 
bit longer to actually render because

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.610 
bit longer to actually render because
you<00:07:06.000> have<00:07:06.150> the<00:07:06.240> Minecraft<00:07:06.660> I<00:07:06.930> know<00:07:07.199> not<00:07:07.530> the

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
mark of the physical sky on but yeah

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.500 
mark of the physical sky on but yeah
that's<00:07:11.190> pretty<00:07:11.490> much<00:07:11.610> it<00:07:11.940> you<00:07:12.060> guys<00:07:12.240> that's
