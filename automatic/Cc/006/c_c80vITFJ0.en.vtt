00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.610 
regard I was talking about how we have
to<00:00:11.400> model<00:00:11.759> certain<00:00:12.059> behavior<00:00:12.509> we<00:00:13.230> have<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.500> be

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
to model certain behavior we have to be

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.660 
to model certain behavior we have to be
a<00:00:13.650> certain<00:00:14.009> kind<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.309> thing<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.580> that's

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
a certain kind of thing and that's

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.820 
a certain kind of thing and that's
that's<00:00:15.030> basically<00:00:15.360> very<00:00:16.049> very<00:00:16.560> very

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
that's basically very very very

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.439 
that's basically very very very
important<00:00:17.340> obviously<00:00:17.580> that's<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.180> that's

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
important obviously that's the that's

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.540 
important obviously that's the that's
the<00:00:18.570> bedrock<00:00:18.990> thing<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.890> think<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.400> also

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
the bedrock thing but I think it also

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.730 
the bedrock thing but I think it also
has<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.880> be<00:00:21.029> verbalized<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.779> children<00:00:22.170> look<00:00:22.619> at

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
has to be verbalized to children look at

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.109 
has to be verbalized to children look at
the<00:00:22.830> differences<00:00:23.310> between<00:00:23.369> what<00:00:23.970> you're

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the differences between what you're

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.670 
the differences between what you're
seeing<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.539> what<00:00:24.720> what<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> Lord<00:00:25.260> expects

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
seeing and what what the Lord expects

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.759 
seeing and what what the Lord expects
this<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.820> not<00:00:27.029> right<00:00:27.930> even<00:00:28.320> though<00:00:28.500> people

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769

there's we disagreements and things

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.149 
there's we disagreements and things
aren't<00:01:39.659> perfect<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.439> life<00:01:40.740> doesn't<00:01:40.979> go

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
a moral life and I don't know that that

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.820 
a moral life and I don't know that that
it's<00:02:10.210> it's<00:02:10.660> not<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.929> case<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.410> they<00:02:11.560> haven't

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
it's it's not the case that they haven't

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.290 
it's it's not the case that they haven't
been<00:02:12.040> there<00:02:12.370> before<00:02:12.490> they've<00:02:12.970> always<00:02:13.150> been

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
been there before they've always been

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.420 
been there before they've always been
there<00:02:13.510> as<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:13.960> noted<00:02:14.290> what's<00:02:14.980> different<00:02:15.400> now

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
there as you noted what's different now

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.390 
there as you noted what's different now
is<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:15.910> they're<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.270> constant<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.400> coming

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
is that they're so constant and coming

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.400 
is that they're so constant and coming
from<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:18.790> many<00:02:18.970> directions<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.780> there's<00:02:19.960> no

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
from so many directions and there's no

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.970 
from so many directions and there's no
let-up

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
let-up

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.320 
let-up
they<00:02:21.160> just<00:02:21.400> you're<00:02:22.330> buried<00:02:22.720> with<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.310> a

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
they just you're buried with it a

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.850 
they just you're buried with it a
continual<00:02:25.330> flow<00:02:25.570> of<00:02:25.750> these<00:02:25.870> things<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.560> and

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
continual flow of these things and and

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.800 
continual flow of these things and and
you<00:02:27.010> know<00:02:27.130> get<00:02:27.340> some<00:02:27.490> any<00:02:27.940> peace<00:02:28.330> from<00:02:28.630> all

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
you know get some any peace from all

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.800 
you know get some any peace from all
that<00:02:29.020> distraction<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.030> think<00:02:31.090> part<00:02:31.690> of<00:02:31.750> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
that distraction so I think part of the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.810 
that distraction so I think part of the
key<00:02:31.990> is<00:02:32.020> to<00:02:32.260> create<00:02:32.590> some<00:02:32.830> space<00:02:33.100> create<00:02:33.640> some

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
key is to create some space create some

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.940 
key is to create some space create some
quiet<00:02:34.090> time<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.900> quiet<00:02:35.230> space<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.890> that's

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
quiet time and quiet space and that's

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.949 
quiet time and quiet space and that's
why<00:02:36.190> we<00:02:36.340> emphasize<00:02:36.550> so<00:02:37.090> much<00:02:37.300> getting<00:02:37.780> into

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
why we emphasize so much getting into

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:38.670 
why we emphasize so much getting into
the<00:02:38.080> scriptures

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
the scriptures

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.970 
the scriptures
that's<00:02:39.489> time<00:02:39.880> apart<00:02:40.270> that's<00:02:40.570> that<00:02:41.470> comes<00:02:41.800> out

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
that's time apart that's that comes out

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.790 
that's time apart that's that comes out
of<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.190> world<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.110> removes<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.350> from<00:02:44.380> the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
of that world and removes you from the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.790 
of that world and removes you from the
constant<00:02:45.310> barrage<00:02:45.459> of<00:02:45.610> things<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.810> that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
constant barrage of things that that

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.170 
constant barrage of things that that
would<00:02:47.920> carry<00:02:48.130> off<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.730> different<00:02:48.880> direction

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
would carry off in a different direction

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.990 
would carry off in a different direction
or<00:02:49.660> conflicting<00:02:50.230> messages<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:51.880> think

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
or conflicting messages so I think

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.580 
or conflicting messages so I think
prayer<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.750> scripture<00:02:52.840> study<00:02:53.350> are

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
prayer and scripture study are

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.350 
prayer and scripture study are
protections<00:02:54.420> if<00:02:55.420> nothing<00:02:55.870> else<00:02:56.020> and<00:02:56.350> then<00:02:56.650> to

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
protections if nothing else and then to

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.320 
protections if nothing else and then to
turn<00:02:58.360> off<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.750> noise<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.290> let<00:03:00.040> us<00:03:00.330> consult

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
turn off the noise and let us consult

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.070 
turn off the noise and let us consult
the<00:03:02.110> inner<00:03:02.380> self<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.040> God<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.840> other<00:03:04.840> thing

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
the inner self and God the other thing

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.530 
the inner self and God the other thing
that<00:03:05.110> occurs<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.560> me<00:03:05.680> is<00:03:06.150> something<00:03:07.150> elder

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
that occurs to me is something elder

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.690 
that occurs to me is something elder
present<00:03:07.870> James<00:03:08.020> II<00:03:08.230> Faust<00:03:08.500> said<00:03:08.800> once<00:03:09.730> about

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
present James II Faust said once about

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.699 
present James II Faust said once about
something<00:03:12.700> very<00:03:12.870> foundational<00:03:13.870> in<00:03:14.080> life<00:03:14.320> to

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
something very foundational in life to

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.650 
something very foundational in life to
help<00:03:15.100> us<00:03:15.250> make<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.580> right<00:03:15.610> decisions<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.480> see

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
help us make the right decisions and see

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.990 
help us make the right decisions and see
us<00:03:16.780> through<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.380> is<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:19.830> constant

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
us through and that is the constant

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.110 
us through and that is the constant
recognition<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.660> we<00:03:22.900> answer<00:03:23.320> to<00:03:23.440> God<00:03:23.620> for

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
recognition that we answer to God for

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.940 
recognition that we answer to God for
our<00:03:25.120> lives<00:03:25.480> there<00:03:26.140> is<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.350> day<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.650> judgment

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
our lives there is a day of judgment

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.910 
our lives there is a day of judgment
there<00:03:27.370> is<00:03:27.400> an<00:03:27.610> accounting<00:03:28.590> accounting<00:03:29.590> as<00:03:29.830> we

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
there is an accounting accounting as we

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.590 
there is an accounting accounting as we
go<00:03:30.040> along<00:03:30.160> but<00:03:30.549> a<00:03:30.610> final<00:03:30.910> accounting<00:03:31.420> as<00:03:31.570> well

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
go along but a final accounting as well

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.840 
go along but a final accounting as well
and<00:03:32.290> I<00:03:32.410> think<00:03:32.470> he's<00:03:32.799> absolutely<00:03:33.250> right<00:03:33.459> if

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
and I think he's absolutely right if

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.270 
and I think he's absolutely right if
there's<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.170> bit<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.200> consciousness<00:03:35.739> there<00:03:36.160> in

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
there's a bit of consciousness there in

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.910 
there's a bit of consciousness there in
your<00:03:36.400> mind<00:03:36.640> you<00:03:36.880> know<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.170> whatever<00:03:38.170> anybody

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
your mind you know that whatever anybody

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.220 
your mind you know that whatever anybody
else<00:03:39.340> may<00:03:39.670> see<00:03:39.730> or<00:03:40.090> not<00:03:40.269> see<00:03:40.329> you<00:03:40.720> think<00:03:40.989> or<00:03:41.110> not

else may see or not see you think or not

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.100 
else may see or not see you think or not
