hello<00:00:01.639> this<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.909> Farfisa<00:00:03.720> fast<00:00:04.710> five<00:00:05.870> and<00:00:07.130> it

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
hello this is a Farfisa fast five and it

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.790 
hello this is a Farfisa fast five and it
is<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:09.059> pretty<00:00:09.420> decent<00:00:09.750> shape<00:00:09.960> will<00:00:10.170> sponsor<00:00:10.559> on

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
is a pretty decent shape will sponsor on

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.459 
is a pretty decent shape will sponsor on
the<00:00:10.889> front<00:00:11.099> not<00:00:11.250> too<00:00:11.490> bad<00:00:11.700> though<00:00:12.259> had<00:00:13.259> some

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
the front not too bad though had some

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.320 
the front not too bad though had some
little<00:00:13.650> cracks<00:00:14.099> underneath<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.849> had<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.150> put

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
little cracks underneath I had to put

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.370 
little cracks underneath I had to put
back<00:00:15.540> together<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:17.390> plastic<00:00:18.390> bottom<00:00:19.199> it's

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
back together on the plastic bottom it's

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.779 
back together on the plastic bottom it's
got<00:00:19.590> this<00:00:20.390> plastic<00:00:21.390> cover<00:00:21.810> underneath<00:00:22.640> or<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
got this plastic cover underneath or the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.310 
got this plastic cover underneath or the
screws<00:00:24.090> tend<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> crack<00:00:24.539> out<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.990> edges

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
screws tend to crack out on the edges

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.290 
screws tend to crack out on the edges
otherwise<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.949> pretty<00:00:26.490> nice<00:00:26.640> shape<00:00:26.670> there's

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
otherwise in pretty nice shape there's

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.339 
otherwise in pretty nice shape there's
the<00:00:27.529> there's<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.800> front<00:00:29.070> cover<00:00:29.929> not<00:00:30.929> too<00:00:31.140> bad

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
the there's the front cover not too bad

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.590 
the there's the front cover not too bad
it's<00:00:31.619> got<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.009> power<00:00:32.910> supply<00:00:33.239> that

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
it's got this power supply that

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.410 
it's got this power supply that
completely<00:00:34.880> confused<00:00:35.880> me<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.149> has<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
completely confused me it has a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.240 
completely confused me it has a
potentiometer<00:00:37.140> here<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:37.920> dirty<00:00:40.250> six

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
potentiometer here that was dirty six

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.490 
potentiometer here that was dirty six
volts<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:44.390> not<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> transformer<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.200> fry<00:00:46.440> it

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
volts and not the transformer to fry it

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.080 
volts and not the transformer to fry it
or<00:00:46.620> something<00:00:46.950> because<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.340> somehow<00:00:47.579> got<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.879> bad

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
or something because I somehow got a bad

or something because I somehow got a bad
reading<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.320> initial<00:00:49.860> capacitor<00:00:50.460> I

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
reading on the the initial capacitor I

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.520 
reading on the the initial capacitor I
don't<00:00:50.940> know<00:00:51.000> how<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.149> measure<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.750> wrong<00:00:52.020> it's

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
don't know how I measure that wrong it's

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.850 
don't know how I measure that wrong it's
it<00:00:53.219> gave<00:00:53.430> me<00:00:53.610> six<00:00:54.120> bolts<00:00:54.390> there<00:00:54.780> also<00:00:55.500> I

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
it gave me six bolts there also I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.150 
it gave me six bolts there also I
thought<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.829> thought<00:00:58.829> well<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
thought but I thought well the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.430 
thought but I thought well the
pre-filter<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.820> bad<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.359> transformer<00:01:01.260> must

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
pre-filter is bad the transformer must

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.979 
pre-filter is bad the transformer must
be<00:01:01.590> wired<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:02.280> 220<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.390> I'm<00:01:03.510> running<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.899> on

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
be wired for 220 and I'm running it on

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.630 
be wired for 220 and I'm running it on
110<00:01:04.650> because<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:05.010> supposed<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.369> 12

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
110 because it's supposed to have 12

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.940 
110 because it's supposed to have 12
volts<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.960> output<00:01:07.110> even<00:01:07.650> though<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.890> would

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
volts on the output even though it would

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.230 
volts on the output even though it would
have<00:01:08.070> had<00:01:08.189> more<00:01:08.400> headroom<00:01:08.790> because<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.090> got

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
have had more headroom because it's got

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.600 
have had more headroom because it's got
a<00:01:09.270> regulator<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:09.990> anyway<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.409> went<00:01:11.400> well

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
a regulator but anyway I went well

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.130 
a regulator but anyway I went well
that's<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:11.970> true<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> wires<00:01:12.570> are<00:01:12.810> hooked<00:01:12.930> up

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that's not true the wires are hooked up

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.260 
that's not true the wires are hooked up
in<00:01:13.320> parallel<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:14.010> there<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.430> not<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.640> series

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
in parallel in there and not in series

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.550 
in parallel in there and not in series
so<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:17.390> concluded<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.900> transformer<00:01:19.500> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
so I concluded that the transformer is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.260 
so I concluded that the transformer is
probably<00:01:19.890> fried<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.549> before<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.909> went<00:01:21.150> out

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
probably fried but before I went out

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.210 
probably fried but before I went out
there<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.509> checked<00:01:21.780> again<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.320> try<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.890> find<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
there I checked again to try to find a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.219 
there I checked again to try to find a
scrap<00:01:23.520> one<00:01:23.790> unfortunately<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.570> was<00:01:24.750> not<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
scrap one unfortunately it was not the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.850 
scrap one unfortunately it was not the
transformer<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:27.020> anyway<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.200> thing<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.650> all

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
transformer so anyway this thing is all

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.890 
transformer so anyway this thing is all
ready<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.290> play<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.320> believe<00:01:32.119> that<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
ready to play I believe that is the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.830 
ready to play I believe that is the
board<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.259> goes<00:01:34.380> back<00:01:34.650> there<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.840> very

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
board that goes back there and very

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.810 
board that goes back there and very
sensitive<00:01:37.170> envelope<00:01:37.920> control<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.670> that's

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
sensitive envelope control and that's

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.480 
sensitive envelope control and that's
your<00:01:39.060> decay<00:01:39.689> time<00:01:40.070> they<00:01:41.070> show<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
your decay time they show you the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.350 
your decay time they show you the
oscillator<00:01:42.000> PA<00:01:42.270> 73<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.380> PA<00:01:44.340> 74<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
oscillator PA 73 the PA 74 is the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.039 
oscillator PA 73 the PA 74 is the
divider<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.579> 75<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:49.310> kir<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:51.049> key

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
divider and 75 is just a kir the key

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.870 
divider and 75 is just a kir the key
switch<00:01:52.380> comes<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.979> here<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.899> provides<00:01:54.899> a

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
switch comes in here and just provides a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.780 
switch comes in here and just provides a
voltage<00:01:56.880> change<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.549> waveform<00:01:59.549> it

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
voltage change so that the waveform it

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.719 
voltage change so that the waveform it
goes<00:02:00.030> through<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> diode<00:02:00.540> here<00:02:01.320> fairly<00:02:02.219> simple

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
goes through a diode here fairly simple

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.590 
goes through a diode here fairly simple
circuit<00:02:03.719> for<00:02:04.040> for<00:02:05.040> causing<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.700> waveform<00:02:06.479> to

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
circuit for for causing the waveform to

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.680 
circuit for for causing the waveform to
be<00:02:06.780> compressed<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.890> no<00:02:08.310> avail<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:09.060> then

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
be compressed to no avail and then

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.020 
be compressed to no avail and then
again<00:02:09.960> when<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.229> drop<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.070> voltage<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.790> open

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
again when you drop the voltage and open

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.550 
again when you drop the voltage and open
some<00:02:12.180> Headroom<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.200> come<00:02:13.530> through

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
some Headroom for it to come through

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.150 
some Headroom for it to come through
here

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
here

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.400 
here
so<00:02:15.060> that's<00:02:15.330> your<00:02:15.740> kheer<00:02:16.740> circuit<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:18.410> your

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
so that's your kheer circuit and your

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.000

them all here in a block diagram how
they're<00:02:25.290> hooked<00:02:25.470> up<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.340> little<00:02:27.020> complex

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
they're hooked up it's a little complex

they're hooked up it's a little complex
to<00:02:28.260> read<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.560> got<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.950> know<00:02:29.070> lines<00:02:29.430> going

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
to read you got you know lines going

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.370 
to read you got you know lines going
across<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.330> things<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.720> they<00:02:30.780> don't<00:02:30.960> tell

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
across the things and they don't tell

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.990 
across the things and they don't tell
you<00:02:31.850> which<00:02:32.850> card<00:02:33.240> does<00:02:33.600> what<00:02:34.080> on<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:35.340> cards

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
you which card does what on the cards

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.790 
you which card does what on the cards
but<00:02:36.210> they<00:02:36.300> have<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> little<00:02:36.750> block<00:02:37.110> diagram

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
but they have a little block diagram

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.240 
but they have a little block diagram
here<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.400> does<00:02:38.790> give<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:40.190> general<00:02:41.190> idea

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
here and it does give you a general idea

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.930 
here and it does give you a general idea
of<00:02:41.550> what<00:02:41.760> does<00:02:42.000> what<00:02:42.270> there<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.520> don't<00:02:44.520> be<00:02:44.670> too

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940

through the pins here on the cards this

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.610 
through the pins here on the cards this
is<00:03:00.210> PA<00:03:00.830> 73<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:02.750> they<00:03:03.750> don't<00:03:03.930> tell<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.350> you

sense as you'll see we've got on the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.330 
sense as you'll see we've got on the
right<00:03:09.030> here<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:09.930> look<00:03:10.230> at<00:03:10.350> this<00:03:10.500> thing<00:03:10.860> all

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
right here as you look at this thing all

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.850 
right here as you look at this thing all
the<00:03:11.610> way<00:03:11.760> over<00:03:12.240> on<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.510> right<00:03:13.110> we<00:03:13.680> had<00:03:13.830> a

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
the way over on the right we had a

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.229 
the way over on the right we had a
pointer<00:03:14.630> hmm<00:03:15.890> this<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.070> like<00:03:17.220> top<00:03:17.459> view<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:17.850> so

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
pointer hmm this is like top view and so

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.030 
pointer hmm this is like top view and so
I'm<00:03:18.330> starting<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.900> right<00:03:19.110> here<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.739> going

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
I'm starting on the right here and going

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.360 
I'm starting on the right here and going
across<00:03:20.130> on<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.480> thing<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.930> has<00:03:22.380> 12<00:03:22.800> volts<00:03:23.160> on

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
across on the thing it has 12 volts on

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.680 
across on the thing it has 12 volts on
the<00:03:23.400> right<00:03:24.239> on<00:03:25.250> both<00:03:26.250> these<00:03:26.489> two<00:03:26.820> on<00:03:27.090> both<00:03:27.600> a

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
the right on both these two on both a

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.400 
the right on both these two on both a
divider<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.320> oscillator<00:03:28.970> so<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.510> go<00:03:30.660> 12

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
divider and the oscillator so you go 12

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.250 
divider and the oscillator so you go 12
volt<00:03:31.650> then<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.459> goes<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.700> capacitor<00:03:33.570> C<00:03:33.810> 3<00:03:34.080> on

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
volt then it goes to capacitor C 3 on

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.040 
volt then it goes to capacitor C 3 on
the<00:03:34.380> next<00:03:34.650> pin<00:03:34.890> of<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.190> pair<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:36.000> then<00:03:36.959> you

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
the next pin of that pair and then you

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.800 
the next pin of that pair and then you
have<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.200> 3<00:03:37.500> pin<00:03:37.770> group<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.459> that's<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.480> output

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
have a 3 pin group and that's the output

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.390 
have a 3 pin group and that's the output
on<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.500> first<00:03:40.739> one<00:03:41.010> C<00:03:41.940> 2<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.660> then<00:03:43.019> C<00:03:43.530> 3<00:03:43.560> on<00:03:44.190> the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
on the first one C 2 and then C 3 on the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.600 
on the first one C 2 and then C 3 on the
other<00:03:44.430> side<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:46.140> also<00:03:46.739> goes<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.010> C<00:03:47.190> one<00:03:47.400> there

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
other side and also goes to C one there

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.300 
other side and also goes to C one there
as<00:03:47.670> you'll<00:03:47.790> see<00:03:47.940> in<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.120> diagram<00:03:48.620> and<00:03:49.620> then

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
as you'll see in the diagram and then

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.090 
as you'll see in the diagram and then
over<00:03:50.640> here<00:03:50.670> you've<00:03:51.360> got<00:03:51.390> those<00:03:52.380> are<00:03:52.530> off<00:03:52.650> board

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100

here you've got a ground the ground and
the<00:04:08.880> vibrato<00:04:09.269> is<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.320> last<00:04:10.560> pin<00:04:10.890> over<00:04:11.070> there

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
the vibrato is the last pin over there

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.060 
the vibrato is the last pin over there
down<00:04:12.420> here<00:04:12.989> you've<00:04:13.950> got<00:04:14.310> 12<00:04:15.030> volts<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.750> out<00:04:16.530> on

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
down here you've got 12 volts and out on

on the diagram I don't tell you anything

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.159 
on the diagram I don't tell you anything

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
is on the tag Ram they just for what

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.110 
is on the tag Ram they just for what
what<00:04:32.530> is<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:32.919> mean<00:04:33.220> I<00:04:33.250> don't<00:04:33.669> know<00:04:33.730> why<00:04:33.970> they

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
what is to mean I don't know why they

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.890 
what is to mean I don't know why they
put<00:04:34.330> that<00:04:34.389> there

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
put that there

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.560 
put that there
the<00:04:35.440> end<00:04:35.620> was<00:04:35.800> called<00:04:36.100> three<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.970> out<00:04:37.240> is

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
the end was called three and the out is

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.470 
the end was called three and the out is
called<00:04:37.810> two<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:39.190> then<00:04:39.790> there's<00:04:40.000> another<00:04:40.090> out

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
called two and then there's another out

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.840 
called two and then there's another out
here<00:04:40.810> which<00:04:41.139> is<00:04:41.350> I<00:04:41.680> think<00:04:41.889> called<00:04:42.400> out<00:04:42.580> isn't

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
here which is I think called out isn't

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:49.320 
here which is I think called out isn't
it<00:04:43.030> I<00:04:43.270> don't<00:04:43.300> know<00:04:44.520> anyway<00:04:45.520> happy<00:04:46.210> 75<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:48.330> key

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330

looking through my camera sorry anyway
so<00:05:02.590> that<00:05:03.160> will<00:05:03.730> hopefully<00:05:04.000> save<00:05:04.419> you<00:05:04.570> a<00:05:04.600> lot<00:05:04.690> of

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
so that will hopefully save you a lot of

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.450 
so that will hopefully save you a lot of
time<00:05:05.020> then<00:05:05.200> I<00:05:05.290> drew<00:05:05.530> where<00:05:05.710> all<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.950> cards<00:05:06.310> are

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
time then I drew where all the cards are

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.310 
time then I drew where all the cards are
located<00:05:07.120> in<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:07.330> back<00:05:07.600> here<00:05:07.960> if<00:05:08.050> you<00:05:08.110> can<00:05:08.290> see

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
located in the back here if you can see

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.950 
located in the back here if you can see
that<00:05:08.760> reading<00:05:09.790> I'll<00:05:10.000> just<00:05:10.180> read<00:05:10.360> from<00:05:10.540> left<00:05:10.810> to

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
that reading I'll just read from left to

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.159 
that reading I'll just read from left to
right<00:05:11.669> that's<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.850> power<00:05:13.030> supplier<00:05:13.510> PA<00:05:14.550> 102

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
right that's the power supplier PA 102

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:23.190 
right that's the power supplier PA 102
there<00:05:17.169> and<00:05:17.560> then<00:05:18.070> 105<00:05:19.200> 113<00:05:20.200> 114<00:05:20.800> and<00:05:21.100> 100<00:05:22.200> is

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
there and then 105 113 114 and 100 is

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.340 
there and then 105 113 114 and 100 is
the<00:05:23.229> one<00:05:23.440> I've<00:05:23.590> got<00:05:23.620> out<00:05:24.040> down<00:05:24.760> there<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.510> then

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
the one I've got out down there and then

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.159 
the one I've got out down there and then
the<00:05:26.500> power<00:05:26.680> supply<00:05:27.130> again<00:05:27.460> P<00:05:27.729> will<00:05:27.910> a<00:05:28.030> 103<00:05:28.540> on

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
the power supply again P will a 103 on

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.570 
the power supply again P will a 103 on
this<00:05:29.530> side<00:05:29.770> towards<00:05:30.130> the<00:05:30.220> keyboard<00:05:31.320> and<00:05:32.320> then

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
this side towards the keyboard and then

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.560 
this side towards the keyboard and then
96<00:05:33.580> 97<00:05:34.300> 98<00:05:34.990> 99<00:05:35.520> reads<00:05:36.520> straight<00:05:36.850> across<00:05:37.060> there

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
96 97 98 99 reads straight across there

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.440 
96 97 98 99 reads straight across there
so<00:05:37.830> that's<00:05:38.830> the<00:05:39.340> stuff<00:05:39.610> they<00:05:39.820> kind<00:05:40.120> of<00:05:40.210> left

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
so that's the stuff they kind of left

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.880 
so that's the stuff they kind of left
out<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:40.930> schematic<00:05:41.380> that<00:05:41.530> might<00:05:41.710> help

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
out of the schematic that might help

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.090 
out of the schematic that might help
some<00:05:42.820> people<00:05:42.970> some<00:05:43.770> cleaner

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
some people some cleaner

00:05:45.100 --> 00:06:00.659 
some people some cleaner
I<00:05:46.140> guess<00:05:47.140> the<00:05:47.320> a<00:05:49.500> lot<00:05:50.500> of<00:05:50.620> percussion

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:07.140 

long<00:06:01.669> because<00:06:04.810> I'm<00:06:05.810> sure<00:06:06.020> I<00:06:06.050> totally<00:06:06.349> got<00:06:06.620> it

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
long because I'm sure I totally got it

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.559 
long because I'm sure I totally got it
right<00:06:08.150> the<00:06:08.360> bass<00:06:08.569> percussion<00:06:09.530> or<00:06:10.330> I'm<00:06:11.330> not

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:11.569 
right the bass percussion or I'm not

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:27.029 
right the bass percussion or I'm not
there<00:06:11.840> okay<00:06:13.060> make<00:06:14.060> it<00:06:14.090> sharp<00:06:23.259> sharp<00:06:24.259> or<00:06:24.470> soft

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.080 

on<00:06:28.039> the<00:06:28.430> next<00:06:28.759> year

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:44.260 

brilliant<00:06:32.090> mixture<00:06:42.880> you<00:06:43.880> got<00:06:44.090> these

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
brilliant mixture you got these

00:06:44.270 --> 00:07:14.580 
brilliant mixture you got these
sustaining<00:06:45.050> sounds<00:06:45.530> of<00:07:03.370> Yukimura

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.590 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:23.620 

oh<00:07:20.440> so<00:07:21.440> it<00:07:21.500> was<00:07:21.710> a<00:07:21.740> pretty<00:07:22.300> crude<00:07:23.300> but

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:23.630 
oh so it was a pretty crude but

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.320 
oh so it was a pretty crude but
interesting<00:07:24.319> mix<00:07:24.529> of<00:07:25.180> possibilities<00:07:26.180> on

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.330 
interesting mix of possibilities on

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:32.709 
interesting mix of possibilities on
these<00:07:26.479> things<00:07:26.659> be<00:07:30.159> percussion<00:07:31.479> sounds<00:07:32.479> really

00:07:32.709 --> 00:07:32.719 
these things be percussion sounds really

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:34.209 
these things be percussion sounds really
all<00:07:32.840> Jimi<00:07:33.229> I<00:07:33.259> don't<00:07:33.590> know<00:07:33.680> that's<00:07:33.889> where<00:07:34.130> it's

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:34.219 
all Jimi I don't know that's where it's

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:38.469 
all Jimi I don't know that's where it's
possible<00:07:36.340> and<00:07:37.340> it<00:07:37.580> seems<00:07:37.849> to<00:07:37.969> be<00:07:38.120> working<00:07:38.389> out

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 
possible and it seems to be working out

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:40.390 
possible and it seems to be working out
there<00:07:39.259> are<00:07:39.380> adjustments<00:07:39.529> all<00:07:40.130> over<00:07:40.310> this

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 
there are adjustments all over this

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.800 
there are adjustments all over this
thing<00:07:40.639> I<00:07:40.729> probably<00:07:40.940> have<00:07:41.210> some<00:07:41.449> of<00:07:41.569> them<00:07:41.690> that

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:41.810 
thing I probably have some of them that

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.450 
thing I probably have some of them that
might<00:07:41.990> still<00:07:42.349> need<00:07:42.529> to<00:07:42.620> be<00:07:42.710> adjusted<00:07:43.250> maybe

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:43.460 
might still need to be adjusted maybe

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.850 
might still need to be adjusted maybe
for<00:07:43.669> the<00:07:43.729> filtering<00:07:44.120> on<00:07:44.240> that<00:07:44.419> or<00:07:44.539> something

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:44.860 
for the filtering on that or something

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.459 
for the filtering on that or something
but<00:07:45.860> anyway<00:07:45.919> that's<00:07:46.340> the<00:07:46.699> general<00:07:47.469> synopsis

00:07:48.459 --> 00:07:48.469 
but anyway that's the general synopsis

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:51.730 
but anyway that's the general synopsis
on<00:07:48.979> that<00:07:49.449> machine<00:07:50.449> the<00:07:50.779> first<00:07:50.810> piece<00:07:51.319> of<00:07:51.500> fast

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:51.740 
on that machine the first piece of fast

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.120 
on that machine the first piece of fast
5<00:07:52.099> you<00:07:52.580> can<00:07:52.699> see<00:07:52.849> it's<00:07:52.969> got<00:07:53.180> the<00:07:53.710> type<00:07:54.710> of<00:07:54.740> key

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.130 
5 you can see it's got the type of key

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.999 
5 you can see it's got the type of key
that's<00:07:56.020> found<00:07:57.020> in<00:07:57.229> some<00:07:57.469> other<00:07:57.560> ones<00:07:57.860> are
