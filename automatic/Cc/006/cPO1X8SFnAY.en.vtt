00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.210
 to happen 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.460
 however, it is about one 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.910
 bizarre accident a garden hard to imagine how it could have happened 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.989
 the woman came from the direction emmeloord turning it is the beginning the red light 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.340
 drove under the first barriers through the bridge and plants for the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.510

 in the meantime the bridge was being opened, the woman has received appellant and 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.840
 probably the goal has panicked she is the decline rows 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.430
 the flap of the bridge goes up against the alps 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.820
 and so it is hoped that hand of the bridge valve 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.950
 with wood order in the water 15 meters deep 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.110
 bruins was eventually taken out of the water by a band the cost of urk 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.770
 Japan had been able to report it from the outside to the inside 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.470
 the divers were then immediately handed out by the lifeboat 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.690
 taken to the scene of the accident 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.190
 we have arrived there 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.190
 bystanders knew the roommate came the water 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.710
 who got his name from one of them could quickly locate the car 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.889
 and about us being better than victim in total and then immediately in 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.290
 brought up 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.090
 Jennings 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.209
 all in all, the rescue campaign lasted twenty minutes 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.110
 and then he himself also died a highly surprised how the accident occurred 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.840
 could have happened 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.360
 it is incomprehensible 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.230
 that had to report incidents 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.430
 The involved 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.369
 by the 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.260
 one of the world life we ​​do 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.230
 without anyone the 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.440
 to watch and services were touched by the dark days you can't 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.090
 to imagine 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.680
 savings over from a son 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.680
 yes in this case the bridge keeper could not have done anything to save the woman 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.470
 there is the first question that comes to mind herman den apparer what is the man 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.369
 on the buttons 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.630
 he could not have closed the bridge quickly to save the woman 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.340
 and that is all still under investigation 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.830
 but the fire brigade indicated that it was very difficult 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.150
 bridge keeper because the woman is driving her car behind the open flap of the 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.769
 bridge populated 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.760
 the victim is listed in critical condition in the seaside 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.379
 Amsterdam 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.999
 Do you know how she is doing now? 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.330
 they are called kennedy rescue action that lasted more than twenty minutes 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.430
 after that the reasoning started immediately and the victim drowned 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.400
 the fire department always speaks of the golden hour as the resuscitation within one 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.230
 hour starts then there is still hope for victim and good if you are those 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.419
 city ​​was that a singing critical condition brought to the hospital 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.709
