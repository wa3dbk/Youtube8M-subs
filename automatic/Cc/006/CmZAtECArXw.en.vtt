00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
and they all have different abilities

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.099 
and they all have different abilities
besides<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.580> jackhammer<00:00:28.000> which<00:00:28.359> is<00:00:28.570> broken

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
besides the jackhammer which is broken

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.450 
besides the jackhammer which is broken
at<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.500> current<00:00:29.740> time<00:00:29.890> but<00:00:29.919> you<00:00:30.189> have<00:00:30.220> three

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
at the current time but you have three

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.769 
at the current time but you have three
different<00:00:30.849> tools<00:00:31.060> which<00:00:31.419> are<00:00:31.539> pretty<00:00:31.689> cool

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
different tools which are pretty cool

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.840 
different tools which are pretty cool
and<00:00:32.140> hopefully<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.830> jackhammer<00:00:33.340> eventually

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
and hopefully the jackhammer eventually

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.190 
and hopefully the jackhammer eventually
gets<00:00:34.030> fixed<00:00:34.329> I<00:00:34.420> don't<00:00:34.570> know<00:00:34.629> if<00:00:34.750> it<00:00:34.840> ever<00:00:34.930> will

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
gets fixed I don't know if it ever will

about<00:00:45.280> okay<00:00:45.699> so<00:00:45.730> all<00:00:46.270> of<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:46.570> power<00:00:46.780> tools

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
about okay so all of the power tools

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.650 
about okay so all of the power tools
require<00:00:47.649> a<00:00:47.680> redstone<00:00:48.190> iron<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:49.149> sticks<00:00:49.570> to

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
require a redstone iron and sticks to

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.020 
require a redstone iron and sticks to
make<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.260> first<00:00:50.590> one<00:00:50.890> is<00:00:51.070> a<00:00:51.100> shaft<00:00:51.550> drill

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
make the first one is a shaft drill

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.700 
make the first one is a shaft drill
which<00:00:52.210> I'll<00:00:52.359> showcase<00:00:52.600> right<00:00:53.079> now<00:00:53.289> it<00:00:53.500> takes

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
which I'll showcase right now it takes

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.240 
which I'll showcase right now it takes
two<00:00:54.190> redstone<00:00:54.870> three<00:00:55.870> iron<00:00:56.140> ingots<00:00:56.500> and<00:00:56.620> two

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
two redstone three iron ingots and two

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.490 
two redstone three iron ingots and two
sticks<00:00:57.789> and<00:00:58.059> once<00:00:58.809> you<00:00:58.960> put<00:00:59.140> this<00:00:59.230> into<00:00:59.410> a

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
sticks and once you put this into a

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.049 
sticks and once you put this into a
crafting<00:00:59.859> table<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.250> will<00:01:00.399> look<00:01:00.579> a<00:01:00.699> little<00:01:00.879> bit

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
crafting table it will look a little bit

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.509 
crafting table it will look a little bit
like<00:01:01.210> this<00:01:01.929> this<00:01:02.289> is<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.710> shaft<00:01:02.949> drill<00:01:03.280> and

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
like this this is the shaft drill and

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.100 
like this this is the shaft drill and
you<00:01:03.850> can<00:01:04.000> kind<00:01:04.210> of<00:01:04.300> see<00:01:04.480> how<00:01:04.690> that<00:01:04.900> actually

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
you can kind of see how that actually

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.530 
you can kind of see how that actually
would<00:01:05.470> make<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.920> drill<00:01:06.340> so<00:01:06.610> yeah<00:01:07.030> there<00:01:07.270> we<00:01:07.390> go

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
would make a drill so yeah there we go

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.910 
would make a drill so yeah there we go
here<00:01:07.810> is<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.170> shaft<00:01:08.409> roll<00:01:08.680> I'm<00:01:08.740> gonna<00:01:08.860> go

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
here is the shaft roll I'm gonna go

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.609 
here is the shaft roll I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:08.979> and<00:01:09.159> use<00:01:09.310> this<00:01:09.580> up<00:01:09.820> here<00:01:10.119> on<00:01:10.619> something

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
ahead and use this up here on something

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.469 
ahead and use this up here on something
let's<00:01:11.740> go<00:01:11.950> ahead<00:01:12.159> and<00:01:12.340> use<00:01:12.520> it<00:01:12.729> on<00:01:12.909> this<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:13.450> I

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
let's go ahead and use it on this and I

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:14.910

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.600 
to take off split touch I've I don't
know<00:01:16.540> why<00:01:16.720> I<00:01:16.750> just<00:01:16.990> just<00:01:17.619> do<00:01:17.829> and<00:01:18.189> yeah<00:01:18.369> so

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
here's the ear is the shaft room once

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.330 
here's the ear is the shaft room once
you<00:01:20.650> break<00:01:20.860> something

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
so I'm sorry about that I kind of

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.460 
so I'm sorry about that I kind of
already<00:01:25.119> started<00:01:25.299> here<00:01:25.720> but<00:01:25.869> what<00:01:26.049> the<00:01:26.170> shaft

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
already started here but what the shaft

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.340 
already started here but what the shaft
drill<00:01:26.799> does<00:01:27.040> is<00:01:27.250> it<00:01:27.400> takes<00:01:27.579> a<00:01:27.850> two<00:01:28.180> by<00:01:28.810> one<00:01:29.170> it

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
drill does is it takes a two by one it

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.580 
drill does is it takes a two by one it
just<00:01:29.380> digs<00:01:29.740> it<00:01:29.860> too<00:01:30.040> tall<00:01:30.930> tunnel<00:01:31.930> rather<00:01:32.259> than

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
just digs it too tall tunnel rather than

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.490 
just digs it too tall tunnel rather than
a<00:01:32.890> one<00:01:33.880> block<00:01:34.299> so<00:01:34.810> it's<00:01:34.960> very<00:01:35.110> simple<00:01:35.350> it's

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
a one block so it's very simple it's

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.289 
a one block so it's very simple it's
just<00:01:35.530> like<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.770> tunneling<00:01:36.250> device<00:01:36.549> where<00:01:37.119> you

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
just like a tunneling device where you

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.840 
just like a tunneling device where you
can<00:01:37.450> see<00:01:37.630> it's<00:01:37.899> two<00:01:38.500> by<00:01:38.710> it's<00:01:39.040> actually<00:01:39.399> two<00:01:39.610> by

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
can see it's two by it's actually two by

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.289 
can see it's two by it's actually two by
um<00:01:40.060> two<00:01:41.049> but<00:01:41.439> in<00:01:41.649> its<00:01:42.220> facing<00:01:42.850> away<00:01:42.939> from<00:01:43.030> you

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
um two but in its facing away from you

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.350 
um two but in its facing away from you
so<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:43.540> can<00:01:43.689> easily<00:01:44.460> build<00:01:45.460> tunnels<00:01:45.850> this<00:01:46.149> way

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
so you can easily build tunnels this way

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.719 
so you can easily build tunnels this way
as<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:46.570> can<00:01:46.600> see<00:01:46.960> I'm<00:01:47.140> just<00:01:47.579> clobbering<00:01:48.579> the

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
as you can see I'm just clobbering the

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.749 
as you can see I'm just clobbering the
rock<00:01:48.969> and<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.689> it<00:01:49.869> also<00:01:50.049> works<00:01:50.380> on<00:01:50.590> dirt<00:01:51.490> much

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
rock and and it also works on dirt much

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.670 
rock and and it also works on dirt much
easier<00:01:52.210> although<00:01:52.329> sometimes<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.930> does<00:01:53.110> seem

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
easier although sometimes it does seem

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.319 
easier although sometimes it does seem
to<00:01:53.860> mess<00:01:54.070> up<00:01:54.250> on<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.549> dirt<00:01:54.700> as<00:01:54.939> you<00:01:55.030> can<00:01:55.149> see

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
to mess up on the dirt as you can see

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.420 
to mess up on the dirt as you can see
it's<00:01:55.810> definitely<00:01:56.079> destroying<00:01:56.740> this<00:01:56.950> dirt<00:01:57.219> and

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
it's definitely destroying this dirt and

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.429 
it's definitely destroying this dirt and
I'm<00:01:57.520> definitely<00:01:58.060> getting<00:01:58.810> around<00:01:59.049> a<00:01:59.170> lot

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
I'm definitely getting around a lot

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.270 
I'm definitely getting around a lot
faster<00:02:00.009> in<00:02:00.219> this<00:02:00.369> tunnel<00:02:00.789> so<00:02:00.909> that<00:02:01.060> is<00:02:01.270> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
faster in this tunnel so that is the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.980 
faster in this tunnel so that is the
drill<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.579> it<00:02:03.729> is<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.180> shaft<00:02:04.450> drill<00:02:04.719> and<00:02:04.869> it

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
drill and it is the shaft drill and it

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.779 
drill and it is the shaft drill and it
kind<00:02:05.320> of<00:02:05.350> makes<00:02:05.530> sense<00:02:05.590> because<00:02:06.070> it<00:02:06.189> it<00:02:06.430> makes

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
kind of makes sense because it it makes

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.400 
kind of makes sense because it it makes
mine<00:02:07.030> shafts<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.600> it<00:02:07.689> makes<00:02:07.869> them<00:02:08.050> fairly

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
mine shafts and it makes them fairly

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.470 
mine shafts and it makes them fairly
easily<00:02:08.590> just<00:02:08.979> got<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.130> break<00:02:09.910> one<00:02:10.120> block<00:02:10.330> and

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
easily just got a break one block and

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.180 
easily just got a break one block and
see<00:02:10.660> sometimes<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.470> has<00:02:11.710> some<00:02:11.950> goofs

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
see sometimes it has some goofs

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.010 
see sometimes it has some goofs
sometimes<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.060> definitely<00:02:13.390> do<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.900> don't

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
sometimes it definitely do so I don't

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.150 
sometimes it definitely do so I don't
know<00:02:14.080> why<00:02:14.290> it's<00:02:14.710> just

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
know why it's just

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.010 
know why it's just
rarely<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.240> doesn't<00:02:16.480> make<00:02:16.600> sense<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.870> me

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
rarely and it doesn't make sense to me

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.990 
rarely and it doesn't make sense to me
but<00:02:17.170> whatever<00:02:17.890> whatever<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:18.460> because<00:02:18.670> because

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
but whatever whatever so because because

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.430 
but whatever whatever so because because
it<00:02:19.120> always<00:02:19.270> breaks<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:19.990> don't<00:02:20.140> know<00:02:20.200> why<00:02:20.380> it

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
it always breaks it I don't know why it

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.170 
it always breaks it I don't know why it
messes<00:02:20.800> up<00:02:20.920> sometimes<00:02:20.950> but<00:02:21.520> you<00:02:21.910> know<00:02:22.000> it

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
messes up sometimes but you know it

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.090 
messes up sometimes but you know it
works<00:02:22.570> enough<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.230> where<00:02:23.410> it's<00:02:23.650> definitely

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
works enough to where it's definitely

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.560 
works enough to where it's definitely
gonna<00:02:24.190> be<00:02:24.280> very<00:02:24.640> useful<00:02:25.060> when<00:02:25.240> you're<00:02:25.540> trying

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
gonna be very useful when you're trying

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.060 
gonna be very useful when you're trying
to<00:02:25.840> make<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.080> mineshaft<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:26.860> would<00:02:27.040> work

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
to make a mineshaft and it would work

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.130 
to make a mineshaft and it would work
and<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.790> gives<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.210> blocks<00:02:28.450> at<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.690> drop<00:02:28.960> so

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
and it gives you the blocks at a drop so

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.330 
and it gives you the blocks at a drop so
it's<00:02:29.290> not<00:02:29.380> like<00:02:29.530> you're<00:02:29.680> destroying<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.160> for

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
it's not like you're destroying it for

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.340 
it's not like you're destroying it for
nothing<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.820> it's<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:31.600> a<00:02:31.690> faster<00:02:32.140> way<00:02:32.290> to

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
nothing and it's just a faster way to

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.450 
nothing and it's just a faster way to
mine<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.250> shaft<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.630> is<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.740> shafted

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
mine and shaft so that is the shafted

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.430 
mine and shaft so that is the shafted
room<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.850> next<00:02:37.030> tool<00:02:37.480> which<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.930> really

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
room the next tool which is really

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.930 
room the next tool which is really
really<00:02:38.560> cool<00:02:38.830> as<00:02:38.980> well<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.670> wide

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
really cool as well it is the wide

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.510 
really cool as well it is the wide
portrait<00:02:40.660> on<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:41.140> is<00:02:41.650> definitely

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
portrait on that this is definitely

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.580 
portrait on that this is definitely
something<00:02:43.000> special<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:43.930> will<00:02:44.110> take<00:02:44.320> a<00:02:44.350> little

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
something special it will take a little

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.410 
something special it will take a little
bit<00:02:44.710> more<00:02:44.770> iron<00:02:45.070> this<00:02:45.370> time<00:02:45.640> taking<00:02:46.180> two

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
bit more iron this time taking two

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.810 
bit more iron this time taking two
redstone<00:02:46.690> five<00:02:47.260> iron<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.800> two<00:02:47.950> sticks<00:02:48.340> you

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
redstone five iron and two sticks you

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.700 
redstone five iron and two sticks you
can<00:02:49.000> craft<00:02:49.240> it<00:02:49.480> up<00:02:49.630> by<00:02:49.960> doing<00:02:49.990> this<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.500> think

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
can craft it up by doing this I think

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.380 
can craft it up by doing this I think
this<00:02:50.800> is<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.070> most<00:02:51.250> expensive<00:02:51.550> out<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.150> all<00:02:52.300> of

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
this is the most expensive out of all of

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.510 
this is the most expensive out of all of
them<00:02:52.510> yeah<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:53.020> okay<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.590> this<00:02:54.070> is<00:02:54.130> the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
them yeah it is okay and this is the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.900 
them yeah it is okay and this is the
wide<00:02:54.760> bore<00:02:55.120> drill<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.810> this<00:02:56.140> goes<00:02:56.740> wild<00:02:57.370> and

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
wide bore drill and this goes wild and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.430 
wide bore drill and this goes wild and
it<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.210> pretty<00:02:58.480> fun<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.750> mess<00:02:58.930> around<00:02:59.050> with<00:02:59.200> so

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
it is pretty fun to mess around with so

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.980 
it is pretty fun to mess around with so
I'll<00:02:59.770> go<00:02:59.950> ahead<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.280> jump<00:03:00.490> over<00:03:01.270> there<00:03:01.630> yeah

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
I'll go ahead and jump over there yeah

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.450 
I'll go ahead and jump over there yeah
let's<00:03:02.170> just<00:03:02.290> go<00:03:02.440> over<00:03:02.560> there<00:03:02.830> really<00:03:03.100> quick

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
let's just go over there really quick

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.060 
let's just go over there really quick
and<00:03:03.790> let's<00:03:04.570> check<00:03:04.810> this<00:03:04.960> out<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.650> need<00:03:05.980> to

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
and let's check this out so I need to

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.320 
and let's check this out so I need to
get<00:03:06.160> my<00:03:06.340> way<00:03:06.490> up<00:03:06.640> here<00:03:06.670> well<00:03:07.000> why<00:03:07.090> don't<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.300> just

I<00:03:10.660> can<00:03:10.840> showcase<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.380> drill<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:11.800> basically<00:03:12.550> if

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
I can showcase the drill so basically if

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.970 
I can showcase the drill so basically if
you<00:03:12.760> break<00:03:13.090> something<00:03:13.360> it<00:03:13.600> will<00:03:13.690> break<00:03:13.960> a<00:03:14.170> nine

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
you break something it will break a nine

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.280 
you break something it will break a nine
it<00:03:15.340> will<00:03:15.460> break<00:03:15.580> nine<00:03:15.910> blocks<00:03:16.300> just<00:03:16.480> one

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
it will break nine blocks just one

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.900 
it will break nine blocks just one
around<00:03:17.710> it<00:03:17.890> in<00:03:17.980> every<00:03:18.130> direction<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.730> this

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
around it in every direction so this

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.270 
around it in every direction so this
will<00:03:19.450> make<00:03:19.630> massive<00:03:20.560> tunnels<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:20.980> doesn't<00:03:21.220> go

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
will make massive tunnels it doesn't go

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.540 
will make massive tunnels it doesn't go
as<00:03:21.430> fast<00:03:21.820> as<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:23.560> shaft<00:03:24.040> drill<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.520> my

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
as fast as the the shaft drill in my

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.949 
as fast as the the shaft drill in my
opinion<00:03:24.910> don't<00:03:25.030> think<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.270> breaks<00:03:25.480> as<00:03:25.720> fast

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
opinion don't think it breaks as fast

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.630 
opinion don't think it breaks as fast
and<00:03:26.170> sometimes<00:03:26.770> of<00:03:26.950> course<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:27.310> messes<00:03:27.580> up

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
and sometimes of course it messes up

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.860 
and sometimes of course it messes up
it's<00:03:27.820> just<00:03:27.850> kind<00:03:28.090> of<00:03:28.120> weird<00:03:28.300> how<00:03:28.480> this<00:03:28.630> mod

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
it's just kind of weird how this mod

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.350 
it's just kind of weird how this mod
does<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.290> sometimes<00:03:29.530> but<00:03:30.310> um<00:03:30.490> yeah<00:03:30.820> so<00:03:30.850> it'll

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
does that sometimes but um yeah so it'll

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.590 
does that sometimes but um yeah so it'll
break<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.920> 3x3<00:03:32.920> area<00:03:32.950> rather<00:03:33.790> than<00:03:34.090> just<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.540> two

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
break a 3x3 area rather than just a two

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.750 
break a 3x3 area rather than just a two
by<00:03:34.930> one<00:03:34.959> or<00:03:35.380> if<00:03:35.709> you're<00:03:35.950> just<00:03:36.160> breaking<00:03:36.459> by

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
by one or if you're just breaking by

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.180 
by one or if you're just breaking by
hand<00:03:37.090> a<00:03:37.300> one<00:03:37.540> by<00:03:37.720> one<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.930> s<00:03:38.200> this<00:03:38.410> thing<00:03:38.620> will

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
hand a one by one a s this thing will

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.360 
hand a one by one a s this thing will
destroy<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.000> they<00:03:40.090> also<00:03:40.270> work<00:03:40.750> oh<00:03:40.930> look<00:03:41.140> at

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
destroy and they also work oh look at

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.060 
destroy and they also work oh look at
hello<00:03:42.370> world<00:03:42.670> they<00:03:43.450> also<00:03:43.690> break<00:03:44.170> down<00:03:44.230> as<00:03:44.890> well

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
hello world they also break down as well

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.250 
hello world they also break down as well
so<00:03:45.250> if<00:03:45.340> I<00:03:45.430> wanted<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:45.730> go<00:03:45.850> down<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.810> works<00:03:47.050> in

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
so if I wanted to go down it works in

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.810 
so if I wanted to go down it works in
the<00:03:47.350> down<00:03:47.530> well<00:03:47.830> it<00:03:47.950> usually<00:03:48.160> works<00:03:48.580> in<00:03:48.760> the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
the down well it usually works in the

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.250 
the down well it usually works in the
down<00:03:49.030> direction<00:03:49.209> that's<00:03:49.690> gonna<00:03:49.840> work<00:03:50.050> that

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
down direction that's gonna work that

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.660 
down direction that's gonna work that
again<00:03:50.530> yeah<00:03:50.709> there<00:03:50.860> we<00:03:50.920> go<00:03:51.040> okay<00:03:51.310> so<00:03:51.340> as<00:03:51.640> you

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
again yeah there we go okay so as you

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.670 
again yeah there we go okay so as you
can<00:03:51.940> see<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.690> can<00:03:52.930> go<00:03:53.140> ahead<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.500> dig

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
can see you can go ahead and dig

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.860 
can see you can go ahead and dig
yourself<00:03:54.070> down<00:03:54.489> as<00:03:54.910> well<00:03:55.180> which<00:03:55.420> is<00:03:55.630> not<00:03:55.810> a

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
yourself down as well which is not a

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.900 
yourself down as well which is not a
good<00:03:56.080> idea<00:03:56.410> because<00:03:57.070> there's<00:03:57.489> always<00:03:57.760> a

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
good idea because there's always a

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.090 
good idea because there's always a
chance<00:03:58.209> of<00:03:58.420> lava<00:03:58.750> under<00:03:59.260> you<00:03:59.410> which<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.830> of

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
chance of lava under you which is of

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.520 
chance of lava under you which is of
course<00:04:00.370> no<00:04:01.150> fun<00:04:01.420> we<00:04:01.630> all<00:04:01.750> know<00:04:01.900> that<00:04:02.050> come<00:04:02.410> on

ingots and two sticks to make so it's

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.810 
ingots and two sticks to make so it's
not<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:17.109> expensive<00:04:17.500> at<00:04:17.919> all<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.459> it<00:04:18.730> will

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
not that expensive at all and it will

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
awesome now unfortunately it doesn't add

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.500 
awesome now unfortunately it doesn't add
extra<00:04:24.220> attacking<00:04:24.700> damage<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:25.180> thought<00:04:25.360> that

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
extra attacking damage I thought that

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.960 
extra attacking damage I thought that
would<00:04:25.600> be<00:04:25.660> pretty<00:04:25.900> cool<00:04:26.080> if<00:04:26.320> it<00:04:26.860> if<00:04:27.370> it<00:04:27.550> felt

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
would be pretty cool if it if it felt

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.140 
would be pretty cool if it if it felt
more<00:04:28.150> attacking

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
more attacking

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.390 
more attacking
or<00:04:29.390> it<00:04:29.450> had<00:04:29.570> a<00:04:29.600> specific<00:04:29.930> attacking<00:04:30.800> kind<00:04:31.340> of

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
or it had a specific attacking kind of

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.980 
or it had a specific attacking kind of
animation<00:04:31.940> or<00:04:32.030> something<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.420> doesn't<00:04:32.450> it

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
animation or something it doesn't it

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.080 
animation or something it doesn't it
just<00:04:33.230> kind<00:04:33.500> of<00:04:33.590> kills<00:04:33.800> things<00:04:34.070> normally<00:04:34.640> but

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
just kind of kills things normally but

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.450 
just kind of kills things normally but
what<00:04:35.270> it<00:04:35.360> does<00:04:35.630> do<00:04:35.990> is<00:04:36.710> chop<00:04:37.190> down<00:04:37.400> trees

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
what it does do is chop down trees

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.110 
what it does do is chop down trees
really<00:04:38.440> really<00:04:39.440> fast<00:04:39.890> so<00:04:40.760> I'll<00:04:40.820> go<00:04:40.880> ahead<00:04:40.940> and

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
really really fast so I'll go ahead and

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.060 
really really fast so I'll go ahead and
show<00:04:41.330> that<00:04:41.570> right<00:04:42.080> now<00:04:42.290> so<00:04:42.500> once<00:04:42.770> you<00:04:42.890> break

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
show that right now so once you break

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.680 
show that right now so once you break
one<00:04:43.370> block<00:04:43.640> what<00:04:43.850> its<00:04:43.970> gonna<00:04:44.030> do<00:04:44.270> to<00:04:44.390> your<00:04:44.450> the

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
one block what its gonna do to your the

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.090 
one block what its gonna do to your the
rest<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:44.990> tree<00:04:45.200> it's<00:04:45.830> just<00:04:45.980> gonna

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
rest of the tree it's just gonna

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.130 
rest of the tree it's just gonna
annihilate<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:47.000> tree<00:04:47.210> like<00:04:47.390> look<00:04:47.690> at<00:04:47.900> that

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
annihilate the tree like look at that

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.680 
annihilate the tree like look at that

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
like these you can see it's not just

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.190 
like these you can see it's not just
gonna<00:05:02.000> take<00:05:02.240> down<00:05:02.390> one<00:05:02.690> treat<00:05:02.960> it's<00:05:03.110> gonna

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.480 
take down both of them so which could be
good<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.260> it<00:05:06.470> also<00:05:06.620> could<00:05:06.950> be<00:05:06.980> bad<00:05:07.280> depending

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
good and it also could be bad depending

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.490 
good and it also could be bad depending

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
prepare anything because it actually

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.450 
prepare anything because it actually
doesn't<00:05:17.390> do<00:05:17.750> anything<00:05:18.200> you<00:05:18.740> just<00:05:18.770> need<00:05:19.040> three

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
doesn't do anything you just need three

it<00:05:21.860> although<00:05:22.580> I<00:05:22.610> don't<00:05:22.880> know<00:05:23.000> why<00:05:23.180> you<00:05:23.240> would

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
it although I don't know why you would

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.320 
it although I don't know why you would
because<00:05:24.020> it's<00:05:24.380> really<00:05:24.860> pointless<00:05:25.340> at<00:05:25.820> this

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
because it's really pointless at this

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.550 
because it's really pointless at this
current<00:05:26.570> time<00:05:26.810> I<00:05:26.870> don't<00:05:27.050> know<00:05:27.200> if<00:05:27.380> it<00:05:27.470> will

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
current time I don't know if it will

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.680 
current time I don't know if it will
ever<00:05:27.680> be<00:05:27.860> fixed<00:05:28.190> but<00:05:28.700> it<00:05:28.790> is<00:05:28.940> the<00:05:29.180> jackhammer

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
ever be fixed but it is the jackhammer

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.720 
ever be fixed but it is the jackhammer
and<00:05:29.930> it<00:05:30.020> does<00:05:30.170> nothing<00:05:30.470> it<00:05:30.830> takes<00:05:31.100> forever<00:05:31.340> to

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
and it does nothing it takes forever to

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.640 
and it does nothing it takes forever to
break<00:05:31.880> things<00:05:32.150> and<00:05:32.360> when<00:05:32.930> you<00:05:32.960> finally<00:05:33.440> break

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
break things and when you finally break

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.950 
break things and when you finally break
them<00:05:33.860> nothing<00:05:34.310> really<00:05:34.520> happens<00:05:35.090> so<00:05:35.300> I<00:05:35.480> don't

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
them nothing really happens so I don't

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.600 
them nothing really happens so I don't
know<00:05:36.200> what<00:05:36.500> this<00:05:36.620> is<00:05:36.770> going<00:05:37.070> to<00:05:37.160> be<00:05:37.250> used<00:05:37.460> for

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
know what this is going to be used for

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.760 
know what this is going to be used for
I'll<00:05:38.000> show<00:05:38.240> you<00:05:38.300> guys<00:05:38.600> right<00:05:38.870> here<00:05:39.200> it<00:05:39.740> just

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
I'll show you guys right here it just

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.230 
I'll show you guys right here it just
takes<00:05:39.980> forever<00:05:40.250> to<00:05:40.520> break<00:05:40.700> something<00:05:41.150> and

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
takes forever to break something and

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.960 
takes forever to break something and
then<00:05:41.450> nothing<00:05:42.290> that<00:05:43.100> nothing<00:05:43.400> happens<00:05:43.730> and<00:05:43.910> it

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
then nothing that nothing happens and it

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.760 
then nothing that nothing happens and it
doesn't<00:05:44.210> work<00:05:44.330> on<00:05:44.480> stone<00:05:44.930> either<00:05:45.260> so<00:05:45.650> I'm

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
doesn't work on stone either so I'm

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.310 
doesn't work on stone either so I'm
confused<00:05:46.340> on<00:05:46.550> what<00:05:47.000> this<00:05:47.180> is<00:05:47.240> really<00:05:47.810> for

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
confused on what this is really for

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.960 
confused on what this is really for
although<00:05:48.560> it<00:05:48.650> looks<00:05:48.890> pretty<00:05:49.100> cool<00:05:49.310> hopefully

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
although it looks pretty cool hopefully

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.300 
although it looks pretty cool hopefully
