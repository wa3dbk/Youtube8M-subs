you can put in the dishwasher so we're

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.850 
you can put in the dishwasher so we're
going<00:00:53.860> to<00:00:54.220> just<00:00:54.460> cut<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.989> chicken<00:00:56.050> on<00:00:56.650> either

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
going to just cut this chicken on either

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.440

side<00:00:57.460> of<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:58.480> backbone<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:00.460> it's<00:01:00.640> you<00:01:01.420> know

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
side of the backbone and it's you know

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.150 
side of the backbone and it's you know
takes<00:01:01.870> a<00:01:01.930> little<00:01:02.050> elbow<00:01:02.260> grease<00:01:02.440> that's<00:01:02.950> not

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
takes a little elbow grease that's not

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.300 
takes a little elbow grease that's not
to<00:01:03.310> complicate<00:01:03.579> it<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:04.770> because<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:05.979> breast

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
to complicate it and because the breast

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.390 
to complicate it and because the breast
meat<00:01:06.490> cooks<00:01:07.000> at<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.330> faster<00:01:08.170> rate<00:01:08.200> than<00:01:08.800> the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
meat cooks at a faster rate than the

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.190 
meat cooks at a faster rate than the
dark<00:01:10.390> meat<00:01:12.030> having<00:01:13.030> it<00:01:13.120> lie<00:01:13.300> flat<00:01:13.630> just<00:01:13.900> gives

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
dark meat having it lie flat just gives

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.390 
dark meat having it lie flat just gives
you<00:01:14.290> a<00:01:14.320> better<00:01:14.500> chance<00:01:14.620> of<00:01:15.010> having<00:01:15.190> a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
you a better chance of having a

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.840 
you a better chance of having a
perfectly<00:01:15.909> cooked<00:01:16.210> chicken<00:01:16.930> I<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:21.549> to<00:01:21.729> use

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
perfectly cooked chicken I like to use

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.080 
perfectly cooked chicken I like to use
kosher<00:01:22.090> chickens<00:01:22.600> if<00:01:22.690> I<00:01:22.810> can<00:01:22.960> find<00:01:23.170> them

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
kosher chickens if I can find them

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.700 
kosher chickens if I can find them
because<00:01:25.090> they're<00:01:25.270> often<00:01:25.600> brined<00:01:25.960> and<00:01:26.290> advance

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
because they're often brined and advance

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.320 
because they're often brined and advance

which means sort of soaked in salt water

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.870 
which means sort of soaked in salt water
so<00:01:28.720> they<00:01:28.810> really<00:01:29.049> play<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.290> fun<00:01:29.590> now<00:01:30.580> what
