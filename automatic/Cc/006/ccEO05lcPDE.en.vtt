00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.740
 but no hardware power too 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.539
 just make two pieces like 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.150
 that of the lg pro 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.789

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.859
 buttons but we have a 4.3 inch 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.410

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.620
 Lightning a riester as you can with dual 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.540
 situation speakers on and 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.659
 switch off earphone jack in 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.360
 microphone the loud knob of course 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.860
 micro-usb also microphone to load 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.100
 transfer us to the data 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.739
 we also have Android 4.4 again 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.580
 Kitkat installed is called with the new 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.379
 law blog functions where i am under 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.949
 certain can touch here for 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.269
 attract 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.129
 I've just seen a lot of me 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.379
 I heard that is nice and fast 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.189
 the dual core processor it in breiviks 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.189
 added 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.640
 where i like the camera for example 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.829
 can start then we can the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.399
 Backward 5 can be short 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.680
 look at 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.759
 that seems to be pleasantly fast 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.040
 display is not too strong 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.600
 picklapp ingo knows even darker 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.740
 a bit too from the side of 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.990
 on the other side, maybe you can see that 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.700
 very bad because here as reflected 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:32.560
 but well let's see the camera 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.090
 the camera has resolution before synonymous 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.280
 okay, but quite dark 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.789
 from the sharpness not completely okay 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.830
 already looked bad and otherwise 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.580
 the markets are not good at speed anymore 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.580
 Chrome on 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.420
 Arrange also brings a message 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.900
 comes exactly no thank you could see that 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.460
 the keyboard 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.420
 okay, I go to the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.420
 normal keyboard love 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.930
 it wise you can also characters 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:06.040
 use 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.050
 or indeed without that 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.240
 but characters work in themselves 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.010
 Nice place keyboard everything no 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.200
 problem to use about that too 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.170
 the turn mutated fine too deep 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.000
 fast with that was the lgl 65 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.680
 smartphone very short hands on the phone 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.970
 water until next time 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.970
