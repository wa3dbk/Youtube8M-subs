00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
I've cut hair piece of former foam

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.310 
I've cut hair piece of former foam
there's<00:00:20.340> black<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.850> there's<00:00:21.060> white<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:22.109> it's

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
there's black and there's white and it's

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.300 
there's black and there's white and it's
a<00:00:22.500> sort<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.980> man<00:00:23.430> phone<00:00:24.269> dense<00:00:24.779> foam<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.560> if

a sort of man phone dense foam and if
you'd<00:00:26.519> say<00:00:26.760> more<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.240> can<00:00:27.390> look<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.689> my<00:00:27.869> blog

the<00:00:29.750> three<00:00:30.750> mil<00:00:31.050> means<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.830> can<00:00:31.980> put<00:00:32.130> you

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
the three mil means that you can put you

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.590 
the three mil means that you can put you
through<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> sewing<00:00:32.790> machine<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.270> that's<00:00:33.450> a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
through a sewing machine so that's a

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.720 
through a sewing machine so that's a
real<00:00:33.840> advantage<00:00:34.140> but<00:00:35.040> how<00:00:35.309> we're<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.670> to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
real advantage but how we're going to

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.400 
real advantage but how we're going to
play<00:00:35.910> with<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.300> well<00:00:36.660> I'm<00:00:36.960> going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> put<00:00:37.380> a

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
play with it well I'm going to put a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.530 
play with it well I'm going to put a
piece<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.680> foil<00:00:38.160> which<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.760> transferring<00:00:39.420> onto

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
piece of foil which is transferring onto

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.549 
piece of foil which is transferring onto
the<00:00:39.780> surface<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:41.040> cover<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:41.640> some<00:00:42.559> slick

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
the surface and cover it with some slick

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.639 
the surface and cover it with some slick
and<00:00:43.739> sheets<00:00:44.149> in<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.360> also<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.140> your<00:00:46.289> iron

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
and sheets in it also to have your iron

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.470 
and sheets in it also to have your iron
on<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.300> a<00:00:48.300> slow<00:00:48.930> methodical<00:00:49.559> iron<00:00:50.489> because

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
on and a slow methodical iron because

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.420 
on and a slow methodical iron because
what<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> foil<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.410> doing<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.190> actually

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
what the foil is doing it's actually

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.979 
what the foil is doing it's actually
attaching<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.809> warm<00:00:55.230> surface<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.989> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
attaching to the warm surface of the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.599 
attaching to the warm surface of the
form<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.590> them<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.100> actually<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
form of them so it's actually a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.040 
form of them so it's actually a
molecular<00:01:00.210> bond<00:01:00.449> rather<00:01:00.750> than<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.020> just

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
molecular bond rather than it just

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.950 
molecular bond rather than it just
sitting<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.890> surface<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.570> having<00:01:03.930> done

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
sitting on the surface so having done

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.190 
sitting on the surface so having done
that<00:01:04.790> you'll<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.510> wriggles<00:01:06.960> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
that you'll see that it wriggles a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.460 
that you'll see that it wriggles a
little<00:01:07.500> bit<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.360> if<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:09.900> carefully

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
little bit and if you then carefully

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.760 
little bit and if you then carefully
peel<00:01:11.159> surface<00:01:11.939> apart<00:01:12.360> you'll<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.560> how

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
peel surface apart you'll see how

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.859 
peel surface apart you'll see how
wonderfully<00:01:14.400> glistening<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.299> tastes<00:01:15.540> with

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
wonderfully glistening it tastes with

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.960 
wonderfully glistening it tastes with
the<00:01:16.020> foil<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:17.070> obviously<00:01:17.400> there's<00:01:17.610> lots<00:01:17.850> of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the foil and obviously there's lots of

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.260 
the foil and obviously there's lots of
different<00:01:18.360> foils<00:01:18.810> available<00:01:19.820> to<00:01:20.820> suit<00:01:21.060> your

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
different foils available to suit your

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.740

palate and having done that what else
can<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.200> do<00:01:25.380> although<00:01:25.860> that's<00:01:26.280> quite<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> nice

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
can we do although that's quite a nice

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.979 
of my all-time favorites peacock so
that's<00:03:12.910> what<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.299> can<00:03:13.450> do<00:03:13.570> with<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.780> but<00:03:13.959> we

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
that's what you can do with it but we

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.050 
that's what you can do with it but we
just<00:03:14.200> need<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.620> let<00:03:14.769> that<00:03:14.980> one<00:03:15.190> dry<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:15.850> little

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
just need to let that one dry a little

just need to let that one dry a little
bit<00:03:16.359> before<00:03:17.040> one<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.430> did<00:03:18.640> earlier<00:03:18.790> and

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
bit before one that I did earlier and

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.170 
bit before one that I did earlier and
you<00:03:20.200> can<00:03:20.380> see<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.650> difference<00:03:21.280> here<00:03:21.700> is

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
you can see the difference here is

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.030 
you can see the difference here is
exactly<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.810> same<00:03:23.019> colors<00:03:23.410> but<00:03:23.590> what<00:03:23.799> I've

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
exactly the same colors but what I've

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.990 
exactly the same colors but what I've
done<00:03:24.280> is<00:03:24.519> enhance<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.570> surface<00:03:26.400> with<00:03:27.400> some<00:03:27.880> of

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
done is enhance the surface with some of

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.110 
done is enhance the surface with some of
the<00:03:28.950> gilding<00:03:29.950> waxes<00:03:30.430> this<00:03:30.640> one<00:03:30.850> just<00:03:31.000> happens

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
the gilding waxes this one just happens

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.080 
the gilding waxes this one just happens
to<00:03:31.540> be<00:03:31.570> peacock<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:33.040> when<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.340> paint's<00:03:33.790> dry

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
to be peacock and when the paint's dry

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.920 
to be peacock and when the paint's dry
we<00:03:34.600> can<00:03:34.780> just<00:03:35.019> add<00:03:35.260> further<00:03:36.780> enhancement<00:03:37.780> of

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
we can just add further enhancement of

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.900 
we can just add further enhancement of
color<00:03:38.200> that<00:03:38.410> sounds<00:03:38.769> very<00:03:38.859> posh<00:03:39.220> but<00:03:39.489> really

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
color that sounds very posh but really

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.539 
color that sounds very posh but really
it's<00:03:40.030> just<00:03:40.180> adding<00:03:40.660> layers<00:03:41.019> of<00:03:41.320> color<00:03:41.590> on<00:03:41.859> to

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
it's just adding layers of color on to

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.199 
it's just adding layers of color on to
give<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:42.910> real<00:03:43.299> deep<00:03:43.840> rich<00:03:44.940> illusion<00:03:45.940> that

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
give that real deep rich illusion that

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.890 
give that real deep rich illusion that
we've<00:03:46.780> changed<00:03:47.250> essentially<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.400> very<00:03:48.900> boring
