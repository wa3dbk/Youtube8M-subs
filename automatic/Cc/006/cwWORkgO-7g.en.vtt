can<00:00:44.460> save<00:00:44.760> different<00:00:45.210> profiles<00:00:45.750> depending<00:00:46.530> on

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
can save different profiles depending on

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.670 
can save different profiles depending on
you<00:00:46.770> know<00:00:46.940> what<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.899> loadout<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.500> want

this is customizable you can edit the
titles<00:01:02.930> but<00:01:03.930> basically<00:01:04.760> yeah<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:07.670> gems

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
titles but basically yeah if you gems

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.520 
titles but basically yeah if you gems
are<00:01:08.820> divided<00:01:09.180> into<00:01:09.299> boost<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.840> assist<00:01:10.110> gem<00:01:10.320> so

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
are divided into boost and assist gem so

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.899 
are divided into boost and assist gem so
if<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.710> scroll<00:01:11.010> down<00:01:11.189> here<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.610> see<00:01:11.790> we

if you scroll down here you can see we
have<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.030> lot<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.240> different<00:01:13.070> boost<00:01:14.070> gems<00:01:14.369> which

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
have a lot of different boost gems which

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.609 
have a lot of different boost gems which
have<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> same<00:01:15.150> name<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.439> have

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
have the same name but they have

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.859 
have the same name but they have
different<00:01:17.330> effects<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.540> different

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
different effects in different

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.300 
different effects in different
activation<00:01:19.229> conditions<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:20.009> well<00:01:20.159> as

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
activation conditions as well as

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.670 
activation conditions as well as
different<00:01:20.460> effect<00:01:21.210> times<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.650> example

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
different effect times so for example

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.230 
different effect times so for example
this<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.189> right<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.880> connect<00:01:24.180> with

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
this one right here you connect with

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.719 
this one right here you connect with
tents<00:01:24.570> normal<00:01:25.200> moves<00:01:25.439> you'll<00:01:26.220> get<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> twenty

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
tents normal moves you'll get a twenty

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.030 
tents normal moves you'll get a twenty
percent<00:01:27.000> damage<00:01:27.930> boosts<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.710> there's<00:01:28.860> also

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
percent damage boosts but there's also

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.679 
percent damage boosts but there's also
an<00:01:29.189> additional<00:01:29.549> penalty<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.180> minus<00:01:30.390> ten

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
an additional penalty of a minus ten

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.990 
an additional penalty of a minus ten
percent<00:01:31.079> speed<00:01:31.979> decrease<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.850> will

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
percent speed decrease and this will

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.020 
percent speed decrease and this will
last<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.329> 15<00:01:33.630> seconds<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:35.220> balanced<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
last for 15 seconds so we balanced the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.780 
last for 15 seconds so we balanced the
gem<00:01:36.299> system<00:01:36.780> by<00:01:36.960> taking<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.500> account<00:01:37.590> how<00:01:38.490> hard

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
gem system by taking to account how hard

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.999 
gem system by taking to account how hard
it<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.150> activate<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> effect<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
it is to activate what the effect of the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.889 
it is to activate what the effect of the
gem<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:41.640> well<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:42.030> how<00:01:42.299> long<00:01:42.570> it'll<00:01:42.840> be

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
gem is as well as how long it'll be

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.319 
gem is as well as how long it'll be
activated<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.090> one

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
activated so you can see here this one

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.270 
activated so you can see here this one
if<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.780> block<00:01:46.020> 5<00:01:46.259> times<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.710> get<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.189> know

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
if you block 5 times you get a you know

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.460 
if you block 5 times you get a you know
straight<00:01:47.520> up<00:01:47.549> ten<00:01:48.299> percent<00:01:48.630> damage<00:01:48.750> boost<00:01:49.170> for

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
straight up ten percent damage boost for

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.889 
straight up ten percent damage boost for
20<00:01:49.740> seconds<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.310> there's<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.390> variety

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
20 seconds so there's a lot of variety

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.450 
20 seconds so there's a lot of variety
here<00:01:52.049> what<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:52.320> want<00:01:52.530> players<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.310> go

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
that you take so it's a little different

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.270 
that you take so it's a little different
than<00:02:23.510> attack<00:02:24.510> than<00:02:25.110> having<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.590> defense<00:02:26.010> boost

basically the amount of damage
calculated<00:02:31.140> will<00:02:31.230> be<00:02:31.320> decreased<00:02:31.680> by<00:02:31.830> set

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
calculated will be decreased by set

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.820 
calculated will be decreased by set
amount<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.450> that's<00:02:33.630> what<00:02:33.750> fortitude<00:02:34.230> does<00:02:34.440> we

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
amount so that's what fortitude does we

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.280 
amount so that's what fortitude does we
got<00:02:34.950> divine<00:02:35.280> speed<00:02:35.670> here<00:02:35.940> these<00:02:36.290> basically

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
got divine speed here these basically

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.680 
got divine speed here these basically
increase<00:02:37.800> your<00:02:37.950> movement<00:02:38.430> speed<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:39.480> they

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
increase your movement speed so they

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.930 
increase your movement speed so they
don't<00:02:39.810> increase<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.530> speed<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.220> attacks<00:02:41.520> your

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
you to do come in it's easier you get a

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.680 
you to do come in it's easier you get a
ten<00:03:41.250> percent<00:03:41.400> decrease<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:42.210> attack

always active for example cancellous is
the<00:03:47.640> same<00:03:47.850> thing<00:03:48.020> ten<00:03:49.020> percent<00:03:49.290> decrease<00:03:49.560> auto

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
the same thing ten percent decrease auto

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.310 
the same thing ten percent decrease auto
throw<00:03:50.250> escape<00:03:50.610> auto<00:03:50.820> block<00:03:51.150> these<00:03:51.450> use<00:03:52.140> your

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
throw escape auto block these use your

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.810 
throw escape auto block these use your
meter<00:03:52.530> basically<00:03:53.100> so<00:03:53.250> if<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.460> run<00:03:53.670> out<00:03:53.700> of

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
meter basically so if you run out of

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.700 
meter basically so if you run out of
super<00:03:54.360> meter<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:55.230> won't<00:03:55.380> be<00:03:55.470> able<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.680> use

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
super meter you won't be able to use

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.130 
super meter you won't be able to use
these<00:03:55.950> anymore<00:03:56.310> so<00:03:56.520> we<00:03:56.640> think<00:03:56.820> that<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:58.050> know

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
these anymore so we think that you know

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.660 
these anymore so we think that you know
they're<00:03:58.290> good<00:03:58.440> for<00:03:58.590> beginning<00:03:58.980> players<00:03:59.280> who

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
they're good for beginning players who

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.430 
they're good for beginning players who
have<00:04:00.090> problems<00:04:00.300> blocking<00:04:00.870> through<00:04:01.080> escape

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
have problems blocking through escape

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.170 
have problems blocking through escape
but<00:04:01.680> for<00:04:02.370> players<00:04:02.640> who<00:04:02.730> know<00:04:02.940> what<00:04:03.060> they're

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
but for players who know what they're

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.430 
but for players who know what they're
doing<00:04:03.240> then<00:04:03.570> they<00:04:03.690> don't<00:04:03.780> really<00:04:03.960> need<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.260> use

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
doing then they don't really need to use

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.050 
doing then they don't really need to use
these<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.830> they<00:04:04.890> can<00:04:05.040> focus<00:04:05.220> on<00:04:05.490> more<00:04:05.670> of<00:04:05.730> the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
these and they can focus on more of the

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.090 
these and they can focus on more of the
boost<00:04:06.540> gems<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.560> kind<00:04:07.740> of<00:04:07.770> making<00:04:08.040> your

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
boost gems and kind of making your

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.530 
boost gems and kind of making your
character<00:04:08.460> stronger<00:04:08.880> rather<00:04:09.090> than<00:04:09.270> just

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
character stronger rather than just

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.230 
character stronger rather than just
trying<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.440> cover<00:04:10.650> for<00:04:10.710> your<00:04:10.920> weaknesses<00:04:11.280> yeah
