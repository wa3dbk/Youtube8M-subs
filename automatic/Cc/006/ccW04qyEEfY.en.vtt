acid or whatever it is I killed these

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.310 
acid or whatever it is I killed these
guys<00:01:13.799> usually<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.780> don't<00:01:15.930> need<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.170> kill

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
guys usually but you don't need to kill

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.170 
guys usually but you don't need to kill
them<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:17.280> don't<00:01:17.430> need<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> kill<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> first<00:01:17.970> guy

them you don't need to kill a first guy
but<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.600> suggest<00:01:19.110> killing<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.590> second<00:01:19.950> guy<00:01:20.040> if

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
but I suggest killing the second guy if

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.130 
but I suggest killing the second guy if
you're<00:01:20.460> waiting<00:01:21.000> for<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> thing<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.810> lasers

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.499 
you're waiting for the thing the lasers
to<00:01:22.409> turn<00:01:23.040> off<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:24.450> makes<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.840> much<00:01:24.990> easier<00:01:25.380> and

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
to turn off it makes so much easier and

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.969 
to turn off it makes so much easier and
yeah<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.600> got<00:01:27.750> shocked<00:01:28.020> by<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.200> guy<00:01:28.470> they<00:01:28.650> look

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.750 
across from that one because I can make
the<00:01:52.470> jump<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.800> and<00:01:52.890> take<00:01:52.980> so<00:01:53.160> much<00:01:53.280> time<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.670> you

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
the jump in and take so much time if you

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.670 
the jump in and take so much time if you
go<00:01:53.850> back<00:01:54.230> all<00:01:55.230> right<00:01:55.350> don't<00:01:55.470> worry<00:01:55.650> about

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
go back all right don't worry about

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.210 
go back all right don't worry about
those<00:01:55.950> barrels<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.490> jump<00:01:56.670> right<00:01:56.790> across

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.970

keep doing that until you get like near

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.260 
keep doing that until you get like near
the<00:02:12.990> bottom<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.560> then<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:14.220> go<00:02:14.340> up<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:15.120> want

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
the bottom and then just go up you want

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.670 
the bottom and then just go up you want
to<00:02:15.330> get<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.540> jump<00:02:15.810> right<00:02:16.020> so<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.260> jump<00:02:16.500> right

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
to get that jump right so you jump right

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.930 
to get that jump right so you jump right
to<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.950> flame<00:02:17.190> or<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:17.580> won't<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.790> able<00:02:17.850> to

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
to the flame or you won't be able to

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.810 
to the flame or you won't be able to
make<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> top<00:02:19.160> don't<00:02:20.160> don't<00:02:20.550> try

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
make it to the top don't don't try

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.190 
make it to the top don't don't try
falling<00:02:21.060> through<00:02:21.450> when<00:02:21.660> these<00:02:21.780> things<00:02:22.020> are

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
falling through when these things are

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.300 
falling through when these things are
going<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.590> want<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.920> go<00:02:23.040> through<00:02:23.280> just

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
going up you want to go through just

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.520 
going up you want to go through just
like<00:02:23.610> this<00:02:23.910> as<00:02:24.720> long<00:02:24.930> as<00:02:25.050> they're<00:02:25.170> going<00:02:25.320> down

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
like this as long as they're going down

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.800 
like this as long as they're going down
and<00:02:25.830> then<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.310> pop<00:02:26.520> in<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.970> jump

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
and then you just kind of pop in I jump

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.390 
and then you just kind of pop in I jump
here<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.140> don't<00:02:28.260> have<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.680> probably<00:02:29.130> should

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
here you don't have to I probably should

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.330 
here you don't have to I probably should
enough<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.760> made<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:31.709> but<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.160> can<00:02:32.310> I

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
enough I just made it and but you can I

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.040 
enough I just made it and but you can I
usually<00:02:32.970> leave<00:02:33.090> them<00:02:33.209> they<00:02:33.360> go<00:02:33.480> up<00:02:33.750> when<00:02:33.990> I

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
usually leave them they go up when I

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.500 
usually leave them they go up when I
make<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.320> jump<00:02:34.560> but<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:34.800> on<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:35.459> time<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.730> wait

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
make this jump but I on this time I wait

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.540 
make this jump but I on this time I wait
till<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.780> went<00:02:37.050> down<00:02:37.250> there's<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.340> make<00:02:38.459> it

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
till I went down there's to make it

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.300 
till I went down there's to make it
across<00:02:38.700> quickly<00:02:39.560> alright<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:40.739> this<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.160> is

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
across quickly alright so this this is

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.570 
across quickly alright so this this is
the<00:02:41.400> part<00:02:41.610> where<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.880> water<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.230> think<00:02:43.580> yep

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
the part where the water is I think yep

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.979 
the part where the water is I think yep
there<00:02:44.910> okay<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.830> guess<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:48.690> just<00:02:48.720> going<00:02:48.930> to

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
there okay I guess you just going to

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.350 
there okay I guess you just going to
stand<00:02:49.260> kind<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.650> near<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.890> more<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.120> left

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
stand kind of near the more to the left

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.810 
stand kind of near the more to the left
and<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.930> right<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.560> these<00:02:53.280> things<00:02:53.610> will

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
and to the right so these things will

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.310 
and to the right so these things will
hit<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.239> just<00:02:54.420> don't<00:02:54.660> even<00:02:54.900> touch<00:02:55.110> your

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
hit you and just don't even touch your

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.990 
hit you and just don't even touch your
left<00:02:55.470> Nick<00:02:55.800> just<00:02:56.010> keep<00:02:56.250> pressing<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.970> a

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
left Nick just keep pressing the a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.970 
left Nick just keep pressing the a
button<00:02:57.150> or<00:02:57.600> whatever<00:02:57.750> button<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.140> pressed<00:02:58.380> to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
button or whatever button you pressed to

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.410 
button or whatever button you pressed to
blow<00:02:59.130> up<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.550> keep<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.820> flies<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.239> back

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
blow up and keep the flies in the back

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.360 
blow up and keep the flies in the back
and<00:03:00.630> do<00:03:00.690> this<00:03:00.870> jump<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.350> want<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.590> wall<00:03:02.070> jump

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
and do this jump you want to wall jump

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.460 
and do this jump you want to wall jump
out<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.730> then<00:03:02.820> well<00:03:03.140> while<00:03:04.140> you're<00:03:04.320> in<00:03:04.380> the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
out and then well while you're in the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.229 
out and then well while you're in the
air<00:03:04.590> jump<00:03:05.250> back<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.850> should<00:03:06.000> make<00:03:06.120> that

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
air jump back and you should make that

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.750 
air jump back and you should make that
jump<00:03:06.480> no<00:03:06.630> problem<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.290> guess<00:03:08.190> that's<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.519> jump

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
jump no problem I guess that's a jump

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.560 
jump no problem I guess that's a jump
that<00:03:09.030> people<00:03:09.420> had<00:03:10.380> trouble<00:03:11.220> with<00:03:11.400> okay<00:03:11.820> again

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
that people had trouble with okay again

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.900 
that people had trouble with okay again
same<00:03:12.930> thing<00:03:12.959> here<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.830> stand<00:03:14.519> more<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.820> the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
same thing here is to stand more to the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.630 
same thing here is to stand more to the
right<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:17.010> can<00:03:17.130> actually<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.489> what

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
right so that you can actually have what

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.449 
right so that you can actually have what
these<00:03:18.440> hit<00:03:19.440> them<00:03:19.530> with<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.860> spinning<00:03:20.340> ball

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
these hit them with the spinning ball

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.600 
these hit them with the spinning ball
thing<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:22.200> just<00:03:22.230> use<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.860> bail<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.220> jump<00:03:23.459> up

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
thing and just use the bail to jump up

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.960 
thing and just use the bail to jump up
and<00:03:26.450> swallows<00:03:27.450> up<00:03:27.600> up<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:27.930> okay<00:03:28.910> now<00:03:29.910> the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
and swallows up up this okay now the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.340 
and swallows up up this okay now the
next<00:03:30.360> part<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:31.700> is<00:03:32.700> okay<00:03:33.060> okay<00:03:33.690> at<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:33.930> part<00:03:34.260> I

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
next part is is okay okay at this part I

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.650 
next part is is okay okay at this part I
don't<00:03:34.500> know<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:35.010> barrel<00:03:35.489> thing<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.880> figured

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
don't know this barrel thing I figured

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.759 
don't know this barrel thing I figured
out<00:03:36.720> how<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.870> do<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.350> right

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
out how to do it right

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.410 
out how to do it right
it<00:03:37.920> doesn't<00:03:38.280> look<00:03:38.400> difficult<00:03:38.640> in<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.150> video

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
it doesn't look difficult in the video

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.509 
it doesn't look difficult in the video
but<00:03:39.660> when<00:03:40.019> you<00:03:40.080> do<00:03:40.170> this<00:03:40.320> you<00:03:40.650> know<00:03:40.769> wait<00:03:41.070> till

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
but when you do this you know wait till

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.259 
but when you do this you know wait till
like<00:03:42.049> that<00:03:43.049> barrel<00:03:43.440> is<00:03:43.620> down<00:03:43.889> far<00:03:44.579> enough<00:03:44.609> so

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
like that barrel is down far enough so

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.550 
like that barrel is down far enough so
that<00:03:45.299> it'll<00:03:45.600> actually<00:03:45.720> hit<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.079> cuz<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.380> did

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
that it'll actually hit it cuz I did

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.660 
that it'll actually hit it cuz I did
that<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.709> bunch<00:03:46.920> of<00:03:47.010> times<00:03:47.250> and

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
that a bunch of times and

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.210 
that a bunch of times and
even<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.540> just<00:03:48.690> missed<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.290> completely<00:03:49.890> all

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
even it just missed it completely all

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.380 
even it just missed it completely all
right<00:03:50.340> here<00:03:50.520> just<00:03:50.640> one<00:03:50.790> get<00:03:50.940> next<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.240> that

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
right here just one get next to that

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.900 
right here just one get next to that
platform<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:52.200> jump<00:03:52.920> up<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.280> kind<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.550> swing

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
platform and jump up and kind of swing

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.300 
platform and jump up and kind of swing
over<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.840> grab<00:03:55.170> onto<00:03:55.410> it<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.860> then<00:03:56.040> right

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
over so you grab onto it and then right

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.960 
over so you grab onto it and then right
at<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.430> end<00:03:56.610> there<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.790> can<00:03:57.030> jump<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.760> just

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
at the end there you can jump and just

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.260 
at the end there you can jump and just
jump<00:04:00.180> through<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.810> fall<00:04:01.230> down<00:04:01.260> here<00:04:02.270> and

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
jump through that and fall down here and

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.229 
jump through that and fall down here and
now<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:03.450> can<00:04:03.540> jump<00:04:03.810> across<00:04:07.520> and<00:04:08.520> that's<00:04:09.060> the

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
now you can jump across and that's the

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.830 
now you can jump across and that's the
end<00:04:09.330> of<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.450> video<00:04:09.630> if<00:04:10.590> anyone<00:04:10.920> else<00:04:11.069> has<00:04:11.250> any
