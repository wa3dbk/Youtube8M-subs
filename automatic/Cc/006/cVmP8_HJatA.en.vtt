00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.370 
also in this video there's what happened
was<00:03:06.350> I<00:03:06.590> was<00:03:07.370> finishing<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.480> world<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:08.900> some

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
was I was finishing the world and some

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.820 
was I was finishing the world and some
reason<00:03:09.800> I<00:03:10.010> will<00:03:10.400> just<00:03:10.790> do<00:03:11.600> safe<00:03:12.020> so<00:03:12.380> I<00:03:12.620> have

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
reason I will just do safe so I have

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.350 
reason I will just do safe so I have
built<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.160> house<00:03:13.280> again<00:03:13.580> exactly<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.090> same

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
built the house again exactly the same

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.500 
built the house again exactly the same
but<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:16.300> isn't<00:03:17.300> I<00:03:18.580> had<00:03:19.580> to<00:03:19.730> redo<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.150> because

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
but it isn't I had to redo it because

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.210 
but it isn't I had to redo it because
the<00:03:20.840> world<00:03:21.019> didn't<00:03:21.260> safe<00:03:21.470> but<00:03:21.709> it's<00:03:21.890> still<00:03:22.070> the

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
the world didn't safe but it's still the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.070 
the world didn't safe but it's still the
same<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:23.000> would<00:03:23.390> live<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.630> notice<00:03:23.959> the

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
same so you would live and notice the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.870 
same so you would live and notice the
difference<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:27.470> I'll<00:03:27.530> be<00:03:27.620> doing<00:03:27.709> some<00:03:28.100> off<00:03:28.370> off

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
difference so I'll be doing some off off

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.660 
difference so I'll be doing some off off
the<00:03:29.390> housework<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.160> I'll<00:03:31.160> probably<00:03:31.280> do<00:03:31.519> the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
the housework so I'll probably do the
