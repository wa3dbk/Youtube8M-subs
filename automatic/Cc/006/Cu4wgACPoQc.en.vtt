this cog system at the back as well and
this<00:02:00.780> does<00:02:01.020> operate<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.590> wings<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.069> if<00:02:02.219> you

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
this does operate the wings so if you

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.809 
this does operate the wings so if you
move<00:02:02.639> that<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.600> will<00:02:03.780> pull<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> wings<00:02:04.380> upwards

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
move that it will pull the wings upwards

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.600 
move that it will pull the wings upwards
so<00:02:05.819> it's<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.450> flapping<00:02:07.049> motion<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.580> that

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
so it's like a flapping motion so that

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.460 
so it's like a flapping motion so that
feature<00:02:09.030> does<00:02:09.300> come<00:02:09.479> into<00:02:09.600> effect<00:02:09.780> when<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.350> is

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
feature does come into effect when it is

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.790 
feature does come into effect when it is
transformed<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:12.569> diner<00:02:13.110> bottom<00:02:13.680> oh

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
transformed in to this diner bottom oh

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.809 
transformed in to this diner bottom oh
so<00:02:14.040> there<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.310> go

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
so there you go

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.940 
so there you go
that<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.840> two<00:02:16.080> modes<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.770> can

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
that is the two modes that you can

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.339 
that is the two modes that you can
expect<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.610> from<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:18.209> set<00:02:18.450> also<00:02:18.900> these

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
expect it from and this set also these

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.710 
expect it from and this set also these
do<00:02:19.739> convert<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:20.970> like<00:02:21.180> any<00:02:21.450> other

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
do convert it just like any other

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.650 
do convert it just like any other
transformer<00:02:22.560> because<00:02:22.709> it<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.069> a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
transformer because it is a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.690 
transformer because it is a
and<00:02:23.900> says<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.740> would<00:02:24.890> expect<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.430> would<00:02:25.550> have

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
and says you would expect you would have

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.850 
and says you would expect you would have
to<00:02:25.850> dissemble<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.780> then<00:02:27.230> construct<00:02:27.710> it

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
to dissemble it and then construct it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.310 
to dissemble it and then construct it
again<00:02:28.130> but<00:02:28.340> no<00:02:28.490> all<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.820> do<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:29.420> manipulated

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
again but no all you do is manipulated

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.770 
again but no all you do is manipulated
in<00:02:30.440> just<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.860> same<00:02:31.070> as<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.430> normal<00:02:31.910> transformer

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
in just the same as a normal transformer

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.960 
in just the same as a normal transformer
to<00:02:33.380> convert<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.160> will<00:02:34.430> never<00:02:34.640> have<00:02:34.940> to

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
to convert so you will never have to

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.930 
to convert so you will never have to
break<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.540> down<00:02:35.570> into<00:02:36.320> small<00:02:36.890> parts<00:02:37.310> ever

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
break it down into small parts ever

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.880 
break it down into small parts ever
again<00:02:38.420> well<00:02:38.600> guys<00:02:38.750> thanks<00:02:39.200> for<00:02:39.410> joining<00:02:39.740> me
