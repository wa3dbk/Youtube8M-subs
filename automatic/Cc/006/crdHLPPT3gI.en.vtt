just<00:00:21.449> bringing<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.840> camera<00:00:21.990> closer<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.160> first

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
just bringing a camera closer so first

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.820 

should<00:00:49.430> also<00:00:49.640> mention<00:00:49.970> that<00:00:50.270> these<00:00:50.690> are<00:00:51.050> using

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
should also mention that these are using

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.620 
should also mention that these are using
the<00:00:52.010> auto<00:00:52.370> feature<00:00:54.340> so<00:00:55.340> no<00:00:55.850> manual<00:00:56.270> settings

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
the auto feature so no manual settings

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.370 
the auto feature so no manual settings
and<00:00:57.190> I'm<00:00:58.190> free<00:00:58.670> handing<00:00:59.150> the<00:00:59.870> camera<00:01:00.350> so<00:01:00.590> no

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
and I'm free handing the camera so no

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.840 
and I'm free handing the camera so no
tripod<00:01:03.380> which<00:01:03.920> means<00:01:04.190> it<00:01:04.280> might<00:01:04.370> be<00:01:04.520> a<00:01:04.550> little

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
tripod which means it might be a little

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.630 
tripod which means it might be a little
jittery<00:01:05.860> so<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:06.920> looks<00:01:07.100> like<00:01:07.160> that's<00:01:07.340> about<00:01:07.490> as

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
jittery so it looks like that's about as

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.620 
jittery so it looks like that's about as
far<00:01:07.820> as<00:01:08.060> I<00:01:08.240> can<00:01:08.300> zoom<00:01:08.930> in<00:01:10.000> free<00:01:11.000> handing<00:01:11.450> it

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
far as I can zoom in free handing it

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.920 
far as I can zoom in free handing it
because<00:01:12.290> it<00:01:12.440> is<00:01:13.300> correcting<00:01:14.300> for<00:01:14.479> my<00:01:14.600> shaking

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
because it is correcting for my shaking

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.740 
because it is correcting for my shaking
hand<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:15.890> we're<00:01:16.160> going<00:01:16.369> to<00:01:16.460> bring<00:01:17.560> in<00:01:18.560> the

camera

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.080 

and<00:01:36.009> that's<00:01:36.759> a<00:01:37.060> coin<00:01:37.659> in<00:01:38.880> direct<00:01:39.880> sunlight

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
and that's a coin in direct sunlight

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.480 
and that's a coin in direct sunlight
inside<00:01:40.720> here<00:01:41.020> is<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.259> same<00:01:41.560> coin<00:01:42.689> indoors

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
inside here is the same coin indoors

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.429 
inside here is the same coin indoors
zooming<00:01:45.490> using<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.909> lens<00:01:46.119> with<00:01:46.720> overhead

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:54.539 
zooming using the lens with overhead
compact<00:01:48.070> fluorescent<00:01:48.640> lighting<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.619> again

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
compact fluorescent lighting and again

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.029 
compact fluorescent lighting and again
it's<00:01:54.880> in<00:01:55.030> fully<00:01:55.630> auto<00:01:55.960> mode<00:01:56.409> so<00:01:56.710> it's<00:01:56.830> trying

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
it's in fully auto mode so it's trying

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:09.300 
it's in fully auto mode so it's trying
to<00:01:57.159> correct<00:01:57.399> for<00:01:57.520> my<00:01:58.110> shaking<00:01:59.110> hand

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.410 

looks<00:02:10.310> like<00:02:10.429> about<00:02:10.579> as<00:02:10.789> close<00:02:10.969> as<00:02:11.030> I'm<00:02:11.299> going

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
looks like about as close as I'm going

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.910 
looks like about as close as I'm going
to<00:02:11.480> get<00:02:11.629> it<00:02:11.750> without<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.110> tripod<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:12.860> I'm

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
to get it without the tripod so I'm

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.630 
to get it without the tripod so I'm
going<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.129> zoom<00:02:13.189> back<00:02:13.340> out<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:15.489> bring<00:02:16.489> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
going to zoom back out and bring the

going to zoom back out and bring the
camera<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.170> object

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.440 

okay<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:34.459> that's<00:02:35.110> indoor<00:02:36.970> overhead<00:02:37.970> compact

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450

this<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:43.330> benchmade<00:02:44.330> triage<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:45.230> handle<00:02:45.950> is

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
this is a benchmade triage the handle is

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.190 
this is a benchmade triage the handle is
textured<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:48.739> we're<00:02:48.890> going<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.069> zoom<00:02:49.430> in<00:02:50.200> see

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
textured so we're going to zoom in see

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.440 
textured so we're going to zoom in see
how<00:02:51.349> that<00:02:51.560> comes<00:02:51.769> out<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.760> again<00:02:59.090> i'm<00:02:59.239> free

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.449 
how that comes out and again i'm free
handing<00:02:59.840> it<00:02:59.959> so<00:03:00.170> i<00:03:00.200> can<00:03:00.410> only<00:03:00.500> get<00:03:00.739> so<00:03:00.769> close

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459
