Hey guys this is Eddie the Magic Monk
welcome to another technology tutorial

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.180
today I want to introduce you guys to
Microsoft DOS commands now you might be

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.560
asking or what are they and do I need
them while back in the old days before

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.189
Microsoft Windows
there was an operating system called

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.500
Microsoft DOS and basically it was just
Windows without any sort of graphical

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.680
user interface so you couldn't drag and
drop anything and basically everything

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.770
had to be typed in on the keyboard so
for example if you wanted to go to a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.960
certain folder you had to type that in
if you had to run a program you had to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.220
type in the file name of the program and
so on so you might ask well why do we

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.850
need to learn that now now that we have
Windows and for those Apple users now

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.299
that we have Mac OS where everything is
done with the mouse why do we need to go

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.930
back to Microsoft DOS commands and
that's because when you encounter a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:34.829
problem for example let's say your hard
drive space has run out or your computer

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.549
is infected with a virus and all those
sorts of problems it's a lot easier to

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:49.950
fix when you have some Microsoft DOS
knowledge so how do we get into command

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.409
prompt that's the first thing we'll go
through so basically all you do is you

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.500
right click on the bottom left hand
corner of your windows 8 and you click

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.399
command prompt admin so you click that
and then do you want to allow this

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.510
program
click yes and then you are in Microsoft

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:23.770
DOS which is run under administrator
mode command prompts ok so here is where

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.900
pretty much you can do everything like
you did in Microsoft DOS back in

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:38.160
nineteen ninety three or four or
whatever ok so another thing you want to

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.650
know is if you weren't in Windows 8 if
you were in Windows 7 you can also go in

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.069
to it through clicking the start button
and then clicking run and then type in

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:59.980
CMD and then press ok and you can also
get into command prompt that way just

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.500
make sure that when you go into it that
it says administrator access at the top

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.370
of the title bar because you kind of
need administrator access if you want to

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:23.500
do anything important ok so now the
first thing we'll do is learn how to

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.370
change folders you can see that right
now

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.609
we're inside the windows folder and
we're inside the system32 folder within

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.769
the windows folder so normally if
you want it to get into this folder you

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:48.040
go to Windows Explorer go to C Drive
windows and then you would go to system

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:56.620
32 you go into it that way right but
here in dos we this means that we're

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.019
already inside that folder so if you
want to get out of that folder if you

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:10.180
want to go back up one level you would
type cd.. and this represents

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:18.190
that we've just got out of the system 32
folder and if you type cd.. again

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.690
you would then go back up one more level
and now you're in the root folder so

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.650
what if you want to get inside the
windows folder again you would type cd

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:37.050
space windows by the way cd stands for
change directory and then if you want to

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:45.420
get into the system32 folder you would
type cd space system 32 so now this will

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:53.070
get you out of the folder and this will
get you in the folder okay the next

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.820
thing you guys need to know is what if I
want to jump back up two or three

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:09.870
folders I'm not going to type cd.. cd..
instead of typing it twice I can just

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:18.690
type in cd\ and that will get me
out a lot quicker similarly if I want to

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.450
go inside system 32 instead of typing 2
cd comments I can just type cd space

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:33.300
windows\system 32 and I can get
inside that folder really quickly okay

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:40.800
so what can you do once you're inside
the folder well you can type dir which

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:49.110
lists all the files in that folder or in
that directory now you can see that it

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:56.460
lists all of it in one column and if you
want to list the files sideways you can

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:08.970
type dir space/w and that will
list the files oh it used to anyway

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.760
listening more horizontally but

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:24.949
now it doesn't now just list them without
any file info so anyway or you can also

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:33.410
type in dir space / s and what that
does is not only does it list all the

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:41.300
files in the system32 directory it'll
also list any files in any folders

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:48.590
within the system32 folder so all the
files in the subfolders so if you type

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:55.900
that you can see that a lot more files
come up and it has listed all the files

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:03.830
within the subfolders of system32 and
you notice that at the end of it it

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.650
tells you how many files there have been
listed

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:17.780
how many folders there are and how big
the files are in total and how much

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:28.009
space we have left right so we have 35
gigabytes left ok so this concludes our

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:32.680
first tutorial I'll see you guys next
time.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.669
