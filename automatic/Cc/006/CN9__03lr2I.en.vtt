00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
lights on and I Zuzu or Chevrolet or box

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.459 
lights on and I Zuzu or Chevrolet or box
or<00:00:08.639> brother<00:00:08.940> pickup<00:00:09.540> they<00:00:09.929> will<00:00:10.080> use<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> same

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
or brother pickup they will use the same

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.980 
or brother pickup they will use the same
light<00:00:10.920> pretty<00:00:11.790> much<00:00:11.910> exactly<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.450> same<00:00:12.509> truck

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
light pretty much exactly the same truck

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.289 
light pretty much exactly the same truck
right<00:00:13.799> then<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.340> there's<00:00:14.519> four<00:00:14.730> screws<00:00:14.940> to

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
right then so there's four screws to

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.269 
right then so there's four screws to
undo<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:15.780> way<00:00:15.990> around<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.440> side<00:00:16.710> let's<00:00:17.010> start

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
undo so way around this side let's start

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.340 
undo so way around this side let's start
with<00:00:17.430> these<00:00:17.609> two<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.600> there's<00:00:18.779> two<00:00:19.020> screws

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
with these two so there's two screws

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.029 
with these two so there's two screws
here<00:00:19.740> they<00:00:19.920> just<00:00:19.949> cross<00:00:20.369> head<00:00:20.869> screws<00:00:21.869> okay<00:00:22.350> so

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
here they just cross head screws okay so

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.720 
here they just cross head screws okay so
I<00:00:23.070> was<00:00:23.279> one

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.430 

now<00:00:28.270> we<00:00:28.360> do<00:00:28.510> these<00:00:28.660> likes<00:00:28.900> and<00:00:29.110> a<00:00:29.140> couple<00:00:29.320> of

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
now we do these likes and a couple of

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.770 
now we do these likes and a couple of
combinations<00:00:30.040> obviously<00:00:30.490> this<00:00:30.670> is<00:00:31.000> this<00:00:31.600> is

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
combinations obviously this is this is

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.300 
combinations obviously this is this is
got<00:00:31.900> a<00:00:31.930> clear<00:00:32.230> indicator<00:00:32.710> with<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.040> orange

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
got a clear indicator with the orange

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.910 
got a clear indicator with the orange
bulb<00:00:33.580> then<00:00:33.970> reverse<00:00:34.390> then<00:00:34.720> Taylor<00:00:35.020> break<00:00:35.380> we

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
bulb then reverse then Taylor break we

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.530 
bulb then reverse then Taylor break we
do<00:00:36.130> this<00:00:36.280> light<00:00:36.550> also<00:00:36.970> with<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.240> orange

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
do this light also with the orange

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.460 
do this light also with the orange
section<00:00:37.750> and<00:00:39.270> like<00:00:40.270> this<00:00:40.510> so<00:00:40.570> I'll<00:00:40.930> take<00:00:41.350> this

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
section and like this so I'll take this

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.470 
section and like this so I'll take this
one<00:00:41.650> out<00:00:41.710> and<00:00:41.920> show<00:00:42.010> you<00:00:42.190> how<00:00:42.400> to<00:00:42.460> that<00:00:43.150> that

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
one out and show you how to that that

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.850 
one out and show you how to that that
they're<00:00:43.870> all<00:00:43.989> wired<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.470> same<00:00:44.500> they're

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
they're all wired the same they're

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.160 
they're all wired the same they're
interchangeable<00:00:45.150> so<00:00:46.150> when<00:00:46.300> you've<00:00:46.450> got<00:00:46.480> then

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
interchangeable so when you've got then

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.410 
interchangeable so when you've got then
you've<00:00:47.320> got<00:00:47.470> to<00:00:47.559> do<00:00:47.770> there's<00:00:48.550> two<00:00:48.940> screws

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
you've got to do there's two screws

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.720 
you've got to do there's two screws
inside<00:00:49.930> here<00:00:50.380> now<00:00:50.620> these<00:00:51.309> screws<00:00:51.700> are

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
inside here now these screws are

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.729 
inside here now these screws are
different<00:00:52.330> to<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.510> ones<00:00:52.600> on<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.050> outside<00:00:53.080> so

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
different to the ones on the outside so

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.440 
different to the ones on the outside so
keep<00:00:53.920> them<00:00:54.040> separate<00:00:54.550> but<00:00:55.000> these<00:00:55.150> come<00:00:55.420> with

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
keep them separate but these come with

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.560 
keep them separate but these come with
washers<00:00:56.200> okay<00:00:56.710> so<00:00:57.550> that's<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:58.030> ones<00:00:58.210> that<00:00:58.420> go

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
washers okay so that's the ones that go

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.440 
washers okay so that's the ones that go
on<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.900> outside<00:00:59.160> the<00:01:00.160> longer<00:01:00.520> ones<00:01:00.760> and<00:01:01.030> the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
where push that in together slip clicks

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.180 
where push that in together slip clicks
in<00:01:59.260> okay<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:00.460> then<00:02:00.550> just<00:02:00.580> fit<00:02:01.420> that<00:02:01.600> back<00:02:01.870> in
