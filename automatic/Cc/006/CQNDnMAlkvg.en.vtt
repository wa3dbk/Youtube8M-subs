you apply any sort of color on top of

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.800 
you apply any sort of color on top of
them<00:04:58.850> whatever<00:04:59.850> it<00:05:00.000> is<00:05:00.090> that<00:05:00.270> you<00:05:00.389> do<00:05:00.600> that

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
them whatever it is that you do that

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.090 
them whatever it is that you do that
would<00:05:01.020> make<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.290> feel<00:05:01.410> better<00:05:01.560> put<00:05:01.889> a<00:05:01.919> little

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
bit of gloss over them maybe that'll

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.810 
bit of gloss over them maybe that'll
last<00:05:03.690> longer<00:05:04.139> but<00:05:05.040> I<00:05:05.100> think<00:05:05.370> these<00:05:05.490> are<00:05:05.550> great

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820
