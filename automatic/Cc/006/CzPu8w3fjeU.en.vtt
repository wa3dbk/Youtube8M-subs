00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.139
 good evening the snow episode is in full swing 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.039
 northern regions in this 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.119
 monday evening 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.070
 the snowfall was important 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.449
 throughout the day she since 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.980
 the ribs of the sleeve going up 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.660
 to the northern regions with 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.189
 sometimes large accumulations 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.540
 all regions that extend from 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.640
 north of brittany to belgium 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.680
 are snowy tonight and cumulated them 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.210
 more important are observed on the side of 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.829
 Normandy or from the west of the 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.149
 picardie and the pas de calais it's 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.680
 especially the north of the department of 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.480
 sleeve and west of calvados which are 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.640
 most concerned with cumulations that 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.430
 tonight frequently exceeds 10 20 even 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.989
 25 centimeters of snow and with the wind 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.760
 all this forms important drifts 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.440
 you see it these two departments 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.000
 remain on red alert a 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.739
 red alert which in the end is 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.510
 perfectly justified in view of the 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.890
 current situation at least on the 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.050
 northern part of the department of the sleeve 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.430
 and the western part of Calvados 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.450
 snowfall will continue all 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.370
 throughout the next night 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.690
 from the north of Brittany to the 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.440
 belgium with still accumulations 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.610
 consistent 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.019
 and then you also notice that 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.149
 the ile-de-france the eure-and-loir passing 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.320
 orange level since we expect 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.270
 also enough snowfall 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.819
 important tomorrow from the end of 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.380
 morning so let's see together the 

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:16.060
 forecast for your Tuesday morning 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.189
 with this snowy axis that will expand 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.109
 from Belgium going back in 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.909
 going down pardon to brittany 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:23.350
 with still sustained rainfall 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.179
 significant snowfall that 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.889
 will lead to significant accumulations 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.149
 several centimeters in the space of 

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:29.560
 just a few hours you notice that 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.069
 the snow will also win the pool 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.170
 Parisian 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:33.819
 so at the very beginning of the morning at 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.509
 daybreak it will still often 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.799
 the slush 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.630
 but over the hours of the morning the 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.249
 temperatures will continue to drop and 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.409
 the snow will eventually fall alone until 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.090
 in the streets of the capital with our 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.439
 snow that will eventually hold on the ground 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.270
 especially at the approach of mid day 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.039
 so be careful further south this will be 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.810
 more rain between the center and the 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.189
 draft and then snow that goes 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.450
 always fall in abundance of the ribs 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.619
 from the sleeve to Belgium in 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.539
 the southern two-thirds a lot of grisaille 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.829
 but little rainfall with a time 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.929
 a little more 5 between the Rhone Valley 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.069
 and the Mediterranean basin in 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.990
 the afternoon this snowy axis goes 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.249
 finally very little evolved he goes 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.719
 always park on the same 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:06.939
 regions with snowfall 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.500
 always frequent and sustained from the north 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.700
 from brittany to belgium 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.010
 they will be a little weaker between the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.060
 south of brittany and the center region has 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.040
 always snowfall is 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.110
 Also on the Paris basin and 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.090
 can leave between 2 and 5 cm 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.090
 especially late afternoon so be 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.190
 cautious earlier 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.330
 pressed between the yonne and the plateau 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.890
 Lorraine and then on the southern two thirds 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.450
 from the country a lot of clouds with still 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.739
 some groups a few flakes here and 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.150
 there a drier and a few times 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.459
 between the Rhône valley and 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.050
 the Mediterranean basin 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.060
 temperatures for your Tuesday morning 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.379
 they are cold so on the 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.640
 northernmost regions we see 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.010
 although these cold retreats 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.920
 rushes from benelux to the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.720
 brittany between 0 and -3 degrees on average 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.220
 are these regions up to -4 degrees between 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.660
 lille amiens brussels and cork 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.730
 it will still take 4 degrees to 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.200
 orleans 5 to nevers 6 degrees to lyon or 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.940
 still 7 degrees to toulouse and then in 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.290
 the afternoon and well the stere is she 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.400
 negative across all regions 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.829
 located north of the Seine 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.540
 -1 to -2 degrees average of the 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.069
 Normandy to Belgium 0 degrees to 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.680
 trouble in the capital so the snow is going 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.040
 end up holding on the ground on paris intra 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.769
 muros 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.200
 4 ° on the side of Strasbourg 9 for Dijon to 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.250
 10 degrees east side of Macon 12 in Lyon 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.900
 and then it's still closer 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.829
 of the Mediterranean with temperatures 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.360
 still between 14 and 16 strike 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.190
 following with the day of Wednesday and 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.540
 this disturbance that goes this time 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.519
 shift to the southern regions 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.750
 we will find it between the Pyrenees 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.160
 the areas of the facade is she will be 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.630
 still much more attenuated than 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.310
 the day before then we will monitor when 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.690
 even a snowy risk at the beginning of 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.340
 morning especially on the regions 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.290
 located south of the Garonne with 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.519
 why not a few centimeters of 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.380
 snow on the side of the Toulouse region 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.849
 for example in the afternoon is 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.829
 temperatures will return to positive 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.329
 and the snow will rise above 400 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.069
 meters on the relief only a few 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.910
 snowfall also on the alps 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.230
 and more at the back the return of 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.030
 thunderstorms is expected between the gironde 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.859
 and the ardennes with a few 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.120
 showers in the afternoon after 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.709
 the ribs of the sleeve and noted this wind 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.239
 particularly neat 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.030
 the Atlantic arc with temperatures 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.349
 who will be truly at the lowest at 3 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.120
 degrees barely average on the north for 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.190
 the maximum temperatures 5 south 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.599
 we are eight to 10 degrees below 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.010
 normal season and you notice 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.870
 also only for Wednesday morning 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.099
 we expect very strong frosts on 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.280
 regions of the far north as the 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.930
 very snowy soils will be to a partner at 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.889
 nightly clearings and so the 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.209
 temperatures will drop 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.919
 we are talking about value that could 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.950
 to descend punctually below 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.180
 -10 degrees for Thursday the grisaille is going to 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.460
 maintain south west regions 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.690
 to the areas of the east facade with 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.250
 still a few flakes of time to 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.289
 others not much but it could 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.430
 sprinkle the soil especially early 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.270
 day on the eastern nation 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.590
 some showers 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.270
 only one on the northern regions and 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.950
 from the north west but not much and 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.480
 and then even a drier time with 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.710
 thunderstorms over the lion's gulf but 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.870
 you notice that the wind will blow 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.580
 particularly significantly an episode 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.540
 mistral and tramontane 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.790
 particularly violent is expected 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.380
 with gusts up to 100 to 120 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.060
 kilometers then we'll talk about it again 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.950
 obviously in the next few days 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.450
 the temperatures for this Thursday will remain 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.820
 at the lowest is very clearly in 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.350
 below the normal of season 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.120
 following with the weekend the beginning 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.560
 of your weekend on Friday the time will be 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.910
 quieter with a lot of clouds 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.860
 from the Pyrenees to the people of the East 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.280
 some flakes near the alps and near 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.500
 of Switzerland 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.240
 the return of a disturbance at the end of 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.440
 day by the oceanic arc and then to 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.850
 the before a few clearings anyway 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.590
 between the limousin and the benelux the 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.730
 temperatures rise slightly but 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.210
 they remain below normal 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.920
 of the season 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.390
 Saturday the disturbance is going this time 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.920
 to settle in all regions 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.660
 from the western half with rains a 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.220
 often supported a warmth since the 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.660
 winds have swung to the southwest sector 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.280
 the maritime entries also on the 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.360
 gulf of the lion and then a time that will 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.900
 will cover half of the regions 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.520
 is 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.500
 this disturbance that should sweep 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.700
 all the southern regions and 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.930
 is for Sunday with rains 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.160
 supported a backlit sky at the back 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.690
 on the north west quarter 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.040
 somewhat also near the 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.840
 Mediterranean temperatures that will be 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.610
 up but still a 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.900
 just little bit for the season and 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.310
 then very little evolution for Monday 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.990
 with a treacherous sky no showers 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.280
 cloudiness a little less than when 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.660
 even near the Mediterranean basin 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.670
 and then temperatures that 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.020
 will just stay for the season on 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.220
 will retain some freshness but 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.670
 this time we will not talk about 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.690
 winter value so this is for this 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.340
 newsletter do not hesitate to come back
