go at it very awkwardly I don't know how
this<00:01:26.369> will<00:01:26.580> work<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.090> knowing<00:01:27.930> no<00:01:28.470> intro

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860

Fenner that Polly so get bees and you'll

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.710 
Fenner that Polly so get bees and you'll
create<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.320> little<00:01:31.560> larva<00:01:31.979> thingy<00:01:32.720> usefully

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
create this little larva thingy usefully

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.410 
create this little larva thingy usefully
they<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.110> actually<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.500> led<00:01:34.829> by<00:01:35.040> weak<00:01:35.420> hence

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
they can actually be led by weak hence

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.609 
they can actually be led by weak hence
how<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> got<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:36.960> these<00:01:37.049> guys<00:01:37.259> into<00:01:37.500> their

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
how I got all these guys into their

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.580 
how I got all these guys into their
cages<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.280> early<00:01:38.579> they<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.259> will<00:01:40.380> stay

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
cages so early they can it will stay

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.620 
cages so early they can it will stay
like<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> little<00:01:41.400> bit<00:01:41.670> until

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
like this for a little bit until

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.420 
like this for a little bit until
eventually<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:43.439> grow<00:01:43.560> up<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.189> one<00:01:44.399> of

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
eventually they grow up in to one of

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.789 
eventually they grow up in to one of
these<00:01:44.579> stages<00:01:45.170> but<00:01:46.170> basically<00:01:46.500> there<00:01:46.710> are

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
these stages but basically there are

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.190 
these stages but basically there are
tons<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.549> combinations<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:49.049> get

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
tons of combinations you get you get

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.499 
tons of combinations you get you get
combinations<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.950> color<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.420> get

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
combinations of color you can get

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.380 
combinations of color you can get
combinations<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.259> shape<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.950> behavior<00:01:53.909> of

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.020
