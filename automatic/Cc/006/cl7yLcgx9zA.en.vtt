 Jesus Christ I have no doubt because 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.550
 if someone won the sky with his work 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.259
 to protect and love the humble was 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.589
 commander hugo chávez here on earth 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.300
 enough merits he made for our 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.539
 Lord Jesus Christ have him by your side 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.249
 now and from now he is blessing us 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:35.930
 permanently so here also the 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:41.230
 admirable campaign logo that I 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.230
 launched at this moment from here he 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.239
 just as there is a strategic commander 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.159
 operational role of the national armed force 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.280
 Bolivarian there is a commander 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.170
 strategic communication that is the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.260
 teacher and he arrives for me to launch a 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.660
 offensive look how beautiful is very beautiful 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.260
 because it is a horse flock 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.450
 advancing on offense 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.050
 200 years of the admirable campaign the 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.840
 lightning war 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.220
 ah good then Guillermo Morón 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.900
 we respect him as a student of 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.320
 the story 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.980
 but we do not share his criteria he says 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.810
 that bolivar turned to venezuela into a 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.410
 been plus one province any of 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.720
 Colombia and disfigures the story because 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.090
 it turns out that Colombia was the project of 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.880
 miranda that bolivar diego forward that 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.550
 Colombia was the name given to the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.210
 new South American union 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.430
 in homage to color 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.560
 they good looking at colom us already 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.119
 we know what happened 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.930
 when they can be seen as 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.200
 navigator but the results of his 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.720
 historical process and then the conquest 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.450
 they have taken a revaluation of the paper 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.750
 in the history of colom and the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.750
 conquerors 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.620
 that other topic but in his time they looked at 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.080
 colom 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.030
 and they gave the name of Colombia to 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.840
 miranda and colombia project 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.430
 Suramericana joint project so 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.820
 what is now colombia panama and 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.190
 venezuela were born from a single project of 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.570
 a single root when our 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.910

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.650

 I was in strange country I was not in 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.540
 strange land was in your land 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.490
 because boliva is the founder of all 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.070
 these lands 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.070

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.470
 them a force and a project that we 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.540
 gave in that first stage of the fight to 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.419
 political independence although after 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.449
 was betrayed and lost everything so 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.400
 we had colleagues today 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.840

 admirable with an admirable people with 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.979
 ideas with fighting spirit wanting to 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.560
 grow from doing homeland and good be the 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.790
 work that we have to develop 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.830
 compatriots 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.900
 this afternoon we have several meetings with 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.340
 entrepreneurs one of them who has been 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.700
 cited you from shanghai has been the 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.520
 first meeting with lorenzo mendoza he 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.860
 He came out a bit haughty yesterday to give 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.620
 statements already launching perhaps to 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.600
 candidates I imagine not even though he says 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.000
 that is not political like that always says in 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.320
 they do not I am not a politician I do it 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.410
 politician 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.090
 candidates something seems to have 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.430
 launched candidate for something because it came out 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.020
 with arrogance that the same the right 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.480
 the whole bourgeoisie came to applaud him if 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.480
 The bourgeoisie is right to power 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.550
 well I was quoting it to the miraflores palace 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.850
 this humble working president who is 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.040
 here son of xavi will receive him and will 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.720
 is going to say four truths on his face and 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.710
 is going to put it to work for the 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.330
 interests of the country 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.699
 another low another low 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.939
 or work workers or mendoza and the 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.939
 polar 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.210
 to produce for what 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.050
 what 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.169
 A) Yes 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.600
 note that I polite him as he says what 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.390
 cuts 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.990
 it takes away what brave we are 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:16.300
 people of good dialoguing way so we 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.800
 he educated the commander he knows of a 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.960
 smile to whom we smile 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.720
 we smile who gives us a bad face 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.300
 we also smile 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.570
 who hates us we love it because we are 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.570
 Christians 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.860
 now who hates us and attacks the people 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.110
 has to face the law because I'm 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.689
 according to what the professor said 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:43.190
 Vladimir Acosta fascism is only 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:48.169
 defeat with the law and with 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:50.599
 an implacable and impeccable justice 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:53.050
 so I'm going to receive it I 'm going to 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:56.020
 talk to him with respect always 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.449
 we the workers 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.110
 we are respectful because we do not want 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.110
 More than anyone 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.700
 we come to be humble 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.020
 we are not the working class 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:13.110
 Colleagues 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.840
 It is the only one that can unite society 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.560
 because the only one that gives society 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.560
 his work 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.990
 in exchange for nothing 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.640
 is the only one that can join the 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.900
 bourgeoisie can join us a society 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.760
 because his work does it in exchange for 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:33.280
 pocket the profit that produces 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.810
 workers and workers 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.200
 through the surplus value of you know 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.960
 all that story 

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.540
 it's a long history of imposing the 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.130
 capitalism in the world and it will also be 

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.390
 long struggle to build the society 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.390
 different socialist
