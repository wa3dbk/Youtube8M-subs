00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.890
 good morning guys has finally come out 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.170
 the decree dated February 5th that 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.599
 defines the methods and contents of 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.180
 admission tests for courses ad 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.820
 access planned in this case i 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.100
 medicine courses atiri atri has with it 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.660
 of veterinary architecture and the 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.220
 health care professions 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.560
 let's take a look at his video a moment 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.990
 point on the characteristics of 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.940
 these tests begin by saying that not 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.070
 there are big news 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.870
 so let's start from the confirmations from this 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.809
 which remains unchanged 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.850
 the questions are always 60 and also i 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.629
 minutes available remain one hundred 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.120
 as in 2013 so we also expect 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.190
 this year an average of one minute e 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.579
 means available to those candidates 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.230
 for each test question also the 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.149
 score of the calculation of the score is 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.749
 remained unchanged a point and a half in 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:01.239
 more for each correct answer 0.4 per 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:04.570
 any wrong answer 0 in case of 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.850
 answer or put other things confirmed 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.340
 compared to 2013 certainly the most 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.650
 the unique ranking is important 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.830
 national that will therefore also be provided 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.530
 for the April 2014 tests 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.620
 also confirmed the absence of time 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.830
 discussed maturity bonus that this year 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.960
 therefore it will not be absolutely foreseen is 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.450
 planned again as for some years a 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.700
 this part the minimum threshold of 20 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.470
 points that is not a minimum threshold for a 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.860
 access to university but is the threshold 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.130
 minimum to enter the ranking e 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.710
 so to see if you can 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.130
 access available seats placed at 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.410
 ban 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.930
 here is precisely what is new 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.390
 we talk a lot in these hours of places 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.990
 available cut at least a 20 per 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.240
 one hundred 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.450
 we would like to clarify us about alpha tests 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.729
 that this decrease 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.280
 temporary decrease in fact the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.979
 ministry to issue a new decree in 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.229
 which will define the places in a way for 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.890
 the definitive note and this decree 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.849
 will be expected in days from here until 11 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.160
 March, some private universities such as the 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.290
 catholic of rome and the saint raffaele of 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.260
 Milan have already published a tender with 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.510
 inside the available places and these 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.130
 available seats are different 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.069
 compared to those of the last decree 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.470
 that is, they are greater 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.930
 the hope therefore that the bumps can 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.910
 there is to be revised upwards and therefore 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.360
 keep calm we wait for them 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.299
 forthcoming communications from the miur 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.360
 other innovations are those of the of one 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.239
 some redistribution of the questions 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.220
 we have one less question for all 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.099
 ministerial tests regarding 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.130
 general culture and we have two questions 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.750
 less with regards to logic 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.810
 compensate in favor of those who are 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.579
 the subjects characterizing the tests for 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.000
 referred regarding the test 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.930
 medical health area medicine 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.600
 veterinary and health care profession 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.639
 we will have an increase in one more question 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.230
 as for biology and two 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.329
 more questions regarding 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.030
 chemistry regarding the 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.579
 architecture test one more question 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.440
 for physics and mathematics and two questions in 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.420
 more regarding the part of 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.730
 history 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.400
 let's see for a moment what are the 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.650
 the most important dates there 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.150
 let us distance ourselves so we say that they divide us 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.830
 from the fateful day of the April test 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.900
 then first of all the opening of 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.610
 registrations that is set for 12 of 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.000
 February which will see its closure 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.160
 at 11 March you will have time then up to 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.959
 March 18, then one more week for 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.269
 make all payments for 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.340
 registration to the test of your own 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.310
 then when the results are known 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.220
 starting from 22 of April we will have i 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.200
 first results in dentistry medicine 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.220
 as we will have the first rankings 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.250
 not registered starting from 22 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.410
 from 12 sorry for May we will start 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.829
 then with medicine and dentistry for 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.120
 continue to compete in the air and with 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.920
 architecture for the moment this is 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.120
 all I can do is make you a big one 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.049
