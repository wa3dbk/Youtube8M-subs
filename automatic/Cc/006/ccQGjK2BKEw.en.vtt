00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello how are you welcome to a video 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.899
 more and then in this new video I'm going to 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.450
 present what will be a top of games 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.389
 that more than born in simple games 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.010
 arcade credit games as well as 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.010
 can know are games that exist 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.320
 for android and ios that except one that 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.740
 nothing is stopping me is but the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.900
 they are truly amazing simple and easy 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.550
 to play and well then before starting 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.040
 typical that you give me a like in 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.059
 this video and do not forget to subscribe to 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.730
 this channel 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.040
 now if we continue with this top zig zag 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.469
 It is a game that will put our minds 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.230
 to think too much because you have to 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.170
 calculate pretty well the pulsation that 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.719
 do you or more than anything can distract 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.149
 which has to turn is a little ball 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.629
 what increase has to go so it will be 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.329
 some barriers I could say it like that and I 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.030
 you have to press at what time 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.399
 you have to change your address because 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.989
 If you're not obviously going to fall, it 's a game 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.000
 that really when you're going to start 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.790
 play is usually you 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.670
 but as you can see little by little I'm going 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.160
 dominating and the truth is incredible this 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.540
 game so you can get it invite 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.180
 download is a game that is going to 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.220
 allow to waste a lot of time of great 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.930
 fun you're also going to establish a 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.390
 little but little by little you will understand 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.420
 I invite you to download it circuit 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.630
 it's a similar game as if it were 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.330
 flop everts but then it will be tar 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.580
 about what would be a circle in which 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.490
 we are going to find a line that 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.220
 going to go down a 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.050
 pending in which then we have to 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.290
 press the screen to jump 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.450
 the circle the truth is very difficult and 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.670
 more is difficult when it's just going 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.619
 Starting him play really very 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.990
 complicated but already after you 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.660
 you usually go a little bit more 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.550
 easy as I said it is a matter nothing 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.380
 more than press on what would be 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.950
 the screen so that the circle 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.720
 jump and then the line that goes by 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.869
 out there by the means you have to spend 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.930
 it is not that it hits with any side of the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.329
 circle because that is to say we paste 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.959
 we would already be but not what is the 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:19.670
 split keep the pulse that 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.980
 it must be because if not then you're going to 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.799
 losing is a very simple game like them 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.480
 it said a cake game and we're also leaving 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.299
 to find what would be some 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.909
 So, king, it will be like 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:35.329
 career not in which is usually quite 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:37.310
 difficult could not happen in the first and 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.170
 it really is totally difficult if something 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.290
 you can not go through with people because 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.000
 I can not pass it then it is a 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.709
 pretty amazing game that the truth 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.379
 I highly recommend that they are also games 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.419
 that will stress you but the truth 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.359
 it's really worth it to download it 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:55.639
 psuv cards is a game obviously that 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.430
 tells us that there are going to be two cars in the 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:01.370
 which the truth is usually quite 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.069
 complicated and then so what is going 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.590
 to allow this game is that you will put 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.109
 work your mind more if you play with 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.579
 two people it will be better not but if 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.340
 you played it just the truth you're going to 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.560
 complicated because it takes a lot because 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.599
 the two carts that one right is not 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.620
 land in which we are going to find 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.620
 with roads 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.510
 Well, it's going to be direct but we 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.819
 we are going to find obstacles that are going 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.830
 to be like the square and the circle that 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.200
 I must tell you that the circle we have 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.690
 what could you say that grab what to eat 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.909
 and the square, not because if we touch a 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.819
 cart with a square obviously 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.769
 let's lose if we play what follows 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.260
 to the cart with a circle then there 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.209
 let's continue not and well, you guys 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.640
 you can see that for me it was complicated for me 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.079
 little use both hands and what 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.930
 we have to do is right left 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.390
 change but you also have to grab 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.640
 all the circles because if not what 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.019
 will happen is that it is based on the game 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.569
 because you have not eaten 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.760
 Circulito and it goes away and you're going to lose 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.090
 then you have to reach all the 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.980
 circuits and the truth is a game that 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.959
 it is very divided to play it alone never 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.269
 has played with another person but yes 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.489
 It was very interesting so well 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.310
 if you touch me of the charges too 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.229
 good this great grand water game 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.940
 it is a game that nothing else is for it 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.250
 is that I hope that later it is for 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.169
 android but it's a very amazing game 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.370
 in which we have to go by a line 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.790
 also about one 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.650
 in which you have to direct it from 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.930
 right to left and we're going to 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.850
 find obstacles because they are going to be 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.669
 bars that we are going to find with 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.979
 some circles with bars inside and in 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.990
 the level more or less like 6 you're going to 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.900
 find with some knives something for 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.400
 the style that I have reached until 7 and 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.600
 he hugged reserves where I think this 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.600
 I play what you have to do then 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.830
 Obviously dodge obstacles 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.380
 right left you have to direct it 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.130
 it's a game that the truth looks like this is 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.080
 simple view looks like very, very, very 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.630
 childish or something very simple but the 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.070
 truth is a very difficult game first 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.680
 but you're playing but then you go 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.990
 getting used to it and the truth is necessary 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.850
 when you go on level 4 level 5 you go 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.789
 raising the level feels pretty 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.010
 well, the truth is they really put you 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.229
 nervous when you say wow that comes by 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.210
 here that will happen through here then you 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.550
 I saw from what you download a game too 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.050
 great and we're also going to 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.240
 find when some store in the 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.669
 which we can put a hat change 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.880
 that gives us a little dot that is a heart 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:34.190
 and good is a highly recommended game 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.500
 is a game that would be the second 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.150
 part of 2 that you know that 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.190
 I tried to do what would be 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.550
 connections of a few dots in which 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.890
 that's going to be like series could be like 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.960
 educando and cruise that will be lives 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:51.350
 but then we are going to find a 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.940
 long row of levels in which then it is 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.090
 question that we are past the 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.740
 first second third fourth and fifth 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.710
 I believe that if he has played the first 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.260
 part of two will already know what they are about 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.600
 align dots that is already a small square 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.220
 then automatically the colors of that 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.060
 putting it you wanted the box they go 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.060
 to eliminate all 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.370
 and then at the top we're going to 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.409
 find what they want the game 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:21.069
 so that we can pass the level 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:24.490
 it could be 15 red or 15 yellow 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:26.439
 15 of green among other things more not and 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.330
 well then to see his most incredible game 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:30.969
 that is handled with great fluidity because its 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.370
 very easy game I mean 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:35.349
 graphically but the truth is very 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.189
 well worked I like the design looks 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:41.379
 very, very intuitive and good 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:43.210
 I hope you liked this video 

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:45.490
 I invite you to give me a like and 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.759
 they are games that, as I said, are games 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:51.550
 very easy arcade with very graphic 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:53.289
 simple but very fun not and 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.719
 also a good point is that we do not 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:58.960
 we are going to spend a lot of money on playing them 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:07:01.479
 and well I say goodbye possibly 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.250
 a part 2 on this channel or on the channel 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:04.719
 the blog title I still do not know but I think 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.259
 that is going to be in this we see ourselves until the 

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:09.909
 next take care a lot until next time 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:11.620
 do not forget to support me with a like 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:13.860
 we see until a next video up 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.860
 soon
