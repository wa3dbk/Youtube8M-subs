agree<00:00:24.599> Ally<00:00:24.750> before<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> simple

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
agree Ally before this is a simple

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.790 
agree Ally before this is a simple
system<00:00:27.300> here<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.869> what<00:00:28.050> we're<00:00:28.199> doing<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.679> we

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
system here and what we're doing is we

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.450 
system here and what we're doing is we
have<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.210> surface<00:00:30.210> with<00:00:30.390> an<00:00:30.570> image<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.460> and

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
have the surface with an image on and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.700 
have the surface with an image on and
when<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.730> put<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.000> down<00:00:33.150> and<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.960> look<00:00:34.230> at<00:00:34.470> it

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
when I put it down and I look at it

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.710 
when I put it down and I look at it
through<00:00:36.650> this<00:00:37.650> tablet<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.360> see<00:00:39.540> that

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
through this tablet you can see that

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.830 
through this tablet you can see that
there's<00:00:39.930> these<00:00:40.140> stacks<00:00:40.560> of<00:00:41.330> blocks<00:00:42.330> being

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
there's these stacks of blocks being

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.500 
there's these stacks of blocks being
rendered<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.290> top<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> image<00:00:44.330> now<00:00:45.330> what's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
rendered on top of the image now what's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.460 
rendered on top of the image now what's
going<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.900> here<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.530> as<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.100> move<00:00:47.340> around<00:00:48.470> the

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
going on here is as I move around the

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.580 
going on here is as I move around the
camera<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.580> the<00:00:50.960> tablet<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.050> taking<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.410> video

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
camera on the tablet is taking a video

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
camera on the tablet is taking a video
feed<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:54.780> tablet<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.860> analyzing<00:00:56.490> that

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
feed and the tablet is analyzing that

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.490 
feed and the tablet is analyzing that
video<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:56.970> you<00:00:57.060> looking<00:00:57.330> for<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.540> image<00:00:57.810> so

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
video for you looking for the image so

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.320 
video for you looking for the image so
that<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.830> figure<00:00:59.100> out<00:00:59.310> where<00:01:00.060> it<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.270> in

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
that it can figure out where it is in

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.900 
that it can figure out where it is in
space<00:01:00.480> relative<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> image<00:01:01.800> once<00:01:02.790> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
space relative to the image once it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.220 
space relative to the image once it
knows<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.690> says<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.650> position<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
knows that it says that position to a

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.070 
knows that it says that position to a
remote<00:01:08.040> server<00:01:08.550> which<00:01:09.240> then<00:01:09.270> renders<00:01:09.870> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
remote server which then renders the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
remote server which then renders the
graphics<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.220> gets<00:01:11.430> sent<00:01:11.700> back<00:01:11.730> as<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
graphics and that gets sent back as a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.810 
graphics and that gets sent back as a
video<00:01:12.570> which<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.440> incorporated<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:14.700> top<00:01:15.090> of

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
video which is incorporated on top of

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.600 
video which is incorporated on top of
this<00:01:17.820> image<00:01:18.120> now<00:01:18.650> this<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.800> collaborative

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
this image now this is a collaborative

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.660 
this image now this is a collaborative
environment<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:22.350> nikunj<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.190> seeing<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
environment so nikunj is is seeing the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.220 
environment so nikunj is is seeing the
same<00:01:23.880> thing<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.330> am<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.960> see<00:01:25.110> that

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
same thing that I am you can see that

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.410 
same thing that I am you can see that
he's<00:01:25.350> starting<00:01:26.160> to<00:01:26.220> fire<00:01:26.490> some<00:01:26.820> blocks<00:01:27.150> into

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
he's starting to fire some blocks into

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.480 
he's starting to fire some blocks into
the<00:01:27.570> scene<00:01:27.950> falling<00:01:28.950> over

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the scene falling over

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.930 
the scene falling over
I<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:30.030> also<00:01:30.180> participate<00:01:30.480> you<00:01:31.260> have<00:01:31.350> some

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
I can also participate you have some

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.580 
I can also participate you have some
collaborative<00:01:32.940> destruction<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:35.330> always

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
collaborative destruction here always

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.100 
collaborative destruction here always
knock<00:01:37.590> down<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:37.980> Jenga<00:01:38.280> blocks<00:01:38.720> we<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:39.990> it

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
knock down the Jenga blocks we can do it

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.600 
knock down the Jenga blocks we can do it
first

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.940 

now<00:01:47.240> we're<00:01:47.810> sharing<00:01:48.170> this<00:01:48.290> environment<00:01:48.830> right

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
now we're sharing this environment right

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.399 
now we're sharing this environment right
here<00:01:49.130> but<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.610> Coons<00:01:49.820> could<00:01:50.030> be<00:01:50.180> in<00:01:50.990> his<00:01:51.259> own

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
here but the Coons could be in his own

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.080 
here but the Coons could be in his own
house<00:01:51.680> with<00:01:52.040> his<00:01:52.220> own<00:01:52.600> image<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:54.970> we<00:01:55.970> can

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
house with his own image and we can

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.180 
house with his own image and we can
still<00:01:56.270> be<00:01:56.360> sharing<00:01:56.630> this<00:01:56.720> experience<00:01:56.930> remote

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.399 

so<00:02:01.190> now<00:02:01.220> we're<00:02:01.460> going<00:02:01.580> to<00:02:01.640> switch<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.659> second

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
so now we're going to switch to a second

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.370 
so now we're going to switch to a second
demo<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:03.830> is<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.190> medical<00:02:04.789> imaging<00:02:05.240> demo<00:02:05.990> what

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
demo this is a medical imaging demo what

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.380 
demo this is a medical imaging demo what
you're<00:02:06.500> seeing<00:02:06.680> is<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.070> upper<00:02:07.520> torso<00:02:07.759> of<00:02:08.239> a

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
you're seeing is the upper torso of a

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.309 
you're seeing is the upper torso of a
human<00:02:09.200> being<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.619> skeleton<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:14.319> this

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
human being the skeleton and this this

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.559 
human being the skeleton and this this
is<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.500> very<00:02:15.800> large<00:02:16.160> data<00:02:16.550> set<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:16.970> it's<00:02:17.180> very

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
is a very large data set and it's very

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.690 
is a very large data set and it's very
computationally<00:02:18.050> expensive<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:19.340> render<00:02:19.580> it's

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
about augmented reality is that we bring

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.699 
about augmented reality is that we bring
these<00:02:51.160> these<00:02:52.160> rich<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.840> sorts<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.230> graphical

navigating and exploring the data you

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.590 
navigating and exploring the data you
can<00:03:06.590> imagine<00:03:07.100> a<00:03:07.220> doctor<00:03:07.670> sitting<00:03:08.269> down<00:03:08.420> with

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
can imagine a doctor sitting down with

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.349 
can imagine a doctor sitting down with
his<00:03:08.720> patients<00:03:09.290> handing<00:03:10.220> them<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.670> tablet<00:03:11.239> and

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
his patients handing them a tablet and

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.120 
his patients handing them a tablet and
they<00:03:11.450> can<00:03:11.570> immediately<00:03:11.810> pick<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.350> up<00:03:12.470> and

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
they can immediately pick it up and

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.830 
they can immediately pick it up and
start<00:03:13.310> looking<00:03:13.549> at<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.910> data<00:03:14.120> without<00:03:14.660> having

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
start looking at the data without having

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.380 
start looking at the data without having
to<00:03:15.109> learn<00:03:15.380> on<00:03:15.560> some<00:03:15.769> complex<00:03:16.549> keystrokes<00:03:17.150> or

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
to learn on some complex keystrokes or

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.610 
to learn on some complex keystrokes or
master<00:03:17.750> history<00:03:17.870> or<00:03:18.230> whatever<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:21.320> he

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
master history or whatever and and he

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.720 
master history or whatever and and he
doesn't<00:03:21.799> even<00:03:21.950> have<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.280> be<00:03:22.400> in<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.549> same

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
doesn't even have to be in the same

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.410 
doesn't even have to be in the same
location<00:03:22.820> he<00:03:23.359> could<00:03:23.510> be<00:03:23.600> be<00:03:24.260> removed<00:03:25.359> okay<00:03:26.359> so

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
location he could be be removed okay so

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.310 
location he could be be removed okay so
for<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.750> final<00:03:27.140> demo<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:28.420> have<00:03:29.420> done<00:03:29.900> step<00:03:30.170> in

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
for the final demo I have done step in

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.789 
for the final demo I have done step in
from<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:31.070> Kinect<00:03:31.760> camera<00:03:32.299> maybe<00:03:32.900> he's<00:03:33.200> in<00:03:33.410> some

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
from a Kinect camera maybe he's in some

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.819 
from a Kinect camera maybe he's in some
other<00:03:33.980> city<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.989> we<00:03:35.989> have<00:03:36.140> a<00:03:36.170> different<00:03:36.620> kind

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
other city and we have a different kind

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.080 
other city and we have a different kind
of<00:03:37.100> video<00:03:37.280> chat<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:38.150> can<00:03:38.540> move<00:03:38.720> around<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:39.320> can

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
of video chat I can move around I can

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.160 
of video chat I can move around I can
see<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.269> we've<00:03:41.420> got<00:03:41.510> a<00:03:41.569> fairly<00:03:41.959> detailed

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
see that we've got a fairly detailed

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.080 
see that we've got a fairly detailed
model<00:03:42.739> of<00:03:42.940> abduch<00:03:43.940> and

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.899 

this<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:47.870> all<00:03:47.989> being<00:03:48.140> done<00:03:48.230> with<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:48.739> know

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
this is all being done with the you know

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.729 
this is all being done with the you know
$150<00:03:49.909> Kinect<00:03:50.299> camera<00:03:53.019> so<00:03:54.019> because<00:03:54.590> the

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
$150 Kinect camera so because the

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.530 
$150 Kinect camera so because the
viewpoint<00:03:55.129> isn't<00:03:55.430> fixed<00:03:55.909> I<00:03:56.060> can<00:03:56.090> move<00:03:56.360> around

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
viewpoint isn't fixed I can move around

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.690 
viewpoint isn't fixed I can move around
and<00:03:57.049> makes<00:03:57.680> for<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:57.920> much<00:03:58.220> more<00:03:58.430> immersive

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
and makes for a much more immersive

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.449 
and makes for a much more immersive
experience<00:03:59.379> this<00:04:00.379> would<00:04:00.530> be<00:04:00.620> useful<00:04:01.040> for

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
experience this would be useful for

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.339 
experience this would be useful for
something<00:04:01.670> like<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.780> know<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:02.930> may<00:04:03.110> have<00:04:03.140> done

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
something like you know I may have done

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:04.720 
something like you know I may have done
where<00:04:03.560> we're<00:04:03.799> trying<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.220> show<00:04:04.370> me<00:04:04.549> how<00:04:04.700> to

where we're trying to show me how to

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.490 
where we're trying to show me how to
work<00:04:05.000> on<00:04:05.209> a<00:04:05.239> car<00:04:05.569> engine<00:04:05.599> or<00:04:06.110> you<00:04:06.140> know<00:04:06.290> some

work on a car engine or you know some

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.339 
work on a car engine or you know some
complex<00:04:06.950> 3d<00:04:07.790> thing<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:08.150> can<00:04:08.360> I<00:04:08.599> can<00:04:09.049> move<00:04:09.200> around

complex 3d thing I can I can move around

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.509 
complex 3d thing I can I can move around
and<00:04:09.739> see<00:04:10.659> see<00:04:11.659> what<00:04:11.780> he's<00:04:11.870> doing<00:04:12.519> from

and see see what he's doing from

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.759 
and see see what he's doing from
different<00:04:13.819> point<00:04:13.970> of<00:04:14.090> view<00:04:14.349> we<00:04:15.349> like<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.590> think
