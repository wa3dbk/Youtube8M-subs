00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
 gloriously, for example, at the BAG, please, tell me Tall too much 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.080
 Spoiler on it can show show and in aisles graphic but not so much 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.809
 Driving from Estoril Felix arrive a little bit China is getting old 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.550
 evil game earlier later anyway already in the end Woltmann never the whole time 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.079
 they'll get me around it, too, a little something from the professionals 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.869
 show it is just different I'm now equal to gta4 the 3 60 Wilson us 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.210
 So have not got the ps3 Wii that will do those four mornings again 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.800
 we hope that we can then show the ps3 version but it is the meaning 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.120
 the already several tests came out saying like almost all that the ps3 version 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.129
 Looking a bit better, the colleagues from Aldi Land should do exactly that 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.180
 compared to both compared in a video and have said there 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.000
 The difference of the Isa minimal that you do not really notice is a man 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.330
 get the version 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.720
 that's sure to get the most friends from you too 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.940
 then you can rock in multiplayer with the bands so head 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.550
 But for her to have breakfast now, start a new game and 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.820
 that means of course he's trouble trap by GTA there's a little intro first 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.910
 to introduce the characters and that is a meaning of gta4 of course Niko 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.150
 cheap this is the antihero or keeps the one in GTA 4 controls so to speak 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.120
 Percent of refugees from Eastern Europe, so to speak, we arrive with the boss 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.380
 and right at the beginning you already notice the box because it's easy on what 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.650
 filmic stagings on the alone start this 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.290
 for like fifths of the altars or the defense its henchmen of all 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.180
 People who have worked 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.080
 s made totally cinematic and you just notice that they have that 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.420
 others just smell far ahead of what this production is about and the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.510
 Atmosphere unsuccessful to Andreas Oldag ORF at 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.230
 with that with this input sequence with the cops to two hours Nat 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.010
 but you can already 4 liters on the door 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.700
 clearly on top 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.320
 Finally, personally, I am very happy and so Bayer is first 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.340
 Harare 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.720
 Mourinho have 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.510
 a minor role 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.510
 by Henrik Bork 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.989
 gorgeous also sometimes with the reading of the indictment put the game 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.989
 but really nice that has a bit scary after that right 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.209
 one reason this collection reigns 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.609
 Despite Gunter Wiedemann's a past winter, Burfoot says that's it 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.409
 a not so good work but as long as I just want you a bit 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.999
 in a few months a huge responsibility 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:39.379
 costs 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.829
 Whatsoever Waidmarkt express new MGP LLC there will come true 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.869
 that was the speech 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.999
 de Maizière kept alive 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.189
 Enlarge picture dpa 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.199
 the élysée 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:58.019
 because who over a Derbysieg in most countries the pressure grows well 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.019
 it was a good lap 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.919
 the foreign minister before conspicuous enjoyment and are leaping with the 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.959
 submitted applications 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.179
 and I can only say that was the first time we travel in Liberty City 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:25.059
 are part of this city Stuttgart part 4 if you are traveling 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.239
 she really 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.079
 So I really have to say terrific 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.879
 I know some people are pushing for the same idea before in Venice 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.529
 publish blurry 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:34.610
 but it is missing 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.959
 Picture of the city 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.759
 It really succeeded incredibly well who loses his voice 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:41.899
 lower Main 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:45.309
 finally lighting effects are fantastic if you for example 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:48.139
 Sunset in the country you will then, for example, the whole 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.780
 Skyscrapers of those of Manhattan, so to speak the Liberty City is in the 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:54.449
 Eventually a bit of York changed 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.449
 unbelievably impressive 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.249
 and the physics except for the very well done too - the animation as well 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:04.849
 Everything can look very realistic here 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.989
 we have just "aryanized" with the good Niko Bellic from the ship 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.699
 so to speak our said and of course served that is achieved and everything 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.959
 and of course we think that will lead to a life in the lap of luxury 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.049
 but that's not always the case 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.809
 of the Mannheim Neckarstadt Hormus are always hard-won at GTA 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.699
 Zoot Suit Zero 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.699
 tram 1 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.460
 You should 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.830
 there is a high content of Leitha broken 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.830
 European Cup so far so I have not found out exactly what 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.510
 his mother is not a country exclusively own opinion in it 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:01.539
 He warned that more oil is flowing out 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.539
 I have over 100 at the county level for organism 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.150
 he returned yesterday 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.400
 I wanted more safely 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.270
 Rank the song you already have is Helga Uhl Friedrich Hecker 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.550
 you are relaxed and France part 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.439
 but he too powerless 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.749
 Chancellor Merkel 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:53.469
 WWS has so far no criticism who would like to plug in what 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.199
 As far as political correctness is concerned 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.770
 from the weak side finally has an end 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.879
 as well Christian Donath who does not care what all the critics 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.330
 they say 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.990
 and that's good work first go 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.319
 Union and FDP meadows 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:12.319
 and La grande-moth victory points 

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:39.379
 reacting fast is already cool but it has me totally 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.189
 the shock absorber from out of Sindelfingen 

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:48.509
 the annual performance that has always been so they experience it especially at one 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:49.990
 GTA 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.389
 already partially on 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.850
 there are many columns, but there are still in the game itself is not 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:55.399
 luck 

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:57.069
 if you leave, for example 

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:00.809
 certain things go around that just looks great from the other part of the 

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:04.340
 City on 11 11 after the recent time have to love their mailbox 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:06.699
 you know that, for example 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:09.960
 that's just nicely done so that's there you can not complain 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.130
 that's relatively quiet for me, a modern one is a bit over the top 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.559
 but they also know how to come out later 

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:18.649
 the infestation Theron said but the men tell us how long have to be 

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:23.059
 we are now is the time that made an avenge here very briefly below 

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:27.050
 that is, so to speak brooklyn could say that in the middle over the man 

00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:28.219
 would represent 

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:31.819
 And this is where our adventure begins, where we will be with the good Niko Bellic 

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:34.579
 first orders equal which always a bit expensive 

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.779
 important times man's no weapons but still that's all very much 

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:40.409
 very well staged minivan between we also add the same here 

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:41.180
 continue to gamble 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.480
 the files are short 

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.350
 very short break not only then are we the reptiles back in place 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.570
 are you
