for<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.210> past<00:00:48.420> decade<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.020> when<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.039> returned

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
for the past decade and when I returned

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.610 
for the past decade and when I returned
to<00:00:50.640> run<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> family<00:00:51.180> business<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
beginning of the last housing boom I

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.560 
beginning of the last housing boom I
just<00:00:55.730> inherently<00:00:56.730> knew<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.239> had<00:00:57.539> to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
just inherently knew that I had to

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.950 
just inherently knew that I had to
document<00:00:58.430> this<00:00:59.430> process<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.149> even<00:01:00.420> just

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
document this process or even just

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.139 
document this process or even just
rationalize<00:01:01.649> what<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:01.980> happening<00:01:02.399> now<00:01:03.090> at

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
rationalize what was happening now at

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.579 
rationalize what was happening now at
first<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.510> did<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:03.840> projects<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.290> this

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
first I did it with projects like this

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950 
first I did it with projects like this
or<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.189> take<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> 20<00:01:05.760> acre<00:01:05.880> barley<00:01:06.299> field<00:01:06.510> grow<00:01:06.810> it

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
or I take a 20 acre barley field grow it

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.230 
or I take a 20 acre barley field grow it
and<00:01:07.140> I'd<00:01:07.530> hold<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.950> massive<00:01:08.520> floor<00:01:08.790> plan<00:01:09.030> out

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and I'd hold this massive floor plan out

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.560 
and I'd hold this massive floor plan out
of<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:10.970> yeah<00:01:12.979> partly<00:01:13.979> cuz<00:01:14.220> I'm<00:01:14.369> nuts<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:15.030> also

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
of it yeah partly cuz I'm nuts but also

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.600 
of it yeah partly cuz I'm nuts but also
to<00:01:15.659> reflect<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.979> past<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.430> future

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
to reflect on the past and future

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.149 
to reflect on the past and future
another<00:01:18.570> type<00:01:18.840> project<00:01:19.229> was<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.860> my

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
another type project was like this my

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.490 
another type project was like this my
grandfather<00:01:20.670> sold<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.600> first<00:01:21.810> portion<00:01:22.140> of

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
grandfather sold the first portion of

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.010 
grandfather sold the first portion of
our<00:01:22.710> property<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> development<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.990> I

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
our property to a development and so I

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.570 
our property to a development and so I
went<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> city<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.860> got<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.130> plot<00:01:26.340> map

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
went to the city and got the plot map

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.600 
went to the city and got the plot map
and<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.150> GPS<00:01:27.689> tit<00:01:27.900> out<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> third<00:01:29.280> scale

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and then I GPS tit out on a third scale

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.969 
and then I GPS tit out on a third scale
adjacent<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> development<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.740> grew

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
adjacent to the development and I grew

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.980 
adjacent to the development and I grew
all<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.280> houses<00:01:32.759> low<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.270> soared<00:01:33.659> them<00:01:33.780> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
all the houses low and soared them and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:46.290 
all the houses low and soared them and
planted<00:01:34.770> all<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.040> roads<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.369> wheat<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:38.060> so

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.300 

but<00:01:47.300> really<00:01:47.600> my<00:01:48.290> heart<00:01:48.500> is<00:01:48.620> so<00:01:48.800> good<00:01:49.010> at<00:01:49.130> is

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
but really my heart is so good at is

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.660 
but really my heart is so good at is
asking<00:01:50.180> questions<00:01:50.330> a<00:01:50.930> question<00:01:51.650> that<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.370> had

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
asking questions a question that I had

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.020 
asking questions a question that I had
was<00:01:52.880> why<00:01:53.420> does<00:01:53.600> this<00:01:53.720> make<00:01:53.960> sense<00:01:54.550> why<00:01:55.550> is<00:01:55.610> this

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
was why does this make sense why is this

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.480 
was why does this make sense why is this
the<00:01:56.360> best<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:57.110> highest<00:01:57.500> use<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.770> this<00:01:58.160> ground

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
the best the highest use of this ground

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.450 
the best the highest use of this ground
and<00:01:59.440> instead<00:02:00.440> of<00:02:00.500> pointing<00:02:00.770> fingers<00:02:00.950> I

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
and instead of pointing fingers I

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.340 
and instead of pointing fingers I
started<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:02.360> think<00:02:02.540> about<00:02:02.630> pointing<00:02:03.080> thumbs

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
started to think about pointing thumbs

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.350 
started to think about pointing thumbs
so<00:02:03.860> let<00:02:04.040> me<00:02:04.100> tell<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.400> a<00:02:04.430> little<00:02:04.580> bit<00:02:04.730> about<00:02:05.180> my

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
so let me tell you a little bit about my

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.630 
so let me tell you a little bit about my
family's<00:02:05.810> farm

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
family's farm

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.850 
family's farm
now<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.670> grow<00:02:08.030> 200<00:02:08.840> acres<00:02:09.110> of<00:02:09.140> carrots<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.619> year

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
now I grow 200 acres of carrots a year

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.800 
now I grow 200 acres of carrots a year
on<00:02:10.040> average

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
on average

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.390 
on average
which<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:11.990> about<00:02:12.230> 60<00:02:12.680> tons<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.010> day<00:02:13.160> that<00:02:13.310> we

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
which is about 60 tons a day that we

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.690 
which is about 60 tons a day that we
harvest<00:02:13.790> for<00:02:14.030> like<00:02:14.630> half<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.020> year<00:02:15.200> I

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
harvest for like half the year I

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.980 
harvest for like half the year I
actually<00:02:16.700> figured<00:02:17.030> out<00:02:17.209> that<00:02:17.420> if<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.720> pulled

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
actually figured out that if I pulled

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.570 
actually figured out that if I pulled
out<00:02:18.080> all<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.560> carrots<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.070> I've<00:02:19.220> grown<00:02:19.400> over

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
out all the carrots that I've grown over

out all the carrots that I've grown over
the<00:02:19.730> last<00:02:19.790> 15<00:02:20.240> years<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.780> connected<00:02:21.740> them<00:02:21.830> end

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
the last 15 years and connected them end

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.790 
the last 15 years and connected them end
to<00:02:22.190> end<00:02:22.250> we've<00:02:23.560> circumnavigated<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.650> world

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
to end we've circumnavigated the world

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.250 
to end we've circumnavigated the world
eight<00:02:25.190> times

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
eight times

here's<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.380> kicker<00:02:27.560> I've<00:02:27.709> never<00:02:28.010> seen<00:02:28.310> one<00:02:29.000> of

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
here's the kicker I've never seen one of

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.470 
here's the kicker I've never seen one of
my<00:02:29.150> carrots<00:02:29.480> in<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.630> supermarket<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:32.120> why<00:02:32.420> is

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
my carrots in a supermarket and why is

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.260 
my carrots in a supermarket and why is
that<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.370> started<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.760> think<00:02:35.000> about<00:02:35.090> that

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
that and I started to think about that

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.750 
that and I started to think about that
more<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:35.990> realized<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.530> maybe<00:02:37.370> where

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
more and I realized that maybe where

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.780 
more and I realized that maybe where
that<00:02:38.330> decision<00:02:38.720> starts<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.650> take<00:02:39.800> place<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:40.310> in

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
that decision starts to take place is in

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.449 
that decision starts to take place is in
an<00:02:40.940> in<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.330> marketplace<00:02:41.810> or<00:02:42.080> as<00:02:42.680> my<00:02:42.860> friend

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
an in the marketplace or as my friend

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.570 
an in the marketplace or as my friend
calls<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.350> it's<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.590> theater<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.310> land

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
calls it the it's the theater of land

calls it the it's the theater of land
use<00:02:47.620> so<00:02:48.620> what<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:48.769> did<00:02:48.890> is<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.280> started<00:02:49.580> filming

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
use so what I did is I started filming

use so what I did is I started filming
everything<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:50.450> grow<00:02:50.690> from<00:02:50.959> seed<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.290> harvest

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
everything I grow from seed to harvest

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.270 
everything I grow from seed to harvest
it's<00:02:52.070> a<00:02:52.130> simple<00:02:52.459> idea<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:53.800> if<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:54.980> went<00:02:55.130> into

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
it's a simple idea that if you went into

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.100 
it's a simple idea that if you went into
supermarket<00:02:56.090> bought<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.300> head<00:02:56.510> of<00:02:56.630> lettuce<00:02:56.660> and

you<00:02:57.320> were<00:02:57.410> able<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.680> see<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.330> lifecycle<00:02:59.330> that

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
you were able to see that lifecycle that

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.630 
you were able to see that lifecycle that
plant<00:02:59.840> in<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.620> few<00:03:00.830> seconds<00:03:01.220> or<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.400> few<00:03:01.459> minutes

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
plant in a few seconds or a few minutes

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.340 
plant in a few seconds or a few minutes
that<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.630> might<00:03:02.780> change<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.080> way<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.320> think

about that food and you see 160 days to
grow<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.150> carrot<00:03:08.680> how<00:03:09.680> might<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.040> change<00:03:10.100> the

initiative called the living library

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.600 
initiative called the living library
this<00:04:38.470> is<00:04:38.530> where<00:04:38.800> we're<00:04:38.950> sending<00:04:39.130> out<00:04:39.370> these

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
this is where we're sending out these

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.250 
this is where we're sending out these
camera<00:04:39.970> units<00:04:40.240> to<00:04:40.330> farmers<00:04:40.690> around<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:41.020> world

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
camera units to farmers around the world

to document their crops but also tell us
how<00:04:45.490> they<00:04:45.729> grow<00:04:45.940> it<00:04:46.120> because<00:04:46.780> as<00:04:46.930> we<00:04:47.140> all<00:04:47.169> know

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
how they grow it because as we all know

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.380 
how they grow it because as we all know
the<00:04:47.830> generational<00:04:48.460> growing<00:04:48.850> knowledge<00:04:49.240> of

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
the generational growing knowledge of

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.870 
the generational growing knowledge of
farmers<00:04:49.810> is<00:04:50.020> continually<00:04:50.800> being<00:04:51.370> lost<00:04:51.640> every

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
farmers is continually being lost every

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.880 
farmers is continually being lost every
year<00:04:52.060> so<00:04:52.810> we<00:04:52.990> try<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:53.229> hold<00:04:53.470> on<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.740> that

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
year so we try and hold on to that

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.650 
year so we try and hold on to that
knowledge<00:04:54.100> and<00:04:54.490> that<00:04:54.550> data<00:04:54.940> about<00:04:55.180> growing

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
knowledge and that data about growing

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.810 
knowledge and that data about growing
those<00:04:55.810> crops<00:04:55.840> and<00:04:56.470> then<00:04:57.100> what<00:04:57.190> we<00:04:57.310> do<00:04:57.520> is<00:04:57.669> we

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
those crops and then what we do is we

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.550 
those crops and then what we do is we
work<00:04:58.150> with<00:04:58.180> a<00:04:58.360> program<00:04:58.540> called<00:04:58.930> life<00:04:59.110> cycles

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
work with a program called life cycles

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.080 
work with a program called life cycles
that's<00:04:59.919> where<00:05:00.160> we<00:05:00.280> take<00:05:00.490> all<00:05:00.760> of<00:05:00.940> that

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.730 
that's where we take all of that
research<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:01.690> all<00:05:01.840> that<00:05:02.020> information<00:05:02.169> and
