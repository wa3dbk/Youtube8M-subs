one third like one fourth of the time
that<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:34.950> would<00:00:35.160> take<00:00:35.340> me<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.610> render<00:00:35.880> aid<00:00:35.969> on

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
that it would take me to render aid on

that it would take me to render aid on
my<00:00:36.180> old<00:00:36.360> computer<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:37.620> good<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.790> pro

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
it's a duel it's a dual processor it's

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.010 
it's a duel it's a dual processor it's
not<00:00:41.070> really<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.309> best<00:00:41.430> out<00:00:42.090> there<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
not really the best out there but it is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.529 
not really the best out there but it is
really<00:00:43.290> fast<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:44.430> has<00:00:44.579> eight<00:00:44.850> eight<00:00:45.149> gigs<00:00:45.420> of

really fast it has eight eight gigs of

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.920 
really fast it has eight eight gigs of
ram<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.520> it<00:00:47.520> holds<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.000> lot<00:00:48.030> more<00:00:48.539> memory<00:00:48.870> than

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
ram and it holds a lot more memory than

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.500 
ram and it holds a lot more memory than
my<00:00:49.140> old<00:00:49.469> computer<00:00:49.879> the<00:00:50.879> think<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> old

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
computer had like four gigs of ram so I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.229 
computer had like four gigs of ram so I
mean<00:00:55.050> I'm<00:00:55.170> really<00:00:55.920> really<00:00:56.129> grateful<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.760> have

reason why I haven't been making a lot
of<00:01:12.780> videos<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.229> my<00:01:13.320> old<00:01:13.470> computer<00:01:13.650> was<00:01:14.490> because

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
of videos on my old computer was because

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.999 
of videos on my old computer was because
it<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.479> takes<00:01:15.750> way<00:01:16.020> too<00:01:16.049> long<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.470> render<00:01:16.890> out

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it just takes way too long to render out

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.429 
it just takes way too long to render out
videos<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.600> know<00:01:18.689> sometimes<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.290> to

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.530 
videos so you know sometimes I have to
do<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.710> overnight<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.430> takes<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:20.820> six<00:01:21.060> 12

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
do it overnight it takes like six 12

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.690 
do it overnight it takes like six 12
hours<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> bummer<00:01:23.220> because<00:01:23.490> I

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
hours it really is a bummer because I

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.390 
hours it really is a bummer because I
love<00:01:24.330> making<00:01:24.479> videos<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.860> whenever<00:01:26.250> I

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
top-of-the-line the best but the sony

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.479 
top-of-the-line the best but the sony
computer<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:52.870> we<00:02:52.959> found<00:02:53.290> with<00:02:54.099> basically

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
computer that we found with basically

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.210 
computer that we found with basically
the<00:02:54.670> same<00:02:54.819> specs<00:02:55.209> hat<00:02:55.450> was<00:02:55.810> like<00:02:56.040> two<00:02:57.040> hundred

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
the same specs hat was like two hundred

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.300 
the same specs hat was like two hundred
dollars<00:02:57.670> more<00:02:58.450> expensive<00:02:58.959> so<00:02:59.500> we<00:02:59.530> just<00:02:59.859> went

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
dollars more expensive so we just went

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.369 
dollars more expensive so we just went
with<00:03:00.430> this<00:03:00.579> one<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:01.390> know<00:03:01.510> really<00:03:01.540> talked
