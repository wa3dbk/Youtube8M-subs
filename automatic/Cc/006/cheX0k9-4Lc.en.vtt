00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.080
 hello youtubers good afternoon here your 62 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:24.660
 commenting here we have the new neo geo 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:28.019
 x gold has left today 28 after 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.870
 several delays and good comes with the 20 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.740
 games that promised us integrated 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:38.030
 plus the game for making the reservation that is 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.030
 the ninja masters 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.550
 at first glance the machine looks like 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.270
 have as something of lack of quality or 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.579
 well for the theme of the menu that 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.940
 you are seeing the graphics do not seem 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.460
 be very very there but of course we have to 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.910
 keep in mind that it is a console 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.050
 early 90s with which although 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.730
 can fool us 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.830
 the hdmi connection 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.200
 it is also true that the graphics are 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.500
 those who were and can not scratch a lot 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.500
 plus 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.120
 once you get used to this 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:22.120
 Well, the truth is that the console is 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.740
 pretty good although at certain times 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:30.170
 it can backfire a bit 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:33.830
 it slows down you see the scroll as it suffers 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.350
 a little bit and good is surely the 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.360
 why many people have said 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.789
 that this is just a very emulator 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.909
 expensive and with a material is therefore worth a 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:50.240
 little bit of quality, well, well, I would not say 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:55.369
 the same although the one that expects to have a 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.860
 neo geo to that in your house for 210 or 199 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.960
 euros the truth is that it is a bit 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.530
 maybe wrong 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.090
 saying this we are going to approve for example 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.580
 so that the video is not too long 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.840
 ok as you can see is the metal slack 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.950
 the maxi salord 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.310

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.209
 fatal fury here you see we have the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.739
 card neo geo gay card la bandita 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.650
 Masters that came for the edition 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.380
 limited the truth is that they say that already 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.510
 have managed to hack the console and the 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.170
 expectation that many people have is that 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.870
 through this card you can erase 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.060
 in quotes the rom that leads and 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.489
 put any game that in principle 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.580
 I was not thinking about getting into this 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.810
 in this machine we also have the work 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.370
 perfect turns 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.209

 cyberlink fatal fury special when fighting 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:13.340
 super celtics and the bowling lic 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.870
 Well, let's do a couple of 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.790
 more minutes so you can see how it 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.150
 execute the theme of 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.020
 the rice the load is very fast as 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.820
 you see 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.820
 just the bar and has already shit 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.210
 Really 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.790
 it's fast 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.400
 it's also fast to the original neo-geo 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.690
 that to say this also not listening to it is 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.560
 a rice as we say 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.099
 go flow 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.180
 and also talk about the arcade stick in 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.280
 this video you are not seeing 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.280
 I will surely upload the video 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.240
 like the rest 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.960
 it feels 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.490
 but I do not know if when the light enough 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.490
 heavy time but not 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.700
 275 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.720
 precisely 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.250
 to the maximum the quality of what was the 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.640
 arcade stick that as you also know 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.340
 excellent apart me in the average markt of 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.800
 barcelona 2 and not even the machine 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.300
 I was exposed and the boy just 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.010
 has commented that it is nothing more in the 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:53.470
 units counted and reserved and neither 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.310
 they had no arcade plugin 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.310
 stick or anything like that 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:13.380

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:24.100
 see the typical distribution of 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:29.430
 buttons we have four credits 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.430

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 now 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.620
 it is your own 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:07.300
 in the past 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:12.450
 well to begin with the woman so 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.450
 which for many people with 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.860
 goodbye 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.860
 It would be a lot 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.590
 low 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.120

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.270
 but 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.770
