there<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.110> only<00:01:10.320> want<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.710> train<00:01:10.920> when<00:01:11.220> you're

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
there you only want to train when you're

there you only want to train when you're
hunting<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.030> chasing<00:01:12.170> performance<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
hunting and chasing performance you

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.830 
hunting and chasing performance you
don't<00:01:13.500> want<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.860> train<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.520> fatigue<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.390> think

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
don't want to train to fatigue I think

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.719 
don't want to train to fatigue I think
the<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.110> general<00:01:16.350> less<00:01:16.860> time<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.490> higher

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the in general less time but a higher

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.270 
the in general less time but a higher
quality<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.990> time<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.380> always<00:01:19.920> superior

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
quality in that time is always superior

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.469 
quality in that time is always superior
if<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.820> want<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.150> give<00:01:21.270> some<00:01:21.450> general

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
if I want to give some general

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.660 
if I want to give some general
guidelines<00:01:21.990> perhaps<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.650> know<00:01:22.740> 45<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.640> 90

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
guidelines perhaps you know 45 to 90

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.640 
guidelines perhaps you know 45 to 90
minutes<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.810> gym<00:01:25.020> weight<00:01:25.350> training

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
minutes and the gym weight training

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
minutes and the gym weight training
would<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.130> ideal<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.820> lack<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.450> concentration

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
would be ideal a lack of concentration

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.690 
would be ideal a lack of concentration
in<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> gym<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.100> problems<00:01:29.490> focusing

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
in the gym so you have problems focusing

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.219 
in the gym so you have problems focusing
and<00:01:30.060> trying<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.270> squeeze<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.750> muscle<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:31.170> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
and trying to squeeze that muscle as a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.080 
and trying to squeeze that muscle as a
great<00:01:31.650> sign<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.340> nervous<00:01:32.549> system<00:01:32.790> is

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
great sign that your nervous system is

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.240

four to five times now let's not get it
twisted<00:02:59.550> there<00:03:00.090> are<00:03:00.270> certain<00:03:00.600> ways<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:01.050> you

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
twisted there are certain ways that you

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.750 
twisted there are certain ways that you
could<00:03:01.290> train<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.680> failure<00:03:02.040> be<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.459> strength

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
could train to failure be it strength

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.430 
could train to failure be it strength
your<00:03:02.940> maximal<00:03:03.420> effort<00:03:03.540> or<00:03:03.840> actually<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.320> know

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
your maximal effort or actually you know

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.320 
your maximal effort or actually you know
muscular<00:03:04.800> failure<00:03:05.220> till<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.700> can't<00:03:05.910> do<00:03:06.060> one

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
muscular failure till you can't do one

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.060 
muscular failure till you can't do one
more<00:03:06.540> rep<00:03:06.780> what<00:03:07.140> I'm<00:03:07.260> saying<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.590> doing<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:07.920> on

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
more rep what I'm saying is doing it on

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.220 
more rep what I'm saying is doing it on
a<00:03:08.130> regular<00:03:08.430> basis<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.150> terrible<00:03:09.660> idea

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
a regular basis is a terrible idea

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.870 
a regular basis is a terrible idea
you<00:03:10.320> know<00:03:10.410> Arnold<00:03:10.740> talked<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.160> lot<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.459> shit<00:03:11.730> and

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
you know Arnold talked a lot of shit and

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.100 
you know Arnold talked a lot of shit and
one<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.270> things<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.750> think<00:03:12.840> is

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
one of the things that I think is

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.780 
one of the things that I think is
absolute<00:03:13.530> buggy's<00:03:13.860> as<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.310> training<00:03:14.670> to

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
absolute buggy's as that training to

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.699 
absolute buggy's as that training to
failure<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.330> necessary<00:03:15.990> instead<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.530> training

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
failure is necessary instead of training

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.949 
failure is necessary instead of training
to<00:03:16.920> absolute<00:03:17.580> failure<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.300> should<00:03:18.480> train<00:03:18.690> to

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
to absolute failure you should train to

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.900 
to absolute failure you should train to
performance<00:03:19.530> failure<00:03:19.860> until<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.640> know<00:03:20.730> your

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
performance failure until you know your

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.850 
performance failure until you know your
reps<00:03:21.180> started<00:03:21.660> looking<00:03:21.870> slower<00:03:22.200> your<00:03:22.590> form

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
reps started looking slower your form

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.770 
reps started looking slower your form
starts<00:03:23.130> breaking<00:03:23.400> down<00:03:23.550> that's<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.450> cutoff

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
starts breaking down that's the cutoff

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.130 
starts breaking down that's the cutoff
point<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.590> smart<00:03:26.010> rules<00:03:26.280> while<00:03:26.670> training<00:03:27.209> just

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
point to smart rules while training just

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.920 
point to smart rules while training just
do<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.640> those<00:03:29.790> are<00:03:30.000> really<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.390> only<00:03:30.660> two

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
do it and those are really the only two

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.840 
do it and those are really the only two
points<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.350> wanted<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.830> say<00:03:32.070> guys<00:03:32.340> thanks<00:03:32.820> for
