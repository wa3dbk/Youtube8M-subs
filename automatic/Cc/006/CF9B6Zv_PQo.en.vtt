00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749 
1992 on HBO the fact that they're

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:35.870 
1992 on HBO the fact that they're
putting<00:01:34.289> something<00:01:34.679> fictitious<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.670> trying

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
putting something fictitious and trying

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.480 
putting something fictitious and trying
to<00:01:35.999> blend<00:01:36.179> it<00:01:36.359> with<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.780> true<00:01:37.109> story<00:01:37.490> normally

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
to blend it with a true story normally

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.559 
to blend it with a true story normally
you'd<00:01:38.609> think<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.880> would<00:01:38.999> be<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> great<00:01:39.359> time

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
you'd think that would be a great time

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.450 
you'd think that would be a great time
but<00:01:39.929> they<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:40.170> didn't<00:01:40.560> blend<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.979> two<00:01:41.009> well

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
but they just didn't blend the two well

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.419 
but they just didn't blend the two well
I<00:01:41.789> agree<00:01:42.479> there<00:01:42.719> could<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:42.929> been<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.350> much<00:01:43.429> in

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
I agree there could have been so much in

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.249 
I agree there could have been so much in
this<00:01:44.609> film<00:01:44.939> especially<00:01:45.719> because<00:01:45.960> richard

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
this film especially because richard

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.349 
this film especially because richard
kuklinski<00:01:46.439> he's<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.369> mob<00:01:47.609> killer<00:01:47.999> and<00:01:48.329> I

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
kuklinski he's this mob killer and I

him there were certain points I feel

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.720 
him there were certain points I feel
where<00:03:39.410> his<00:03:39.620> performance<00:03:40.280> was<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.459> little

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
where his performance was a little

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.240 
where his performance was a little
obvious<00:03:41.150> like<00:03:42.050> there's<00:03:42.860> a<00:03:42.890> couple<00:03:43.010> scenes

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
obvious like there's a couple scenes

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.490 
obvious like there's a couple scenes
where<00:03:43.430> he<00:03:43.550> was<00:03:43.670> angry<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.300> he<00:03:44.900> was<00:03:45.050> like<00:03:45.230> being

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
where he was angry and he was like being

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.740 
where he was angry and he was like being
really<00:03:45.920> visually<00:03:46.910> angry<00:03:47.270> and<00:03:47.390> I<00:03:47.420> think<00:03:47.600> that

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
really visually angry and I think that

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.150 
really visually angry and I think that
maybe<00:03:48.110> somebody<00:03:48.380> told<00:03:48.680> him<00:03:48.770> that<00:03:48.920> you<00:03:48.980> can't

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
maybe somebody told him that you can't

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.710 
maybe somebody told him that you can't
have<00:03:49.250> to<00:03:49.340> be<00:03:49.400> angry<00:03:49.580> in<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.850> scene<00:03:50.090> no<00:03:50.330> angrier

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
have to be angry in the scene no angrier

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.560 
have to be angry in the scene no angrier
angrier<00:03:51.650> yeah<00:03:52.040> I<00:03:52.070> know<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:52.520> felt<00:03:53.090> beyond<00:03:53.360> the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570

angrier yeah I know I I felt beyond the
surface<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.200> I've<00:03:54.290> felt<00:03:54.830> it<00:03:55.010> probably<00:03:55.640> came

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
surface and I've felt it probably came

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.490 
surface and I've felt it probably came
because<00:03:56.120> of<00:03:56.270> the<00:03:56.330> writing<00:03:56.690> like<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:57.020> started

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500
