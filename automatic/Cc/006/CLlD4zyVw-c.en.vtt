on my thing and I go for a discharge I
get<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:11.450> pair<00:05:11.780> ax<00:05:11.990> which<00:05:12.470> that's<00:05:13.280> not<00:05:13.490> that

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
get the pair ax which that's not that

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.760 
get the pair ax which that's not that
much<00:05:13.940> of<00:05:14.000> a<00:05:14.120> hex<00:05:14.390> because<00:05:14.600> it<00:05:14.720> is<00:05:14.810> 30%<00:05:15.350> plus<00:05:15.500> he

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
much of a hex because it is 30% plus he

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.470 
much of a hex because it is 30% plus he
gets<00:05:15.890> the<00:05:16.100> Marvel<00:05:16.460> scale<00:05:16.760> boost<00:05:17.000> so<00:05:17.330> that's

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
gets the Marvel scale boost so that's

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.080 
gets the Marvel scale boost so that's
kinda<00:05:17.900> you<00:05:18.080> know<00:05:18.110> whatever<00:05:18.560> I<00:05:18.920> mean<00:05:19.580> it<00:05:19.820> still

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.570 
kinda you know whatever I mean it still
acts<00:05:20.270> whatever<00:05:21.230> I<00:05:21.380> mean<00:05:21.620> I'm<00:05:21.710> now<00:05:21.860> faster<00:05:22.430> than

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
acts whatever I mean I'm now faster than

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.340 
acts whatever I mean I'm now faster than
it<00:05:22.700> so<00:05:22.940> if<00:05:23.150> he<00:05:23.270> does<00:05:23.510> get<00:05:23.690> paralyzed<00:05:24.080> I<00:05:24.200> can

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
it so if he does get paralyzed I can

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.910 
it so if he does get paralyzed I can
kill<00:05:24.560> it<00:05:25.330> or<00:05:26.330> if<00:05:26.450> I<00:05:26.540> credit<00:05:27.110> I'll<00:05:27.560> kill<00:05:27.890> it

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
kill it or if I credit I'll kill it

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.950 
kill it or if I credit I'll kill it
which<00:05:28.220> I<00:05:28.400> did<00:05:28.670> get<00:05:28.820> a<00:05:28.880> crit<00:05:29.210> here<00:05:29.390> so<00:05:29.660> it's<00:05:29.930> a

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
which I did get a crit here so it's a

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.360 
which I did get a crit here so it's a
good<00:05:30.110> thing<00:05:30.260> he<00:05:30.380> did<00:05:30.590> switch<00:05:31.420> but<00:05:32.420> uh<00:05:33.370> that

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
good thing he did switch but uh that

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.070 
good thing he did switch but uh that
crit<00:05:34.820> on<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.180> venous<00:05:35.510> world<00:05:35.690> was<00:05:35.810> irrelevant

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
crit on the venous world was irrelevant

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.630 
crit on the venous world was irrelevant
because<00:05:36.380> I<00:05:36.560> do<00:05:36.620> have<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.950> HP<00:05:37.100> ice

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
because I do have the HP ice

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.050 
because I do have the HP ice
so<00:05:40.570> that<00:05:40.960> didn't<00:05:41.320> really<00:05:41.410> matter<00:05:41.620> at<00:05:41.920> all<00:05:42.400> but

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
so that didn't really matter at all but

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.430 
so that didn't really matter at all but
everything<00:05:43.990> else<00:05:44.050> did<00:05:44.820> Hanks<00:05:45.820> xxx<00:05:46.480> xxx

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
everything else did Hanks xxx xxx

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.690 
everything else did Hanks xxx xxx
everywhere<00:05:47.950> is<00:05:48.250> hacks<00:05:48.570> so<00:05:50.400> venusaur<00:05:51.400> finally

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.220 
two as a reason why I cursed but I guess
he<00:07:17.770> doesn't<00:07:18.580> have<00:07:18.790> ice<00:07:18.910> beam<00:07:19.120> babysit<00:07:19.840> oh<00:07:19.930> yeah

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.230 
he doesn't have ice beam babysit oh yeah

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.140 
he doesn't have ice beam babysit oh yeah
he<00:07:20.350> has<00:07:20.470> him<00:07:20.620> for<00:07:20.770> electric<00:07:21.220> that's<00:07:21.760> usually

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.150 
he has him for electric that's usually

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.370 
he has him for electric that's usually
what<00:07:22.390> my<00:07:22.630> logic

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.380 
what my logic

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.660 
what my logic
decided<00:07:24.380> that<00:07:24.470> or<00:07:24.620> ice<00:07:24.740> cream<00:07:25.690> but<00:07:26.690> whatever

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:27.670 
decided that or ice cream but whatever

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.320 
decided that or ice cream but whatever
anyway<00:07:28.670> so<00:07:28.910> uh<00:07:29.830> yeah<00:07:30.830> his<00:07:31.340> uh<00:07:31.370> I<00:07:32.000> go<00:07:32.150> for<00:07:32.300> a

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.330 
anyway so uh yeah his uh I go for a

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.210 
anyway so uh yeah his uh I go for a
powerup<00:07:32.570> now<00:07:32.840> but<00:07:33.110> because<00:07:33.230> he's<00:07:33.770> paralyzed

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.220 
powerup now but because he's paralyzed

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.980 
powerup now but because he's paralyzed
he<00:07:34.340> does<00:07:34.490> get<00:07:34.640> the<00:07:34.730> Marvel<00:07:35.060> scale<00:07:35.390> boost<00:07:35.660> which

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:35.990 
he does get the Marvel scale boost which

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.280 
he does get the Marvel scale boost which
makes<00:07:36.710> them<00:07:36.830> live<00:07:37.450> which<00:07:38.450> is<00:07:38.570> like<00:07:38.720> yeah<00:07:38.930> but

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:39.290 
makes them live which is like yeah but

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.810 
makes them live which is like yeah but
that<00:07:39.560> doesn't<00:07:39.800> really<00:07:39.890> matter<00:07:40.070> because<00:07:40.220> you

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:40.820 
that doesn't really matter because you

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.720 
that doesn't really matter because you
know<00:07:40.970> surf<00:07:41.440> doesn't<00:07:42.440> do<00:07:42.500> shit<00:07:42.560> I'm<00:07:43.550> actually

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:43.730 
know surf doesn't do shit I'm actually

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.350 
know surf doesn't do shit I'm actually
gaining<00:07:44.090> more<00:07:44.390> HP<00:07:44.600> I'm<00:07:45.350> pretty<00:07:45.710> sure<00:07:46.330> but<00:07:47.330> uh

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 
gaining more HP I'm pretty sure but uh

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.690 
gaining more HP I'm pretty sure but uh
yeah<00:07:47.750> anyway<00:07:48.440> so<00:07:48.470> I<00:07:48.650> go<00:07:48.980> for<00:07:49.070> powerup<00:07:49.460> again<00:07:49.670> I

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:49.700 
yeah anyway so I go for powerup again I

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.860 
yeah anyway so I go for powerup again I
guess<00:07:50.060> I<00:07:50.150> could<00:07:50.300> have<00:07:50.390> just<00:07:50.540> went<00:07:50.660> for<00:07:50.780> an

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:50.870 
guess I could have just went for an

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.970 
guess I could have just went for an
earthquake<00:07:51.230> that<00:07:51.260> would<00:07:51.470> probably<00:07:51.740> take<00:07:51.890> it

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:51.980 
earthquake that would probably take it

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.920 
earthquake that would probably take it
out<00:07:52.100> anyways<00:07:52.220> but<00:07:52.640> uh<00:07:52.700> you<00:07:53.300> know<00:07:53.390> I<00:07:53.420> didn't<00:07:53.750> and
