run<00:02:17.460> into<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.670> lava<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:18.090> more<00:02:18.240> concerned<00:02:18.570> with

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
run into the lava is more concerned with

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.040 
run into the lava is more concerned with
running<00:02:19.050> over<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.440> TNT<00:02:20.210> look<00:02:21.210> at<00:02:21.300> 88<00:02:21.630> xp<00:02:22.020> for

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
running over the TNT look at 88 xp for

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:30.170

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
two floors and you could fall just from

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.360

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
think this may be the last one that we

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.570 
think this may be the last one that we
do<00:04:17.190> in<00:04:17.400> this<00:04:17.489> episode<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.979> let's<00:04:19.979> try<00:04:20.190> not<00:04:20.370> to

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580
