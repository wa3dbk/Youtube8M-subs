00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.240
 Well, guys, I hope you are 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:05.980
 very good and welcome to a new video 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.990
 in this video as you will have seen the 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.700
 title let's see or learn how 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.220
 remove the back cover of the choice is 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.680
 of 2 ok before I start I want 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.050
 tell you a couple of things the first one is 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.029
 that the chosen as you will know since not 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.710
 has a removable battery with which 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.810
 you can not remove the back cover is 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.159
 a lid that has to stay 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.689
 closed if or if there is a way to remove it and 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.539
 in this video we will learn to do 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.239
 one of them 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.100
 I want to say that in Spain doing this 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.370
 the device's warranty is not lost 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.680
 in Mexico or in America or somewhere in 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.239
 I'm not sure, but I know that in 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.370
 Spain not lose it and go with 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.420
 rather to need two things to 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.670
 open the lid from two the first is the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.750
 pinchito that brings the c2 when you what 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.540
 purchases to remove it is to dedicate 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.990
 and another such as for example a barb of 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.830
 a guitar 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:08.560
 well let's start by removing the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.520
 micro sd sorry the micro sim sorry 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:17.020
 we put the little hole will empeÃ±arme 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.020
 and we have and remove 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.530
 and the pass card paula 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.619
 as you see and have a gap that we have 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:33.500
 catch now the barb study it do more 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:36.500
 high and put it in and go lifting 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.500
 moment 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.299
 once you go up by the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.220
 open side on the other side is worth 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.320
 say with he acts doing it like this 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.400
 below until you hear a click click 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.400
 click like this all the time 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.930
 to move and start to lift the 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.930
 cap 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.490
 at the beginning it's going to cost a little bit 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.880
 be afraid to break them is not usual 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.880
 break 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.239
 and now with the top 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.239
 Y 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.459
 the top part is usually the most 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.459
 hard 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.360
 animals 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.739
 just a moment 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.629
 would be missing because a little bit we're going to see 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.629
 yes, as you can see, 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.489
 this would be 2 and this would be the top 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.750
 back of the device infoca the shit 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.440
 of camera is 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.130
 primary 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.430
 so would the device be on the side 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.430
 rear 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.930
 and I would have the stuff that it brings or is it a 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.460
 non-removable battery 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.500
 this battery when you have them open 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.330
 more advisable to touch it a lot is a 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.370
 very soft battery you can break and 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.740
 doing this is something that is not very 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.980
 recommended good this would be the part 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.980
 rear 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.110
 and this would be the 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.290
 the FUNDIT generally is 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.290
 boiling 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.870
 brings different connection ports 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:44.350
 this would be to connect the mobile 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.150
 with a house that was 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.670
 to directly charge the mobile 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.410
 imagine that this one has windows 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.620
 go directly to load it then 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.430
 I wanted like this 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.430
 and so 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.650
 but this is not very normal since as 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.650
 a little water but you can not 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.080
 end up nagging 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.950
 here it is 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.860
 Well windows 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.780
 moment is worth 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.430
 so that you can remove the lid of this 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.739
 so first of all you can 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.739
 remove then those very curious to see 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.630
 how the monsters inside and if 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.400
 it's simply because of some fault or for 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.770
 change the battery buttons 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.690
 speaker that would be that down or any 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.880
 another function would be to change the 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.500
 camera screen forgiveness 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.840
 removing the screws that I am I no longer 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.720
 I 'm going to make it worth it because it's not like that 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.440
 the guarantee is lost in Spain by removing 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.350
 the lid not removing the screen itself 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.180
 yes it loses good because we talk to 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.680
 put again the case that is very 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.600
 simple you simply put it in your 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.090
 perspective form 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.110
 and vice pressing in the gaps as 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.640
 You see win again 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.640
 you were connecting 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.740
 you have to do a little bit of strength 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.900
 very well let's see this all perfect 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.900
 placed on all sides 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.820
 everything is not perfect and we can already 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.230
 re-insert the 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.430
 the card is 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.430
 and now I do not know how the fuck 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.630
 It will be so far 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.919
 I can understand it again this is 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.500
 It is recommended that you do it with the 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.600
 screen off because if you have put 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.720
 the card can feel like you 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.720
 bothering what you have some 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.720
 little problem 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:12.020
 surely you have everything wrong 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:15.699
 and very important to make sure 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.699
 everything is well placed 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.560
 another thing is that you have when you are 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.380
 doing this the table where are you 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.380
 working clean I mentioned some speck 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.960
 Dust can be a dangerous same 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:38.080
 you see the device works very well and 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.080
 perfectly detects the sim card 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.520
 90 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.690
 Well I hope you liked to leave 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.880
 a comment 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.389
 this video and see you in the next 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.389
 bye
