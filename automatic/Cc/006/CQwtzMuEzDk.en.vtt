00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.210
 Chinese fellow 81 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.730
 learning I collected a layout in a bunch 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:49.760
 apart from everything else, it seemed to have led its head 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:53.420
 I priter her just took small fine 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.140

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.090
 on top of 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.390
 neatly neatly little by little 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.989
 that is, this is it so that they heart 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.989
 the edge itself 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.790

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:16.040

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:18.500
 trying to already go off into it also 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.390

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.320

 the piston and answered the front wheel to me 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.619
 really do not like the wheel leads so well here 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.429
 it's hard for a friend not to understand what's funny 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:38.030
 I have to go disassemble the plug and watch 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:42.500

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.009
 drive through 3 bridge 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.920
 and from the fact that I like so much 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.440
 from the fact that at the municipal osvald 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.870

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.570

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.150

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.500
 whether it turned on just 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.880
