Tony Miller ater was was serviced as far
as<00:01:11.140> it<00:01:11.590> needed<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:11.950> be<00:01:12.159> which<00:01:12.430> pretty<00:01:12.820> much<00:01:13.000> in

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
as it needed to be which pretty much in

as it needed to be which pretty much in
this<00:01:13.240> case<00:01:13.450> was<00:01:13.750> just<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:14.080> good<00:01:14.290> oiling<00:01:14.799> this<00:01:15.670> is

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
this case was just a good oiling this is

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.950 
this case was just a good oiling this is
an<00:01:15.909> older<00:01:16.240> organ<00:01:16.659> probably<00:01:17.140> from<00:01:17.350> about<00:01:17.590> 1962

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
an older organ probably from about 1962

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.280 
an older organ probably from about 1962
possibly<00:01:19.960> early<00:01:20.290> 1963<00:01:21.159> it's<00:01:22.119> a<00:01:22.240> wax<00:01:22.450> cap<00:01:22.810> organ

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
possibly early 1963 it's a wax cap organ

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.740 
possibly early 1963 it's a wax cap organ
there<00:01:24.189> are<00:01:24.310> some<00:01:24.490> that<00:01:24.670> prefer<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.240> slightly

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
there are some that prefer the slightly

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.899 
there are some that prefer the slightly
more<00:01:25.930> mellow<00:01:26.170> sound<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:26.860> wax<00:01:27.100> cap<00:01:27.430> organs

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
more mellow sound of the wax cap organs

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.210 
more mellow sound of the wax cap organs
versus<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.600> much<00:01:29.229> brighter<00:01:29.560> sound<00:01:29.890> of<00:01:30.130> the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
versus the much brighter sound of the

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.960 
versus the much brighter sound of the
red<00:01:30.400> cap<00:01:30.670> mylar<00:01:31.570> cap<00:01:31.810> organs<00:01:32.290> but<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.790> one

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
red cap mylar cap organs but this one

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.789 
red cap mylar cap organs but this one
sounded<00:01:34.329> good<00:01:34.509> we<00:01:35.200> didn't<00:01:35.439> think<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:35.680> needed

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
sounded good we didn't think it needed

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.069 
sounded good we didn't think it needed
additional<00:01:36.399> RC<00:01:36.790> filtering<00:01:37.390> or<00:01:37.509> anything<00:01:37.689> if

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
additional RC filtering or anything if

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.600 
additional RC filtering or anything if
they've<00:01:38.259> had<00:01:38.409> a<00:01:38.470> nice<00:01:38.710> sound<00:01:39.009> to<00:01:39.220> it<00:01:39.340> already

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
they've had a nice sound to it already

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.520 
they've had a nice sound to it already
so<00:01:39.939> we<00:01:39.970> left<00:01:40.540> well<00:01:40.750> enough<00:01:40.840> alone

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
so we left well enough alone

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.770 
so we left well enough alone
the<00:01:42.009> vibrato<00:01:42.430> scanner<00:01:42.909> was<00:01:43.360> removed

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
the vibrato scanner was removed

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.060 
the vibrato scanner was removed
completely<00:01:44.380> disassembled<00:01:45.189> cleaned<00:01:47.070> soaked

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
completely disassembled cleaned soaked

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.139 
completely disassembled cleaned soaked
and<00:01:48.310> then<00:01:49.060> reassembled<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.640> motors<00:01:51.969> were

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
and then reassembled the motors were

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.950 
and then reassembled the motors were
checked<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:53.409> properly<00:01:54.310> oiled<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.540> vibrato

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
checked and properly oiled the vibrato

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.800 
checked and properly oiled the vibrato
line<00:01:56.350> box<00:01:56.680> was<00:01:56.979> recapped<00:01:57.939> and<00:01:58.180> rebuilt

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
line box was recapped and rebuilt

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.660 
line box was recapped and rebuilt
the<00:02:00.200> tongue<00:02:00.409> wheel<00:02:00.590> generator<00:02:01.009> sounded<00:02:01.490> good

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
the tongue wheel generator sounded good

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.070 
the tongue wheel generator sounded good
so<00:02:01.729> we<00:02:02.030> didn't<00:02:02.270> feel<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:02.509> was<00:02:02.540> necessary<00:02:02.630> to

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
so we didn't feel it was necessary to

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.050 
so we didn't feel it was necessary to
recap<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.710> Tomio<00:02:04.100> generator<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.700> that's<00:02:04.850> a

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
recap the Tomio generator and that's a

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.390 
recap the Tomio generator and that's a
very<00:02:05.930> involved<00:02:06.200> process<00:02:06.409> which<00:02:07.070> involves

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
very involved process which involves

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.570 
very involved process which involves
actually<00:02:08.119> then<00:02:08.649> tuning<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.770> filters<00:02:10.190> by

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
actually then tuning the filters by

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.380 
actually then tuning the filters by
selecting<00:02:11.569> capacitors<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:13.180> properly<00:02:14.180> match

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
selecting capacitors to properly match

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.420 
selecting capacitors to properly match
to<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.690> inductances<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.650> transformer

to the inductances and the transformer

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.460 
to the inductances and the transformer
so<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.819> get<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.120> right<00:02:17.270> peak<00:02:17.630> in<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.989> in

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
so that you get the right peak in the in

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.770 
so that you get the right peak in the in
the<00:02:18.680> filter<00:02:19.040> response<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.760> those<00:02:19.940> circuit

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
the filter response that those circuit

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.110 
the filter response that those circuit
elements<00:02:21.170> generate<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:22.280> requires<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.790> lot<00:02:23.000> of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
elements generate that requires a lot of

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.940 
elements generate that requires a lot of
tests<00:02:23.450> equipment<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.050> lot<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.260> hours<00:02:24.709> and

tests equipment and a lot of hours and

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.949 
tests equipment and a lot of hours and

if an organ sounds good
generally<00:02:27.590> speaking<00:02:27.739> it's<00:02:28.130> not<00:02:28.280> necessary<00:02:28.880> to

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
generally speaking it's not necessary to

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.430 
generally speaking it's not necessary to
do<00:02:29.239> that<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:31.370> preamp<00:02:31.819> was<00:02:32.440> completely

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
passive components in the preamp were

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.120 
passive components in the preamp were
removed<00:02:41.930> all<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.440> original<00:02:42.830> ones<00:02:43.010> and

pretty much everything that was inside

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.940 
pretty much everything that was inside
that<00:02:49.790> preamp<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.930> tubes<00:02:51.200> were<00:02:51.410> checked<00:02:51.739> and

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
that preamp the tubes were checked and

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.479 
that preamp the tubes were checked and
tested<00:02:52.160> fine<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:53.000> we're<00:02:53.180> leaving<00:02:53.299> them<00:02:53.569> alone

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
tested fine so we're leaving them alone

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.240

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
the amps and reverb amp was removed from

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.210 
the amps and reverb amp was removed from
this<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.610> 100<00:02:59.180> cabinet<00:02:59.690> because<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:00.890> wasn't

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
this a 100 cabinet because it wasn't

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.460 
this a 100 cabinet because it wasn't
going<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.430> be<00:03:01.549> used<00:03:01.790> in<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.030> application<00:03:02.900> and

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
going to be used in that application and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.039 
going to be used in that application and
we<00:03:03.590> installed<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:04.040> trek<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.340> OBX<00:03:05.150> box<00:03:05.920> for<00:03:06.920> the

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
we installed a trek to OBX box for the

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.210 
we installed a trek to OBX box for the
for<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.230> for<00:03:09.859> the<00:03:09.980> Leslie<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.760> power<00:03:11.299> input

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
for the for the Leslie and power input

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.699 
for the for the Leslie and power input
that's<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.340> track<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.730> OBX<00:03:14.209> box<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.930> over<00:03:15.500> here

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
that's a track to OBX box and over here

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.830 
that's a track to OBX box and over here
we<00:03:15.829> have<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:16.130> trek<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.370> effects<00:03:16.880> loops<00:03:17.209> which

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
we have the trek to effects loops which

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.599 
we have the trek to effects loops which
allow<00:03:18.109> us<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.440> run<00:03:18.590> effects<00:03:18.980> on<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.310> upper

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
allow us to run effects on the upper

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.370 
allow us to run effects on the upper
manual<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.180> lower<00:03:20.359> manual<00:03:20.720> separately

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
manual and the lower manual separately

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.009 
manual and the lower manual separately
so<00:03:22.370> if<00:03:22.400> someone<00:03:22.790> wants<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.060> run<00:03:23.269> a<00:03:23.299> chorus<00:03:23.810> on

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
so if someone wants to run a chorus on

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.830 
so if someone wants to run a chorus on
the<00:03:24.109> upper<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:26.120> know<00:03:26.180> delay<00:03:26.510> on<00:03:26.720> the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
the upper and you know delay on the

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.080 
the upper and you know delay on the
lower<00:03:27.019> or<00:03:27.620> distortion<00:03:28.280> or<00:03:28.430> fuzz<00:03:28.670> or<00:03:28.850> whatever

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
lower or distortion or fuzz or whatever

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.720 
lower or distortion or fuzz or whatever
you<00:03:29.239> can<00:03:29.450> plug<00:03:30.049> in<00:03:30.260> there<00:03:30.950> basically<00:03:31.280> sends

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
you can plug in there basically sends

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.110 
you can plug in there basically sends
and<00:03:31.850> returns<00:03:32.950> just<00:03:33.950> like<00:03:34.130> in<00:03:34.280> pro<00:03:34.940> audio

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
and returns just like in pro audio

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.759 
and returns just like in pro audio
equipment<00:03:36.220> so<00:03:37.220> everything<00:03:37.700> was<00:03:37.880> basically

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
equipment so everything was basically

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.190 
equipment so everything was basically
you<00:03:39.769> know<00:03:39.890> rebuilt<00:03:40.549> and<00:03:40.910> put<00:03:41.720> back<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.170> the

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
you know rebuilt and put back to the

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.059 
you know rebuilt and put back to the
correct<00:03:42.530> spec<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:44.200> it's<00:03:45.200> act<00:03:45.440> it<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:45.769> running

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
correct spec and it's act it is running

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.979 
correct spec and it's act it is running
now<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.370> aside<00:03:46.819> from<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:47.180> motor<00:03:47.390> inside<00:03:47.840> you

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
now and aside from the motor inside you

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.590 
now and aside from the motor inside you
can<00:03:48.170> hear<00:03:48.380> it<00:03:48.470> is<00:03:48.620> very<00:03:48.890> quiet<00:03:49.480> Leslie<00:03:50.480> is

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
can hear it is very quiet Leslie is

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.680 
can hear it is very quiet Leslie is
quiet<00:03:50.930> as<00:03:51.140> well<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:52.400> had<00:03:52.609> all<00:03:52.819> of<00:03:52.850> its<00:03:53.030> motors

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
quiet as well it had all of its motors

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.680 
quiet as well it had all of its motors
rebuilt<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.560> amp<00:03:54.769> basically<00:03:55.639> rebuilt<00:03:56.090> it

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
rebuilt and the amp basically rebuilt it

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.140 
rebuilt and the amp basically rebuilt it
also<00:03:56.840> has<00:03:57.049> a<00:03:57.109> solid<00:03:57.380> state<00:03:57.859> relay<00:03:58.310> everything

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
also has a solid state relay everything

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.509 
also has a solid state relay everything
was<00:03:59.269> properly<00:03:59.510> adjusted<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:01.100> point<00:04:01.370> where

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
was properly adjusted the point where

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.129 
was properly adjusted the point where
you<00:04:01.579> can't<00:04:01.790> even<00:04:02.000> hear<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.209> switch<00:04:02.540> speed<00:04:02.870> I'm

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
you can't even hear it switch speed I'm

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.479 
you can't even hear it switch speed I'm
going<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:03.380> switch<00:04:03.650> to

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.380 

and<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:08.610> can<00:04:08.790> hear<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.269> it's<00:04:10.049> practically

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
and you can hear that it's practically

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.080 
and you can hear that it's practically
silent<00:04:12.390> when<00:04:12.569> it<00:04:12.659> switches<00:04:13.790> of<00:04:14.790> course

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
silent when it switches of course

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.879 
silent when it switches of course
there's<00:04:15.239> always<00:04:15.360> gonna<00:04:15.510> be<00:04:15.599> a<00:04:15.720> little<00:04:16.650> bit<00:04:16.799> of

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
there's always gonna be a little bit of

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.670 
there's always gonna be a little bit of
mechanical<00:04:17.489> noise<00:04:17.639> is<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.180> shift<00:04:19.019> gear<00:04:19.350> so<00:04:19.620> to

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
mechanical noise is it shift gear so to

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.920 
mechanical noise is it shift gear so to
speak<00:04:22.010> as<00:04:23.010> far<00:04:23.220> as<00:04:23.370> Leslie's<00:04:23.820> go<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.449> mean<00:04:24.810> this

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930
