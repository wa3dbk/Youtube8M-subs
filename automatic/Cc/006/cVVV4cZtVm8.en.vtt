missing
oh<00:02:35.780> yeah<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:37.600> think<00:02:38.600> that's<00:02:39.230> ammonia<00:02:39.769> not<00:02:40.430> no

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
oh yeah I think that's ammonia not no

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.140 
oh yeah I think that's ammonia not no
more<00:02:41.030> no<00:02:41.239> he<00:02:41.540> won't<00:02:41.720> be<00:02:42.200> anyway<00:02:42.850> so<00:02:43.850> I<00:02:43.880> did

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
more no he won't be anyway so I did

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.449 
more no he won't be anyway so I did
research<00:02:44.660> on<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.410> it's<00:02:45.739> pretty<00:02:46.010> much<00:02:46.130> it

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
research on that and it's pretty much it

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.790 
research on that and it's pretty much it
says<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:47.000> if<00:02:47.180> you're<00:02:47.810> dyeing<00:02:48.200> your<00:02:48.380> hair<00:02:48.440> for

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
says that if you're dyeing your hair for

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.440 
says that if you're dyeing your hair for
the<00:02:48.830> first<00:02:48.890> time<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.400> want<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:49.670> get<00:02:49.880> em<00:02:50.120> long

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
the first time you want to get em long

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.970 
the first time you want to get em long
everywhere<00:02:51.170> like<00:02:51.350> you're<00:02:51.500> putting<00:02:51.620> color<00:02:51.890> on

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
everywhere like you're putting color on

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.040 
everywhere like you're putting color on
it<00:02:52.190> for<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.400> first<00:02:52.580> time<00:02:52.820> this<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:53.630> what<00:02:53.870> you

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
it for the first time this is what you

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.320 
it for the first time this is what you
want<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.350> use<00:02:55.600> but<00:02:56.600> it's<00:02:56.810> basically<00:02:57.290> ammonia

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
want to use but it's basically ammonia

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.140 
want to use but it's basically ammonia
just<00:02:59.330> basically<00:02:59.810> helps<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.739> color<00:03:00.940> stay<00:03:01.940> in

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
just basically helps the color stay in

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.070 
just basically helps the color stay in
your<00:03:02.300> hair<00:03:02.510> longer<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.200> then<00:03:03.800> I<00:03:04.720> don't<00:03:05.720> know<00:03:05.840> I

like short hair like this and that's

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.240 
like short hair like this and that's
about<00:04:55.919> it

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
about it

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.890 
about it
and<00:04:56.580> that's<00:04:57.139> at<00:04:58.139> least<00:04:58.200> in<00:04:58.530> my<00:04:58.740> opinion<00:04:59.130> if<00:04:59.550> you

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
and that's at least in my opinion if you

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.620 
and that's at least in my opinion if you
concerned<00:05:00.900> right<00:05:01.229> and<00:05:01.470> do<00:05:01.650> all<00:05:01.830> that<00:05:02.630> but<00:05:03.630> yeah

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
concerned right and do all that but yeah

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.820 
concerned right and do all that but yeah
so<00:05:05.230> I<00:05:05.260> also<00:05:05.740> thought<00:05:06.160> that<00:05:06.430> this<00:05:06.640> was<00:05:06.940> like<00:05:07.830> the

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
so I also thought that this was like the

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.580 
so I also thought that this was like the
