grew on trees would you own a greenhouse

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.300 
grew on trees would you own a greenhouse
to<00:01:25.920> grow<00:01:26.400> them<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:27.229> a<00:01:28.229> house<00:01:28.470> made<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.890> glass

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
to grow them as a house made of glass

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.270 
to grow them as a house made of glass
not<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.850> greenhouse

not a greenhouse

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.100 
not a greenhouse
well<00:01:32.280> glass<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> ingredients<00:01:33.960> to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
well glass is one of the ingredients to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.670 
well glass is one of the ingredients to
making<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.500> house<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.100> green<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:37.380> would

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
making a house that is green so I would

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.370 
making a house that is green so I would
buy<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> house<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.579> green<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.229> wouldn't<00:01:40.229> keep

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
buy a house that's green I wouldn't keep

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.670 
buy a house that's green I wouldn't keep
any<00:01:40.619> pizza<00:01:41.040> trees<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.520> though<00:01:41.670> because

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
any pizza trees in it though because

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.840 
any pizza trees in it though because
they<00:01:43.680> probably<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.130> all<00:01:44.280> sorts<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.700> weird

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
they probably have all sorts of weird

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.410 
they probably have all sorts of weird
stuff<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.509> I'd<00:01:45.720> probably<00:01:46.350> die<00:01:46.649> of

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
stuff in it and I'd probably die of

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.359 
stuff in it and I'd probably die of
eating<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:49.350> mo<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.649> made<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> banana

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
eating it if mo you made a banana

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.899 
eating it if mo you made a banana
company<00:01:51.000> would<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.750> buy<00:01:51.899> bananas<00:01:52.140> from<00:01:52.680> them

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
company would you buy bananas from them

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.580 
company would you buy bananas from them
but<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.970> need<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> buy<00:01:54.540> bananas<00:01:54.780> from<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.409> when

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
but I need to buy bananas from that when

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.530 
but I need to buy bananas from that when
I<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.130> buy<00:01:56.369> all<00:01:56.430> these<00:01:56.670> bananas<00:01:57.210> from<00:01:57.420> my

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
I can just buy all these bananas from my

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.060 
I can just buy all these bananas from my
local<00:01:57.780> health<00:01:58.110> food<00:01:58.200> store<00:02:00.829> what<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
local health food store what is the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.910 
local health food store what is the
worst<00:02:02.399> cube<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.210> own<00:02:03.469> actually<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.649> one

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
worst cube you own actually this one

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.240 
worst cube you own actually this one
it's<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.969> cardboard<00:02:06.630> cube<00:02:07.350> it's<00:02:07.619> not<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> puzzle

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
it's a cardboard cube it's not a puzzle

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.790 
it's a cardboard cube it's not a puzzle
in<00:02:08.520> any<00:02:08.700> way<00:02:09.050> it's<00:02:10.050> really<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.440> even<00:02:10.590> that

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
in any way it's really not even that

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.080 
in any way it's really not even that
cubic<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.459> also<00:02:11.580> pretty<00:02:11.910> beat-up

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
cubic it's also pretty beat-up

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.850 
cubic it's also pretty beat-up
there<00:02:13.239> is<00:02:13.360> some<00:02:13.569> tokens<00:02:13.989> for<00:02:14.200> free<00:02:14.440> ice<00:02:14.560> cream

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
there is some tokens for free ice cream

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.130 
there is some tokens for free ice cream
inside<00:02:15.190> though<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.640> guess<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:16.840> could

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
inside though so I guess this could

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.050 
inside though so I guess this could
actually<00:02:17.319> be<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.590> best<00:02:17.830> cube<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.280> own<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.849> I

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
actually be the best cube I own so I

actually be the best cube I own so I
don't<00:02:20.050> really<00:02:20.140> know<00:02:20.440> have<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.370> ever<00:02:21.550> tried<00:02:21.849> to

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
don't really know have you ever tried to

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.040 
don't really know have you ever tried to
solve<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.269> through<00:02:22.480> by<00:02:22.599> through<00:02:22.810> with<00:02:22.930> your

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
solve it through by through with your

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.229 
solve it through by through with your
tongue<00:02:24.330> no<00:02:25.950> what's<00:02:26.950> your<00:02:27.010> opinion<00:02:27.370> on<00:02:27.670> deez

is<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.470> overused<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.599> don't<00:02:31.599> even<00:02:31.750> know<00:02:31.989> where

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
is it overused I don't even know where

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.900 
is it overused I don't even know where
this<00:02:32.230> comes<00:02:32.530> from<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:33.220> think<00:02:33.610> it's<00:02:33.700> from<00:02:33.849> the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
this comes from I think it's from the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.900 
this comes from I think it's from the
video<00:02:34.590> but<00:02:35.590> yeah<00:02:35.739> it's<00:02:35.890> definitely<00:02:36.099> overused

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
video but yeah it's definitely overused

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.070 
video but yeah it's definitely overused
cuz<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:38.280> hear<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.400> like<00:02:39.640> every<00:02:40.000> day<00:02:40.209> but<00:02:40.269> don't

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
cuz I hear it like every day but don't

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.789 
cuz I hear it like every day but don't
even<00:02:41.200> know<00:02:41.440> where<00:02:41.590> it's<00:02:41.709> from<00:02:41.799> so<00:02:43.650> that's<00:02:44.650> a

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
even know where it's from so that's a

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.440 
even know where it's from so that's a
good<00:02:44.890> sign<00:02:45.069> that's<00:02:45.310> overused<00:02:45.849> what's<00:02:46.329> your

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
good sign that's overused what's your

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.309 
good sign that's overused what's your

original<00:02:50.319> it's<00:02:50.709> not<00:02:50.799> really<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.220> hard<00:02:51.430> next

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
question if you're color neutral how do

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.479 
question if you're color neutral how do
you<00:02:54.730> decide<00:02:55.090> which<00:02:55.329> color<00:02:55.750> cross<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:57.069> do<00:02:57.250> on

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
you decide which color cross to do on

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.559 
you decide which color cross to do on
5x5<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.510> up<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:59.250> use<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.430> same<00:03:00.640> way<00:03:01.060> I<00:03:01.090> do<00:03:01.239> for

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
5x5 and up I use the same way I do for

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.350 
5x5 and up I use the same way I do for
4x4<00:03:01.810> 2<00:03:02.290> because<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.500> don't<00:03:02.709> use<00:03:02.860> Yao<00:03:03.250> if<00:03:04.209> I'm

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
4x4 2 because I don't use Yao if I'm

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.940 
4x4 2 because I don't use Yao if I'm
going<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.510> use<00:03:04.629> something<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:04.959> use<00:03:05.140> Hoya<00:03:05.530> but

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
going to use something I use Hoya but

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.089 
going to use something I use Hoya but
most<00:03:06.190> of<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.459> time<00:03:06.640> I<00:03:06.670> use<00:03:06.910> redux<00:03:07.269> like<00:03:07.829> all<00:03:08.829> of

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
most of the time I use redux like all of

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.520 
most of the time I use redux like all of
the<00:03:09.220> time<00:03:09.459> pretty<00:03:09.640> much<00:03:09.760> but<00:03:10.239> basically<00:03:11.079> once

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
the time pretty much but basically once

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.650 
the time pretty much but basically once
I<00:03:11.620> get<00:03:11.739> done<00:03:11.890> with<00:03:11.950> centers<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.000> edge<00:03:13.150> pairing

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
I get done with centers and edge pairing

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.009 
I get done with centers and edge pairing
I<00:03:13.959> would<00:03:14.379> just<00:03:14.940> it's<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:16.030> very<00:03:16.209> quick<00:03:16.480> process

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
I would just it's a very quick process

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.780 
I would just it's a very quick process
I<00:03:17.200> mostly<00:03:17.470> just<00:03:17.560> look<00:03:17.859> for<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.190> edges<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.549> I

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
I mostly just look for the edges that I

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.750 
I mostly just look for the edges that I
see<00:03:19.060> if<00:03:19.840> there's<00:03:20.109> any<00:03:20.290> pairs<00:03:20.650> like<00:03:21.160> matched<00:03:21.579> up

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
see if there's any pairs like matched up

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.759 
see if there's any pairs like matched up
with<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:21.940> center<00:03:22.420> I'll<00:03:22.600> usually<00:03:22.989> try<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.530> do

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
with a center I'll usually try and do

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.890 
with a center I'll usually try and do
that<00:03:23.920> one<00:03:24.160> unless<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.239> see<00:03:25.420> something<00:03:25.780> else

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
that one unless I see something else

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.199 
that one unless I see something else
better<00:03:26.560> but<00:03:27.280> most<00:03:27.549> of<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.790> time<00:03:27.970> it's<00:03:28.120> just

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
better but most of the time it's just

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.180 
better but most of the time it's just
like<00:03:28.389> whichever<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.079> can<00:03:29.260> see<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.560> most<00:03:29.769> edges

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
like whichever I can see the most edges

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.349 
like whichever I can see the most edges
of<00:03:30.400> if<00:03:30.940> that<00:03:31.209> kind<00:03:31.359> of<00:03:31.450> makes<00:03:31.510> sense<00:03:31.750> if<00:03:33.359> I

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
of if that kind of makes sense if I

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.910 
of if that kind of makes sense if I
don't<00:03:34.540> really<00:03:34.750> see<00:03:35.109> a<00:03:35.139> lot<00:03:35.319> of<00:03:35.349> edges<00:03:35.739> I'll

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
don't really see a lot of edges I'll

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.830 
don't really see a lot of edges I'll
just<00:03:36.069> do<00:03:36.250> pretty<00:03:36.760> much<00:03:36.849> whatever<00:03:37.150> color<00:03:37.510> is

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
just do pretty much whatever color is

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.949 
just do pretty much whatever color is
either<00:03:38.230> facing<00:03:38.859> me<00:03:39.010> or<00:03:39.220> on<00:03:39.459> bottom<00:03:39.870> where<00:03:40.870> do

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
either facing me or on bottom where do

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.800
