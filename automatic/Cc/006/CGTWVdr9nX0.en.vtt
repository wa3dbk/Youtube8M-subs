00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.420
 hello today we will introduce you to 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.580
 compact motherboard available 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.599
 micro format Thai language asus speech 81 and kay 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.609
 This board is one of the most 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.380
 models available to the mass buyer 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.029
 format micro tanks in stock 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.070
 Taiwanese company with an average 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.420
 costs about 50 5 dollars she 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.039
 offers several significant 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.170
 benefits such as support 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.119
 modern interfaces of usizi 30 and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.920
 acid 6 gigabit per second high 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.290
 workmanship as well as several 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.340
 useful proprietary technologies 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.809
 Additionally, we note that this model 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.719
 made on the basis of the youngest 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.430
 intel h81 chipset 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.489
 which in many ways accompanied such a low 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.260
 final cost on the front side 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.760
 packaging is mentioned among other things 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.530
 chip application for protection against 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.969
 electrostatic discharge as well 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.280
 indicated support for a number of branded 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.710
 user-friendly interface technology uefi bios 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.000
 and vs windows 81 on the back 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.920
 packaging image is located 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.300
 motherboard and and brief 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.589
 data sheet 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.110
 as well as a list of supported 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.990
 technology and features in a box with 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.549
 asus 81 more kei delivered only 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.220
 the most necessary accessories 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.080
 namely a disk with drivers and utilities 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.430
 user manual 20 loop a 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.430
 also interface panel stub 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.730
 new made on compact printed

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.110
 bright shades or design bring 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.270
 expansion slots painted yellow 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.040
 what makes the motherboard look more 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.840
 interesting layout same typesetting 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.160
 elements of the whole is implemented at high 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.170
 level therefore no significant 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.820
 problems with this aspect of use 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.740
 you will not have since all the ports 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.030
 located at optimum locations closer 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.860
 to the edges of the PCB 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.869
 only close discomfort can cause 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.180
 neighborhood vadim slots and connectors pisya 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.250
 express 20 x 16 and so to retrieve 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.720
 memory modules possible 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.940
 will have to pre-disable 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.830
 video card at the bottom of the PCB 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.570
 The following connectors are located 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.090
 connect the audio jack in the front 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.720

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.380
 as well as the front connection pad 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.840
 panels additionally note two pads 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.910
 to activate ports yusb 20 just the same 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.570
 motherboard supports 6 usb ports 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.400

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.120
 cooling consists of only one lime 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.330
 its radiator during testing 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.930
 The following indicators were recorded 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.850
 the results can be 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.410
 characterize as mean however up to 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.420
 There are still quite critical values 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.430
 sufficient processor power supply 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.230
 are carried out according to the three-phase scheme for 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.060
 computational cores and additional 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.239
 nodes to extend functionality

 main usage scenario and z mod 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.150
 which all the necessary settings 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.129
 grouped on one screen either 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.349
 the usual 20 mod where all the settings 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.060
 spaced apart in their tabs are all linked 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.519
 with system overclocking parameters are

 in the process of testing maternal 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.490
 asus board speech 81- kay recommended 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.050
 yourself on the good side 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.090
 combining myself not only affordable 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.230
 cost but decent quality along with

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.410
 nice design 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.970
 as for the features then before 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.560
 the purchase is worth remembering uncomfortable 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.480
 connect multichannel acoustics 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.370
 there are only 2 deep slots for 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.420
