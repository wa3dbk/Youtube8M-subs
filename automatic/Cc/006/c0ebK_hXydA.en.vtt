00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.120
 the quadruple nuts I have never seen 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.100
 I do not remember seeing a full picture 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.070
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.830
 I try it plushenko in a championship and 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.920
 he has tried it already in fact he did 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.130
 in a grand prix I do not remember in what era 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.720
 him in america on skate america if yes 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.029
 it will be the first time that I have 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.290
 seen quadruple quadruple alcohol 'toe 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.290
 you have to see it you have to see it 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.730
 today nobody else does it because 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.530
 if he does he does it at the beginning so 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.000
 get ready because for me it can be a 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.290
 historical or what to do in ripoll 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.290
 to a quadruple light 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.770
 to the asphalt half turn completely 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.400
 but we will have to see 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.400
 how they are accounted for 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.329
 the triple axel 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.260
 very good pirouettes was the difference 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.260
 speed with benzine 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.329
 triple light 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.329
 triplet wow 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.229
 very fast machines 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.770
 what good program is doing be 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.090
 See what pirouettes what speed 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.090
 looks like the skin 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.390
 it's the difficult entry 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.170
 what is one more level and at the same place 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.860
 and here the three positions camel goes down and 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.940
 vertical 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.330
 other level 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.270
 yes although strength and with what claw yes 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.770
 sir yes sir is missing the last 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.660
 combination of pirouette with the three 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.630
 positions the three basic positions 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.220
 of these and camelo foot 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.950
 but to work 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.030
 gives Level 4 and take a look around the 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.880
 Technical score now exceeds 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.680
 Awesome 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.330
 I think it lacks rotation like that 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.420
 it lacks rotation 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.350
 will have to see yes 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.760
 if the effort has been worth it 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.310
 it will have to be seen because normally he 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.400
 does he use it as a tactic because 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.820
 even if you miss a room if you deserve the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.390
 sorry being under rotate now but if that 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.680
 mean massacre already pass it as if 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.910
 out a triple nothing else comes out 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.360
 count as if it were triple and 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.360
 less 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.209
 no longer deserves here is let's see 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.220
 look at the 123 boot is that in the absence of 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.109
 the family has completely missed 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.579
 half 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.070
 that's not a quadruple fight is a 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.020
 try four times but surely it 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.080
 they are going to degrade it, it would have deserved more 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.680
 worth doing triple flip 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.009
 I would have told him five and a half 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.580
 but this thing that goes down of 4 points that had 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:41.610
 in principle a quadruple a quadruple 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.660
 lutz me part that are 11 peak I do not know 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.729
 the 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.889
 yes the combination very many 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.380
 quad lutz 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.650
 but that are 13 points 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:56.880
 that burrada and they have lowered it to triple 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.520
 light that are 6 clear is that more than double 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.400
 plus the boe that is negative to clark 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.890
 attentive but then when you see the 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.320
 protocols and see how they have downloaded 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.610
 also in the combination of the first 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.120
 be in the combination triple the 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.460
 triplet in the in the first light we go in 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.590
 the first jump that is a look has 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.820
 missing has lacked a little bit of spin 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.290
 with which also there will have its 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.870
 small penalty but good is a 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:26.550
 skater 75 76 77 the best season 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.000
 the best note of the season has been 76 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.580
 98 will not have any problems without doubt adam 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.260
 pace to be in the final but it's 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.330
 true maybe this strategy 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.400
 I would have to review it 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.260
 You would do it again this time 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.420
 be strategically that quadruple look 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.400
 that yes it is that it has come to do 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.910
 is that he has managed to do 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.520
 then there is the doubt you never know 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.370
 but to this today to this day I do not think that 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.310
 it was worth it 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.250
 return to 36 in technique 38 in 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.440
 presentation when they fuck and rafael in 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.090
 trainer rafa air doctor jan when 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.729
 see the protocol they will see the failures 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.840
 and especially the two looks the quadruple 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.840
 has done and then the triple
