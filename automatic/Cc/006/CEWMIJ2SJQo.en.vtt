these<00:00:14.509> these<00:00:15.509> mealworms<00:00:16.220> start<00:00:17.220> off<00:00:17.369> as

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
these these mealworms start off as

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.279 
these these mealworms start off as
Beatles<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.680> The<00:00:20.600> Beatles<00:00:21.600> lay<00:00:21.779> eggs<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
Beatles and The Beatles lay eggs the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.290 
Beatles and The Beatles lay eggs the
eggs<00:00:22.529> turn<00:00:23.189> into<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> mealworms<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
eggs turn into the mealworms the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.040 
eggs turn into the mealworms the
mealworms<00:00:24.660> pupate<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:26.599> come<00:00:27.599> little<00:00:27.779> hard

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
mealworms pupate and come little hard

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.950 
mealworms pupate and come little hard
little<00:00:28.380> they<00:00:28.769> look<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.039> seeds<00:00:29.660> and<00:00:30.660> then

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
little they look like seeds and then

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.500 
little they look like seeds and then
they<00:00:31.080> hatch<00:00:31.230> out<00:00:31.439> into<00:00:31.830> beetles<00:00:32.009> again<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
they hatch out into beetles again so the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.010 
they hatch out into beetles again so the
cycle<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.020> pretty<00:00:34.620> simple<00:00:35.090> basically<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.840> put

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
cycle is pretty simple basically you put

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.979 
cycle is pretty simple basically you put
them<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> container<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.690> you<00:00:39.690> as

box inside there so I ordered 2000 of

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.940 
box inside there so I ordered 2000 of
them<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:18.360> would<00:02:19.050> assume<00:02:19.350> they<00:02:19.620> don't<00:02:19.739> count

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
them I would assume they don't count

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.530 
them I would assume they don't count
these<00:02:20.190> out<00:02:20.370> they<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.760> weigh<00:02:20.880> them<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
these out they just weigh them and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.990 
these out they just weigh them and
that's<00:02:22.350> about<00:02:22.530> what<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.920> get<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.459> will<00:02:26.850> just

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000

believe was $22 that's the till I ended

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.870 
believe was $22 that's the till I ended
up<00:02:49.500> paying<00:02:49.770> for<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.100> about<00:02:50.550> $22<00:02:52.640> it's<00:02:53.640> still

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
up paying for it about $22 it's still

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.380 
up paying for it about $22 it's still
quite<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.120> few<00:02:54.210> in<00:02:54.510> there<00:02:54.660> but<00:02:55.940> get<00:02:56.940> those<00:02:57.150> out

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
quite a few in there but get those out

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.940 
quite a few in there but get those out
so<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:59.190> looks<00:02:59.310> like<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.550> don't<00:02:59.610> even<00:02:59.970> need<00:03:00.950> looks

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
so it looks like I don't even need looks

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.190 
so it looks like I don't even need looks
like<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.190> don't<00:03:02.250> even<00:03:02.610> need<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.970> have<00:03:03.200> the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
like I don't even need to have the

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.350 
like I don't even need to have the
oatmeal<00:03:04.350> in<00:03:04.680> here<00:03:04.800> coz<00:03:04.980> they're<00:03:05.130> already<00:03:05.360> it's

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
oatmeal in here coz they're already it's

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.510 
oatmeal in here coz they're already it's
already<00:03:06.450> plenty<00:03:06.840> in<00:03:07.050> here

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
already plenty in here

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.100 
already plenty in here
another's<00:03:08.520> there<00:03:09.300> are<00:03:09.390> quite<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.690> few<00:03:09.780> dead

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
another's there are quite a few dead

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.610 
another's there are quite a few dead
ones<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.470> here<00:03:10.620> but<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:12.140> guess<00:03:13.140> that's<00:03:13.290> probably

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
ones in here but I guess that's probably

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.920 
ones in here but I guess that's probably
from<00:03:13.980> his<00:03:14.720> from<00:03:15.720> his<00:03:15.750> setup<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:21.540> see<00:03:21.810> the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
from his from his setup to see the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.920 
from his from his setup to see the
different<00:03:22.260> stages<00:03:26.510> but<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.600> can<00:03:27.720> see<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
different stages but you can see the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.199 
different stages but you can see the
whole<00:03:28.080> thing<00:03:28.110> kind<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.620> just<00:03:28.770> crawls

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.649 

and<00:03:35.930> that's<00:03:36.170> it<00:03:36.379> so<00:03:37.060> basically<00:03:38.060> just<00:03:38.329> put

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
and that's it so basically just put

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.190 
and that's it so basically just put
these<00:03:38.810> aside<00:03:39.189> keep<00:03:40.189> feeding<00:03:40.459> them<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:40.879> then

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
these aside keep feeding them and then

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.899 
these aside keep feeding them and then
when<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.290> end<00:03:42.439> up<00:03:42.530> getting<00:03:42.680> beetles<00:03:43.189> I<00:03:43.400> will

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
when you end up getting beetles I will

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.770 
when you end up getting beetles I will
separate<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.480> beetles<00:03:44.810> out<00:03:44.930> into<00:03:45.230> another

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
separate the beetles out into another

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.449 
separate the beetles out into another
another<00:03:47.780> container<00:03:50.829> this<00:03:51.829> is<00:03:51.889> kind<00:03:52.280> of<00:03:52.310> like

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
another container this is kind of like

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.959 
another container this is kind of like
the<00:03:52.639> set<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.420> and<00:03:53.540> forget<00:03:53.629> it<00:03:54.700> probably<00:03:55.700> put

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:55.969 
the set it and forget it probably put

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.490 
the set it and forget it probably put
some<00:03:56.120> holes<00:03:56.299> in<00:03:56.450> this<00:03:56.540> but<00:03:56.870> it's<00:03:57.049> not<00:03:57.260> really

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
some holes in this but it's not really

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.970 
some holes in this but it's not really
that<00:03:57.530> airtight<00:03:58.219> so<00:03:59.000> I<00:04:00.939> love<00:04:01.939> that<00:04:02.769> that's<00:04:03.769> how
