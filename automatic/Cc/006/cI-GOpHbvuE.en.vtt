your arm you gotta sync this up with
your<00:03:03.080> ps3<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.440> such<00:03:05.270> so<00:03:06.270> we'll<00:03:06.390> see<00:03:06.510> how<00:03:06.540> that

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
your ps3 and such so we'll see how that

turns<00:03:06.780> out<00:03:08.060> yeah<00:03:09.060> exactly<00:03:09.330> thing<00:03:09.810> uh<00:03:09.840> let's

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
turns out yeah exactly thing uh let's

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.680 
turns out yeah exactly thing uh let's
see<00:03:10.860> in<00:03:11.430> other<00:03:11.610> words<00:03:11.790> backing<00:03:12.209> up<00:03:12.270> files<00:03:12.420> and

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
see in other words backing up files and

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.120 
see in other words backing up files and
transferring<00:03:13.080> data<00:03:13.170> works<00:03:13.530> exactly<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:14.040> same

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
transferring data works exactly the same

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.550 
transferring data works exactly the same
way<00:03:14.280> with<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.730> pc<00:03:15.239> vida<00:03:15.600> pairing<00:03:16.110> as<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.410> does

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
way with a pc vida pairing as it does

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.090 
way with a pc vida pairing as it does
with<00:03:16.769> ps3<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.580> vita<00:03:18.180> setup<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.720> keeps<00:03:19.140> things

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
with ps3 and vita setup it keeps things

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.000 
with ps3 and vita setup it keeps things
simple<00:03:20.790> with<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:21.510> too<00:03:21.900> many<00:03:22.049> copy<00:03:22.530> content

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
simple with just too many copy content

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.380 
simple with just too many copy content
and<00:03:23.220> back<00:03:23.400> up<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:23.760> i<00:03:23.820> guess<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.030> get<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.180> backup

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
and back up so i guess you get a backup

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.530 
and back up so i guess you get a backup
for<00:03:24.690> your<00:03:24.780> pc<00:03:25.310> or<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.700> get<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.820> other<00:03:27.120> backup

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
for your pc or you get a other backup

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.300 
for your pc or you get a other backup
your<00:03:27.660> pc<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.049> your<00:03:28.380> PS<00:03:28.590> vita<00:03:28.769> or<00:03:29.010> your<00:03:29.160> p's

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
play on it mp3 and before wave and then

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.199 
play on it mp3 and before wave and then
for<00:03:38.700> movies<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.209> can<00:03:39.239> play<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.600> mpeg-4<00:03:41.209> h.264

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
for movies you can play the mpeg-4 h.264

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.710 
for movies you can play the mpeg-4 h.264
codec<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:43.530> then<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:43.860> plays<00:03:44.100> major<00:03:44.720> image

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
codec and then it plays major image

extremely<00:04:34.820> awesome<00:04:35.000> stuff<00:04:35.450> and<00:04:36.080> now<00:04:36.260> here<00:04:36.560> is

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
extremely awesome stuff and now here is

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.730 
extremely awesome stuff and now here is
the<00:04:36.740> camera<00:04:37.340> which<00:04:37.490> apparently<00:04:37.760> um<00:04:38.240> I<00:04:38.740> guess

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
the camera which apparently um I guess

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.620 
the camera which apparently um I guess
that's<00:04:40.070> why<00:04:40.280> this<00:04:40.340> is<00:04:40.550> bad<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:41.270> maximum

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
that's why this is bad the maximum

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.560 
that's why this is bad the maximum
resolution<00:04:42.050> on<00:04:42.470> this<00:04:42.650> camera<00:04:43.010> is<00:04:43.190> 640<00:04:43.940> by<00:04:44.060> 480

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
resolution on this camera is 640 by 480

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.820 
resolution on this camera is 640 by 480
which<00:04:45.140> is<00:04:45.290> also<00:04:45.440> known<00:04:45.590> as<00:04:45.860> 480p<00:04:46.270> so<00:04:47.270> I<00:04:47.360> mean

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
which is also known as 480p so I mean

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.190 
which is also known as 480p so I mean
nothing<00:04:48.830> good<00:04:49.100> but<00:04:49.750> yeah<00:04:50.750> I<00:04:50.780> give<00:04:51.110> this

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
nothing good but yeah I give this

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.330 
nothing good but yeah I give this
nothing<00:04:51.500> good<00:04:51.680> there's<00:04:51.890> nothing<00:04:52.130> else<00:04:52.220> too

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
nothing good there's nothing else too

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.850 
nothing good there's nothing else too
good<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.550> say<00:04:52.730> about<00:04:52.760> it<00:04:53.150> before<00:04:54.080> 8p<00:04:54.440> camera<00:04:54.800> is

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
good to say about it before 8p camera is

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.600 
good to say about it before 8p camera is
pretty<00:04:55.220> bad<00:04:55.490> I<00:04:55.970> would<00:04:56.900> have<00:04:56.990> hope<00:04:57.170> that<00:04:57.580> such<00:04:58.580> a

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
pretty bad I would have hope that such a

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.160 
pretty bad I would have hope that such a
device<00:04:59.000> like<00:04:59.030> this<00:04:59.360> would<00:04:59.570> at<00:04:59.690> least<00:04:59.840> have<00:05:00.020> a

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
device like this would at least have a

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.470 
device like this would at least have a
720p<00:05:01.090> camera<00:05:02.090> but<00:05:02.480> ya<00:05:02.930> know<00:05:03.470> battery<00:05:03.800> life<00:05:04.040> um

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
720p camera but ya know battery life um

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.030 
720p camera but ya know battery life um
yeah<00:05:05.480> well<00:05:05.870> already<00:05:06.530> made<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:06.740> video<00:05:06.890> about

yeah well already made a video about
this<00:05:07.250> before<00:05:07.610> but<00:05:07.790> the<00:05:07.970> battery<00:05:08.330> life

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
this before but the battery life

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.200 
this before but the battery life
apparently<00:05:08.780> is<00:05:09.140> six<00:05:09.350> hours<00:05:09.710> whoo<00:05:10.340> I<00:05:10.820> made<00:05:11.180> a

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.480 
really don't think so I mean I
understand<00:05:45.770> they're<00:05:45.860> both<00:05:46.040> handheld

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
understand they're both handheld

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.520 
understand they're both handheld
consoles<00:05:47.000> but<00:05:47.150> they<00:05:47.810> kind<00:05:48.110> of<00:05:48.140> don't<00:05:48.260> aim<00:05:48.500> for

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
consoles but they kind of don't aim for

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.710 
consoles but they kind of don't aim for
the<00:05:48.800> same<00:05:48.980> target<00:05:49.400> market<00:05:49.760> I<00:05:49.880> mean<00:05:50.060> one<00:05:50.540> is<00:05:50.690> a

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
the same target market I mean one is a

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.070 
the same target market I mean one is a
3d<00:05:51.230> device<00:05:51.620> and<00:05:51.920> one<00:05:52.040> is<00:05:52.130> just<00:05:52.310> like<00:05:52.520> a<00:05:52.550> normal

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
3d device and one is just like a normal

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.130 
3d device and one is just like a normal
console<00:05:55.000> yeah<00:05:56.000> I<00:05:56.030> don't<00:05:56.570> really<00:05:56.660> consider

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
console yeah I don't really consider

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.440 
console yeah I don't really consider
them<00:05:58.130> being<00:05:58.430> in<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:58.550> same<00:05:58.760> markup<00:05:59.180> I<00:05:59.270> guess

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
them being in the same markup I guess

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.900 
them being in the same markup I guess
technically<00:06:00.080> they<00:06:00.320> are<00:06:00.410> so<00:06:01.370> yeah<00:06:01.580> we'll<00:06:01.760> see
