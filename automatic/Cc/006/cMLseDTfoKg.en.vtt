00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.510 
concerts with Adam Lambert in Europe
though<00:03:16.620> there's<00:03:17.620> some<00:03:17.830> as<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.070> sort<00:03:18.460> of

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
though there's some as a sort of

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.480 
though there's some as a sort of
experiment<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.710> think<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.070> would<00:03:21.190> be<00:03:21.280> fun

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
experiment and I think it would be fun

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.120 
experiment and I think it would be fun
but<00:03:22.210> of<00:03:22.900> course<00:03:23.140> we<00:03:23.290> won't<00:03:23.410> be<00:03:23.590> seeing<00:03:23.800> you

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
actually I mean they're calling these

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.550 
actually I mean they're calling these
things<00:04:28.210> Holograms<00:04:28.720> now<00:04:28.930> they're<00:04:29.140> not<00:04:29.320> exactly

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
things Holograms now they're not exactly

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.680

musical<00:04:37.960> show<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:39.030> we<00:04:40.030> thought<00:04:40.270> about<00:04:40.360> doing

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
musical show and we thought about doing

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.050

it<00:04:40.810> there<00:04:41.020> we<00:04:41.470> didn't<00:04:41.740> really<00:04:41.920> think<00:04:42.040> and<00:04:42.760> I

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
it there we didn't really think and I

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.370 
it there we didn't really think and I
certainly<00:04:43.300> wouldn't<00:04:43.750> want<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:44.020> appear

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
alongside er I pretend Freddie I don't

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.570 
alongside er I pretend Freddie I don't
