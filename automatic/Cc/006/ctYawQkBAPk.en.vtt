00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.009
 hello everybody, alright, blows the roger month 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.039
 we are starting today our review process for the 2010 enem 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.050
 another you can access 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.579
 this class 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.949
 on September 7 college portal 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.310
 following the given data 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.730
 c7 this point with br 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.940
 or enem 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.460
 brought a lot of news 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.460
 in the preparation of students that in the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.490
 the parents of the students 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.560
 speaker important force for us to remember today with you 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.520
 the first of them the enemy requires of every student 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.400
 of the contestant 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.460
 who will do the test with 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.260
 two important aspects 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.550
 the vision 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.980
 world 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.980
 a more critical view of things that occur 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.110
 around them and the vision of science 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.650
 which often bring a matter of luck to physical chemical biology together 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.740
 cushion 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.040
 without abandoning 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.520
 the chemistry is abandoned fitch that without abandoning biology then many times 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.440
 they are all three walking together in a personal sense 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.480
 This question is very interesting. 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.030
 Why does she approach her? 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.200
 based on skill 15 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.689
 skill 15 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.970
 interpreted by the experiments to explain at least the processes 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.819
 organisms at any level of organization of biological systems 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.380
 to explain the situation of users 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.520
 as well as the function of the microbial ages of the cell membranes lining 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.060
 the inner walls of the small intestine 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.370
 students or follows experiment 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.090
 put 200 ml of water in two containers in the first said pitt 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.330
 plunged for five seconds 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.709
 a piece of paper in this as in figure 1 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.190
 in the second container 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.120
 did the same with a piece of paper with borges 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.260
 simulating the microbes ages according to figure 2 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:18.860
 the data obtained is 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.150
 the amount of water dissolved by the waste paper was eight and a half 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.029
 while the folded paper was 12 m 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:31.779
 based on the data obtained it is inferred that the function of the micros and damages 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:32.869
 intestinal 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:36.809
 with regard to the absorption of nutrients by the cells 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.809
 of the internal walls of the intestine is his 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:41.610
 letter 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.529
 maintain the absorption volume 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:45.629
 truth 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.529
 increase the absorption surface 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:51.529
 letter c decreased the rate of absorption 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.529
 letter d increase absorption time 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:57.059
 letter R 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:00.059
 maintain selectivity in absorption 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.849
 the question brings models 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.609
 the experiments as they want 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.760
 here it shows more or less how the digestive system should work 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:11.489
 jessop remember the following 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.089
 that the digestive system 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:16.109
 it begins in the normal natural process 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.750
 in the mouth 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.829
 mt taquari will arrive in the form of a correct 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:21.919
 will arrive 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.609
 our mouth and these machines colleagues will begin to undergo a process of d 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:27.580
 management 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.770
 mechanic through mastication 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.280
 and a process of digestion kiko through thematic actions 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.950
 then the cpc is the next bo food was formed in the mouth 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.660
 these lightweight machines like this are suffering actions and magic 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.109
 and through the digestive system through a series of movements called 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.349
 that said 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.989
 this food cake begins to move 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.329
 and going toward the lower parts of the digestive system 

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:57.759
 in the specific case of interests speak of whom 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:02.339
 of the small intestine, note that the small intestine is rich in 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:03.859
 specializations 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.859
 of membranes called micro-ages 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:13.540
 these microbes cities have the function of what we had 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.729
 of our gut 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.169
 now for a little bit 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.749
 the boot lapa issue 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:19.859
 another farce question 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.699
 reference perimeter models that 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.499
 you see in figure 1 

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:29.409
 you have a double sheet on the scoreless island in figure 2 you have an account in 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.020
 site a sheet with bags 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.020
 orangutans are immersed in containers 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.979
 during the same time the same volume of water 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.499
 the clip made with similar conditions why 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:43.770
 what is expected 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.129
 in the first moment that absorption is what the same term but the forces 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.120
 paulista equal size 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.340
 technically 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.919
 but you notice that it clears with balls 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.979
 she absorbs simpler of the matter speaks speaks of it speaks that welcomes with 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:58.879
 borges 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:02.269
 the dssopt 12mm of water in contrast 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:04.509
 the high figure 1 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.729
 in which the revelry who only knew 8 ml of water okay 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.740
 good similar to what happens with the digestive system 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.430
 the histories of the intestinal mucosa to called micael speeds also 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.430
 increase the area of ​​absorption 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:25.409
 skill 15 used verba to interpret that interprets the model and that is what 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:26.570
 you're doing 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.120
 it was proposed modern 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.749
 absorption 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:32.580
 so you can explain 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.050
 what happens 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.199
 in the natural that happens in your body specifically in the small intestine 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.250
 and you note that from the interpretation of this model 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.430
 You can get there. 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.430
 to an explanation of what is right in reality 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.830
 so she 15 skill what is that of you 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.009
 to interpret 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.460
 reasons to explain phenomena 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.500
 given to sports a day are as a whole as well as intestinal absorption are 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.039
 biological phenomena 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.050
 and apart 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.539
 this interpretation you can therefore 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:11.229
 explain what the cut is in your scientific organism 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.400
 delay then 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.400
 do not understand 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.839
 and asks for peace are interferences of the talks until now 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:30.869
 the paper as poor he would increase what 

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:32.120
 absorbing 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.169
 the resemblance to what happens 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.379
 there in your gut 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:39.379
 therefore correct item people is understand 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:43.389
 remembers that I spoke in the little about the critical worldview 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:47.479
 Can we bring this to one reality, but the next one? 

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:51.300
 have seen celiac disease 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.889
 already went to buy a 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:54.199
 1 food 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:58.169
 that contained in your vote contains gluten or does not contain gluten 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.250
 anyone who has celiac disease should avoid the foods that contain the bo group 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.250
 b will consist of a series that 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.550
 that will trigger your immune system 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.479
 I will act in the team has been the cattle diminishing the action to sportive 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.990
 determined by micro cities 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.479
 which will make it difficult then the distortion that I mentioned in the 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:26.270
 few 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.619
 so attention 

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:29.740
 Who has gone next? 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.639
 remember if 

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:34.860
 you should not eat foods that contain the gluten element ok 

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:37.729
 the hug 

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:42.339
 I did not forget wtcc rugged japanese handle being compact powder 

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:43.159
 br 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:45.160
 to save yourself watch 

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.290
 and prepares forwards
