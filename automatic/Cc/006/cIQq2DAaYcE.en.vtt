far<00:02:24.659> as<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.440> mouse<00:02:25.769> goes<00:02:26.129> in<00:02:26.459> terms<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.940> good

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
far as this mouse goes in terms of good

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.160 
far as this mouse goes in terms of good
points<00:02:27.680> because<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.950> cord<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.909> very<00:02:30.329> I<00:02:30.750> don't

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
points because the cord is very I don't

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.460 
points because the cord is very I don't
know<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.440> think<00:02:31.680> it's<00:02:31.799> very<00:02:31.890> weak<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.290> little<00:02:34.290> I

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
know I think it's very weak and little I

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.770 
know I think it's very weak and little I
mean<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.549> could<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.940> mean<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.329> I<00:02:36.360> don't<00:02:36.659> really

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
mean I could I mean I I don't really

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.220 
mean I could I mean I I don't really
care<00:02:37.140> because<00:02:37.379> on<00:02:38.480> I'm<00:02:39.480> not<00:02:39.720> really<00:02:39.900> taking

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
care because on I'm not really taking

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.839 
care because on I'm not really taking
this<00:02:40.470> mouse<00:02:40.739> anywhere<00:02:41.250> but<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:41.519> you'll<00:02:41.640> take

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
this mouse anywhere but if you'll take

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.940 
this mouse anywhere but if you'll take
to<00:02:42.120> learn<00:02:42.269> events<00:02:42.780> or<00:02:42.930> if<00:02:43.049> you<00:02:43.170> had<00:02:43.319> animals<00:02:43.799> in

the house this any scored could easily

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.970 
the house this any scored could easily
get<00:02:46.859> ripped<00:02:47.190> or<00:02:47.900> busted<00:02:48.900> by<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.079> cat's<00:02:49.500> teeth

or something you know but another the
second<00:02:54.299> bad<00:02:54.510> point<00:02:54.930> about<00:02:55.109> this<00:02:55.260> mouse<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.590> I

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
second bad point about this mouse is I

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.289 
second bad point about this mouse is I
mean<00:02:56.190> it's<00:02:57.799> so<00:02:58.799> light<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.579> mean<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.790> pick<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.150> up

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
mean it's so light I mean I pick it up

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.020 
mean it's so light I mean I pick it up
it's<00:03:00.780> like<00:03:01.049> it<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:02.069> lightest<00:03:02.489> mouse<00:03:02.730> I've

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
it's like it is the lightest mouse I've

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.670 
it's like it is the lightest mouse I've
ever<00:03:03.269> held<00:03:03.629> it<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.859> just<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.310> light<00:03:06.560> like<00:03:07.560> I

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
ever held it is just so light like I

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.069 
ever held it is just so light like I
move<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:08.040> around<00:03:08.159> it<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.120> just<00:03:09.299> light<00:03:09.659> and

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
move it around it it is just light and

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.410 
move it around it it is just light and
see<00:03:11.040> for<00:03:11.220> me<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.400> think<00:03:11.819> that's<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.030> little<00:03:12.120> bit

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
see for me I think that's a little bit

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.990 
see for me I think that's a little bit
of<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.569> bad<00:03:12.780> point<00:03:13.109> because<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.500> mean<00:03:13.819> here's<00:03:14.819> my

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
of a bad point because I mean here's my

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.900 
of a bad point because I mean here's my
hand<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.450> just<00:03:15.799> feels<00:03:16.799> like<00:03:17.040> I'm<00:03:17.250> moving<00:03:17.459> air

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
hand it just feels like I'm moving air

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.699 
hand it just feels like I'm moving air
you<00:03:18.299> know<00:03:18.450> like<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:19.019> doesn't<00:03:19.169> even<00:03:19.319> feel<00:03:19.650> like

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
you know like it doesn't even feel like

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.210 
you know like it doesn't even feel like
I'm<00:03:20.040> holding<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.819> mouse<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.450> know<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:22.739> kind

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
I'm holding a mouse you know so I kind

I'm holding a mouse you know so I kind
of<00:03:23.340> I'd<00:03:23.700> prefer<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.569> raise<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:25.019> did<00:03:25.200> put<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.470> bit

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
of I'd prefer if raise it did put a bit

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.729 
of I'd prefer if raise it did put a bit
of<00:03:26.120> weight<00:03:27.120> in<00:03:27.359> this<00:03:27.569> mouse<00:03:27.870> maybe<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.620> know

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
of weight in this mouse maybe you know

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.780 
of weight in this mouse maybe you know
cuz<00:03:29.519> i<00:03:29.609> did<00:03:29.819> way<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.389> did<00:03:31.379> way<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.799> on<00:03:31.919> my<00:03:32.129> scales

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
cuz i did way I did way it on my scales

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.280 
cuz i did way I did way it on my scales
and<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:34.049> came<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.500> about<00:03:34.620> sixty<00:03:35.310> six<00:03:35.609> grams<00:03:36.290> it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
and it came to about sixty six grams it

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.509 
and it came to about sixty six grams it
is<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.500> light<00:03:37.859> little<00:03:38.099> boy<00:03:38.519> this<00:03:39.120> mess<00:03:39.389> and<00:03:40.160> um<00:03:41.160> I

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
is a light little boy this mess and um I

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.970 
is a light little boy this mess and um I
guess<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.180> another<00:03:42.660> bad<00:03:42.959> point<00:03:43.379> about<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.739> is

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
guess the another bad point about it is

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.089 
guess the another bad point about it is
the<00:03:44.250> clicking<00:03:44.849> is<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.959> clicking<00:03:46.379> itself<00:03:46.859> when

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
the clicking is the clicking itself when

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.550 
the clicking is the clicking itself when
you<00:03:47.190> click<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.579> buttons<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.239> kind<00:03:49.169> of<00:03:49.290> feels

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
you click the buttons it kind of feels

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.150 
you click the buttons it kind of feels
like<00:03:49.829> a<00:03:49.889> cushy<00:03:50.310> click<00:03:51.829> like<00:03:52.829> if<00:03:53.010> you're

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
like a cushy click like if you're

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.180 
like a cushy click like if you're
clicking<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.639> buttons<00:03:54.000> they<00:03:54.709> kind<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.859> feel

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
clicking the buttons they kind of feel

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.089 
clicking the buttons they kind of feel
like<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.430> cushy<00:03:56.940> click<00:03:57.389> here<00:03:57.720> I'm<00:03:57.989> not<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.799> can't

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
like a cushy click here I'm not I can't

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.949 
like a cushy click here I'm not I can't
say<00:03:59.310> I'm<00:03:59.459> not<00:03:59.579> probably<00:04:00.000> not<00:04:00.090> not<00:04:00.569> much<00:04:00.720> of<00:04:00.900> a

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
say I'm not probably not not much of a

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.050 
say I'm not probably not not much of a
fan<00:04:01.260> of<00:04:01.319> it<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:02.480> yeah<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.930> preferred<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:05.099> guess

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
fan of it so yeah I preferred I guess

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.860 
fan of it so yeah I preferred I guess
Logitech's<00:04:06.840> click<00:04:07.230> or<00:04:08.449> Microsoft's<00:04:09.449> click<00:04:09.720> as

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
Logitech's click or Microsoft's click as

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.870 
Logitech's click or Microsoft's click as
opposed<00:04:10.169> to<00:04:10.470> razors<00:04:10.889> click<00:04:11.190> so

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
opposed to razors click so

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.900 
opposed to razors click so
that's<00:04:13.570> um<00:04:13.930> that's<00:04:14.380> about<00:04:15.100> it<00:04:15.130> for<00:04:15.340> this<00:04:15.610> mouse

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
that's um that's about it for this mouse

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.300 
that's um that's about it for this mouse
but<00:04:16.360> I<00:04:16.390> guess<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.930> last<00:04:17.140> thing<00:04:17.350> is<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.680> I

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
but I guess the last thing is the I

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.670 
but I guess the last thing is the I
guess<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.150> hold<00:04:19.450> it<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:19.840> kind<00:04:20.200> of<00:04:20.320> I<00:04:20.590> don't

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
guess you hold it and it kind of I don't

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.680 
guess you hold it and it kind of I don't
know<00:04:20.890> like<00:04:20.980> if<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.489> build<00:04:22.090> quality<00:04:22.360> is

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
know like if the the build quality is

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.380 
know like if the the build quality is
good<00:04:23.020> but<00:04:23.260> kind<00:04:23.740> of<00:04:23.860> feels<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.370> bit<00:04:24.490> cheap<00:04:25.120> i

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
good but kind of feels a bit cheap i

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.350 
good but kind of feels a bit cheap i
guess<00:04:25.750> like<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:27.130> can<00:04:27.280> see<00:04:27.490> where<00:04:27.700> razor<00:04:27.970> makes

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
guess like you can see where razor makes

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.990 
guess like you can see where razor makes
their<00:04:28.630> money<00:04:28.840> out<00:04:28.930> of<00:04:29.050> this<00:04:29.230> mouse<00:04:29.530> i<00:04:29.800> mean<00:04:30.010> it

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
their money out of this mouse i mean it

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.860 
their money out of this mouse i mean it
just<00:04:31.180> kind<00:04:31.750> of<00:04:31.840> feels<00:04:32.050> like<00:04:32.320> it's<00:04:32.530> cheap<00:04:32.890> so<00:04:33.580> i

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
just kind of feels like it's cheap so i

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.650 
just kind of feels like it's cheap so i
don't<00:04:34.870> know<00:04:34.960> but<00:04:35.230> yeah<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.620> i<00:04:35.650> mean<00:04:36.300> it's<00:04:37.300> got

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
don't know but yeah the i mean it's got

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.270 
don't know but yeah the i mean it's got
what<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:37.930> need<00:04:38.140> if<00:04:38.350> you're<00:04:38.890> definitely

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
what you need if you're definitely

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.700 
what you need if you're definitely
looking<00:04:39.820> for<00:04:40.150> an<00:04:40.240> upgrade<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:41.020> is<00:04:41.230> good<00:04:41.470> it<00:04:41.680> is

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
looking for an upgrade it is good it is

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.070 
looking for an upgrade it is good it is
a<00:04:41.830> good<00:04:42.040> mouse<00:04:42.250> i<00:04:42.520> would<00:04:42.700> i<00:04:42.940> would<00:04:43.360> recommend

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
a good mouse i would i would recommend

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.330 
a good mouse i would i would recommend
it<00:04:44.230> but<00:04:44.560> i'd<00:04:45.310> probably<00:04:45.880> say<00:04:46.320> for<00:04:47.320> me<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.680> g3<00:04:48.310> is

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
it but i'd probably say for me the g3 is

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.490 
it but i'd probably say for me the g3 is
better<00:04:48.730> than<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.060> razor<00:04:49.300> and<00:04:49.660> so<00:04:50.230> i'll<00:04:50.350> do

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
better than the razor and so i'll do

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.320 
better than the razor and so i'll do
another<00:04:50.530> review<00:04:51.190> after<00:04:51.310> this<00:04:51.610> comparing<00:04:52.210> the

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
another review after this comparing the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.190 
another review after this comparing the
razor<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.290> g3<00:04:53.920> but<00:04:54.190> basically<00:04:55.090> yeah<00:04:55.390> if

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
razor and the g3 but basically yeah if

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.870 
razor and the g3 but basically yeah if
they<00:04:56.440> added<00:04:56.740> a<00:04:56.830> bit<00:04:56.980> more<00:04:57.040> weight<00:04:57.460> to<00:04:57.520> this

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
they added a bit more weight to this

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.230 
they added a bit more weight to this
mouse<00:04:58.180> it'd<00:04:58.480> be<00:04:59.200> really<00:04:59.380> good<00:04:59.820> if<00:05:00.820> I<00:05:01.000> think

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
mouse it'd be really good if I think

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.640 
mouse it'd be really good if I think
that's<00:05:01.420> the<00:05:01.570> biggest<00:05:01.750> thing<00:05:01.990> is<00:05:02.200> it's<00:05:02.380> just

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
that's the biggest thing is it's just

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.200 
that's the biggest thing is it's just
too<00:05:02.980> light<00:05:03.280> so<00:05:04.830> um<00:05:05.830> yeah<00:05:06.520> that's<00:05:06.880> about<00:05:07.180> it

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
too light so um yeah that's about it

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.160 
too light so um yeah that's about it
guys<00:05:07.390> so<00:05:08.020> I<00:05:09.390> can't<00:05:10.390> think<00:05:10.540> of<00:05:10.660> anything<00:05:10.900> else

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
guys so I can't think of anything else

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.700 
guys so I can't think of anything else
to<00:05:11.470> say<00:05:11.740> it's<00:05:12.220> it's<00:05:12.640> a<00:05:12.790> good<00:05:12.970> Mouse<00:05:13.180> it's<00:05:13.710> but

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
to say it's it's a good Mouse it's but

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.580 
to say it's it's a good Mouse it's but
it's<00:05:14.860> just<00:05:15.040> too<00:05:15.130> light<00:05:15.460> so<00:05:15.490> I<00:05:16.150> don't<00:05:17.110> think<00:05:17.320> um

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
it's just too light so I don't think um

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.000 
it's just too light so I don't think um
