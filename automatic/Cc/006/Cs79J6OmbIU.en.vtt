they<00:02:18.360> touch<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.870> they<00:02:19.050> would<00:02:19.230> push<00:02:19.769> dump<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
they touch it they would push dump the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.030 
they touch it they would push dump the
barrels<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.510> they<00:02:21.989> also<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.470> little<00:02:22.680> car

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
barrels and they also have a little car

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.699 
barrels and they also have a little car
that<00:02:23.850> tripped<00:02:24.239> off<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.780> side<00:02:25.080> when<00:02:25.590> they

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
that tripped off of the side when they

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.280 
that tripped off of the side when they
did<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.060> they<00:02:27.209> pushed<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.959> mission

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
did that and so they pushed the mission

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.070 
did that and so they pushed the mission
of<00:02:28.350> delivering<00:02:28.560> something<00:02:29.250> into<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> water

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
of delivering something into the water

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.380 
of delivering something into the water
at<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.110> same<00:02:31.470> time<00:02:31.799> so<00:02:32.580> they<00:02:32.730> accomplished

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
at the same time so they accomplished

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.289 
at the same time so they accomplished
two<00:02:34.290> missions<00:02:34.799> you're<00:02:35.100> missing<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.700> car<00:02:36.060> was

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
two missions you're missing the car was

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.360 
two missions you're missing the car was
on<00:02:36.480> wheels<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.350> they<00:02:37.799> point<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.250> rolled<00:02:38.519> off<00:02:40.370> so

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
on wheels so they point it rolled off so

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.080 
on wheels so they point it rolled off so
that<00:02:41.700> was<00:02:42.540> pretty<00:02:42.720> good<00:02:43.760> now<00:02:44.760> I'm<00:02:44.880> going<00:02:44.970> to

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
that was pretty good now I'm going to

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:55.819 
that was pretty good now I'm going to
take<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.209> whole<00:02:45.450> group<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.810> thing<00:02:46.049> some<00:02:54.829> nice

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
take a whole group of thing some nice

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.750 
take a whole group of thing some nice
delivery<00:02:56.989> they<00:02:57.989> go<00:02:58.140> fast<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.680> slow<00:02:59.070> down<00:02:59.310> very

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
delivery they go fast and slow down very

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.539 
delivery they go fast and slow down very
compact<00:03:00.359> robot<00:03:00.900> all<00:03:01.560> working<00:03:02.250> on<00:03:02.400> the

on this trigger satellite come back home

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.649 
on this trigger satellite come back home
go<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.709> other<00:04:07.769> put<00:04:08.430> their<00:04:08.579> next<00:04:08.909> adapter<00:04:09.480> on

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
go the other put their next adapter on

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.479 
go the other put their next adapter on
you'll<00:04:10.409> notice<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:10.769> there's<00:04:11.129> a<00:04:11.189> light

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
you'll notice that there's a light

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.619 
you'll notice that there's a light
sensor<00:04:11.819> here<00:04:12.269> for<00:04:13.019> sensor<00:04:13.500> right<00:04:14.299> and<00:04:15.299> they're

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
sensor here for sensor right and they're

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.080 
sensor here for sensor right and they're
going<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.810> come<00:04:16.079> out<00:04:16.320> here<00:04:16.349> is<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.340> light<00:04:17.760> sensor

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
going to come out here is a light sensor

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.319 
going to come out here is a light sensor
to<00:04:18.510> locate<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.109> edge<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:20.070> then<00:04:20.729> using<00:04:21.209> the

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
to locate the edge and then using the

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.020 
to locate the edge and then using the
light<00:04:21.510> sensor<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.109> locate<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.560> edge<00:04:22.970> we<00:04:23.970> are

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
light sensor to locate the edge we are

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.600 
light sensor to locate the edge we are
going<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.780> pick<00:04:25.320> out<00:04:25.530> all<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:26.400> these

going to pick out all of these

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.390 
going to pick out all of these
and<00:04:28.699> then<00:04:29.120> when<00:04:29.300> they<00:04:29.419> back<00:04:29.659> I<00:04:30.289> want<00:04:31.099> to<00:04:31.159> come

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
and then when they back I want to come

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.249 
and then when they back I want to come
over<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:32.000> want<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.300> check<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.539> time<00:04:32.750> on<00:04:32.780> this<00:04:33.050> so

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
over I want to check the time on this so

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.469 
over I want to check the time on this so
keep<00:04:33.409> going<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.800> again<00:04:34.150> when<00:04:35.150> they're<00:04:35.300> gonna

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
keep going and again when they're gonna

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.409 
keep going and again when they're gonna
push<00:04:35.900> it<00:04:36.110> out<00:04:36.199> on<00:04:36.349> the<00:04:36.439> table<00:04:36.520> yes<00:04:37.520> so<00:04:37.729> that<00:04:37.969> it

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
push it out on the table yes so that it

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.899 
push it out on the table yes so that it
releases<00:04:38.569> the<00:04:38.990> full<00:04:39.349> car<00:04:39.650> then<00:04:40.639> they're<00:04:40.789> going

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:40.909 
releases the full car then they're going

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:42.670 
releases the full car then they're going
to<00:04:41.000> turn<00:04:41.240> around<00:04:41.389> and<00:04:41.719> they<00:04:41.840> picked<00:04:42.199> up<00:04:42.379> all

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
to turn around and they picked up all

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.040 
to turn around and they picked up all
these<00:04:42.979> others<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:44.419> they're<00:04:44.539> going<00:04:44.689> to<00:04:44.750> drag

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
these others and they're going to drag

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.610 
these others and they're going to drag
them<00:04:45.289> back<00:04:45.669> and<00:04:46.669> be<00:04:47.509> completely<00:04:48.020> in<00:04:48.289> base<00:04:50.620> now

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
them back and be completely in base now

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.719 
them back and be completely in base now
we're<00:04:51.800> going<00:04:51.919> to<00:04:51.979> put<00:04:52.039> a<00:04:52.219> couple<00:04:52.460> more

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
we're going to put a couple more

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.700 
we're going to put a couple more
adapters<00:04:53.389> on<00:04:53.629> this<00:04:53.870> one<00:04:54.710> is<00:04:54.919> organized<00:04:55.490> shoot

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
adapters on this one is organized shoot

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.809 
adapters on this one is organized shoot
then<00:04:57.710> I<00:04:57.860> shoot<00:04:57.919> do<00:04:58.550> ya<00:05:00.189> item<00:05:01.189> that<00:05:01.370> goes<00:05:01.580> into
