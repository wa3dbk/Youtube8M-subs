 wearable and still wearable 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:07.859
 wearables from archos as many as four 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.340
 different devices 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.760

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.689
 the 2014 range and bad devices e 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:22.169
 French we lost several from 49 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:25.079
 euro for the first smartwatch landing 59 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.900
 euro for the active tracker 99 euros for it 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:30.239
 smartwatch with studen colors and 149

 euro fold the smartwatch with display 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:35.050
 curved inc we start from the first model is 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.559
 a 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.379
 the 49 euro clock then connects 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.760
 to your android device that 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.940
 allows to have notifications e 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.970
 information on the main activities 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.640
 of your apple device so it is not 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.190
 lateral interlocking touchscreen 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.750
 switch off to move in the part 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.079
 corruption corruption bra back 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.490
 very light simple but for 49 euros 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:06.810
 hard to tell whose 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.350
 the other smartwatch is instead 99 euros the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.380
 its price 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.440
 well in color in color with the possibility 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.200
 to have in applications in their own 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.510
 inside the device display 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.450
 full touchscreen access to 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.340
 notifications and the integrated android system 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.770
 then the android operating system 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.770
 obviously customized by the manufacturer 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.490
 as you can see, very simple, very nice 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.580
 Now I do not go out here to go back 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.880
 here it is possible to meet the 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.259
 music and timer alarms go to 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.180
 using the camera and oar was more there 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.680
 will be other features but to 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.770
 moment they are not present because this 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.369
 is a device worth products 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.159
 with reader 60 to charge a battery 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.780
 fairly thin and light strap 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.939
 it is not very thin however it is anyway 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.009
 light 99 euros 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.289
 perhaps the most particular product more 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.539
 obviously this is interesting 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.700
 smartwatch with curved display if you did 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.679
 at the end, here is the strap 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.379
 fits perfectly into ours 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:11.410
 wrist because the molding follows 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.750
 so it's comfortable and easy to 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.200
 read the ease even banks 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.730
 from the display and ink which then one 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.950
 technology that allows you to have one 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.380
 low readability but in all 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.540
 excellent autonomy conditions 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.709
 superior of the relative to all smart 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.599
 watch seen so far 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.640
 well this is a prototype but archos is 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.110
 also working to use it 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.180
 screen via touch and then render 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.849
 touch screen the screen in this case 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.220
 the screen but not the thatcher serve 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.970
 two side buttons to move 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.350
 within the various settings 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:52.260
 create with the active because it opens to 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.810
 the usb connector directly on the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:01.980
 outside of the display display that is 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.340
 light blue and black monochrome I answer 59 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.620
 EUR 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.000
 basically it's yours 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.300
 sport activity with the application 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.300
 Android 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.840
 sorry but I'm really sick 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:19.620
 we said pedometer information 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.890
 possible notifications and care 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.560
 very very important lightness and in 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.500
 convention on the two black one straps 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.750
 and one purple have dark on the formula 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.380
 only one given three bullfighters hdblog from 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.380
 mycological
