he are asked us to build a concept
racecar<00:00:16.020> for<00:00:16.290> them<00:00:16.610> possible<00:00:17.610> introduction

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
racecar for them possible introduction

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.260 
racecar for them possible introduction
into<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.360> race<00:00:18.600> series<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.290> 2012<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.400> they

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
into a race series in 2012 and they

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.660 
into a race series in 2012 and they
asked<00:00:21.810> us<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.050> sort<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.290> mock<00:00:22.770> up<00:00:22.950> a<00:00:23.070> car<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.490> see

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
asked us to sort of mock up a car to see

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.990 
asked us to sort of mock up a car to see
basically<00:00:24.450> see<00:00:24.660> what<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.900> would<00:00:25.050> look<00:00:25.170> like

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
basically see what it would look like

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.730 
basically see what it would look like
should<00:00:27.000> they<00:00:27.150> decide<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.779> go<00:00:27.990> racing<00:00:28.200> what<00:00:28.650> we

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
should they decide to go racing what we

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.400 
should they decide to go racing what we
did<00:00:28.919> we<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.279> took<00:00:29.400> an<00:00:29.520> ordinary<00:00:30.259> brand<00:00:31.259> new

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
did we just took an ordinary brand new

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.360 
did we just took an ordinary brand new
2011<00:00:31.740> optima<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.780> took<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.010> took<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.130> aside

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
2011 optima and took it took it aside

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.740 
2011 optima and took it took it aside
and<00:00:35.610> sort<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.850> said<00:00:36.000> ok<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.329> would<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:36.600> do

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
and sort of said ok what would we do

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.630 
and sort of said ok what would we do
typically<00:00:37.940> for<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.970> race<00:00:39.120> car<00:00:39.360> built<00:00:39.660> and

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
typically for a race car built and

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.100 
typically for a race car built and
obviously<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:41.910> would<00:00:42.090> cook<00:00:42.570> everything<00:00:42.840> off

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
obviously we would cook everything off

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.430 
obviously we would cook everything off
from<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.560> inside<00:00:44.220> to<00:00:44.250> reduce<00:00:44.820> weight<00:00:45.230> we<00:00:46.230> put

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
from the inside to reduce weight we put

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.920 
from the inside to reduce weight we put
in<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.620> custom<00:00:46.980> roll<00:00:47.430> cage<00:00:47.700> which<00:00:48.540> you<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.900> see

like a race car externally what we've

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.510 
like a race car externally what we've
done<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.000> lowered<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> car<00:01:24.659> considerably

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
done is lowered the car considerably

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
we've put on a carbon effect roof on

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.960 
we've put on a carbon effect roof on
on<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.820> top<00:01:31.030> there<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:33.310> move<00:01:33.520> around<00:01:33.670> to<00:01:33.880> the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970

to the to the thing with our wheel
partner<00:01:41.799> BBS<00:01:42.189> we<00:01:42.909> put<00:01:43.149> on<00:01:43.270> some<00:01:44.200> race<00:01:44.710> slicks

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
partner BBS we put on some race slicks

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.520 
partner BBS we put on some race slicks
and<00:01:45.570> we'll<00:01:46.570> come<00:01:46.720> around<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:47.140> back<00:01:47.289> here

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
and we'll come around to the back here

and we'll come around to the back here
would<00:01:47.710> come<00:01:47.890> up<00:01:47.979> with<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.159> our<00:01:48.549> own<00:01:48.670> design<00:01:49.030> for

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
would come up with a our own design for

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.529 
would come up with a our own design for
interpreting<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.100> turbo<00:01:51.580> model<00:01:51.909> itself<00:01:52.210> so

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
interpreting the turbo model itself so

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.219 
interpreting the turbo model itself so
the<00:01:52.750> turbo<00:01:53.380> GDI<00:01:53.590> logo<00:01:54.490> is<00:01:55.329> a<00:01:55.390> more<00:01:55.630> for<00:01:55.869> some<00:01:56.110> of

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
the turbo GDI logo is a more for some of

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.620 
the turbo GDI logo is a more for some of
their<00:01:56.409> text<00:01:57.220> and<00:01:57.399> together<00:01:57.640> with<00:01:57.939> our<00:01:57.970> kinetic

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
their text and together with our kinetic

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.300 
their text and together with our kinetic
swoosh<00:01:59.020> trying<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.799> combine<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.100> two

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
swoosh trying to combine the two

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.210 
swoosh trying to combine the two
elements<00:02:01.140> we've<00:02:02.140> taken<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.560> number<00:02:02.770> 10<00:02:02.979> and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
elements we've taken the number 10 and

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.389 
elements we've taken the number 10 and
repeated<00:02:04.179> that<00:02:04.299> design<00:02:04.709> number<00:02:05.709> 10<00:02:05.890> basically

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
repeated that design number 10 basically

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.130 
repeated that design number 10 basically
is<00:02:06.549> what<00:02:06.580> we<00:02:06.880> run<00:02:07.060> with<00:02:07.240> on<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.569> coupes<00:02:07.899> as

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
is what we run with on the coupes as

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.080 
is what we run with on the coupes as
well<00:02:08.319> and<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:08.679> is<00:02:09.250> meant<00:02:09.489> to<00:02:09.549> signify<00:02:09.910> the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
well and it is meant to signify the

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.910 
well and it is meant to signify the
10-year<00:02:10.600> warranty<00:02:10.780> that<00:02:11.200> here<00:02:11.440> is<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:11.709> famous

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
10-year warranty that here is so famous

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.729 
10-year warranty that here is so famous
for<00:02:12.100> so<00:02:13.060> we<00:02:13.209> try<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.420> repeat<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.290> numbering

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
for so we try to repeat that numbering

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.559 
for so we try to repeat that numbering
and<00:02:15.280> if<00:02:15.430> we<00:02:15.580> come<00:02:15.760> down<00:02:15.970> here<00:02:16.030> we're<00:02:16.540> looking

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
and if we come down here we're looking

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.220 
and if we come down here we're looking
at<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.080> rear<00:02:17.319> diffuser<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:19.390> custom<00:02:20.110> exhaust

at the rear diffuser and custom exhaust

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.640 
at the rear diffuser and custom exhaust
