 he came back with a suitcase 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.979
 despite its name American football is closer to rugby the field 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.280
 we have almost the same dimensions 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.110
 players are obliged to have special equipment for mouthguards 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.110

 the ministries we quickly understand why such precautions are 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.550
 required 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.230
 American football being a very encouraging contact sport for 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.680
 the other teams must not be neglected
