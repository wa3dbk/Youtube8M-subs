00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.890
 let's do the art 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.320
 expectations but I think that of the two 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.570
 a little bit of a little less 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:32.270
 I liked that these jessica spirits 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.270
 that they will teach us 33 different ones not 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.270
 112 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:43.649
 here in your image in this case we are going to 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.930
 use a base in white tone first 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.409
 I can use other's base with those of 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.079
 another light color better I will not lie 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:54.539
 I will continue this exactly not what 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.729
 apply excess product ok for 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.729
 achieve that same tc that perfectly 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.120
 the time to my first layer 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.360
 and this third truly that the most 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.979
 is the black glossy friends with black 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.979
 mate and tobin 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.420
 you already did it 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.670
 Obviously whoever copied it did not 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.100
 have you ever done but who 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.590
 days 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.009
 because it will be so that black because because 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.380
 I'm applying I'm not applying very 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.810
 little product so it does not look like 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.610
 they say thick dough and it does not take long 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.880
 dry with my second layer I will cover 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.880
 perfectly 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.380
 because put like this instead of putting it like that 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.380
 this animal is interesting 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.430
 father makes me these three colors 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.810
 to start with our design 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:14.540
 We are going to use a piece of aluminum 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.519
 and we are going to add 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.310
 a little bit of the tone that we're going to use 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.290
 with the brush this amount is reached 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.959
 perfectly about 5 minutes 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.620
 let's hunt vertical lines first 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:30.760
 you're going to do the little tip on the 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.760
 same domain that we have excess 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.730
 we draw a totally vertical life 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.739
 to a horizontal line 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.410
 you are in the grid h 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.170
 very good very well 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.040
 some top delegate caritas 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.530
 one we have excess 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.730
 already here as little things, if you do not have 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.000
 the material is canijo 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.000
 total than from a medium 2 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:23.159
 here on all corners you can 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.159
 mark let's say if half 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.090
 already with a hundred 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.750
 this is my favorite of the world life 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.180
 we take a little bit of enamel we try 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.930
 freehand because here we can not 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.930
 delineate what 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.620
 I will not have to be 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.620
 More thin I know I was wrong 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:17.290
 you can mark it I said a little more 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.290
 easy more right you can do it 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.800
 to those you attend to leave as yes 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.800
 this presence 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.259
 Now with these tips and what 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.389
 they can do are thousands of things already 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.460
 it depends on the colors of what you 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.009
 have but to see that at home 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.000
