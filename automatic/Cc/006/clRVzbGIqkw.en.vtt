a level or from rise of the eldrazi when
it<00:01:00.600> gets<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> 7<00:01:01.379> level<00:01:01.680> counters<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.280> can

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
it gets up to 7 level counters you can

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.840 
it gets up to 7 level counters you can
take<00:01:02.670> an<00:01:02.820> extra<00:01:03.149> turn<00:01:03.359> after<00:01:04.460> at<00:01:05.460> the

take an extra turn after at the
beginning<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.210> each<00:01:06.360> ms<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> end<00:01:06.960> step<00:01:07.640> so

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
beginning of each ms the end step so

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.200 
beginning of each ms the end step so
basically<00:01:11.490> at<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> end<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.000> turn<00:01:12.180> you

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
a network rolex it better the only

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.370 
a network rolex it better the only
disadvantage<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.210> 13<00:01:18.720> turns

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
disadvantage is is that it's a 13 turns

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.160 
disadvantage is is that it's a 13 turns
into<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.650> 24<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:20.430> goes<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.850> 35<00:01:21.330> it's

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
into a 24 and then goes to a 35 it's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.770 
into a 24 and then goes to a 35 it's
very<00:01:22.409> vulnerable<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> bolt<00:01:23.670> or<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.570> be

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
very vulnerable to a bolt or can be

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.940

removed<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.979> doom<00:01:26.189> blade<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.880> it's

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
removed with doom blade so it's

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.300 
removed with doom blade so it's

high-risk high-return the next card is a

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.230 
high-risk high-return the next card is a
frost<00:01:32.820> titan<00:01:33.180> from<00:01:33.930> m<00:01:34.380> 11<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.060> for

gets the high-value artifact cards which

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.940 
gets the high-value artifact cards which
is<00:02:30.900> good<00:02:31.079> for<00:02:31.109> getting<00:02:31.349> blight<00:02:31.680> steel

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
is good for getting blight steel

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.069 
is good for getting blight steel
Colossus<00:02:32.519> or<00:02:32.730> throat<00:02:33.329> dear<00:02:33.510> assembly<00:02:33.900> and

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
already seen I have one blight steel

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.619 
already seen I have one blight steel
Colossus<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.069> is<00:02:50.370> obvious<00:02:50.849> for<00:02:51.359> getting

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
Colossus this is obvious for getting

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.009 
Colossus this is obvious for getting
stuff<00:02:51.840> out<00:02:52.019> it's<00:02:52.409> because<00:02:52.859> it's<00:02:53.750> well<00:02:54.750> wait<00:02:54.989> a

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
stuff out it's because it's well wait a

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.119 
stuff out it's because it's well wait a
minute<00:02:55.230> what<00:02:55.349> in<00:02:55.439> the<00:02:55.500> hell<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:55.769> just<00:02:55.980> said

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
minute what in the hell that I just said

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.059 
minute what in the hell that I just said
yeah<00:02:56.540> it's<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.810> trampled<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.319> in<00:02:58.439> fact<00:02:58.709> and

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
yeah it's the trampled and in fact and

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.699 
yeah it's the trampled and in fact and
it's<00:02:59.340> indestructible<00:02:59.669> so<00:03:00.060> it's<00:03:00.209> awesome<00:03:00.510> I

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
it's indestructible so it's awesome I

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.759 
it's indestructible so it's awesome I
have<00:03:01.709> three<00:03:01.949> culled<00:03:02.280> out<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.579> forge<00:03:02.819> master

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
have three culled out the forge master

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.550 
have three culled out the forge master
for<00:03:04.769> getting<00:03:05.540> for<00:03:06.540> sacrificing<00:03:07.109> artifacts

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
for getting for sacrificing artifacts

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.409 
for getting for sacrificing artifacts
and<00:03:07.799> then<00:03:08.159> getting<00:03:08.400> blight<00:03:08.730> still<00:03:08.969> Colossus

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
and then getting blight still Colossus

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.580 
and then getting blight still Colossus
out<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.680> if<00:03:10.949> I<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.189> a<00:03:11.219> softer<00:03:11.699> assembly<00:03:12.150> and

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
out so if I have a softer assembly and

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.349 
out so if I have a softer assembly and
chem<00:03:13.609> combination<00:03:14.609> with<00:03:14.760> semblance<00:03:15.180> anvil

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
chem combination with semblance anvil

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.899 
chem combination with semblance anvil
which<00:03:15.689> takes<00:03:15.930> three<00:03:16.199> I<00:03:16.230> could<00:03:16.439> have<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.949> turn

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
which takes three I could have a turn

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.499 
which takes three I could have a turn
for<00:03:18.359> dropped<00:03:18.900> or<00:03:19.049> assembly<00:03:19.639> if<00:03:20.639> you<00:03:21.269> know<00:03:21.359> it

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:21.509 
for dropped or assembly if you know it

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:24.259 
for dropped or assembly if you know it
goes<00:03:21.720> well<00:03:22.519> turn<00:03:23.519> four<00:03:23.790> thruster<00:03:24.180> assembly

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
goes well turn four thruster assembly

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.729 
goes well turn four thruster assembly
turn<00:03:25.099> forth<00:03:26.099> Ford<00:03:26.549> master<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.259> I<00:03:28.259> could<00:03:28.560> just

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
turn forth Ford master and I could just

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.849 
turn forth Ford master and I could just
be<00:03:28.919> turned<00:03:29.459> five<00:03:29.699> I<00:03:29.729> have<00:03:29.970> Bly<00:03:30.150> still<00:03:30.389> Colossus

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
be turned five I have Bly still Colossus

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.039 
be turned five I have Bly still Colossus
so<00:03:31.859> they're<00:03:32.009> awesome<00:03:32.159> and<00:03:32.549> of<00:03:33.180> course<00:03:33.209> the
