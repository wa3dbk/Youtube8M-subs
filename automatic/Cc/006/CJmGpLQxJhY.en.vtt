00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
is it's very easy to put the media in

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.119 
is it's very easy to put the media in
and<00:00:36.180> now<00:00:36.590> clean<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:38.610> re<00:00:38.910> priming<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:40.129> it's

if I were going for a canister filter

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.490 
if I were going for a canister filter
again<00:00:49.610> probably<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.570> probably<00:00:52.320> not

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
again probably not do that probably not

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.189 
again probably not do that probably not

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
buy one of these again just something to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.119 
buy one of these again just something to
bear<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.620> mind<00:00:57.410> then<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.710> air<00:00:58.859> pump

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
bear in mind then on to the air pump

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.270 
bear in mind then on to the air pump
it's<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.879> basic<00:01:00.239> bog<00:01:00.870> standard<00:01:01.079> dual<00:01:01.920> port

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
heater that chemists standard with it

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.399 
heater that chemists standard with it
sank<00:01:22.549> just<00:01:23.549> use<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.850> now<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.140> heat<00:01:25.140> not<00:01:25.320> be

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
sank just use that now for heat not be

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.590 
sank just use that now for heat not be
wok<00:01:25.619> before<00:01:25.830> applying<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> tank<00:01:27.000> so

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
can see it is the hallux media which is

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.840 
can see it is the hallux media which is
just<00:01:47.500> put<00:01:47.650> it<00:01:47.710> alongside<00:01:49.290> UK<00:01:50.290> pound<00:01:50.560> coin<00:01:50.920> just

also the almond leaf that's great for

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.430 
also the almond leaf that's great for
you<00:02:41.680> pH<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.640> also<00:02:43.030> for<00:02:43.720> breeding<00:02:44.080> or<00:02:44.290> your

you pH and also for breeding or your
fish<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:47.190> something<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.280> do<00:02:48.370> with<00:02:48.489> the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
fish it's something to do with the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.520 
fish it's something to do with the
qualities<00:02:49.270> on<00:02:49.420> me<00:02:49.510> help<00:02:49.780> protect<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.860> eggs

I'm feeding on not got the frozen food
out<00:03:25.600> everybody<00:03:26.020> knows<00:03:26.230> what<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.620> I'm

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890

just using brine shrimp and frozen

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.690 
just using brine shrimp and frozen
bloodworm<00:03:30.310> but<00:03:31.120> I've<00:03:31.840> got<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.170> Hikari<00:03:32.800> micro

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
bloodworm but I've got the Hikari micro

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.240 
bloodworm but I've got the Hikari micro
pellets<00:03:35.160> for<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.250> tetris<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.930> also<00:03:38.769> the

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
pellets for the tetris but also the

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.509 
pellets for the tetris but also the
angelfish<00:03:39.790> all<00:03:40.030> of<00:03:40.180> these<00:03:40.390> go<00:03:41.080> mad<00:03:41.380> from<00:03:41.650> great

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
angelfish all of these go mad from great

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.800 
angelfish all of these go mad from great
protein<00:03:43.120> content<00:03:43.569> I<00:03:43.720> think<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.110> like<00:03:44.290> 45%

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
protein content I think so like 45%

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.380 
protein content I think so like 45%
I've<00:03:46.810> just<00:03:46.930> got<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.430> standard<00:03:48.430> flight<00:03:48.730> well

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
I've just got a standard flight well

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.449 
I've just got a standard flight well
that's<00:03:49.569> about<00:03:49.750> 35<00:03:50.319> percent<00:03:50.470> protein<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:52.510> I

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
that's about 35 percent protein so I

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.500 
that's about 35 percent protein so I
don't<00:03:54.459> know<00:03:54.519> if<00:03:54.610> you<00:03:54.700> could<00:03:54.850> see<00:03:54.970> that<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.360> don't

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
don't know if you could see that I don't

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.790 
don't know if you could see that I don't
think<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:55.840> can<00:03:56.190> yeah<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:58.720> then<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:59.110> drop<00:03:59.590> a

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
think you can yeah and then I drop a

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.460 
think you can yeah and then I drop a
couple<00:04:00.040> of<00:04:00.459> catfish<00:04:01.060> pellets<00:04:01.239> in<00:04:01.570> only<00:04:02.200> put

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470
