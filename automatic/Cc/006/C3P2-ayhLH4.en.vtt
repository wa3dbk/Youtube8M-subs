00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 We have come from television, 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.160
 and that some of the broadcasts are not compatible with the TV 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.600
 We found on TV that we were not prepared as we wanted. 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.080
 It's also a new form of communication and new audiovisual 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.600
 language testing. 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.360
 This does not happen on the Internet; you can search and test new communication tools ... 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.720
 If you say something, and it does not matter to anyone, then you did not say anything. 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.200
 Or hurt someone while creating new content 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.120
 you should not be afraid to irritate. 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.440
 Just create it, my dear. Then you have your own audience, that is, to you 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.880
 joiners and non-joiners. 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.240
 When you want to say something, 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.080
 who wants to hear you somewhere, and think the same way 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.160
 or someone who has the same interest as you ... 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.600
 I am Mexican 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.320
 I am Polish 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.920
 Romanian 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.720
 Guinea 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.360
 Brazilian 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.880
 Chilean 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.720
 South African 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.160
 I am Spanish 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.120
 Colombian 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.280
 We started! 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.840
 Ala! 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.440
 Usually when you work with a brand, you have guides and more 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.400
 give, 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.640
 and tell you that you want to see it. 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.360
 Just be a little creative. 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.080
 In this regard, the invitation was very different. Goal machine 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.440
 to try it in any way that came to mind. 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.520
 It's the most exotic, most unthinkable 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.120
 try it out 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.160
 The idea was to show that the car could compete with anything you imagined. 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.600
 Such a broad perspective 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.240
 our job was very interesting, 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.280
 because we are really inaccurate ideas 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.600
 and that was one of them. 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.400
 This test was carried out under controlled conditions. Do not try to play tennis on a moving car.
