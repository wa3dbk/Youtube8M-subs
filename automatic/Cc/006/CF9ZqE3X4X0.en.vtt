00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 the 2014 target and mine governance through 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.460
 of the Secretary of State for the Environment 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:13.590
 sustainable development 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.679
 expedition swimming condel by the river of 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.679
 old 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.870
 The mountain range of the lode changes very 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.809
 natural beauties our flora is of a 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.180
 so there are more than 200 species 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.250
 per square meter for we have several 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.080
 species of endemic plants 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.930
 We have a very rich fauna too. 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.490
 is to our mountain ranges is a part of the 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.280
 of the ridge was formed by 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.340
 several waterfalls that these waterfalls 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.860
 they come together are some of them 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.320
 the other one in the river 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.490
 mbokani and has several streams and also 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.280
 which are tributaries 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.729
 these two together form a vine and then the 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.770
 river to the old river are in 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.009
 average 350 km 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.170
 is a very beautiful river and nowadays 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.229
 returned enough fish in this part of 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.050
 that formerly disappeared fish 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.940
 for the issue also of deforestation 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.000
 of the riparian forest of the fisheries issue 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.250
 I have already been able to observe the 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.960
 back of the London fish I found 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.509
 The day I was very happy. 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.060
 the importance of our rice class 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.179
 special is this here on the banks have 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.619
 haste in conservation areas 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:07.220
 both on the one hand and the 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.709
 another that is does not have mining 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.930
 buildings can not be included 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.450
 none of that much water for their 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.280
 image is fully preserved 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.569
 the difference between the special class for 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.150
 other exactly this 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.370
 of course even in the clash there with a project 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.760
 exists a deputy who tries to draw 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.610
 of the tributaries of the river cipó the quality né 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.680
 of a special cacao river that people 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.650
 is in the struggle for this project to be 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.400
 approved this project of qualification 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.239
 net of the river bank and its 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.400
 tributaries 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.800
 is common and is a preservation area 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.020
 permanence is a great absurdity because 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.629
 we all here the majority of people who 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.190
 Here live the neighboring nation of the park. 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.900
 bedroom window neighbor 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.599
 most people live within the 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.730
 water and thank god the community more 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.140
 once a tone comes at school and spoke 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.060
 we do not want this 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.760
 we want our waters preserved in 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.040
 that we 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.709
 sweet river we have a very great privilege 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.390
 great that we have a river 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.819
 A healthy river has a lot of wealth 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.989
 breath to help the other river 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.450
 We have to have a very close look. 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.220
 especially for the preservation of 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.069
 The population here needs to be attentive. 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.200
 for is struggling to preserve for 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.720
 and also the people who come from 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.900
 outside this awareness of the importance of 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.670
 not only see here as a tourist focus but the 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.640
 focus of research 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.530
 for the preservation of biomes 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.500
 important that there is only here in our 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.720
 and the people here working with 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.010
 preservation of nature and is 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.720
 precisely because we do not want to 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.000
 This will end, I think it 's right to 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.010
 the place of renewal of several others 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.680
 age and nowadays without the sling she is 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.260
 on the historic path as soon as we 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.849
 native us acs community by our 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.639
 school can not miss this moment 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.829
 every moment that the natives to the community 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.989
 this hypothesis this awareness that there is 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.239
 It's our job that we have to take care of. 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.910
 of the party can be careful with the 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.169
 smell of the river of our diversity 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.510
 cultural 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.250
 I think it's the time for school people. 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.260
 he understands this to see that the 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.900
 community that goes along with the 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.900
 in relation to the preservation of nature
