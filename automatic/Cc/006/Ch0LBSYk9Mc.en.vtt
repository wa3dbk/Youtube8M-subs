00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
cafeteria a lot purely because there's a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.099 
cafeteria a lot purely because there's a
lot<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.609> running<00:00:18.029> space<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.869> can<00:00:18.990> just

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
lot of running space and you can just

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.439 
lot of running space and you can just
basically<00:00:19.320> rape<00:00:20.010> train<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.580> ages<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:20.939> take

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
out zombies in one go and you've got the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.870 
out zombies in one go and you've got the
acid<00:00:24.570> trip<00:00:24.840> as<00:00:25.019> well<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.340> zombies<00:00:26.340> don't<00:00:26.519> speak

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
acid trip as well so zombies don't speak

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.150 
acid trip as well so zombies don't speak
sneak<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.689> out<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.050> nowhere<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:29.010> I

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
sneak up on you out of nowhere but I

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.130 
sneak up on you out of nowhere but I
kind<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.550> got<00:00:29.730> bored<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.179> being<00:00:30.240> there<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.109> I

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
kind of got bored of being there so I

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.560 
kind of got bored of being there so I
explored<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.949> bit<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.820> found<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.270> spot

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
explored a bit and I found this spot

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.959 
explored a bit and I found this spot
this<00:00:34.350> spot<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.680> actually<00:00:35.160> really<00:00:35.370> efficient

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
this spot is actually really efficient

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.479 
this spot is actually really efficient
so<00:00:36.510> zombies<00:00:37.110> can't<00:00:37.350> sneak<00:00:37.590> up<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.250> you

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
so zombies can't sneak up on you and you

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.520 
so zombies can't sneak up on you and you
can<00:00:38.610> see<00:00:38.850> everything<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.360> front<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
can see everything in front of you the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.860 
can see everything in front of you the
only<00:00:40.890> way<00:00:41.340> zombies<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.120> come<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.540> either

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
only way zombies can come is either

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.619 
only way zombies can come is either
ahead<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.829> down<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.160> path<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:44.670> by<00:00:45.149> climbing

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
ahead just down this path or by climbing

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.990 
ahead just down this path or by climbing
up<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> railing<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.340> know<00:00:47.789> where

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
up the railing here so you know where

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.490 
up the railing here so you know where
they're<00:00:48.120> all<00:00:48.210> coming<00:00:48.450> from<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.289> keep

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
they're all coming from and you can keep

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.220 
they're all coming from and you can keep
a<00:00:49.620> nice<00:00:49.770> distance<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.520> well<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.940> will<00:00:51.840> say<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
a nice distance as well I will say that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.350 
a nice distance as well I will say that
if<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:53.039> decide<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.489> try<00:00:53.730> out<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.030> spot

bottom and then just finishing you off
completely<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:17.040> will<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.640> annoying<00:01:17.970> because

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
completely that will be annoying because

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.200 
completely that will be annoying because
i<00:01:19.110> had<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> ray<00:01:19.770> gun<00:01:20.009> at<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> time<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.759> thought

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
i had the ray gun at the time I thought

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.929 
i had the ray gun at the time I thought
yeah<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.710> go<00:01:22.890> by<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.100> PhD<00:01:23.759> flopper

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
yeah I have to go by the PhD flopper

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.690 
yeah I have to go by the PhD flopper
first<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:25.290> worked<00:01:25.560> out<00:01:25.770> really<00:01:25.830> well<00:01:26.280> you

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
first and it worked out really well you

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.090 
first and it worked out really well you
could<00:01:27.240> use<00:01:27.540> maybe<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.140> death<00:01:28.350> machine<00:01:28.560> or<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
could use maybe the death machine or the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.240 
could use maybe the death machine or the
lsat<00:01:29.880> or<00:01:30.150> any<00:01:30.570> other<00:01:30.869> weapon<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.740> i<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.009> think

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
lsat or any other weapon but i do think

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.249 
lsat or any other weapon but i do think
maybe<00:01:32.790> you're<00:01:33.000> better<00:01:33.180> off<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> Reagan

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
maybe you're better off with the Reagan

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.499 
maybe you're better off with the Reagan
the<00:01:34.439> Mustang<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.100> Sally<00:01:35.430> pistols<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the Mustang and Sally pistols or the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.050 
the Mustang and Sally pistols or the
blundergat<00:01:37.130> even<00:01:38.130> better<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:38.640> they<00:01:38.820> pack<00:01:39.030> a

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
blundergat even better if they pack a

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.960 
blundergat even better if they pack a
punched<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:40.170> only<00:01:40.560> mistake<00:01:40.770> I'm<00:01:41.250> gonna<00:01:41.520> admit

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
punched the only mistake I'm gonna admit

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.359 
punched the only mistake I'm gonna admit
I<00:01:42.119> made<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:43.170> didn't<00:01:43.500> buy<00:01:43.680> speed<00:01:44.040> Cola

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
