00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
bad so it opens pretty quickly anyway

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.380

the default view you can just press the
number<00:01:04.330> seven<00:01:04.720> on<00:01:04.839> numpad<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:06.640> you<00:01:06.850> can't<00:01:07.120> do

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.990 
number seven on numpad if you can't do
that<00:01:07.560> then<00:01:08.560> you've<00:01:08.830> just<00:01:09.100> if<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:09.730> don't<00:01:09.909> have

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.200 
that then you've just if you don't have
a<00:01:10.060> numpad<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:10.510> mean<00:01:10.780> there<00:01:11.560> is<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:11.890> view<00:01:12.610> controls

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
a numpad I mean there is a view controls

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.360 
a numpad I mean there is a view controls
go<00:01:13.750> then<00:01:14.440> you<00:01:14.650> can<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:17.200> somewhere<00:01:17.950> here<00:01:18.190> you

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
go then you can as somewhere here you

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.470 
go then you can as somewhere here you
can<00:01:18.550> emulate<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.240> numpad<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:22.150> can<00:01:22.330> also

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
can emulate the numpad you can also

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.380 
can emulate the numpad you can also
emulate<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.230> three<00:01:23.680> mouse<00:01:23.860> button<00:01:24.460> if<00:01:24.700> you

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
emulate the three mouse button if you

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.670 
emulate the three mouse button if you
don't<00:01:25.780> actually<00:01:26.140> have<00:01:26.320> a<00:01:29.430> rotational<00:01:30.430> wheel

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
don't actually have a rotational wheel

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.040 
don't actually have a rotational wheel
but<00:01:32.680> I'm<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:34.720> trying<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.140> find<00:01:35.470> this

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
but I'm just trying to find this

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:44.570 
but I'm just trying to find this
emulator

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.150 

okay<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.480> it<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.080> go<00:01:46.230> to<00:01:46.290> system<00:01:46.860> and

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
okay so it is you go to system and

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.000 
okay so it is you go to system and
OpenGL<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.300> then<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.930> click<00:01:49.200> emulate<00:01:49.860> numpad

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
OpenGL and then you click emulate numpad

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.430 
OpenGL and then you click emulate numpad
and<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:51.150> way<00:01:51.300> you'll<00:01:51.510> be<00:01:51.540> able<00:01:51.660> to<00:01:51.900> use<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
and that way you'll be able to use the

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.170 
and that way you'll be able to use the
numbers<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.400> top<00:01:53.580> of<00:01:53.670> your<00:01:53.760> keyboard

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
numbers on the top of your keyboard

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.670 
numbers on the top of your keyboard
rather<00:01:54.300> than<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.600> numpad<00:01:55.050> if<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> don't<00:01:55.560> have

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
rather than a numpad if you don't have

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.570 
rather than a numpad if you don't have
one<00:01:55.790> anyway<00:01:57.350> if<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.560> don't<00:01:58.740> want<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.100> big

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
one anyway if you don't want this big

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.940 
one anyway if you don't want this big
space<00:02:00.000> up<00:02:00.270> here<00:02:00.300> blocking<00:02:01.140> your<00:02:01.380> view<00:02:01.440> you<00:02:01.770> can

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
space up here blocking your view you can

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.950 
space up here blocking your view you can
just<00:02:02.160> you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.730> grab<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.240> here<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.840> can

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
just you can grab it here and you can

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.630 
just you can grab it here and you can
push<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.200> all<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.440> way<00:02:04.530> up<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.280> way<00:02:05.370> and<00:02:05.520> then

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
push it all the way up the way and then

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.270 
push it all the way up the way and then
you<00:02:05.760> can<00:02:05.910> bring<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.510> down<00:02:06.690> when<00:02:06.720> you<00:02:06.930> need<00:02:07.110> it

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
you can bring it down when you need it

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.040 
you can bring it down when you need it
so<00:02:08.280> I'm<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.149> going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.390> push<00:02:09.570> that<00:02:09.780> out<00:02:09.840> of

and then if you press that that means

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:45.960 
and then if you press that that means
whenever<00:04:44.440> you<00:04:44.710> move<00:04:44.889> this<00:04:45.100> square<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.820> will

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
whenever you move this square it will

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.870 
whenever you move this square it will
snap<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.960> grid<00:04:47.190> so<00:04:48.190> you<00:04:48.280> can't<00:04:48.580> move<00:04:48.729> it

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
snap to the grid so you can't move it

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.580 
snap to the grid so you can't move it
freely<00:04:49.090> you<00:04:49.330> can<00:04:49.510> only<00:04:49.630> snap<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.200> to<00:04:50.290> the<00:04:50.410> grid

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
freely you can only snap it to the grid

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.440 
freely you can only snap it to the grid
and<00:04:51.450> to<00:04:52.450> move<00:04:52.660> it<00:04:52.900> you<00:04:53.200> just<00:04:53.350> press<00:04:53.740> G<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:55.330> if

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
and to move it you just press G so if

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.740 
and to move it you just press G so if
you<00:04:55.540> press<00:04:55.780> G<00:04:56.050> there<00:04:56.320> then<00:04:57.160> you<00:04:57.430> can<00:04:57.729> move<00:04:58.540> it

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
you press G there then you can move it

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.510 
you press G there then you can move it
and<00:04:58.900> you<00:04:59.050> see<00:04:59.260> it<00:04:59.350> sort<00:04:59.680> of<00:04:59.710> snapping<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.400> the

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
and you see it sort of snapping to the

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.850 
and you see it sort of snapping to the
growth<00:05:00.729> there<00:05:01.000> it's<00:05:01.870> going<00:05:02.080> exactly<00:05:02.500> on<00:05:02.830> the

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
growth there it's going exactly on the

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.070 
growth there it's going exactly on the
grid<00:05:03.160> squares<00:05:03.580> I<00:05:03.940> can't<00:05:04.419> like<00:05:04.570> move<00:05:04.810> it<00:05:04.990> around

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
grid squares I can't like move it around

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.100 
grid squares I can't like move it around
without<00:05:05.590> it<00:05:06.090> going<00:05:07.090> in<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.360> sort<00:05:07.570> of<00:05:07.630> technical

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
without it going in a sort of technical

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.529 
without it going in a sort of technical
way<00:05:08.760> so<00:05:09.760> I'm<00:05:09.820> just<00:05:09.970> going<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.150> put<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.360> back

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
way so I'm just going to put a back

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.490 
way so I'm just going to put a back
there<00:05:12.210> another<00:05:13.210> thing<00:05:13.479> you<00:05:13.510> can<00:05:13.750> do<00:05:13.960> I'm<00:05:14.260> using

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
there another thing you can do I'm using

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.060 
there another thing you can do I'm using
blender<00:05:15.479> 2.45<00:05:16.479> there<00:05:16.780> believe<00:05:17.020> it<00:05:17.169> is<00:05:17.289> you<00:05:17.830> can

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
blender 2.45 there believe it is you can

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.340 
blender 2.45 there believe it is you can
so<00:05:18.820> you<00:05:18.850> can<00:05:19.380> hold<00:05:20.380> left<00:05:20.650> mouse<00:05:20.889> button<00:05:21.340> oops

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
so you can hold left mouse button oops

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.129 
so you can hold left mouse button oops
hold<00:05:23.350> the<00:05:23.500> left<00:05:23.650> mouse<00:05:23.770> button<00:05:24.340> and<00:05:24.490> quickly

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
hold the left mouse button and quickly

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.650 
hold the left mouse button and quickly
do<00:05:26.139> that<00:05:26.430> again<00:05:27.430> you<00:05:27.760> can<00:05:27.910> like<00:05:28.060> draw<00:05:28.360> a<00:05:28.389> line

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
do that again you can like draw a line

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.770 
do that again you can like draw a line
with<00:05:29.320> your<00:05:29.470> mouse<00:05:29.970> it<00:05:30.970> doesn't<00:05:31.539> have<00:05:31.630> to<00:05:31.720> be

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
with your mouse it doesn't have to be

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.270 
with your mouse it doesn't have to be
such<00:05:32.020> huge<00:05:32.289> line<00:05:32.470> you<00:05:32.590> can<00:05:32.740> just<00:05:32.889> sort<00:05:33.039> of<00:05:33.130> do

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
such huge line you can just sort of do

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.040 
such huge line you can just sort of do
it<00:05:33.400> slightly<00:05:33.669> and<00:05:34.030> then<00:05:34.210> it<00:05:34.600> will<00:05:34.780> also<00:05:34.870> allow

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
it slightly and then it will also allow

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.320 
it slightly and then it will also allow
you<00:05:35.289> to<00:05:35.590> move<00:05:35.740> although<00:05:36.580> I<00:05:36.610> think<00:05:36.729> it's<00:05:37.030> better

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
you to move although I think it's better

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.070 
you to move although I think it's better
practice<00:05:37.840> if<00:05:37.990> you<00:05:38.139> use<00:05:38.380> G<00:05:38.800> because<00:05:39.639> um<00:05:39.900> just<00:05:40.900> as

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
practice if you use G because um just as

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.600 
practice if you use G because um just as
I<00:05:41.650> said<00:05:41.710> better<00:05:42.070> practice<00:05:44.280> another<00:05:45.280> thing

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
I said better practice another thing

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.500 
I said better practice another thing
another<00:05:46.060> basic<00:05:46.950> command<00:05:47.950> is<00:05:48.250> you<00:05:48.910> press<00:05:49.210> our

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
another basic command is you press our

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.710 
another basic command is you press our
key<00:05:49.930> and<00:05:50.560> you<00:05:51.099> can<00:05:51.280> rotate<00:05:51.490> now<00:05:53.039> you<00:05:54.039> can<00:05:54.220> also

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
key and you can rotate now you can also

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.629 
key and you can rotate now you can also
snap<00:05:55.720> to<00:05:55.960> grid<00:05:55.990> or<00:05:56.289> more<00:05:56.500> at<00:05:56.590> eight

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
snap to grid or more at eight

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.280 
snap to grid or more at eight
and<00:05:59.639> that<00:05:59.910> will<00:06:00.060> snap<00:06:00.300> it<00:06:00.600> to<00:06:00.750> the<00:06:00.870> grid<00:06:01.050> on<00:06:01.260> the

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
and that will snap it to the grid on the

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:07.280 
and that will snap it to the grid on the
rotate<00:06:05.060> so<00:06:06.060> that's<00:06:06.180> a<00:06:06.330> bit<00:06:06.540> out<00:06:06.570> of<00:06:06.720> line<00:06:06.990> there

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
rotate so that's a bit out of line there

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:13.430 
rotate so that's a bit out of line there
oh<00:06:10.910> well<00:06:11.910> good<00:06:12.180> enough<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:12.630> then<00:06:13.110> the<00:06:13.230> final

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
oh well good enough and then the final

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.060 
oh well good enough and then the final
one<00:06:13.620> is<00:06:14.400> the<00:06:14.639> size<00:06:14.880> or<00:06:15.389> scale<00:06:15.870> and<00:06:16.230> you<00:06:16.800> do<00:06:16.919> that

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
one is the size or scale and you do that

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.260 
one is the size or scale and you do that
by<00:06:17.130> pressing<00:06:17.310> s<00:06:17.900> and<00:06:18.900> then<00:06:19.110> you<00:06:19.230> you<00:06:20.040> can<00:06:20.280> pull

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
by pressing s and then you you can pull

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.750 
by pressing s and then you you can pull
your<00:06:21.360> mouth<00:06:21.540> out<00:06:21.810> to<00:06:22.650> make<00:06:22.800> it<00:06:22.950> bigger<00:06:23.220> put<00:06:23.639> it

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
your mouth out to make it bigger put it

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.840 
your mouth out to make it bigger put it
in<00:06:23.880> to<00:06:24.120> make<00:06:24.270> it<00:06:24.450> more<00:06:26.150> so<00:06:27.150> I'm<00:06:27.480> very<00:06:28.850> useful

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
in to make it more so I'm very useful

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.050 
in to make it more so I'm very useful
there<00:06:30.030> you<00:06:30.810> can
