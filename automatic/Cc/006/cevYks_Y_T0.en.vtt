that's how you do that and then your

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.520 
that's how you do that and then your
anti-aliasing<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.569> standard<00:03:05.349> definition

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
maximum level are set to those and then

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.680 
maximum level are set to those and then
AMI<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.010> occlusion<00:03:12.519> is<00:03:12.730> turned<00:03:13.000> on<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.329> and

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
AMI and occlusion is turned on is and

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.509 
AMI and occlusion is turned on is and
with<00:03:14.109> a<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.440> B<00:03:14.470> an<00:03:14.560> inclusion<00:03:14.859> that's<00:03:15.340> what

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
with a and B an inclusion that's what
