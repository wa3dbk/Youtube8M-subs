that<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.060> performance<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.840> going<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.140> be<00:02:19.230> half

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
that the performance is going to be half

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.190 
that the performance is going to be half
as<00:02:19.800> much<00:02:20.040> as<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.480> playstation<00:02:21.480> 4<00:02:21.629> that<00:02:21.810> sounds

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200

and I have influenced friends to get the

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.390 
and I have influenced friends to get the
playstation<00:04:35.550> 3<00:04:35.760> themselves<00:04:36.450> and<00:04:37.040> it's<00:04:38.040> it's<00:04:38.310> a

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
playstation 3 themselves and it's it's a

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.850 
playstation 3 themselves and it's it's a
community<00:04:38.910> that's<00:04:39.030> building<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:40.590> that's

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
community that's building and that's

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.680 
community that's building and that's
just<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.400> way<00:04:41.550> that<00:04:41.730> marketing<00:04:42.180> works<00:04:42.450> and

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
just the way that marketing works and

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.490 
just the way that marketing works and
hopefully<00:04:43.850> for<00:04:44.850> xboxes<00:04:45.630> sake<00:04:45.900> that's<00:04:46.170> going

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
hopefully for xboxes sake that's going

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.560 
hopefully for xboxes sake that's going
to<00:04:46.560> be<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.860> way<00:04:47.010> that<00:04:47.040> their<00:04:47.970> marketing<00:04:48.480> is

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
to be the way that their marketing is

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.050 
to be the way that their marketing is
going<00:04:48.720> to<00:04:48.780> continue<00:04:49.050> but<00:04:49.760> success<00:04:50.760> doesn't

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
going to continue but success doesn't

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.560 
going to continue but success doesn't
last<00:04:51.360> forever<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:52.970> overall<00:04:53.970> that's<00:04:54.360> the

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
last forever and overall that's the

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.320 
last forever and overall that's the
reason<00:04:54.870> I<00:04:54.930> think<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.290> xbox<00:04:55.770> one<00:04:56.070> won't<00:04:57.060> fail

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
reason I think the xbox one won't fail

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.420 
reason I think the xbox one won't fail
completely<00:04:57.750> now<00:04:58.260> I<00:04:58.560> could<00:04:59.100> be<00:04:59.220> completely

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
completely now I could be completely

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.060 
completely now I could be completely
wrong<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.390> this<00:05:00.990> five<00:05:01.230> hundred<00:05:01.590> dollar<00:05:01.770> price

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
wrong and this five hundred dollar price

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.750 
wrong and this five hundred dollar price
tag<00:05:02.370> might<00:05:02.610> just<00:05:02.910> be<00:05:03.060> too<00:05:03.300> much<00:05:03.330> and<00:05:04.040> it<00:05:05.040> just<00:05:05.490> I

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
tag might just be too much and it just I

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.070 
tag might just be too much and it just I
don't<00:05:06.450> know<00:05:06.630> it<00:05:06.840> just<00:05:06.870> might<00:05:07.380> pom-pom<00:05:08.130> it

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
don't know it just might pom-pom it

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.950 
don't know it just might pom-pom it
might<00:05:10.080> be<00:05:10.200> like<00:05:10.350> the<00:05:10.500> dreamcast<00:05:11.070> or<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:12.210> Sega

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
might be like the dreamcast or the Sega

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.400 
might be like the dreamcast or the Sega
Jaguar<00:05:13.650> or<00:05:13.980> what<00:05:14.880> we<00:05:15.150> we<00:05:15.630> honestly<00:05:15.810> don't<00:05:16.260> know
