00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.710
 with an instructor in unarmed combat by 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.090
 control and we will organize a lesson 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.700
 match the division of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.630
 these techniques and so we often 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.229
 had to work very limited 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.080
 space mainly on detention 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.000
 happens we have limited in 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.600
 limited space without transport 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.600
 from the apartment. 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:47.580
 have a large small significant 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.320
 difference specifics work if severity 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:56.960
 you units FSB team or 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.960
 Army again this system 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:07.050
 separation we apply in practice 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.660
 passed yours well passed at 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.320
 close and very close contact with 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:18.560
 adversary 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:21.060
 where speed is required efficiency 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.810
 fast effective without neighbors 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.260
 adversary further escort 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.750
 it is often to justify herself she 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.330
 practical implementation of those 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.940
 fucking world which is not in the methodology or 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.830
 Russian hand-to-hand combat systems 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.220
 which includes special training 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.660
 specially developed exercises 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.220
 safe wadim triggers 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.020
 rolls work in conditions 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.390
 confined space 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.270
 as well as using techniques 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.370
 effective self-defense and wiring 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.220
 seizures of detention our theme 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.580
 of today's occupation seizing retention 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.830
 escorts were you 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:05.410
 gorilla technique of painful tricks again 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.960
 we moved on to doing that 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.880
 painful reception we examined the zones and 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.130
 points of active lesions ie 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.130
 striking before working on 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.130
 brush we hit all those blows from someone 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.160
 put if there are boxing practices 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.620
 there other technology everything works the most 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:32.830
 the main principle of what impact their 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:35.230
 strong on his weak but before 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.870
 Russian pain can be considered 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.270
 every finger starts maybe 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.390
 the situation is what kind of person you need 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.490
 he shows youtube and he pulls 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.560
 you hand let it impact 1 on 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.330
 finger 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.690
 the initial effects are carried out as 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.590
 on the thumb and little finger but how 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.720
 arranged as arranged in this way 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.230
 tendon joints ie fingers and 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.420
 dip in august 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.780
 but there are people with anatomical features 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:13.720
 that even if big could 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.750
 reach out to your forearm here considering 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.810
 this is us 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.180
 that we are more harmful than boys 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.110
 thumbs up 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.050
 end phalanxes of index childhood 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.690
 now we apply the principle of work 3 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.639
 planes that is, we own it 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.810
 directions 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:43.900
 at forearm with knee striking 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:51.129
 the leg and the plane of the area we are here and here 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:58.960
 give the bar works now see 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:05:04.919
 on this add rotation uses 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.919
 handcuffed or acted 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:21.360
 unfolded it happened we take away and 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.360
 take 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.360
 give back
