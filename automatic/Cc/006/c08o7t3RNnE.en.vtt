00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.020
 Hello everyone, Eugene, I'm in 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.820
 my client's test world is pioneers 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.170
 especially a small video which 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.510
 recorded personal 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.960
 personally for Andrew dialogue so that 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.119
 show him the prototype of my system 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.669
 high pressure boiler and how 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.220
 the way i made a trunk for filing 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.990
 couple and so it really is just 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.989
 first recorded lazily then I thought 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.250
 why does the good lead everyone hide and 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.930
 there is a topic for you to use more 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.579
 Actually you can also see how 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.430
 way here 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.859
 a prototype is formed and, on the contrary, I 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.120
 now own build in the pioneers but in 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.489
 In general, you can look a little 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.230
 forward and so here he is of higher 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.170
 pressure is the maximum size 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.059
 boiler winter we look now we 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.579
 we will see that now I have a point 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.699
 filled with fuel warmed up in this 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.949
 moment up to 150 degrees and constantly 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.719
 gives out 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.969
 this ward we take away the liquidators 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.460
 all liquidation who can see 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.220
 quantity let's see the parameters 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.610
 networks at the moment this network is at 10,500 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.340
 at 10,500 full and 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 there is steam on it as you see something 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.880
 tit tag goes through let's take a look at 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.909
 motor and make sure that they are maximally 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:28.920
 engage so look the motor that we 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.350
 we see a8 it gives us magicians now 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.939
 joule is completely filled with pairs that is 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.939
 he is fully equipped with everything necessary 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.409
 for maximum convenience if we 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.510
 look here we see what we have here 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.940
 only one involved 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.100
 astral liquid acts let's make sure 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.220
 what's going on normally energy generation all 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.710
 as a principle as it should be 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.170
 we see that it does not require any special 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.120
 complex such as i would say 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.830
 congested junctions with pipes 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.420
 in order to engage 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.010
 maximum number of motors 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.500
 at the moment again this is with us 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.020
 industrial industrial engines on 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.820
 8 monitors joules in lima them 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.880
 installed a total of nine pieces here in 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.560
 this line and 9 pieces here in this line this 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.610
 maximum number of engines 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.690
 which can allow which can 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.730
 provide couples with such a boiler 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.170
 high pressure 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.210
 I hope this video was useful to you and 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.460
 if you want more like 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.650
 mini-videos of some kind of technology 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.360
 write what you would like to see and not 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.220
 cares and likes videos you 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.780
 I liked just a couple of friends with you 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.780
 was Eugene lynx until new meetings 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.360
 and
