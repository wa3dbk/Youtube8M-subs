CS<00:00:35.550> 1.6<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.420> source<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.590> let's<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.920> go<00:00:39.559> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:55.460 

just<00:01:39.640> going<00:01:39.970> to<00:01:40.090> cut<00:01:40.330> this<00:01:44.310> suck<00:01:46.500> silicon<00:01:51.420> dad

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.260 
shot done to go over is the auto shotgun
again<00:02:06.070> we<00:02:06.340> could<00:02:06.580> get<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.759> from<00:02:07.090> sauce<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:07.780> 16

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
again we could get it from sauce and 16

not<00:02:10.270> really<00:02:10.570> keen<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:10.869> this<00:02:11.200> one<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:14.050> know<00:02:14.170> why

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
not really keen on this one you know why

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.449 
not really keen on this one you know why
biggest<00:02:15.370> upwards<00:02:15.970> recoil<00:02:18.690> really<00:02:20.459> spreads

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
biggest upwards recoil really spreads

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.390 
biggest upwards recoil really spreads
all<00:02:21.670> over<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:22.000> place<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:23.830> know<00:02:23.860> quite

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
all over the place you know quite

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:37.820 
all over the place you know quite
difficult<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:25.030> manage<00:02:36.180> there<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.299> go

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
difficult to manage there you go

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.150 
difficult to manage there you go
eventually<00:02:38.830> gets<00:02:40.470> compared<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.560> their<00:02:41.920> kind

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
eventually gets compared to their kind

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.060 
eventually gets compared to their kind
of<00:02:42.330> rope<00:02:45.060> pump<00:02:46.060> action<00:02:46.269> no<00:02:46.900> shotgun<00:02:47.350> some

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
really no comparison and again it's more

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.039 
really no comparison and again it's more
expensive<00:02:51.010> thousand<00:02:51.970> dollars<00:02:52.239> more<00:02:52.450> really

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
expensive thousand dollars more really

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.380 
expensive thousand dollars more really
most<00:02:53.200> difference

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
most difference

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.720 
most difference
for<00:02:56.050> kind<00:02:56.350> of<00:02:56.440> purposes<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:57.370> wouldn't<00:02:57.610> really

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
for kind of purposes you wouldn't really

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.040

have it in kind of anything you know no
shotgun<00:03:02.650> it's<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.670> lot<00:03:03.850> more<00:03:03.900> powerful<00:03:04.900> more

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:13.040 
shotgun it's a lot more powerful more
viable<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.550> you<00:03:07.800> guess<00:03:08.800> I'm<00:03:09.480> ready<00:03:10.480> clearly

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.630 

really<00:03:19.330> just<00:03:19.420> spreads<00:03:20.050> out<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.770> can't<00:03:21.040> do

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
really just spreads out and you can't do

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:29.220 
really just spreads out and you can't do
anything<00:03:21.820> about<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:26.790> until<00:03:27.790> next<00:03:28.230> shotgun

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230

shotgun this does have actually bullet
penetration<00:03:38.230> only<00:03:38.769> one<00:03:38.980> x<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:39.970> really<00:03:40.300> won't

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
penetration only one x so really won't

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.580 
penetration only one x so really won't
do<00:03:40.630> any<00:03:40.750> significant<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:41.739> know<00:03:41.769> damage

update<00:03:54.330> kind<00:03:55.330> of<00:03:55.450> unfortunate<00:03:55.720> really

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
update kind of unfortunate really

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.990 
update kind of unfortunate really
especially<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.830> know<00:03:56.950> if<00:03:57.489> you're<00:03:57.670> a<00:03:57.700> fan<00:03:57.880> on

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
especially you know if you're a fan on

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.840 
especially you know if you're a fan on
1.6<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:58.959> much<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:02.430> lastly<00:04:03.430> i<00:04:03.489> think<00:04:03.730> is

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
1.6 and so much this lastly i think is

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.610 
1.6 and so much this lastly i think is
probably<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.209> most<00:04:04.360> powerful<00:04:04.660> shotgun<00:04:05.500> in

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
probably the most powerful shotgun in

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.819 
probably the most powerful shotgun in
csgo<00:04:06.329> really<00:04:07.329> does<00:04:07.510> deliver<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.930> good<00:04:08.230> kick<00:04:08.500> and

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
csgo really does deliver a good kick and

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:15.870 
csgo really does deliver a good kick and
you<00:04:08.950> can<00:04:09.130> really<00:04:09.400> just<00:04:09.640> jump<00:04:14.220> but<00:04:15.220> that's<00:04:15.370> you

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
you can really just jump but that's you

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.180 
you can really just jump but that's you
know<00:04:15.910> for<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.359> teesside<00:04:17.260> so<00:04:17.829> we'll<00:04:17.950> go<00:04:18.070> on<00:04:18.160> to

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
know for the teesside so we'll go on to

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:25.590 
know for the teesside so we'll go on to
the<00:04:18.370> just<00:04:18.549> jump<00:04:18.790> on<00:04:18.850> CT<00:04:23.010> so<00:04:24.010> this<00:04:24.880> is<00:04:25.030> CT<00:04:25.330> side

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
the just jump on CT so this is CT side

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.820 
the just jump on CT so this is CT side
and<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:27.310> new<00:04:27.910> shotgun<00:04:28.270> with<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.660> cisco<00:04:29.500> again

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
and the new shotgun with a cisco again

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.030 
and the new shotgun with a cisco again
is<00:04:29.979> matt<00:04:30.690> it's<00:04:31.690> costing<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.080> two<00:04:32.260> thousand<00:04:32.770> so

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
is matt it's costing a two thousand so

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.630 
is matt it's costing a two thousand so
compared<00:04:33.729> the<00:04:34.240> unique<00:04:35.050> one<00:04:35.320> on<00:04:35.640> character

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
compared the unique one on character

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.770 
compared the unique one on character
it's<00:04:36.940> pondered

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.350 

realistically<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:40.870> think<00:04:41.290> it<00:04:41.560> is<00:04:41.590> powerful

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
realistically I think it is powerful

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.360 
realistically I think it is powerful
it's<00:04:43.360> good<00:04:43.930> in<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.229> aspect<00:04:44.560> that<00:04:44.740> we're<00:04:45.280> all

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
it's good in the aspect that we're all

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.800 
it's good in the aspect that we're all
the<00:04:45.610> rest<00:04:45.760> of<00:04:45.910> shotguns<00:04:46.270> you<00:04:46.419> do<00:04:46.570> have<00:04:46.690> to

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
the rest of shotguns you do have to

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.800 
the rest of shotguns you do have to
