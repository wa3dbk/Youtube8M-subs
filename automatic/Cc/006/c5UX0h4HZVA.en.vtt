00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello everyone today I bring you the third 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:11.040
 video of miraculous products for me 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.540
 today I bring you a product that is good 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.970
 a bit for everything but above all it is 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.690
 cosmetic 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.220
 is the tree to teach us because 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:25.120
 this one is worn that is the one that I used 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.180
 during all this time 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.470
 that is the essence of the good tea tree 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.840
 tea tree oil is how he cited the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.470
 natural essential oil cosmetic use is 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.750
 what he puts in the jar and 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.450
 and well there is not much more in the vote 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.060
 It is from the herbalist that I 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.730
 I have this one that they buy me herbalist and 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:55.570
 Now I have this one that is also from that 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:58.190
 tea tree of the body shop forgiveness 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.019
 I hope it looks good 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.489
 puts them more or less the same 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.620
 explain is also a bit too for 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.720
 get a little doubt out of the whole roll 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.270
 sink that I have inside me because 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.409
 in this he says that it is 100% natural in the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.609
 of herbal bullet 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.859
 in this one that is 100% natural but in this one 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:19.350
 puts that only takes 15 percent of 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.289
 tea tree essence I do not know what 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.690
 means that he mixes it or not 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.460
 plants that can not be seen 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.130
 this is the loss here 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.400
 I do not know if you can see it but it puts 15 of 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.530
 tea tree 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.150
 repeat the tea tree sorry and I do not know what 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.950
 means that so good as from 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.640
 I have not used too much I'm going to 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.370
 talk about this how good is the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.340
 third miraculous product is miraculous to 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.830
 me is that one day I was looking for 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.250
 what does it do and is that the question is for 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.770
 what does it work for us? 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.390
 there is a homemade cleaning with a 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.690
 boiling water or pulled it back to 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.880
 to the vapors of the skin you throw two 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.150
 drops two drops because I 'm going to 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.170
 teach 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.880
 and what the other team taught us to 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.550
 to be able to hump butt because she with the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.620
 conta drops did not come out more droplets you see 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.250
 they have like an eyedropper this 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.400
 out drip worth it too 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.050
 I had these two droplets you came a little 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.630
 with a stick because it is made by hand 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.180
 you go agrasar and that the vapors fall and 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.790
 even if you're constipated, that's what 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.520
 same thing to open the pores but 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.770
 the same to breathe the vapors of 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.770
 tea tree and it clears everything is 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.140
 wonderful as well as if it is like 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.880
 tree is like type is not eucalyptus smell 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.820
 it is me des menttolado but it is very 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.209
 intense and it was completely uncovered in 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.850
 serious I especially can use it 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.470
 for granites for granite wells 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.050
 a little complicated I said that I do not 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.390
 I am of many many granites but 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.700
 when they come out I do not like them 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.500
 obviously and I started using the tree 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.370
 tea to remove them what I do is in 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.470
 a pot in a swab of the ears 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.810
 I put a little water I pass it by 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.290
 hot water and I put a little droplet and I 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.890
 I put in the contacts or where are the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.620
 granites complicated and goes super well 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.200
 dry right away or maybe a grain 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.130
 it may take five days to leave in 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.530
 two for not exaggerating I say 3 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.420
 is fully recovered or I want to 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.950
 say that it is already starting to go 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.510
 when normal is that the fifth day is 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.120
 when you are starting to go not here to the 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.660
 third , practically only the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.190
 dry granite so that they leave 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.810
 Do not touch the anethon alone with the cane 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.580
 cited and leave it there on air 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.110
 I do this twice a day for the 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.660
 morning and evening always mixing 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.310
 not because some tea is very intense and if 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.900
 applies it directly sad is that 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.330
 I'm in a hurry, I need to throw myself 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.400
 whole dropper does not always mix it 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.380
 because if you throw it directly it 's a 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.660
 little strong for some types of skins 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.490
 I believe mine is sensitive and 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.200
 it can be a little abrasive can even 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.340
 leave some mark of the forts that 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.250
 It is 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.270
 of dryness so to speak but it is not 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.790
 dangerous calm 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.310
 also to see is that I only have 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.720
 used for that to follow the winters 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.540
 Facials for breathing and for 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.300
 granites 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.030
 but I have heard that it serves for I have read that 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.790
 you stop a lot of things if you also 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.650
 used that hip and it's agreed 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.660
 healing if you have any wound that 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.580
 be not open from the middle because open 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.380
 It may sting but when is it 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.480
 as healing he has effects 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.450
 healing of 100 always mixing it 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.450
 with never pure water found in 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.100
 in herbalists and most low in 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.990
 herbalists and in the body shop 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.240
 also found but the evo 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.850
 said at the moment I'm not very happy 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.260
 with him because I've used him a couple of 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.870
 times 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.210
 and when using it I mixed it with water 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.360
 as always but it has left me a 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.610
 tiny little thing mark that with this never 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.580
 in my life it had happened to me 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.050
 organitos and friend the granites is going 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.300
 wonderfully well very 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.160
 wonderfully well and since I 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.390
 I discovered as soon as I saw a granite 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.750
 be there the awful little bit I catch my 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.670
 length I take it and at night I called what 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.140
 he found put more he took off like that 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.350
 saying festa the next day is no longer going 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:36.050
 to be me I recommend it for a hundred 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.150
 irregular price I took expensive 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.800
 number I bought yesterday obviously I would 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.800
 I bought a couple of years ago 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:49.120
 it cost me eight euros that are well in 15 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:54.320
 milliliters but we like it from 15 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:57.080
 milliliters not that is not nothing you know 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.230
 but believe is a drop what you have to 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.930
 use by functionability oil 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.600
 tea tree or 15 milliliters cunden 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.450
 a lot is worth this one of him a body shop 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.720
 I think it costs 8 but I bought it in 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:14.690
 one day I was all 15% and month and I 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.100
 It came out at six euros that's why I took advantage 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.260
 I said good that I have 15 percent 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.670
 I take advantage and I buy it but not increase 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.410
 I'm very happy with the body shop 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.990
 so I'm not going to recommend it in case 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.290
 perhaps and recommended the herbalist 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:30.800
 that is 100% tea tree this would be this 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:33.260
 from 10 to live naturally I do not know 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.490
 it will be a special brand or something but 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.490
 well I show you 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.010
 and that is 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.240
 for the girls that have problems I 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.450
 I teach you because I also have 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.750
 problems so he released the council the 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.490
 launched my advice to the youtube world for 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.710
 that everyone can see it like I did 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.540
 with the deodorant that I've seen that 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.980
 had that has a lot of acceptance 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.390
 and a lot of comments and a lot 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.860
 of people who tell me but who has 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.020
 bought to prove it 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.640
 I love it works wonderful and I 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.590
 he says he does not even understand very well how 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.720
 you use it you can not see me apply and I 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.180
 send me a message I answer and I 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:13.200
 I explain how I use it all over again and the 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.790
 of the old oil you will come sweet 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.980
 I have also seen that it was very good 

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:20.040
 acceptance so well then I do another 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.710
 I make my third miraculous product of 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.780
 At the moment I do not have another product 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.570
