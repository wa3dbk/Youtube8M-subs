00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
breakaway and um like I said it already

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.860 
breakaway and um like I said it already
has<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.400> string<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.210> you<00:02:28.300> could<00:02:28.420> connect<00:02:28.750> the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
has a string so you could connect the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.870 
has a string so you could connect the
figures<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.290> comes<00:02:29.440> right<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:30.040> here's<00:02:30.760> a

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
figures it comes right to it here's a

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.360 
figures it comes right to it here's a
platform<00:02:33.630> um<00:02:37.110> here's<00:02:38.110> where<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.380> put<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.740> bat

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
platform um here's where you put the bat

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.590 
platform um here's where you put the bat
magnum<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.180> balls<00:02:40.450> or<00:02:40.690> carbo's<00:02:41.110> or<00:02:41.320> whatever

magnum of balls or carbo's or whatever
and<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:45.520> put<00:02:45.700> them<00:02:45.790> in<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.570> this<00:02:47.350> would<00:02:47.650> go<00:02:47.860> up

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
and you put them in and this would go up

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.180 
and you put them in and this would go up
this<00:02:48.490> lever<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:49.270> just<00:02:49.600> push<00:02:50.020> in<00:02:50.230> nikko<00:02:50.860> flying

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
this lever and just push in nikko flying

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.860 
this lever and just push in nikko flying
up<00:02:51.420> actually<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.450> could<00:02:52.750> demonstrate<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.620> with

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
up actually I could demonstrate it with

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.290 
up actually I could demonstrate it with
r2d2<00:02:55.870> huh<00:02:56.700> if<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:57.820> want<00:02:58.000> me<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.770> goes<00:02:59.920> in

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
r2d2 huh if you want me to so it goes in

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.330

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
except level anyway juicy inside it's

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.930 
except level anyway juicy inside it's
kind<00:03:07.600> of<00:03:07.630> cool<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:09.670> again<00:03:11.520> here's<00:03:12.520> our<00:03:12.700> peg

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
kind of cool so again here's our peg

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.250 
kind of cool so again here's our peg
stand<00:03:13.360> figures<00:03:13.810> on<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.510> is<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.930> love<00:03:17.230> of

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
stand figures on and this is the love of

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.250 
stand figures on and this is the love of
bullets<00:03:17.860> I'm<00:03:18.070> out<00:03:18.310> it's<00:03:18.790> not<00:03:18.940> stupid<00:03:19.260> because

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
bullets I'm out it's not stupid because

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.010 
bullets I'm out it's not stupid because
the<00:03:20.530> first<00:03:20.830> is<00:03:20.980> lava<00:03:21.280> then<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:22.030> guess<00:03:22.210> to<00:03:22.660> be

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
the first is lava then I guess to be

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.770 
the first is lava then I guess to be
like<00:03:23.230> your<00:03:23.380> Vader<00:03:23.590> burning<00:03:24.210> it's<00:03:25.210> his<00:03:25.390> hand

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
like your Vader burning it's his hand

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.520 
like your Vader burning it's his hand
but<00:03:26.560> if<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.860> like<00:03:27.130> when<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.610> lava<00:03:27.850> he<00:03:28.180> be<00:03:28.530> dead

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
but if you like when the lava he be dead

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.060 
but if you like when the lava he be dead
and<00:03:29.770> how<00:03:29.980> could<00:03:30.130> they<00:03:30.280> recover<00:03:30.640> his<00:03:30.790> body<00:03:32.070> so

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
and how could they recover his body so

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.560 
and how could they recover his body so
this<00:03:33.460> stupid<00:03:34.330> now<00:03:34.560> really<00:03:35.560> good<00:03:35.740> it<00:03:35.920> um<00:03:36.570> also

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
this stupid now really good it um also

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.160 
this stupid now really good it um also
lets<00:03:37.780> i<00:03:38.080> think<00:03:38.440> is<00:03:38.530> stupid<00:03:38.740> they<00:03:39.580> have<00:03:40.170> you

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
lets i think is stupid they have you

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.320 
lets i think is stupid they have you
connect<00:03:41.440> these<00:03:41.560> two<00:03:41.830> like<00:03:42.130> orange<00:03:42.760> things<00:03:43.090> to

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330

it<00:03:43.450> in<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:43.750> little<00:03:43.930> platforms<00:03:44.500> at<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.709> top<00:03:45.240> so

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
it in the little platforms at the top so

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.699 
it in the little platforms at the top so
they<00:03:46.420> could<00:03:46.600> fight<00:03:46.630> but<00:03:47.200> i<00:03:47.440> don't<00:03:47.590> really

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
they could fight but i don't really

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.520 
they could fight but i don't really
