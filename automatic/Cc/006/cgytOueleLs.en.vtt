00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.970
 It's night when you want to put gadgets 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:16.020
 always on the alert he runs into a new one 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:18.570
 case immediately hound instinct signals 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.779
 mister gadget that needs to be investigated further 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:28.400
 bottom we have not fallen here is a new one 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.400
 mission for mister hunting 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.880
 it is useless to take it long 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.710
 if the windscreen wipers no longer do the 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.309
 their duty means that it is time to 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.760
 to change 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.680
 safety is at stake 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.410
 this happens because the brushes are 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.699
 old the rubber has hardened and theirs 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.699
 board is worn 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.710
 but you have seen how much they cost 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.670
 Replacement brushes A complete set can 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.350
 get to cost more than 50 euros but there is 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.590
 a cheaper solution ready 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:32.810
 the piper wizz air is bought on the internet 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:35.330
 and it costs less than 10 euros but it will work 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.430
 I 'm really a bit skeptical but 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.680
 let's try this brush has 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.400
 evidently a central area that does not 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.990
 cleans more right before the eyes 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.820
 the instructions are clear 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.240
 first make sure that the rubber 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.310
 it is not cracked or cracked then 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.050
 you have to go three or four times on the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.990
 rubber lip through the wiper 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.340
 first wizard with the rough part if there is one 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.400
 very wear 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.470
 then with that end one must finally 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.720
 clean the brush well with the cloths in 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.140
 microfiber supplied with the wipe 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.390
 erwitt is an operation that requires one 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.970
 certain dexterity is not easy to be 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.820
 precise nor with the third in hand in the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.920
 leaving it inserted on the support 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.920
 especially with the Uruguay curved types 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.110
 perÃ¹ bizarre flows with difficulty la 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.840
 check under our water jets 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.510
 colored stripes and water residues 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.989
 there are still at least they are not 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.989
 worsened 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.640
 sin there is no illusions with 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.680
 10 euros we have not improved the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.420
 situation of our windscreen wipers 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.100
 on the other hand the edge of the brush is 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.980
 an object too delicate to be able to 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.870
 be rebuilt rather look on 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.700
 flea markets and at most spare parts dealers 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.800
 provided for some types of 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.620
 windscreen wipers can be found there 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.750
 only spare tires for a few euros ed 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.750
 it's like replacing the entire racket 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.330
 once again mister gadget has 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.510
 solved a dog as amazing 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:17.220
 adventures await him 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.220
 we'll find out in the next episode
