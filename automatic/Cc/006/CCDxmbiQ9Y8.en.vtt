00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.430
 or the one who is alone without good and had 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.110
 teach about a convent called tt 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.360
 force that this command seemed to me 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.509
 very useful because he used it from time to time 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.470
 when on the adventure map and good is 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.450
 You can use more than the entire map 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.730
 it only works if that were done 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.560
 with creative mode because you have to 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.029
 use with a command block okay 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.380
 only with block the command does not 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.410
 you can put here on the bar below 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.410
 what do you put that for example you ford 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.560
 we put more penh and put the 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.390
 topics I'm going to teach you, it's not going to 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.520
 work because simply nothing else 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.220
 works with command block and good 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.170
 first let's see through the level ok 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.790
 here I am going to apply more or less done 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.280
 a repeater to update the 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.110
 ok command signal has to be assured 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.430
 has a repeater this this respect the 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.940
 sars in the following way that would be 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.370
 grab a comparator you place it here 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.350
 place to recognize around with elton 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.120
 well here back you can place a 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.800
 lever can be placed like this was 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.650
 carries a torch to recompose 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.990
 that I had to place is a lever here 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.520
 click on you set the tribute quoted here 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:19.360
 and you're going to have a repeater that makes 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.470
 I recommend you and good is simple good 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.780
 to make this command we are going to 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.520
 need it to be there by the way 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.290
 how much later do you have to have for 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.490
 example of the network do not do it here 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.050
 I hit the block because it's not going to 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.540
 teaching has to conform to two of 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.430
 rest not three so that for the 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.649
 command will grip the signal and leave 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.720
 updating and placing it one is going to be 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.500
 too fast we are going to feel like a 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.060
 signal always on 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.530
 I recommend that you do your finger to 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.360
 picture after having done the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.520
 repeater of the pictures forward and there 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.430
 put the command block and so you go to 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.660
 do achieve excellent ok 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.220
 once we would give the first one we're going 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.620
 to write in block command very 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.910
 that living from outside breaks in between 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.950
 square brackets and we put the emmy that 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.960
 means the level the beach level is 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.490
 closer this means reform 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.840
 break that would be the sea player nearby 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.090
 as it says to select played more 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.830
 close and good and the number 5 that would be 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.539
 number 5 this would be the level of 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.789
 player that the level of the player that 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.190
 requires to be able to be fulfilled 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.020
 the requirements that must be put 10 20 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.090
 30 to 25 can put everything you 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.370
 you want that would be the level you need 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.440
 the player ok then he goes and then 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.000
 we put a comparator which compares the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.950
 signal with so that it is being fulfilled 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.660
 the requirements were sent this block 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.510
 command which is quick yesterday tales 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.080
 a time lapse in a say has come up from 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.959
 level can happen ok and then done was 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.760
 had a repeated for that nut to 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.530
 I can feel that it is in a sign that goes 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.630
 to send the repeater the signal and it's going to 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.130
 get to the door and in this way 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.900
 makes the person that we 're going to 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.320
 prove the theory would be when I get to 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.320
 level 5 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.390
 As you can see it comes down the notice has 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.580
 up the level can you pass and how and how 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.769
 has opened the door ok it seems very 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.470
 useful in that sense but that has the 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.459
 command that would be the third forum ap l 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.400
 in brackets 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.400
 lm the mi5 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.340
 one 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.300
 now we go with the second one that would be 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.490
 this one is operated by radio or 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.680
 range or you can also say as per 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.960
 perimeter than when you touch this line 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.910
 in this blue line that since what 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.350
 drawn without a base that opens these 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.670
 because the command block has 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.390
 this next command that would be the 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.580
 third open radio equal to 5 ok has a 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.930
 5 radius all all players that 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.760
 has around 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.769
 as around the command block with 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.569
 five blocks of separation is going to be that 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.829
 will have to know the door or what you 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.819
 you want it to open what you want 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.650
 that works because because of 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.030
 the block is good all you are 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.790
 close what command makes it 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.340
 now as you can see already for out 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.219
 of the fight that closes the door I get 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.019
 it opens here we have this the four 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:03.889
 points 1 5 exactly the 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.959
 five blocks that would be that 1 2 3 4 and 5 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.489
 right here it does not open it seems to me 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.470
 obvious if you open 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.760
 good would be the second works of the 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.569
 next way you put a block of 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.370
 command 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.169
 then you place a comparator like you already 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.430
 I said so that I feel the signal of 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.810
 have to put a repeater so that 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.639
 will comment life sign but logical 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.650
 because the compared only goes to 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.150
 send a one-pulse signal you can 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.949
 see is a single pulse of pointed out that 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.410
 they send therefore you are going to need a 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.389
 comparator a premium repeater that 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.820
 handles a repeater to send the 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.130
 complete and good signal to be able to have 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.310
 this to be able to have the command block 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.340
 I did not tell you, you have to put 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.410
 if you do not have your mind it is not what 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.900
 is used to make you recommended it and see 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.260
 your name for example the net ok and 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:53.990
 place 637 people and with this I will give you 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:57.410
 a block command ok over time 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.900
 in the 5000 in the 70 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.740
 I want to show you it would be this that would be 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.180
 by position or what would be telford 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.880
 we put the coordinates here and I do not know 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.590
 why a coordinate the f3 and how 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.480
 can see in the upper part it 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.420
 will show the coordinate that would be the x 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.550
 the yy the z l what would be the position 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:21.950
 this would be three positions that have 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:25.860
 cross for example that would be less 127 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:28.350
 57 413 these would be and coordinates in 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.290
 this moment and good this area that we are going 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.480
 to use we will use them pegaditas 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.220
 separating them with only a comma gain 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.470
 between each coordinate will be a comma 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.690
 and has been doing exactly like those that 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.980
 I have here for example these three 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.360
 coordinates are what I have in this 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:49.110
 command block that would be less 121 56 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.300
 47 400 1.1 etc one would be the radius would be 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.900
 what they explain to you right now in the block 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.190
 blue would be the radio that is then 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.570
 around this command when the 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.700
 block are you going to use for example that I'm 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.770
 using one alone this means that 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.110
 when I stopped at that green dot it 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.500
 open the door to try we put it in 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.300
 the green dot opens the door 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.860
 to see each other again except on occasion 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:16.160
 Closing for opens very useful and good 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.100
 we go for example here we have 121 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.840
 place it on the 1 as you put a 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.820
 2 radius 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.310
 now it turns out that when I stood on the 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.900
 red line the door was opened 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.520
 for the red girl they did not stop me in the middle 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.530
 but I stopped the red line because 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.350
 around that table cuadrito 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.940
 green around that where I stopped 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.699
 within a radius of 2 to open the door 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.620
 not this would be the third option and the 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:42.960
 fourth is the same I have put the same 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.210
 command and the port so stop it 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.790
 here it's going to open up and well it works like this 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.470
 in the following way for example here 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.030
 what we have would be the same 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.430
 command that we use used here with your 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.800
 comparator with its repeaters in its 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:59.100
 comparator and I have put a patotero 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:05.160
 grain up in the coordinate since posts 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:08.840
 zombie eggs we will not say ok here 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.840
 we have the comparator giving it pointing 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.750
 to the dispenser and well how much I stop 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.250
 exactly in that blue block is going to 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.290
 drop a zombie this can also be 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.480
 a piston can be a door so what 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.190
 that you want it to open or close 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.080
 because let's try it would I stop at 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.330
 this blue block and it opens and it's going to come out 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.880
 a zombie of ayn to test I stop here 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.070
 we went out good man to come out another 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.080
 zombie and every time I stop here is the 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:36.200
 another zombie is very useful for more adventure 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.540
 as I already told you and well that is 4 

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.880
 that gives you 4 way that you can use this 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.040
 command called this ford I hope you've 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.930
 like you have served subscribe the 

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.930
 favorites and see you in the opportunity
