his lackeys do it so I also made this

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.740 
his lackeys do it so I also made this
genealogy<00:00:42.420> chart<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:44.210> everyone<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.329> see<00:00:45.390> kind

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
genealogy chart so everyone can see kind

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.240 
genealogy chart so everyone can see kind
of<00:00:45.780> where<00:00:45.930> I'm<00:00:46.050> coming<00:00:46.379> from<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:48.230> I'll<00:00:49.250> make

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
of where I'm coming from and I'll make

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.250 
of where I'm coming from and I'll make
it<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.670> little<00:00:51.120> bit<00:00:51.329> better<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:52.199> read<00:00:54.140> but<00:00:55.140> it

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
it a little bit better to read but it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.240 
it a little bit better to read but it
would<00:00:55.350> make<00:00:55.559> sense<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:56.690> if<00:00:57.739> like<00:00:58.739> almond

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
would make sense that if like almond

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.220 
would make sense that if like almond
said<00:00:59.550> cuz<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.000> don't<00:01:00.149> see<00:01:00.329> any<00:01:00.539> reason<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:00.960> them

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
said cuz I don't see any reason for them

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.899 
said cuz I don't see any reason for them
to<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:02.190> lie<00:01:04.430> that

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.230 

um<00:01:10.689> his<00:01:11.200> his<00:01:11.560> parents<00:01:12.189> were<00:01:12.340> killed<00:01:12.579> by<00:01:12.909> a

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
um his his parents were killed by a

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.370 
um his his parents were killed by a
firebender<00:01:14.249> like<00:01:15.249> he<00:01:15.399> said<00:01:15.749> which<00:01:16.749> was<00:01:16.990> yacon

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
firebender like he said which was yacon

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.679 
firebender like he said which was yacon
and<00:01:17.740> his<00:01:18.039> mother<00:01:18.780> later<00:01:19.780> on<00:01:21.119> then<00:01:22.119> tarlac

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
and his mother later on then tarlac

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:23.849 
and his mother later on then tarlac
would<00:01:22.840> have<00:01:22.929> gone<00:01:23.079> to<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.439> Northern<00:01:23.829> Water

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
would have gone to the Northern Water

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:27.419 
would have gone to the Northern Water
Tribe<00:01:24.539> and<00:01:25.539> he<00:01:25.840> would<00:01:25.990> have<00:01:26.079> become<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:27.100> you

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
Tribe and he would have become the you

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.330 
Tribe and he would have become the you
know<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.670> man<00:01:27.819> he<00:01:28.000> is<00:01:28.030> now<00:01:28.329> on<00:01:28.659> the<00:01:29.619> council

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.819 
know the man he is now on the council
and<00:01:30.369> why<00:01:30.549> not<00:01:30.789> an<00:01:31.289> almond<00:01:32.289> might<00:01:32.619> have<00:01:32.740> been

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
and why not an almond might have been

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.999 
and why not an almond might have been
taken<00:01:33.250> under<00:01:33.420> by<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.479> Kyoshi<00:01:35.020> warriors<00:01:38.009> which

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
taken under by the Kyoshi warriors which

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.399 
taken under by the Kyoshi warriors which
would<00:01:39.189> explain<00:01:39.219> why<00:01:39.909> he<00:01:40.450> knows<00:01:40.689> how<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.109> do<00:01:41.319> the

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
would explain why he knows how to do the

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.190 
would explain why he knows how to do the
Chi<00:01:41.590> blocking<00:01:42.069> because<00:01:43.030> ty<00:01:43.479> lee<00:01:43.689> had<00:01:43.959> joined

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
the last airbender so that's my theory I

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.429 
the last airbender so that's my theory I
wanted<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.479> record<00:01:55.750> this<00:01:55.929> and<00:01:56.079> make<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.229> video

everything over and over and over and

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.240 
everything over and over and over and
over<00:02:02.229> again<00:02:02.759> also<00:02:03.759> a<00:02:04.149> side<00:02:04.689> note<00:02:05.129> see<00:02:06.129> these

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
over again also a side note see these

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.090 
over again also a side note see these
little<00:02:06.399> stars<00:02:06.789> um

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.440 

in<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.820> promise<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:17.050> fire<00:02:17.940> nation<00:02:18.940> colonies

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
in the promise the fire nation colonies

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.050 
in the promise the fire nation colonies
wouldn't<00:02:20.110> leave<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.470> earth<00:02:20.500> nation<00:02:21.060> because

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
wouldn't leave the earth nation because

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.610 
wouldn't leave the earth nation because
they<00:02:22.240> had<00:02:22.390> become<00:02:22.750> family<00:02:23.410> members<00:02:23.920> there<00:02:24.160> and

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
they had become family members there and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.620 
they had become family members there and
that<00:02:26.620> would<00:02:26.710> explain<00:02:27.010> maybe<00:02:27.370> why<00:02:27.760> amok<00:02:28.210> oh<00:02:28.240> and

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
that would explain maybe why amok oh and

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.630 
that would explain maybe why amok oh and
Bolin<00:02:29.080> are<00:02:29.760> both<00:02:30.760> far<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.650> earthbenders<00:02:32.650> um

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
Bolin are both far and earthbenders um

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.540 
Bolin are both far and earthbenders um
it<00:02:34.270> also<00:02:34.510> explains<00:02:34.720> why<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:35.200> saw<00:02:35.620> me<00:02:35.680> has<00:02:36.070> green

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
it also explains why I saw me has green

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.670 
it also explains why I saw me has green
eyes<00:02:36.700> like<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.180> fart<00:02:37.420> like<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.900> earth<00:02:38.320> nation

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680
