I'm<00:00:57.180> working<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.199> been<00:00:58.260> working<00:00:58.710> on

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
I'm working on and have been working on

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.039 
I'm working on and have been working on
now<00:00:59.850> each<00:01:00.210> page<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:01.670> different<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.969> that

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
now each page is different and that

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.219 
now each page is different and that
really<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.589> make<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.309> best<00:01:05.939> value<00:01:06.229> that

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
really is to make it the best value that

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.530 
really is to make it the best value that
I<00:01:07.260> could<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.580> might<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.850> little<00:01:09.060> hard<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
I could so it might be a little hard to

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.289 
I could so it might be a little hard to
decide<00:01:10.110> which<00:01:10.409> side<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.920> use<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:11.549> anyway

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
decide which side to use but anyway

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.730 
decide which side to use but anyway
