00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.890
 hello friends this time I'm going to 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:09.790
 show what is the maximum speed of 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.940
 a w hundred second 2015 good to see 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.370
 this to see how it raises butt so 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.400
 Regular not run but if I want to see 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.840
 see nothing has come to give me 100 equal and 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.840
 it happens the same and gives them back 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.430
 to me 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:44.330
 well it was the top but it came to 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.040
 90 as it says a lot of technique but given me 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.110
 I think the 100 but in this one field 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.580
 longer because I think the motorcycle 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.580
 run good 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.000
 and it feels good there are many who say 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.000
 what 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.470
 what italic vibrates a lot 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.000
 after 60 80 kilometers per hour 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.810
 but I do not vibrate in what 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.179
 particular does not spare me anything 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.450
 and going to 100 what it is that the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:17.489
 machine is forced what I want to leave 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:20.420
 in clear is that this one is good this 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.110
 scooter is not made for 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.540
 to run like that you want to run 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:32.530
 buy yourself a 250 zo one press 200 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.530
 you want to feel more speed 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.340
 I tell them that the motorcycle calls for five 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.920
 thousand four hundred kilometers has 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:47.030
 responded very well the ground so much 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:50.170
 ugly terrain like right now that is that 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.170
 what is pavement 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.930
 the fact sheet does not lie what I 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.680
 like the double times they raise 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.879
 the speed is faster than those 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.189
 it is all day today friends and 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.549
 I hope and you liked me 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:15.299
 they left in the comments they want 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.350
 to show me the bike in a very climb 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.540
 inclined 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.650
 I have not had the chance to go but 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.050
 where my my grandparents live is this in 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.210
 cuautepec 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.520
 by the North Prison then there's 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.710
 super steep climbs 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.270
 and this I have climbed the bike without 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.270
 passengers 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.830
 it has gone up to me at a speed of 35 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:43.360
 kilometers per hour 30 to 35 kilometers 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.810
 he does not try hard I did not have to go down 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.810
 Push 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.510
 and this 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.000
 What I do not recommend is uploading 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.380
 I believe that for a passenger it goes up but 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.380
 if the motorcycle would be forced 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:06.170
 right now I'm in tecÃ¡mac heroes 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.170
 he comes to leave a money 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.130
 since it has 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.900
 this is like normal injuries 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.900
 100% recommendable 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.900
 well for those who are hesitating 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.430
 buy it so I do not do the videos for 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.270
 prove that italics are better than 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:36.180
 yamaha because you have to put your feet in 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.340
 the earth I know that no but I do them 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.820
 to defend those of us who have 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.520
 imply that sometimes they try to 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:49.249
 humiliate us the times on yamaha yo 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:52.339
 I had a Yamaha r 15 and I was never this one 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:55.159
 I never tried to feel superior 

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:57.249
 have a more expensive motorbike to the contrary 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:00.849
 so I always get to help is 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:00.849
 whenever I killed someone 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.730
 I try to help in what I can push 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.550
 because then in this of the bikes I think 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.850
 that we are all one, maybe today you are 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.100
 there was still a stranger and one 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.810
 help but tomorrow it may be you who is 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.560
 is your motorcycle and I do not think you'll like it 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:23.160
 that happen and then you need help and no no 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.160
 give it to you 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.210
 that's all for today's friends and 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.750
 I will try to upload the video of the 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.700
 rise and so that they see no 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.850
 I have to push down or anything 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.850
 that
