00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.270 
you guys how you should spray I have a
standard<00:04:03.480> spray<00:04:04.050> bottle<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.680> little<00:04:05.100> tiny<00:04:05.550> one

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
standard spray bottle a little tiny one

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.039 
standard spray bottle a little tiny one
I<00:04:08.280> don't<00:04:08.790> spray<00:04:09.090> on<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.269> glass<00:04:09.480> walls<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:09.930> I

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
I don't spray on the glass walls that I

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.259 
I don't spray on the glass walls that I
don't<00:04:10.440> need<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.860> in<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.160> these<00:04:11.610> water<00:04:11.910> marks

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
don't need to in it these water marks

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.830 
don't need to in it these water marks
what<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.450> do<00:04:12.540> do<00:04:12.900> is<00:04:13.110> spray<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:13.920> substrate

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
what I do do is spray the substrate

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.360 
what I do do is spray the substrate
because<00:04:15.840> it<00:04:15.959> is<00:04:16.080> coconut<00:04:16.350> fiber<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.190> tree

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
because it is coconut fiber and tree

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.690 
because it is coconut fiber and tree
bark

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
bark

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.460 
bark
no<00:04:18.850> I<00:04:18.880> didn't<00:04:19.120> mention<00:04:19.270> that<00:04:19.480> earlier<00:04:19.540> I<00:04:20.230> just

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
no I didn't mention that earlier I just

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.900 
no I didn't mention that earlier I just
make<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.010> tune<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.250> make<00:04:21.520> it<00:04:21.640> a<00:04:21.670> little<00:04:21.730> more

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
make the tune to make it a little more

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.380 
make the tune to make it a little more
realistic<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:24.750> spray<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.900> substrate<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:28.270> it

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
realistic I spray the substrate and it

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:35.730 
realistic I spray the substrate and it
stays<00:04:28.630> wet<00:04:28.960> for<00:04:28.990> about<00:04:29.440> two<00:04:29.620> hours<00:04:29.650> I<00:04:34.740> make

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
stays wet for about two hours I make

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.260 
stays wet for about two hours I make
sure<00:04:35.890> everything<00:04:36.100> is<00:04:36.340> wet<00:04:39.000> make<00:04:40.000> sure<00:04:40.180> this

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
sure everything is wet make sure this

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.370 
sure everything is wet make sure this
tree<00:04:40.540> bark<00:04:40.750> is<00:04:40.990> wet<00:04:42.240> then<00:04:43.240> I<00:04:43.630> usually<00:04:43.900> do<00:04:44.260> it

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
tree bark is wet then I usually do it

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.430 
tree bark is wet then I usually do it
faster<00:04:44.800> but<00:04:44.980> I<00:04:45.190> enclose<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:45.880> top<00:04:46.200> first<00:04:47.200> put

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
faster but I enclose the top first put

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:55.880 
faster but I enclose the top first put
the<00:04:47.530> widdle<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:48.040> mean<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.460> fire<00:04:48.700> stage<00:04:49.660> top

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.350 

then<00:04:56.890> I<00:04:57.040> put<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.370> plastic<00:04:57.910> plate<00:04:58.030> on<00:04:58.810> top<00:05:00.360> the

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
then I put the plastic plate on top the

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.010 
then I put the plastic plate on top the
two<00:05:01.540> other<00:05:01.750> sides<00:05:03.420> and<00:05:04.420> then<00:05:04.570> one<00:05:04.810> in<00:05:04.930> the

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
two other sides and then one in the

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.880 
two other sides and then one in the
center<00:05:06.720> once<00:05:07.720> again<00:05:08.020> I<00:05:08.050> do<00:05:08.200> this<00:05:08.470> to<00:05:08.650> keep<00:05:08.830> the

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
center once again I do this to keep the

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.080 
center once again I do this to keep the
humidity<00:05:09.250> in<00:05:11.430> because<00:05:12.430> when<00:05:12.700> you<00:05:12.820> when<00:05:13.060> I

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
humidity in because when you when I

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.910 
humidity in because when you when I
didn't<00:05:13.450> have<00:05:13.600> it<00:05:13.780> before<00:05:13.870> I<00:05:14.410> would<00:05:14.470> be<00:05:14.710> having

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
didn't have it before I would be having

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.490 
didn't have it before I would be having
to<00:05:15.130> spray<00:05:15.370> every<00:05:15.820> half<00:05:16.600> hour<00:05:16.840> because<00:05:17.230> the

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
to spray every half hour because the

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.890 
to spray every half hour because the
lamp<00:05:17.710> got<00:05:17.920> so<00:05:18.130> hot<00:05:18.310> that<00:05:18.340> it<00:05:18.610> would<00:05:18.760> burn<00:05:19.660> up

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
lamp got so hot that it would burn up

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.210 
lamp got so hot that it would burn up
any<00:05:20.080> moisture<00:05:20.290> that<00:05:20.620> was<00:05:20.740> in<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:20.950> tank<00:05:23.220> and

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
any moisture that was in the tank and

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.080 
any moisture that was in the tank and
now<00:05:24.580> you<00:05:24.670> should<00:05:24.880> see<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:27.250> humidity<00:05:27.640> gauge

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
now you should see the humidity gauge

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.210 
now you should see the humidity gauge
will<00:05:28.810> start<00:05:29.080> going<00:05:29.380> up<00:05:29.530> a<00:05:29.680> little<00:05:29.830> by<00:05:29.980> little

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
will start going up a little by little

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:37.190 
will start going up a little by little
there<00:05:30.730> it<00:05:30.820> goes

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.750 

there<00:05:37.860> there<00:05:38.190> it's<00:05:38.370> movin<00:05:40.190> and<00:05:41.190> if<00:05:41.340> I<00:05:41.460> wanted

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
there there it's movin and if I wanted

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.310 
there there it's movin and if I wanted
to<00:05:41.880> get<00:05:42.030> more<00:05:42.240> humid<00:05:42.600> in<00:05:42.690> the<00:05:42.780> tank<00:05:43.020> I<00:05:43.170> would

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
to get more humid in the tank I would

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.470 
to get more humid in the tank I would
just<00:05:43.440> move<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:43.770> lamp<00:05:43.980> up<00:05:44.160> a<00:05:44.250> little<00:05:44.430> bit<00:05:44.640> which

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
just move the lamp up a little bit which

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.410 
just move the lamp up a little bit which
I<00:05:45.660> probably<00:05:45.960> want<00:05:46.590> a<00:05:46.650> few<00:05:49.550> that's<00:05:50.550> about<00:05:50.880> it<00:05:51.210> my
