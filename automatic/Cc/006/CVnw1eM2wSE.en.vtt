00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.280
 I want to talk to you about this video 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.340
 I speak the insulin index movie 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.139
 actually almost the last nail 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.150
 I know how much we need yes 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.890
 I want to do it again with so much 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.050
 Overweight died there we need 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.689
 maybe a little bit more the last one 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.680
 Sargagel can be there for this app 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.609
 child slow carb diets and so on 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.430
 and what is the theory about ? 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.320
 many of these low carb diets so 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.380
 also and kings I have to talk about it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.870
 is too much insulin that leads 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.000
 to diabetes overweight of manz 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.219
 can lose weight and so on 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.770
 that's why foods should eat the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.600
 Avoid carbohydrates as much as possible 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.940
 so that you should see the reactions in the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.850
 Body as well as zero is so 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.390
 if possible you will just be fat in the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.010
 Klose comes or ends in mild forms 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.640
 Keep insulin as much as possible 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.290
 but rand produces exactly and also 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.930
 in others every one is slim in sleep 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.119
 it already reads that only three 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.520
 to eat meals a day as we the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.840
 Insulin in the blood is not taken off 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.210
 well it's even quite a while further 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.909
 what is the insulin index and more people 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.689
 know this chemical index in the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.729
 The reaction of the blood sugar level 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.890
 measured on specific foods 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.369
 has been 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.820
 That is, the white bread was easy with 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.439
 the index rated 100 and others 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.840
 food then settle down 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.790
 below or above depending on whether 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.700
 they have a stronger reaction to 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.649
 Blood sugar causes its weakness 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.829
 the insulin index also knows it with white and 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.350
 set to 100 and paid the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.869
 insulin responses of the body to 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.430
 white bread on 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.469
 and then there are different 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.200
 gradations life the body reacts 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:08.160
 stronger with insulin on it or 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.740
 weaker is the study with 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.130
 unfortunately not quite like that 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:17.430
 detailed oldenburg 38 food 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.770
 tested and is very funny to 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.770
 example, the jelly beans so this 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.320
 phone that the corpses should him 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.800
 index of 160 have glycemic 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.870
 index of 118 so the glycemic index 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.510
 and the insulin index does not hang 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.370
 forcibly always together ever 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:44.850
 is noted for what is quite interesting 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.070
 that in many cases it is for chemical 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.000
 however, and insulin index approximately 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.160
 goes hand in hand 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.260
 but that just cheese and cheese 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.510
 so on what he should be particularly good 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:05.400
 locally have very high insulin index 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:08.220
 or exactly meat fish eggs like that 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.200
 these are the things you supposedly do 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.959
 it should not eat insulin 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.410
 is distributed 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.540
 which produce much insulin the 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.180
 I have also noticed with me because always 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.250
 if i have to milk my comics 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.440
 I did then once 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.900
 Under-sugar get why a lot of insulin 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.930
 where the out finds no blood even more 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:35.670
 where he always does oh oh well so 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.640
 small guessing game 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.790
 I'll just say something that stands out 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.780
 clear white rice has 110 glycemic 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.630
 index 79 insulin index so that it 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.770
 not surprised 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:58.910
 at 42 chemical index 31 insulin index 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:03.180
 ok cheese 55 luck less chemical index 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:08.060
 45 insulin index it will be a little more 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:12.959
 beef 21 malicious index 51 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.000
 Insulin index or fruit is also 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.599
 relatively interesting for example here 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.470
 bananas have 19 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:24.580
 So it's not that surprising 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:29.389
 here so exactly for example 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:33.669
 Oatmeal and I have 60 pp mission 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:35.690
 index 40 insulin index had so 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.610
 Have fiber-rich foods 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.319
 seemingly low hand insulin ian 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.030
 now as the actual mission index 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:43.220
 to have 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.919
 now comes the winemaker the absolute 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:52.130
 Growing I think is the white noodles 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:54.650
 So now from sophisticated mail 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.810
 should have him index of one 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.479
 chemical index of 46 and one 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:06.639
 insulin index of 14 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:10.130
 what had beef ? 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.560
 45 what shall we do with dinner? 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.860
 we will not get as a click 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:21.289
 do not get so high insulin mirror 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:22.669
 beef or noodles so this whole 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.740
 low carb diets 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.069
 I'm wondering what to do next 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.800
 want to cling to power at which 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:32.479
 the insulin stoll train is actually 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.849
 The study has long since worn off 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.300
 it's been for decades or past 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.300
 even longer 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.960
 So then what video I liked 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.960
 the thumbs up write yours 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.969
 comments here below and how 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.580
 always if you have more videos of this 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:54.440
 sort and from a diary entries 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.889
 then subscribe me 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.650
 You're welcome 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.650
 Thank you for watching it soon
