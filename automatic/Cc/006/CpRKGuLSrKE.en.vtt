just spin up for a ride on the bike just
to<00:02:01.229> check<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.680> everything's<00:02:02.369> where<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.610> can

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
to check that everything's where I can

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.580 
to check that everything's where I can
okay<00:02:03.119> anything<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:03.990> works<00:02:04.229> fine

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.160 

brakes<00:02:07.590> are<00:02:07.770> working<00:02:07.799> okay<00:02:08.750> all<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.929> gears

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
brakes are working okay all the gears

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.119 
brakes are working okay all the gears
are<00:02:10.349> indexed<00:02:10.739> properly

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.949 

housing<00:02:15.129> has<00:02:15.159> a<00:02:15.310> nine<00:02:15.549> speed<00:02:15.760> cassette<00:02:16.450> on<00:02:16.689> the

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
housing has a nine speed cassette on the

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.250 
housing has a nine speed cassette on the
back<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:18.069> back<00:02:18.219> of<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.489> bike<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.140> that's<00:02:20.140> a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
back the back of the bike so that's a

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.089 
back the back of the bike so that's a
boy

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
boy

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.729 
boy
make<00:02:21.819> sure<00:02:21.969> to<00:02:22.120> get<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.390> nine<00:02:22.569> speed<00:02:22.959> version

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
make sure to get the nine speed version

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.830 
make sure to get the nine speed version
of<00:02:24.010> these<00:02:24.159> because<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.640> different<00:02:25.420> them<00:02:25.629> does

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
of these because the different them does

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.440 
of these because the different them does
eight<00:02:26.040> eight<00:02:27.040> speeds<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:27.909> seven<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:28.359> you

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
eight eight speeds on and seven so you

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.630 
eight eight speeds on and seven so you
have<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.629> make<00:02:28.780> sure<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.049> get<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.290> nine<00:02:29.439> speed

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.530 

gives<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:35.370> changes<00:02:36.370> first<00:02:36.579> off<00:02:36.819> to<00:02:37.269> make<00:02:37.420> it

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
gives the changes first off to make it

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.069 
gives the changes first off to make it
go<00:02:37.689> back<00:02:40.739> that's<00:02:41.739> it<00:02:41.920> basically

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
go back that's it basically

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.220 
go back that's it basically
pretty<00:02:44.079> straightforward<00:02:44.439> conversion<00:02:46.230> and

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
pretty straightforward conversion and

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.539 
pretty straightforward conversion and
then<00:02:48.209> like<00:02:49.209> this<00:02:52.560> converts<00:02:53.560> over<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.280> road

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
then like this converts over to a road

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.819 
then like this converts over to a road
bike
