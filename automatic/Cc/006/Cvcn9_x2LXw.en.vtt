00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.180
 now again youtube people here 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.490
 he talks cutman 766 and in this tutorial 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.019
 I'm going to show you how to put a video of 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.019
 wallpaper in windows 7 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.620
 the main reason why I do this 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.270
 video is because my girlfriend wanted to know if 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.150
 you could put a background video of 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.640
 screen and if possible in what way 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.350
 it was done 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.149
 I know it and then I decided to do this 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.829
 tutorial to help her already 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.710
 anyone who is interested in putting 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.290
 a video of wallpaper 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.390
 and on the process that we must take to 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.790
 out to be able to do it is pretty 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.519
 easy and it's fast the only thing we have 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.320
 what to do is download this file whose 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.450
 link will be in the description of 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.140
 video 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.030
 we simply extract it 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.830
 will ask us for a password that also 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.830
 is in the description of the video 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.700
 once we have it decompressed 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.540
 we are going to find this folder and 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.480
 these two files within it 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.360
 we will work with this file that what 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.330
 going to do basically is in this menu 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.950
 by right clicking on a video we're going 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.720
 to add the option to select as 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.210
 wallpaper 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.450
 we must execute it as administrators 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.990
 because if we do not do it, this will come out 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.329
 window 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.360
 that will give us two options if continue or 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.250
 leave if we go out we go out and if 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.280
 we continue the changes that we go to 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.780
 do not go to take effect so there 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.530
 that execute it yes or yes as 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.530
 administrators 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.110
 he runs it as an administrator I will leave 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.030
 this window where I'm going to have to 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.030
 Clicking this button 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.450
 the explorer is going to restart 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.510
 we can close this 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.380
 and now here I have a video a video of 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.280
 example to put wallpaper 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.430
 I give him right click 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.959
 and here we will skip the option of 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.120
 select as wallpaper 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.459
 I'm going to select it and we'll have 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.830
 our video wallpaper in 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.680
 some computers with processors 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.640
 medium weak or little ram memory 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:41.080
 it is very possible that the video slow down 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.200
 the functions that overheat 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.160
 that you have to be careful with that I 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.470
 I trust that everyone knows their 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.710
 team and that will take care of it and that is not going to 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.610
 put this on unless you know what 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.610
 will stand it 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.100
 in case the video distracts you 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.200
 too much and do not want to use it 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.720
 they just right click on the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.360
 screen anywhere and it will come out 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.280
 this option to pause trimcyp that 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.160
 we put pause 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.350
 and ready the background video is going to pause 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.510
 and we can leave it like that 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.520
 although if we leave it like that it would not have 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.130
 It makes a lot of sense to put a background video of 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.680
 screen but we could simply 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.990
 take a capture and put it as a background 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.680
 another detail perhaps the detail more 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:39.350
 important is that they are only admitted 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:41.510
 videos in the opposite mpeg4 format if you 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.310
 we right click on a video that does not 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.320
 is the option of this format 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.870
 Select as wallpaper is not going 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.670
 to appear then if we want a video 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.590
 of wallpaper that is not in this 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.160
 format we go to our editor 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.220
 video in our formats converter 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.840
 preferred and we passed it to mp and then 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.640
 by right clicking on the option of 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.080
 selected as wallpaper will 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.060
 to leave 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.190
 if we get tired we regret 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.410
 have installed this we go to the 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.720
 folder where the file was 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.120
 we execute as administrator and 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.400
 we press the stable dreams button 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.709
 in and absolutely everything is going to be like 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.139
 I was before 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.340
 thank you very much for watching this video and we 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.340
 we see in the next tutorial 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.060
 I can not I can not I am distracted administer 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.190
 too much I can not talk I can not no 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.220
 I can not even think this is not for 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.430
 I'm going to choose another theme 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.430
 anyone
