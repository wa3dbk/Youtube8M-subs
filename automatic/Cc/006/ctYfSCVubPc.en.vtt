00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.889
 very good morning welcome to our program 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.530
 the institutes of andalusia have seen p as in the last two courses they 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.700
 incorporates a new figure to the centers it is about the social 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.159
 figure that comes to support and has complemented a work 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:21.309
 the one that goes beyond the work that many times have to develop 

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:25.739
 teachers colo student i also clear by extension with the family us 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.319
 what I say close 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:32.409
 the daily work of these social educators and know what are the 

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.530
 main lines of action that I advance are the support for teachers 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.090
 individual attention to students and family mediation 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.570
 so today we start our educational magazine 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.950
 ahead 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.360
 with this culture you have to consider conflicts as negative the 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.510
 people they knew were like as conflictive people 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.990
 Conflicts are an inherent part of the coexistence between people 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.580
 not all disagreements constitute a conflict 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.170
 well-addressed conflicts can be an opportunity to grow 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.070
 for people and change 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.730
 for groups 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.140
 this phrase 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.840
 consume is in some way what is our work within the 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.280
 educational context 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.210
 because although sometimes we are associated with some or conflictive sports or 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.490
 problematic 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.270
 Actually our work has to be guided to advise to form conscience and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.300
 We coordinate with the teaching staff and the other professionals involved 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.580
 in the socio-educational field 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.580
 nor to facilitate aspects such as coexistence 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.960
 Carmen is a social educator 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.170
 a professional profile recently implanted in educational centers 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.180
 of all andalusia 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.640
 develops its work 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.760
 in the educational team of palm of the river 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.010

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.740
 educational compensation 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.840
 the support to the tutorial function of the teaching staff 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840
 and attention to students with special educational needs 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.340
 The incorporation of the social educator in this site 2 has a significant impact on 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.149
 the whole educational community 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:19.789
 min is going to benefit g 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:22.789
 e in December much affection and and especially for 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.489
 e in the aspect of 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.489
 being feeling that advice 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.689
 that orientation that many times the family does not have and that 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.479
 orientation professionals and also many teachers themselves 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.199
 times for lack of time for 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:43.769
 it is not serious and you can not cathode what really should be devoted this 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.399
 theme family 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:50.699
 the social educator in a study and of course in an adviser not only in 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:55.139
 educational subject but also in subject of which type environment 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.909
 in the economic field in the field of professional orientation 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.119
 percent in diamond the social economic cultural labor field 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:08.809
 The social educator is a technician with specific training to perform 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.120
 Strategies and actions oriented 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.239
 to the improvement of coexistence in schools 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.239
 its activity focuses on three fundamental areas of action 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:22.549
 the support to the teaching staff the individualized attention to the students and the 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.519
 family mediation 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.199
 the support to the teaching staff 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:28.709
 inside of the 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.869
 in our framework, which are the educational guidance teams 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:36.989
 is essential especially in matters related to the area of 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.129
 transversal 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.029
 it's good with competition does in general 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:46.429
 but s cie could establish in the three blocks of culture of peace 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:49.579
 r solution of conflicts and school coexistence 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:54.029
 the figure of the educator social work of the considered very necessary 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:56.709
 percent finally move 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.429
 the reason why it will do in single-dose say that they would be 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:01.569
 specialists 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.719
 in working on one of the biggest problems we have in the centers of 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.599
 day p the problems of coexistence 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.069
 then power allow allow for more individualized attention 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:16.559
 what the one that can give is that the tudors at a given moment 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.579
 and then in that sense I have helped 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.979
 very much to have a coexistence in the center 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.409
 imma gentle 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.409
 Normal more regularized 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:40.480
 individual attention to students 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.750
 focuses on those at risk of social 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.750
 with problems of school absenteeism and coexistence 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.419
 While 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.599
 10 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.520
 two 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.449
 houston 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.430
 The social educator is also a catalyst for activities that provoke 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.710
 synergies teacher student family in cross-disciplinary matters such as 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.710
 coexistence peace, respect and nonviolence 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.219
 the objective to provide communication strategies and skills tools 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:28.050
 social to the whole educational community the coexistence workshop is oriented 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.500
 exclusively this year in first of that 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.320
 we have a very large group of students only in first of that 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:39.750
 they come from school and ati in transit they have to know the change very strong 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:42.499
 from primary to secondary 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:46.979
 and the attempt not to do just as in the dynamics of the center and if the 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.039
 resources that they can have when they arrive at the institute but which in 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.819
 the dynamics of coexistence the necessary thing that is to establish norms will learn to 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:00.489
 establish interpersonal relationships what basic social skills are 

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:04.119
 respect for fellow human rights tolerance 

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:08.139
 Family mediation is the third fundamental axis of the educator's work 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:09.770
 Social 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.889
 among the preferred centers of the educational area where Carmen works 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.139
 the school finds the boys in the Cordovan neighborhood of the same name 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.289
 center that has 80 percent of gypsy students 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.680
 now you know that even silver will always receive in any circumstance 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.139
 eto'o and especially after we take advantage of a cession of the neighborhood 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.969
 it will be a cultural week 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:36.930
 And that's why I was doing a day to tie the opportunity as educational 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.789
 I have come to do a little bit of work that has taken place in the 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:40.520
 center 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.270
 so if it appears vie 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.389
 do not go accompanied by panama 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.530
 We were going to go house to house and we are going to see the activities that are being 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.009
 doing at this moment 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:53.070
 and I think it's very important for the child I think they look some way 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:53.659
 can 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:58.179
 supported with the ones controlled a club next to the singer that the education not 

00:06:58.179 --> 00:07:01.949
 only part of the school and the teachers but also form 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:06.599
 part of the parents and the mother is involved in beni between the girl at 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:09.599
 military school or a can last some way can 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.550
 soon participated because it issues that very important I think the idea is that 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.860
 they participate integrate and that in some way they also acquire 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.550
 encouraged the patient to the fortress 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.050
 stop me the work we have to do for swords 

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:30.439
 the educational community has received this new profile with good eyes 

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:31.449
 professional 

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:34.779
 a necessary figure in educational centers 

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:38.669
 Both teachers and family and students find in the social educator 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.200
 the indispensable referent in the advice and help for the dialogue and 

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.100
 communication in order to carry out the resolution of the 

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.539
 conflicts and improve coexistence 

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:52.019
 subjects for which we are scared
