of<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.760> dam<00:02:19.660> where<00:02:19.989> we've<00:02:20.110> created<00:02:20.350> a

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
of the the dam where we've created a

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.070 
of the the dam where we've created a
plywood<00:02:20.950> background<00:02:21.670> where<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.660> lights<00:02:22.900> do

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
plywood background where the lights do

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.840 
plywood background where the lights do
not<00:02:23.110> shine<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:24.040> lights<00:02:24.250> then<00:02:24.520> would<00:02:24.700> then

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
not shine the lights then would then

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.060 
not shine the lights then would then
move<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.270> eels<00:02:25.450> towards<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.200> dark<00:02:26.650> corner

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
move the eels towards the dark corner

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.430 
move the eels towards the dark corner
through<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:28.000> suction<00:02:28.630> side<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.050> siphon

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
through the suction side of the siphon

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.260 
through the suction side of the siphon
the<00:02:29.650> siphon<00:02:30.100> then<00:02:30.220> runs<00:02:30.459> water<00:02:30.700> over<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.239> dam

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
the siphon then runs water over the dam

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.180 
the siphon then runs water over the dam
the<00:02:31.870> idea<00:02:32.140> being<00:02:32.350> is<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.770> eels<00:02:32.950> would

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
the idea being is that the eels would

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.240 
the idea being is that the eels would
enter<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.580> siphon<00:02:34.290> over<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.410> dam<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.890> then

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
enter the siphon over the dam and then

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.520 
enter the siphon over the dam and then
be<00:02:36.400> released<00:02:36.580> below<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.420> dam<00:02:37.660> we<00:02:38.050> have<00:02:38.200> an<00:02:38.350> eel

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
be released below the dam we have an eel

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.520 
be released below the dam we have an eel
trap<00:02:38.920> below<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.459> dam<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.209> we're<00:02:40.900> working

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
trap below the dam and we're working

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.780 
trap below the dam and we're working
along<00:02:41.769> with<00:02:41.800> our<00:02:42.100> partners<00:02:42.489> we<00:02:42.670> are

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
along with our partners we are

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.699 
along with our partners we are
accounting<00:02:43.269> eels<00:02:43.630> as<00:02:43.900> they<00:02:44.080> move<00:02:44.320> from

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
accounting eels as they move from

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.560 
accounting eels as they move from
through<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.190> siphon<00:02:45.640> into<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.120> lower<00:02:46.239> part

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
through the siphon into the lower part

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.990 
through the siphon into the lower part
of<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:47.010> aspect<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.100> dam<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.640> then<00:02:48.730> they<00:02:48.850> will

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
of the aspect of dam and then they will

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.180 
of the aspect of dam and then they will
be<00:02:49.120> released<00:02:49.480> from<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:49.870> location<00:02:50.380> into<00:02:51.100> the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
be released from that location into the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.979 
be released from that location into the
aspect<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.580> river<00:02:51.820> we're<00:02:52.330> using<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.630> technique

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
aspect of river we're using a technique

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.500 
aspect of river we're using a technique
called<00:02:53.049> radio<00:02:53.620> telemetry<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.760> see<00:02:54.970> if<00:02:55.239> the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
called radio telemetry to see if the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.720 
called radio telemetry to see if the
eels<00:02:55.720> pass<00:02:56.110> through<00:02:56.440> each<00:02:56.620> one<00:02:56.830> of<00:02:56.890> those<00:02:57.100> so

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
eels pass through each one of those so

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.729 
eels pass through each one of those so
the<00:02:57.880> eels<00:02:58.120> haven't<00:02:58.959> surgically<00:02:59.590> implanted

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
the eels haven't surgically implanted

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.789 
the eels haven't surgically implanted
inside<00:03:00.250> them<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.970> little<00:03:01.600> tag<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.170> emits<00:03:02.560> a
