hi welcome back to what the tech in this
issue<00:00:17.580> we're<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.600> talk<00:00:18.810> about<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
issue we're going to talk about the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.060 
issue we're going to talk about the
Chippewa<00:00:19.920> super<00:00:20.310> lager<00:00:21.439> this<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.619> going<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.980> be

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
Chippewa super lager this is going to be

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.279 
Chippewa super lager this is going to be
the<00:00:23.189> first<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.609> four<00:00:23.880> issues<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:25.170> we

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
the first of four issues that we

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.650 
the first of four issues that we
discussed<00:00:25.769> these<00:00:25.949> Chippewa<00:00:26.430> super<00:00:26.820> lager<00:00:27.000> and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
discussed these Chippewa super lager and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.900 
discussed these Chippewa super lager and
today<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.470> would<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.039> tell<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.519> what

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
today I would like to tell you what

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.849 
today I would like to tell you what
makes<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.300> super<00:00:30.689> lager<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.170> super<00:00:31.650> lager

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
makes this super lager a super lager

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.950 
makes this super lager a super lager
because<00:00:32.520> it's<00:00:32.669> not<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.149> regular<00:00:33.480> order<00:00:33.809> it

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
because it's not just a regular order it

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.549 
because it's not just a regular order it
is<00:00:34.260> super<00:00:35.630> what<00:00:36.630> makes<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.960> super<00:00:37.260> lager<00:00:37.469> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
is super what makes this super lager a
