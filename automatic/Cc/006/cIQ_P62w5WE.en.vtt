great<00:00:20.130> offroad<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.910> feels<00:00:21.150> like<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> motocross

great offroad it feels like a motocross
bike<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.560> very<00:00:22.769> high<00:00:23.010> revving<00:00:23.490> engine

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
bike it's a very high revving engine

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.820 
bike it's a very high revving engine
that<00:00:24.210> works<00:00:24.539> best<00:00:24.869> when<00:00:25.080> you've<00:00:25.230> got<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.619> in

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
that works best when you've got it up in

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.730 
that works best when you've got it up in
ours<00:00:26.189> doesn't<00:00:27.150> quite<00:00:27.420> have<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.750> bottom<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.590> at

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
ours doesn't quite have the bottom in at

ours doesn't quite have the bottom in at
mid-range<00:00:28.890> as<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> Kawasaki<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> little

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
mid-range as the Kawasaki but a little

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.840 
mid-range as the Kawasaki but a little
clutch<00:00:31.260> action<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> lot<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.040> throttle<00:00:32.219> takes

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
clutch action a lot of throttle takes

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.150 
clutch action a lot of throttle takes
care<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> all<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:33.750> me<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.410> actually<00:00:34.710> don't

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
care of all that for me I actually don't

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.220 
care of all that for me I actually don't
prefer<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.910> engine<00:00:36.210> as<00:00:36.360> much<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.809> do<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
prefer the engine as much as I do the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.130 
prefer the engine as much as I do the
Kawasaki<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:38.730> Giri<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.210> also<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> Yamaha

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
Kawasaki the Giri and also on the Yamaha

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.049 
Kawasaki the Giri and also on the Yamaha
is<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> little<00:00:40.620> tall<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.250> trail<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.820> had

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
is a little tall for the trail so it had

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.819 
is a little tall for the trail so it had
a<00:00:42.090> little<00:00:42.210> bit<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.540> tendency<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> stall<00:00:43.350> but

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
a little bit of a tendency to stall but

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.799 
a little bit of a tendency to stall but
I<00:00:43.890> think<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> fuel<00:00:44.670> injection<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.239> calibrated

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
I think the fuel injection is calibrated

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.319 
I think the fuel injection is calibrated
those<00:00:45.930> slight<00:00:46.260> bit<00:00:46.410> better<00:00:47.090> braking<00:00:48.090> is

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
those slight bit better braking is

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.130 
those slight bit better braking is
topknot<00:00:49.579> brakes<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.789> both<00:00:50.969> bikes<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.480> really

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
topknot brakes on both bikes are really

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.139 
topknot brakes on both bikes are really
good<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.530> think<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.640> an<00:00:53.789> easier<00:00:54.090> time

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
good I think that I have an easier time

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.630 
good I think that I have an easier time
reaching<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.930> brakes<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.469> Kawasaki<00:00:55.640> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
reaching the brakes on the Kawasaki the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.849 
reaching the brakes on the Kawasaki the
Yamaha<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.570> little<00:00:57.960> bit<00:00:58.079> difficult<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.680> me

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
Yamaha is a little bit difficult for me

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.180 
Yamaha is a little bit difficult for me
to<00:00:59.190> get<00:00:59.609> my<00:00:59.820> hand<00:01:00.149> from<00:01:00.359> throttle<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.559> brake<00:01:01.890> so

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
to get my hand from throttle to brake so

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.709 
to get my hand from throttle to brake so
that<00:01:02.340> kind<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.730> messes<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.210> me<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> little<00:01:03.570> bit

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
that kind of messes with me a little bit

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.560 
that kind of messes with me a little bit
when<00:01:03.840> I'm<00:01:03.960> jockeying<00:01:04.769> around<00:01:05.060> the<00:01:06.060> big

overall on this is suspension is just

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.210 
overall on this is suspension is just
amazing<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.409> thing<00:01:10.470> will<00:01:10.770> gobble<00:01:10.950> up

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
amazing this thing will gobble up

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.950 
amazing this thing will gobble up
anything<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.030> when<00:01:12.330> you're<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.750> through

everything<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.390> working<00:01:15.689> working<00:01:16.049> I

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
everything it's just working working I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.460 
everything it's just working working I
mean<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.970> money<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.509> find<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.350> it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
mean it's just it's money I find that it

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.270 
mean it's just it's money I find that it
does<00:01:19.680> allow<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.850> straddle<00:01:21.630> ruts<00:01:22.380> quite<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
does allow you to straddle ruts quite a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190 
does allow you to straddle ruts quite a
bit<00:01:23.490> better<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.060> writer<00:01:24.450> isn't<00:01:24.750> even<00:01:25.020> hardly

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
bit better the writer isn't even hardly

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.410 
bit better the writer isn't even hardly
being<00:01:25.439> affected<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.040> great<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.610> absolutely

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
being affected it's great I absolutely

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.300 
being affected it's great I absolutely
loved<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.590> woods<00:01:28.770> environment<00:01:29.579> I

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
loved it in the woods environment I

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.740 
loved it in the woods environment I
really<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.640> way<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.909> Yamaha<00:01:33.270> handles

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
really like the way that Yamaha handles

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.080 
really like the way that Yamaha handles
of<00:01:34.320> course<00:01:34.590> royally<00:01:35.369> sucks<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.880> doesn't

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
of course royally sucks that doesn't

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.149 
of course royally sucks that doesn't
have<00:01:36.210> reverse<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.960> gets<00:01:37.110> tiresome<00:01:37.590> constantly

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
have reverse it gets tiresome constantly

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.480 
have reverse it gets tiresome constantly
manhandling<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.790> quad<00:01:39.329> turn<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.720> around<00:01:39.840> I

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
manhandling the quad turn it around I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.100 
manhandling the quad turn it around I
really<00:01:41.490> wish<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:42.329> an<00:01:42.659> off-road

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
really wish that for an off-road

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.020 
really wish that for an off-road
situation<00:01:43.740> had<00:01:43.950> reversed<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:44.520> obviously<00:01:44.880> it

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
situation had reversed but obviously it

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.340 
situation had reversed but obviously it
was<00:01:45.060> not<00:01:45.450> designed<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.259> a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
was not designed for that it's a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.170 
was not designed for that it's a
motocross<00:01:46.590> bike<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.490> other<00:01:47.640> than<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.850> this

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
motocross bike but other than that this

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.950 
motocross bike but other than that this
thing<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.659> phenomenal

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
thing is phenomenal

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.880 
thing is phenomenal
far<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.109> a<00:01:52.170> way<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.499> the<00:01:52.649> better-looking

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
far in a way this is the better-looking

off you can hook a leg around it and
basically<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.900> air<00:02:33.959> goes<00:02:34.140> work<00:02:34.410> really<00:02:34.709> well

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920

basically the air goes work really well
for<00:02:34.980> me<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.870> can<00:02:37.019> go<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.799> dunes<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.250> go<00:02:38.400> on

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
for me it can go in the dunes and go on

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.800 
for me it can go in the dunes and go on
the<00:02:38.610> motor<00:02:38.790> track<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.299> it's<00:02:39.420> shown<00:02:39.629> they<00:02:39.780> can
