the<00:02:17.390> most<00:02:17.510> part<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:18.050> do<00:02:18.110> about<00:02:18.650> half<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.730> bag

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
the most part I do about half a bag

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.270 
the most part I do about half a bag
maybe<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.450> little<00:02:20.630> under<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:21.650> I'm<00:02:21.950> going<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.160> go

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
maybe a little under and I'm going to go

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.360 
maybe a little under and I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.549> chop<00:02:23.540> these<00:02:23.750> up<00:02:23.810> now<00:02:24.260> there<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.220> go

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
ahead and chop these up now there you go

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.860 
ahead and chop these up now there you go
I'd<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.209> can<00:02:26.390> see<00:02:26.600> that<00:02:26.920> they<00:02:27.920> aren't<00:02:28.130> um<00:02:28.750> in<00:02:29.750> a

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
I'd you can see that they aren't um in a

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.680 
I'd you can see that they aren't um in a
powder<00:02:30.110> they're<00:02:30.500> just<00:02:30.530> kind<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:33.549> broken<00:02:34.549> up<00:02:36.340> so

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
powder they're just kind of broken up so

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.500 
powder they're just kind of broken up so
so<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.720> added<00:02:38.959> everything<00:02:39.319> together<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:40.730> am

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
so I added everything together I am

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.070 
so I added everything together I am
using<00:02:42.019> my<00:02:42.709> dough<00:02:42.769> attachment<00:02:43.700> on<00:02:43.880> my<00:02:44.360> mixer<00:02:44.750> to

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
using my dough attachment on my mixer to

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.740 
using my dough attachment on my mixer to
do<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.980> can<00:02:46.160> do<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:46.489> by<00:02:46.640> hand<00:02:46.970> it's<00:02:47.299> just

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
do this you can do it by hand it's just

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.830 
do this you can do it by hand it's just
really<00:02:48.230> messy<00:02:48.799> so<00:02:49.730> if<00:02:49.819> you<00:02:49.970> don't<00:02:50.150> mind<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:50.720> mean

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
really messy so if you don't mind I mean

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.020 
really messy so if you don't mind I mean
eventually<00:02:50.989> it's<00:02:51.470> going<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.709> turn<00:02:51.920> into<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.700> big

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
eventually it's going to turn into a big

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.240 
eventually it's going to turn into a big
ball<00:02:53.299> of<00:02:53.360> dough<00:02:53.829> so<00:02:54.829> if<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:54.980> don't<00:02:55.130> mind

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
ball of dough so if you don't mind

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.590 
ball of dough so if you don't mind
getting<00:02:55.400> your<00:02:55.609> hands<00:02:55.850> dirty<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.329> this<00:02:56.450> would

be a fun project for the kids to do but

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.539 
be a fun project for the kids to do but
I'm<00:02:58.519> going<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.790> go<00:02:58.910> ahead<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.120> use<00:02:59.450> my<00:03:00.109> dough

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
I'm going to go ahead and use my dough

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.020 
I'm going to go ahead and use my dough
attachment<00:03:01.660> for<00:03:02.660> my<00:03:02.780> mixer<00:03:03.109> today<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.880> want

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
attachment for my mixer today you want

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.210 
attachment for my mixer today you want
to<00:03:05.180> keep<00:03:05.750> mixing<00:03:06.049> it<00:03:06.380> until<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.920> cream<00:03:07.190> cheese

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
to keep mixing it until the cream cheese

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.180 
to keep mixing it until the cream cheese
break<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.569> a<00:03:09.530> big<00:03:10.069> ball<00:03:10.400> of<00:03:10.430> Dell<00:03:10.910> fun<00:03:11.269> so

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
break that and a big ball of Dell fun so

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.740 
break that and a big ball of Dell fun so
usually<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.340> takes<00:03:13.400> about<00:03:13.880> two<00:03:14.420> or<00:03:14.569> three

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
usually it takes about two or three

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.289 
usually it takes about two or three
minutes<00:03:14.900> for<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.560> happen<00:03:16.060> that's<00:03:17.060> what

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
minutes for that to happen that's what

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.440 
minutes for that to happen that's what
it<00:03:17.390> looks<00:03:17.540> like<00:03:17.630> all<00:03:17.810> mixed<00:03:18.140> together<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:20.239> now

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
it looks like all mixed together and now

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.770 
it looks like all mixed together and now
you're<00:03:20.959> going<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.730> roll<00:03:22.730> little<00:03:23.180> tiny<00:03:23.450> balls

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
you're going to roll little tiny balls

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.030 
you're going to roll little tiny balls
out<00:03:24.109> of<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:25.130> dough<00:03:25.690> it's<00:03:26.690> this<00:03:27.170> part<00:03:27.500> is<00:03:27.650> messy

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
out of the dough it's this part is messy

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.259 
out of the dough it's this part is messy
and<00:03:28.069> I<00:03:28.310> don't<00:03:28.489> think<00:03:28.670> there's<00:03:28.850> any<00:03:29.060> way<00:03:29.150> around

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
and I don't think there's any way around

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
balls i'm going to lay them on a cookie

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.780 
balls i'm going to lay them on a cookie
sheet<00:03:36.049> and<00:03:36.410> then<00:03:37.130> we're<00:03:37.310> going<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.459> freeze

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
sheet and then we're going to freeze

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.509 
sheet and then we're going to freeze
them<00:03:37.970> for<00:03:38.000> a<00:03:38.239> half<00:03:38.450> hour<00:03:39.100> all<00:03:40.100> right<00:03:40.280> they<00:03:40.489> are

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
them for a half hour all right they are

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.390 
them for a half hour all right they are
all<00:03:40.910> rolled<00:03:41.359> out<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:42.530> can<00:03:42.709> see<00:03:42.920> it's<00:03:43.100> a<00:03:43.220> full

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
all rolled out you can see it's a full

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.120 
all rolled out you can see it's a full
tray<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.750> doesn't<00:03:45.079> matter<00:03:45.109> how<00:03:45.680> big<00:03:45.709> you

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
tray and it doesn't matter how big you

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.819 
tray and it doesn't matter how big you
do<00:03:46.280> them<00:03:46.489> I<00:03:46.730> tend<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.690> try<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.170> make<00:03:48.380> them<00:03:48.590> a

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
do them I tend to try to make them a

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.050 
do them I tend to try to make them a
little<00:03:49.370> on<00:03:49.639> the<00:03:49.670> smaller<00:03:50.090> side<00:03:50.209> so<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:52.060> can

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
little on the smaller side so you can

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.420 
little on the smaller side so you can
kind<00:03:53.329> of<00:03:53.389> see<00:03:53.450> there<00:03:53.989> about<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.560> don't<00:03:55.280> know

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
kind of see there about I don't know

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.570 
kind of see there about I don't know
maybe<00:03:56.269> less<00:03:56.720> than<00:03:56.750> two<00:03:57.049> inches<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:58.189> they

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
maybe less than two inches and they

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.970 
maybe less than two inches and they
aren't<00:03:59.090> perfect<00:03:59.870> by<00:04:00.140> any<00:04:00.170> means<00:04:00.409> but<00:04:00.830> I'm

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
aren't perfect by any means but I'm

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.649 
aren't perfect by any means but I'm
going<00:04:01.159> to<00:04:01.220> go<00:04:01.340> ahead<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.549> throw<00:04:01.909> these<00:04:02.180> in<00:04:02.540> the

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
going to go ahead and throw these in the

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:03.000 
going to go ahead and throw these in the
fries

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
fries

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.119 
fries
and<00:04:03.250> let<00:04:03.400> them<00:04:03.549> freeze<00:04:03.879> from<00:04:04.470> at<00:04:05.470> least<00:04:05.739> a<00:04:05.950> half

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
and let them freeze from at least a half

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.690 
and let them freeze from at least a half
hour<00:04:06.360> so<00:04:07.360> from<00:04:07.870> half<00:04:08.230> hour<00:04:08.409> to<00:04:08.769> about<00:04:09.250> an<00:04:09.549> hour

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
hour so from half hour to about an hour

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.490 
hour so from half hour to about an hour
or<00:04:09.849> so<00:04:10.000> I'm<00:04:10.659> pretty<00:04:10.870> sure<00:04:11.110> you<00:04:11.230> could<00:04:11.379> even

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
or so I'm pretty sure you could even

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.679 
or so I'm pretty sure you could even
leave<00:04:11.739> them<00:04:11.890> in<00:04:12.010> overnight<00:04:12.370> now<00:04:13.209> we<00:04:13.269> are<00:04:13.659> going

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689 
leave them in overnight now we are going

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:17.039 
leave them in overnight now we are going
to<00:04:14.170> melt<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.799> almond<00:04:15.159> bark<00:04:15.370> inside<00:04:16.299> a<00:04:16.660> double

to melt the almond bark inside a double
boiler<00:04:17.260> I<00:04:17.769> usually<00:04:18.459> do<00:04:18.940> a<00:04:19.299> small<00:04:19.870> pot<00:04:20.139> of<00:04:20.260> water

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
boiler I usually do a small pot of water

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.730 
boiler I usually do a small pot of water
boiling<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.340> then<00:04:21.489> place<00:04:21.850> a<00:04:22.120> glass<00:04:22.740> dish

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
boiling and then place a glass dish

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.650 
boiling and then place a glass dish
right<00:04:23.979> on<00:04:24.160> top<00:04:24.400> I<00:04:24.610> just<00:04:24.789> feel<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.030> a<00:04:25.240> smaller

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
right on top I just feel that a smaller

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.029 
right on top I just feel that a smaller
Bowl<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.289> a<00:04:26.350> lot<00:04:27.190> easier<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.760> get<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:29.039> balls

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
Bowl is a lot easier to get the balls

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.980 
Bowl is a lot easier to get the balls
coated<00:04:30.490> with<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.669> chocolate<00:04:30.970> so<00:04:31.690> I'm<00:04:31.810> going

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
coated with the chocolate so I'm going

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.450 
coated with the chocolate so I'm going
to<00:04:32.050> go<00:04:32.169> ahead<00:04:32.199> and<00:04:32.410> wait<00:04:32.680> for<00:04:32.889> that<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.039> boil

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
to go ahead and wait for that to boil

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.939 
to go ahead and wait for that to boil
and<00:04:33.760> then<00:04:33.789> I'm<00:04:34.120> going<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.300> put<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:35.710> chocolate

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
and then I'm going to put the chocolate

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.719 
and then I'm going to put the chocolate
pieces<00:04:36.840> into<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:37.960> hole<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.380> started<00:04:39.130> off<00:04:39.280> with

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
pieces into the hole I started off with

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.890 
pieces into the hole I started off with
eight<00:04:40.500> chunks<00:04:41.500> of<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:43.000> white<00:04:43.180> chocolate<00:04:43.389> then

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
eight chunks of the white chocolate then

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.890 
eight chunks of the white chocolate then
I<00:04:43.930> will<00:04:44.410> add<00:04:44.650> more<00:04:45.039> if<00:04:45.280> I<00:04:45.460> need<00:04:45.669> to<00:04:45.699> but<00:04:45.880> I<00:04:46.419> try

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
I will add more if I need to but I try

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.270 
I will add more if I need to but I try
to<00:04:46.960> only<00:04:47.169> melt<00:04:47.470> what<00:04:47.650> I'm<00:04:47.770> going<00:04:47.949> to<00:04:48.010> end<00:04:48.160> up

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
to only melt what I'm going to end up

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.390 
to only melt what I'm going to end up
using<00:04:48.520> so<00:04:49.090> that<00:04:49.270> I'm<00:04:49.360> not<00:04:49.510> wasting<00:04:49.750> any<00:04:50.400> make

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
using so that I'm not wasting any make

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.400 
using so that I'm not wasting any make
sure<00:04:51.580> you<00:04:51.729> keep<00:04:52.090> stirring<00:04:52.750> your<00:04:52.930> chocolate

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
sure you keep stirring your chocolate

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.379 
sure you keep stirring your chocolate
until<00:04:53.770> it<00:04:53.979> is<00:04:54.190> melted<00:04:54.760> and<00:04:54.880> then<00:04:55.060> you're<00:04:55.240> going

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
until it is melted and then you're going

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.230 
until it is melted and then you're going
to<00:04:55.449> lower<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:55.900> heat<00:04:56.169> it's<00:04:57.100> just<00:04:57.639> about<00:04:57.940> there

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
to lower the heat it's just about there

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.500 
to lower the heat it's just about there
there's<00:04:58.510> still<00:04:58.780> a<00:04:58.810> few<00:04:59.580> lumps<00:05:00.580> I'm<00:05:00.940> just<00:05:01.240> going

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
there's still a few lumps I'm just going

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.050 
there's still a few lumps I'm just going
to<00:05:01.570> continue<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:02.139> stir<00:05:02.500> it<00:05:02.680> I<00:05:02.919> did<00:05:03.580> lower<00:05:03.820> the

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
to continue to stir it I did lower the

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.719 
to continue to stir it I did lower the
heat<00:05:04.300> because<00:05:04.570> it<00:05:04.720> started<00:05:05.080> to<00:05:05.550> get<00:05:06.550> pretty

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
heat because it started to get pretty

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.529 
heat because it started to get pretty
hot<00:05:07.060> pretty<00:05:07.389> fast<00:05:07.720> so<00:05:08.080> even<00:05:09.039> though<00:05:09.539> the

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
hot pretty fast so even though the

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.480 
hot pretty fast so even though the
chunks<00:05:10.960> are<00:05:11.080> pretty<00:05:11.289> big<00:05:11.500> I<00:05:11.800> mean<00:05:12.190> you<00:05:12.310> can

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
chunks are pretty big I mean you can

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.730 
chunks are pretty big I mean you can
chop<00:05:12.760> them<00:05:12.970> it'll<00:05:13.150> definitely<00:05:14.050> make<00:05:14.410> this

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
chop them it'll definitely make this

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.670 
chop them it'll definitely make this
process<00:05:15.010> a<00:05:15.280> lot<00:05:15.520> faster<00:05:15.760> I<00:05:16.270> just<00:05:16.990> choose<00:05:17.320> to

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
process a lot faster I just choose to

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.510 
process a lot faster I just choose to
wait<00:05:17.889> it<00:05:18.039> out<00:05:19.169> now<00:05:20.169> you<00:05:20.229> need<00:05:20.680> to<00:05:20.710> coat<00:05:21.160> your

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
wait it out now you need to coat your

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.350 
wait it out now you need to coat your
Oreo<00:05:22.030> balls<00:05:22.180> in<00:05:22.630> white<00:05:23.560> chocolate<00:05:23.590> do<00:05:24.099> one

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
Oreo balls in white chocolate do one

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.719 
Oreo balls in white chocolate do one
one-handed<00:05:25.560> so<00:05:26.560> go<00:05:26.919> ahead<00:05:27.010> and<00:05:27.130> drop<00:05:27.400> it<00:05:27.610> in

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
one-handed so go ahead and drop it in

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:36.960 
one-handed so go ahead and drop it in
and<00:05:28.260> then<00:05:29.260> just<00:05:29.919> give<00:05:30.130> it<00:05:30.250> a<00:05:30.400> quick<00:05:30.960> toss<00:05:35.970> want

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
and then just give it a quick toss want

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.460 
and then just give it a quick toss want
to<00:05:37.060> pick<00:05:37.210> it<00:05:37.240> up<00:05:37.560> and<00:05:38.560> drop<00:05:38.949> it<00:05:39.220> right<00:05:39.250> on<00:05:39.669> to

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
to pick it up and drop it right on to

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.650 
to pick it up and drop it right on to
purchase<00:05:41.470> so<00:05:42.400> that's<00:05:42.669> what<00:05:43.330> they<00:05:43.449> look<00:05:43.599> like

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
purchase so that's what they look like

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.779 
purchase so that's what they look like
after<00:05:44.050> I've<00:05:44.410> dipped<00:05:44.770> them<00:05:45.010> I'm<00:05:45.250> going<00:05:45.580> to<00:05:45.669> put

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
after I've dipped them I'm going to put

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.060 
after I've dipped them I'm going to put
them<00:05:45.880> in<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.120> fridge<00:05:46.330> for<00:05:46.659> about<00:05:47.070> 15-20

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
them in the fridge for about 15-20

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.740 
them in the fridge for about 15-20
minutes<00:05:48.610> so<00:05:48.789> that<00:05:48.820> the<00:05:49.060> chocolate<00:05:49.449> can<00:05:49.599> get

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
minutes so that the chocolate can get

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.020 
minutes so that the chocolate can get
nice<00:05:49.900> and<00:05:49.930> hard<00:05:50.229> it's<00:05:51.010> like<00:05:51.430> an<00:05:51.580> eighth<00:05:51.760> of<00:05:51.940> a

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
nice and hard it's like an eighth of a

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.180 
nice and hard it's like an eighth of a
cup<00:05:52.060> of<00:05:52.449> melted<00:05:52.690> chocolate<00:05:53.289> chips<00:05:53.500> and<00:05:53.740> I'm

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
cup of melted chocolate chips and I'm

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.620 
cup of melted chocolate chips and I'm
going<00:05:54.370> to<00:05:54.400> go<00:05:54.610> ahead<00:05:54.639> and<00:05:54.880> just<00:05:55.300> drizzle

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
going to go ahead and just drizzle

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.320 
going to go ahead and just drizzle
chocolate<00:05:55.780> on<00:05:56.560> them<00:05:57.159> and<00:05:57.490> that<00:05:57.639> is<00:05:57.820> the<00:05:58.000> final

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
chocolate on them and that is the final

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.200 
chocolate on them and that is the final
step<00:05:58.510> so<00:05:59.080> I<00:05:59.139> hope<00:05:59.530> you<00:05:59.710> guys<00:05:59.740> try<00:06:00.490> it<00:06:00.639> and<00:06:01.120> if
