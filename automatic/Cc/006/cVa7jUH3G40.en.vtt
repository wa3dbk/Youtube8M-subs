00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.740
 this tutorial was inspired by the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.870
 gabriela melendes request that asks us 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.870
 a look for a beach cover 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.820
 Y 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.250
 there is nothing more romantic than a love of 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.930
 summer and dating on the beach for that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.540
 what we did to make a look with colors 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.730
 soft but at the same time super sexy and that 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.279
 for the textures the look really 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.850
 last on the beach and also protects you from 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.850
 sunlight 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.380
 let's start with the hair you want 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.240
 do something that is far from you 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.610
 face so you do not really have to 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.500
 worry about those sea breezes that 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.730
 sometimes you get fussed in all the hair and 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.590
 I may be more worried about 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.230
 move your hair away from your face 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.940
 really be in your teeth and here what 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.470
 what I'm doing is a high queue but 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.210
 with a fish braid because I 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.840
 It seems that it is perfect to that theme 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.460
 t-shirt 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.990
 and to be able to make my fish braid 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.879
 what I want to do is divide my 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.070
 hair in two and take from one end 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.840
 pass it to the other and then take the other 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.550
 extreme and pass the other the truth is 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.780
 super simple even simpler than 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.780
 the typical braids of 3 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.460
 once finished use spei vista 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.200
 sainz that will give you shine and you will 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.390
 control the frizz that is super super 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.390
 important with that beach climate 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.530
 but what am I doing is using a 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.909
 little this spray on all my braid 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.470
 so let 's start with our 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.940
 makeup and sunscreen is 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.860
 super important so we're going to 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.720
 start with the facebook you have 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.720
 50 sun protection factor 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.650
 although I plan to be in the shade is 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.030
 important that you apply a quantity 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.670
 considerable so you can really 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.260
 do your job and protect you do not want 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.480
 try to save with the sunscreen 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.370
 so more or less this amount is from 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.720
 you buy for your whole face and not 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.720
 forget to apply it also on your neck 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.470
 of course one what super good not 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.560
 you also do not want to face 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.560
 white 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.140
 let's not forget to also protect our 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.820
 lips and to use the berlitz band 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.110
 in oxygen that has protection factor 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.110
 solar 18 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.490
 now let's move the face of truth not 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.200
 I want to load my makeup face if 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.970
 I will be next to the beach because 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.040
 it will probably be very hot so 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.500
 I 'm just going to apply base where 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.290
 I really need it and in my case it's the 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.970
 dark circles next is going to take the powder 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.590
 side under cover and this a pole 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.450
 translucent so they do not want either 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.340
 abuse him because he can reflect the 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.990
 light action that you see whiter what 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.330
 you want to do is apply it in your area t 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.010
 this one will absorb the fat and the sight 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.010
 that you see all sweat under the sun 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.250
 we go to the eyes we want a 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.780
 super natural makeup and for that 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.820
 let's use the sextet size fits 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.980
 aysÃ©n woman sets and we're going to 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.050
 concentrate these golden shades that 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.300
 they are very natural I will start with the 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.090
 darker bronze and not apply with my 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.620
 finger on the outside of friends main 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.230
 it's like the natural shadow that I have 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.670
 now I'm going to take my smallest finger and 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.880
 I will also review it for the part 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.090
 external bottom nothing to join all the 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.090
 makeup 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.320
 next is going to take the all golden and what 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.870
 will apply in the rest of my part and 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.520
 this gives me light and shine 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.170
 finally it will take that tone similar to 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.990
 vanilla and will apply it in the arch of 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.580
 my eyebrows and in the lacrimal and 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.830
 Of course do not forget to make up your 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.390
 eyebrows is super important and more if 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.970
 They have hair collected because this 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.290
 truth is going to frame your face 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.060
 Now let's apply mask 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.370
 eyelashes and I'm using the light 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.710
 power in official black this mask 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.270
 Lashes has 5 different benefits and 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.850
 among them is that it is waterproof 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.330
 so it's ideal for situations together 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.730
 Sea 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.830
 clear this makeup is not to enter 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.240
 to the water but in case it splashes 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.890
 or the sweat will make you run 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.180
 makeup this is going to be less likely 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.459
 that run because it's waterproof 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.049
 now for the lips who used 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.150
 a flashy and real lipstick 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.980
 It will depend on you which one you like and which one 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.930
 you choose a lot depends on your skin tone 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.120
 your tastes and so on 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.710
 Now what I 'm important is the type 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.050
 of lipstick you choose at least six 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.210
 latest lipsticks, street time and smart 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.100
 it was color the Lavianese times are from 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.590
 long duration while those over 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.990
 color are much more creamy and not you 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.370
 they will last so much in this situation 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.289
 I recommend that you choose a lipstick this 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.229
 contest since it will hold much more 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.610
 under the heat and under the sun likewise 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.770
 both have many colors so 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.759
 You have to choose I chose the extra 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.759
 time in rose pine 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.669
 now another seen interesting that you can 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.830
 to give your lipstick is to apply it in your 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.780
 cheeks make two dots and then what 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.460
 unes up this will give you as 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.750
 a kind of cream blush that is 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.910
 much more natural 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.500
 equally so that it is more durable the 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.870
 makeup on the we will use 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.700
 this chic girl in blogs and that aside 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.250
 it has glowing bits that 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.290
 go super nice under the sun so what 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.850
 has the exam on the side for 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.360
 Enjoy your summer and know if you are 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.360
 next to the sea 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.550
 see you next video chao
