00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.020
 and today I bring you this makeup 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.709
 that if it's super super super simple and 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.389
 Well you'll see if we keep seeing the 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.190
 video if you like it keep watching the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.449
 video but to explain a little bit because 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.859
 I make a look so simple when it's already 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.480
 having made looks a bit more 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.039
 complicated because I do things again 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.900
 simple as well simple and basically 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.280
 because I'm starting to make a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.289
 kind of series that will try on 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.230
 how to make up big eyes because 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.680
 because I'm seeing that there's almost no 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.579
 nobody that does things of these in youtube 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.710
 for big eyes and everyone 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.920
 can see tutorials of any kind 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.890
 of clear eye that yes but it is that 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.250
 what I'm seeing and it's one thing 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.100
 personal experience is that it is very 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.379
 difficult to make shadows with a kind of 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.530
 eyes like that because it's not the same as with 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.170
 a normal eye that has cost a lot 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.579
 find him the trick and that's why 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.570
 I want to start doing a kind of 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.189
 series where to teach what it is that we 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.340
 feel good that is what we do not feel 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:13.520
 well or how to do it to make us feel 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.229
 well as you can see I have not done a 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.030
 makeup to make them smaller 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.340
 because you already know my opinion about what if 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.429
 they have them great because they teach 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.470
 even great and I like a lot to me 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:28.080
 finished then you can see it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.000
 but this is kind of wrist eye me 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.890
 love because I think you feel super 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.710
 well and over 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.110
 that is, I know you already received 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.520
 comments like how ugly your eyes are 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.780
 of stories of these but not here 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.770
 by youtube on the contrary here you tell me 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.770
 that are super pretty but 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.140
 you know he had a kind of 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.330
 trauma but it did embarrass me in a 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.310
 little bit like it somehow I'm 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.860
 starting to do this jackson 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.150
 great because highlight them and make them still 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.050
 bigger because it's something that people 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.050
 normal is not normal 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:14.400
 granda is called the normal size because 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.940
 you can already see that they occupy a lot in 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.940
 my face 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.710
 but if I tell them that if 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.840
 you have them this big because the 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.120
 enjoy and teach them to the fullest and 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.770
 Well then what if you like that 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.930
 you stay to watch the video 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.570
 I'm going to start with the always base 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.970
 makeup powders of the corrector 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.760
 I'm always not going to do anything that 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.010
 that you are not already familiar because 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.120
 well you know that I always do what 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.710
 same and because it is what to my face 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.720
 feel good you know that I think that 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.470
 everyone will do what what 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.470
 it feels good to him 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.420
 what I always do for the outlined 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.760
 is to start marking everything that would be the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.480
 lash line leaving the first 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.520
 third of the eye totally free from 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.500
 from there we started to do a little bit 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.500
 thicker and according to our taste 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.400
 once we have the line pretty much 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.590
 how we like what we are going to do is 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.750
 mark very very very weak what would be 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.200
 the direction and the angle that is going to have 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.209
 our cat's eye 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.640
 we join the end of the line with the 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.330
 outlined as if we were drawing 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.330
 a triangle 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.040
 we fill them and we have it only 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.040
 is to do the other and match them 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.240
 with a shadow of black color what 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.400
 let's do is mark the tabs 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.680
 inferiors to give us that touch of 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.050
 wrist eye that I think feels 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.320
 phenomenal and then we blur it with the 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.320
 finger 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.690
 my latest acquisition has been this 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.450
 mask and the truth is that it leaves 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.430
 lashes to die as always two 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.200
 layers on the upper lashes and a 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.150
 of quite abundant in the lower 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.150
 so that it opens us much more the eye 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.300
 a little bit of cocoa and lists 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.230
 good and you see the look has been super 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.639
 super super simple pretty fast of 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.710
 do 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.469
 we would like you to leave here below in 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.629

 always not that if not also not 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:44.999
 because I also like to know if what 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.610
 I do it works or if it only works for me 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:49.020
