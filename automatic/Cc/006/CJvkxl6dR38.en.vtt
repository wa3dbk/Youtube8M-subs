leave link in the description below of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.100 
leave link in the description below of
course<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.630> Jessica<00:00:37.079> install<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.160> accept

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
course and Jessica install and accept

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.700 
course and Jessica install and accept
now<00:00:40.110> go<00:00:40.320> download<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.770> app<00:00:42.170> so<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:43.500> us<00:00:43.590> of

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
now go download the app so it for us of

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.779 
now go download the app so it for us of
course<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.270> open<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.750> up<00:00:49.610> if<00:00:50.610> it

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
course so then just open it up if it

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.220 
course so then just open it up if it
root<00:00:51.360> access

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
root access

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.279 
root access
so<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.280> says<00:00:53.579> multi-room<00:00:54.329> silence<00:00:54.719> killed<00:00:55.020> and

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
so it says multi-room silence killed and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.709 
so it says multi-room silence killed and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
completely stuck in this like the sign

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.179 
completely stuck in this like the sign
is<00:01:20.700> valid<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.090> an<00:01:21.180> S<00:01:21.330> kernel<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.560> because<00:01:22.979> I

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
is valid like an S kernel but because I

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.160 
is valid like an S kernel but because I
have<00:01:23.460> already<00:01:23.850> Frank<00:01:24.659> occurrence<00:01:25.080> tone<00:01:25.439> I

have already Frank occurrence tone I

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.289 
have already Frank occurrence tone I
just<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.850> need<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
just do this and then you need to

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.830 
just do this and then you need to
install<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.439> multi<00:01:31.740> from<00:01:31.920> version<00:01:32.670> 28<00:01:33.150> D<00:01:33.570> at

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
install the multi from version 28 D at

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.539 
install the multi from version 28 D at
the<00:01:33.930> moment<00:01:34.290> that's<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.979> latest<00:01:35.100> version

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
the moment that's the latest version

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.780 
the moment that's the latest version
available<00:01:35.869> and<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.259> recovery<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.549> then

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
available and with the recovery so then

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.870 
available and with the recovery so then
just<00:01:39.180> install<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.280> will<00:01:41.280> download<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
system you look at a boot menu you saw

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.670 
system you look at a boot menu you saw
it<00:04:36.270> already<00:04:36.450> in<00:04:36.720> this<00:04:36.780> video

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
it already in this video

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.420 
it already in this video
but<00:04:37.800> I<00:04:37.860> will<00:04:38.040> show<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:38.460> again<00:04:43.280> so<00:04:44.280> here

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
this so it will boost the internal row

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.650 
this so it will boost the internal row
or<00:04:47.310> it<00:04:47.580> can<00:04:47.699> hit<00:04:47.880> cancel

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
or it can hit cancel

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.550 
or it can hit cancel
si<00:04:49.320> only<00:04:49.620> one<00:04:49.830> and<00:04:50.100> in<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.320> recovery<00:04:52.320> you<00:04:52.410> can

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
si only one and in the recovery you can

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.270 
si only one and in the recovery you can
also<00:04:52.710> select<00:04:52.979> which<00:04:53.729> one<00:04:53.970> should<00:04:54.210> load<00:04:54.539> and<00:04:55.280> I

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
also select which one should load and I

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.270 
also select which one should load and I
would<00:04:56.729> shoot<00:04:56.910> boot<00:04:57.270> so<00:04:57.810> your<00:04:58.590> typical<00:04:58.949> into

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
would shoot boot so your typical into

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.640 
would shoot boot so your typical into
boot<00:04:59.460> system<00:04:59.759> and<00:05:00.240> if<00:05:00.900> you've<00:05:01.050> seen<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.440> room

boot system and if you've seen that room

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.590 
boot system and if you've seen that room
you<00:05:01.800> can<00:05:01.949> double<00:05:02.250> tap<00:05:02.280> on<00:05:02.520> that<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:02.940> we'll

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
you can double tap on that and we'll

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
you can double tap on that and we'll
install<00:05:04.259> or<00:05:04.470> it<00:05:04.770> will<00:05:04.979> reboot<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.150> that<00:05:06.300> one

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
install or it will reboot to that one

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.689 
install or it will reboot to that one
just<00:05:07.620> boot<00:05:07.889> to<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.220> internal<00:05:09.210> room<00:05:10.520> because<00:05:11.520> I

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
just boot to the internal room because I

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.020 
just boot to the internal room because I
didn't<00:05:12.030> flash<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:12.300> secondary<00:05:12.780> one<00:05:13.130> and<00:05:14.130> now<00:05:14.490> you

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
didn't flash a secondary one and now you

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.529 
didn't flash a secondary one and now you
think<00:05:15.090> well<00:05:16.050> it's<00:05:16.979> non<00:05:17.639> black<00:05:17.820> screen<00:05:18.150> yes<00:05:18.389> it

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539
