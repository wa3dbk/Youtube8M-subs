it's not too far over the top that

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.050 
it's not too far over the top that

they're not stretched out too much

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.089 
they're not stretched out too much

something<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.289> that<00:01:52.380> where<00:01:52.619> there's<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
something like that where there's a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.469 
something like that where there's a
table<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.280> usually<00:01:53.580> shoot<00:01:53.729> straight<00:01:54.090> down<00:01:54.300> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
table I usually shoot straight down the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.779 
table I usually shoot straight down the
table<00:01:54.929> from<00:01:55.530> behind<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> chair<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.429> give<00:01:56.580> it<00:01:56.700> a

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
table from behind the chair to give it a

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.050 
table from behind the chair to give it a
you<00:01:57.330> know<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.780> give<00:01:57.959> the<00:01:58.110> feel<00:01:58.410> of<00:01:58.709> depth

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
you know to give the feel of depth

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
you know to give the feel of depth
because<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.209> tends<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.509> help<00:02:00.720> in<00:02:00.929> those

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
because that tends to help in those

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.150 
because that tends to help in those

shooting down the banister and blow it

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.710 
shooting down the banister and blow it
out<00:02:53.290> of<00:02:53.409> focus<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:54.370> gives<00:02:54.579> them<00:02:54.760> room<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.420> an

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
out of focus that gives them room in an

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.110 
out of focus that gives them room in an
advertisement<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.650> put<00:02:57.040> text<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:58.030> that's

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
advertisement to put text so that's

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.369 
advertisement to put text so that's
something<00:02:58.389> that<00:02:58.510> I'm<00:02:58.659> always<00:02:58.750> thinking<00:02:59.019> about

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
something that I'm always thinking about

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.729 
something that I'm always thinking about
is<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.829> what<00:03:00.519> can<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.819> do<00:03:00.879> to<00:03:01.720> give<00:03:01.959> more<00:03:02.349> to<00:03:02.650> the

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
is is what can I do to give more to the

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.220 
is is what can I do to give more to the
client<00:03:03.389> when<00:03:04.389> I'm<00:03:04.540> done<00:03:04.720> so<00:03:04.870> I'm<00:03:04.959> always

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
client when I'm done so I'm always

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.920 
client when I'm done so I'm always
looking<00:03:05.859> for<00:03:05.970> extra<00:03:06.970> pictures<00:03:07.299> at<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.720> end<00:03:07.840> I

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
looking for extra pictures at the end I

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.300 
looking for extra pictures at the end I
usually<00:03:08.200> take<00:03:08.319> about<00:03:08.500> 20<00:03:08.859> minutes<00:03:08.889> do<00:03:09.280> a

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
usually take about 20 minutes do a

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.949 
usually take about 20 minutes do a
run-through<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:10.180> just<00:03:10.720> look<00:03:10.930> for

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
run-through and just look for

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.690 
run-through and just look for
interesting<00:03:11.680> things<00:03:11.859> off<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.459> tripod

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
interesting things off the tripod

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.670 
interesting things off the tripod
because<00:03:13.090> that's<00:03:13.239> how<00:03:13.389> I<00:03:13.420> like<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.930> shoot<00:03:14.139> so<00:03:14.650> I

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
because that's how I like to shoot so I

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.559 
because that's how I like to shoot so I
can<00:03:14.889> move<00:03:15.069> around<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.700> change<00:03:16.120> my<00:03:16.299> angle

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
can move around and change my angle

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.839 
can move around and change my angle
really<00:03:16.720> quick<00:03:17.079> so<00:03:17.590> that's<00:03:18.189> what<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:18.400> look<00:03:18.609> for

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
really quick so that's what I look for

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.309 
really quick so that's what I look for
and<00:03:19.030> at<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.209> end<00:03:19.359> of<00:03:19.510> this<00:03:19.659> one<00:03:19.930> I'm<00:03:20.139> going<00:03:20.260> to

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
and at the end of this one I'm going to

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.160 
and at the end of this one I'm going to
do<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.500> walk-through<00:03:21.340> with<00:03:21.639> the<00:03:21.879> D<00:03:22.060> 3s<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.689> the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
do a walk-through with the D 3s and the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.159 
do a walk-through with the D 3s and the
14<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.650> 24<00:03:24.069> on<00:03:24.370> video<00:03:24.790> I'll<00:03:25.599> use<00:03:25.629> what<00:03:26.019> I<00:03:26.049> call

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
14 to 24 on video I'll use what I call

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.680 
14 to 24 on video I'll use what I call
my<00:03:26.919> Steadicam<00:03:27.489> it's<00:03:27.669> basically<00:03:27.940> it's<00:03:28.480> my

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
my Steadicam it's basically it's my

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.809 
my Steadicam it's basically it's my
monopod<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:30.129> then<00:03:30.280> I'll<00:03:30.400> piece<00:03:30.579> it<00:03:30.730> together

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
monopod and then I'll piece it together

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.059
