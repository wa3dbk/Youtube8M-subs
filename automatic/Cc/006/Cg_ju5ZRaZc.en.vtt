00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
we're going to do a little bit of a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.450 
we're going to do a little bit of a
quick<00:00:39.570> comparison<00:00:39.719> here<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.710> case

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
quick comparison here this is the case

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.750 
quick comparison here this is the case
that<00:00:41.489> comes<00:00:41.969> pre<00:00:42.329> bundled<00:00:42.719> with<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.899> e-reader

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
that comes pre bundled with the e-reader

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.040 
that comes pre bundled with the e-reader
it's<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> sony<00:00:45.149> reader<00:00:45.420> case<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
it's the sony reader case with the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.959 
it's the sony reader case with the
backing<00:00:46.969> suede<00:00:47.969> inserts<00:00:48.289> leather<00:00:49.289> exterior

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
backing suede inserts leather exterior

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.500 
backing suede inserts leather exterior
very<00:00:50.969> thin<00:00:52.370> this<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> case<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
very thin this is the case with the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.770 
very thin this is the case with the
light<00:00:55.910> so<00:00:56.910> we're<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.210> take<00:00:57.360> off<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
light so we're going to take off the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.070 
light so we're going to take off the
protective<00:00:59.210> static<00:01:00.210> sheet<00:01:00.449> here<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.870> is

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
protective static sheet here so this is

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.480 
protective static sheet here so this is
the<00:01:04.320> same<00:01:04.799> kind<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.100> material<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> inside

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
the same kind of material on the inside

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.950 
the same kind of material on the inside
except<00:01:08.490> obviously<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> lot

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.630 
except obviously you see you have a lot
more<00:01:10.170> electronics<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.130> mechanics<00:01:11.549> here

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
more electronics and mechanics here

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.700 
more electronics and mechanics here
because<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.479> has<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> built-in<00:01:13.260> light<00:01:13.439> we're
