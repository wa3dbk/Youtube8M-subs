00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.569
 what's up fitness joy new blog 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.710
 after a long time and finally back in 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.710
 the familiar environment 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.830
 I have now the first time 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:26.680
 used to after I left 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.279
 Counting calories stopped me 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:34.960
 to move only one bed for two weeks 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.600
 and of course I have no sport 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.739
 made and I ate that what 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.190
 was given to me 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.180
 I could not cook myself and 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.190
 I could not get up either side 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.660
 refrain when my whole family of 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.909
 I ate cake with 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:54.400
 eaten and the case is, we it 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:55.420
 that I've gained two kilos each 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.690
 week one kilo 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.299
 that means muscle mass I believe 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.860
 I did not lose after two 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:03.690
 weeks should not be the case 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.340
 his 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:13.690
 maybe minimal but I guess 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:15.190
 that the two kilos was just fat and has 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.770
 the muscle mass will be lost 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.299
 Of course even more bold than a monument 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.870
 I gained two kilos of fat at 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.210
 that's about the same as me 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.240
 every day a calorie surplus of 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.790
 I had 1000 calories as I said 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.610
 not counted but if you have one 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.710
 a surplus every day from 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.490
 1000 calories does it all in all 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.670
 Of course, 7000 and a kilogram 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.340
 body fat 7000 kilocalories 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.580
 that means I had one in total 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.950
 surplus of 14,000 thus I have 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.590
 two kilograms of body fat increased 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.510
 some stored stored that 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.730
 you can see a well on my form 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.620
 sixpack is i would say away though 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.960
 significantly less significantly less 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.630
 Of course, separation pump is complete 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.630
 out and that's why mine is from 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.849
 shit was also clear and she will 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.220
 be even crappier 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.319
 and that makes me happy I will too 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.319
 at the end of the transformation make of 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.760
 No training with it for six weeks 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.230
 you see what can happen if 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.670
 not six weeks 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.680
 how the body changes and how 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.380
 If necessary , I cut again 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.730
 I will come back and eat today 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.170
 again ye have ever 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.720
 You should know that 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.330
 Baked spaghetti bolognese with cheese 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.750
 my first meal and i'm going to 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.380
 dessert a quest bar and indeed 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.920
 here 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.310
 100 cashew this time and I will be back 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.430
 I will put him back in my ranking 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.990
 insert 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.260
 I have to say I feel 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.330
 a little stupid when I fitness rule 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.640
 eat protein bar but eat no 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.020
 you can do fitness okay 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.000
 So the rule is empty and I have to 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.380
 say that was like all the quest again 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.110
 Bars really really delicious I could 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.690
 The around the clock eat 20 pieces 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.000
 No problem at all, though 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.520
 you say that too many 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.700
 Fiber is just as bad as 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.770
 too little and therefore you should not 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.980
 more than two quest bass daily as well 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.810
 eat because of the very high fiber 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.190
 already included 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.050
 I would be the third at the moment 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.310
 Of course , that will always be the case now 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:37.510
 heavier and heavier the more I eat 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:41.000
 I mean the ranking now to make 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.370
 but I would give now to place one 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.450
 it still the banana falls on place 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.610
 three is the mix biblis and in place 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.530
 I'm in second place is the mix 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.830
 biblis and in third place is this one 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.459
 now completely cashew then came faith 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.670
 I cache there at betis and then came 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.500
 tina bad bocklet 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.209
 that's how I would judge that now 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.470
 can not remember me exactly like that 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.420
 to remember tastes 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.560
 Of course you could compare the 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.450
 Do the best if you all 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.130
 Anyway , I would have been next to each other 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.410
 only judge the taste because 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.940
 of the added values ​​and ingredients 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:22.390
 they are all very, very good 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.860
 not in vain as the healthiest 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.480
 protein bar called the world 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.300
 improves me if I'm wrong 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.919
 but as far as I know, that's something 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.009
 go find friends i want you 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:36.689
 now a little was the updates 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:39.339
 show after two weeks without training 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.710
 I did that now that I did 

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:44.860
 The diet is as good as possible 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.809
 still good, but I do not count any 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.999
 Calories and I move a lot 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:52.869
 less and that's why I have more 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:56.289
 fat is probably saying now 

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:58.059
 I once to be in comparison yes to one 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:01.839
 average people still not 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:06.460
 too much kfa but much more 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:08.259
 body fat than usual and muscle mass me 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.389
 I think the poor at all 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.099
 can not move and you can too 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.680
 a little bit see that 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.699
 I really thin winter hardly fits 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.620
 pure in the plaster 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.270
 the other poor is still because I'm with 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.330
 take over everything right now 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.149
 must and become less conscious 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:30.389
 I generally think that I am now 

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:30.389
 Slowly losing muscle mass
