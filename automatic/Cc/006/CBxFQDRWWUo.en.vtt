instead<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.100> dog<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.729> they<00:01:57.149> don't<00:01:57.329> have

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390

actually a baby albino corn snake and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.540 
actually a baby albino corn snake and
chances<00:02:51.989> are<00:02:52.140> when<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.709> buy<00:02:52.739> your<00:02:53.040> first<00:02:53.250> name

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
certainly not an adult like the one we

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.309
