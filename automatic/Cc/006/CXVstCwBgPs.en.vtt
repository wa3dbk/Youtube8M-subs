00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
blurry picture that we can't really see

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.550

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
dissecting of it in a second here really

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.200 
dissecting of it in a second here really
gives<00:01:18.869> me<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.380> decent<00:01:20.280> look<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.119> know

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.260 
this really could be you know based on
the<00:01:23.790> map<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.659> let's<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:24.990> into<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:26.180> for<00:01:27.180> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the map so let's get into the for you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.510 
the map so let's get into the for you
guys<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.350> here<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.070> what<00:01:29.430> appears

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
guys so here we are we have what appears

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.950 
guys so here we are we have what appears
with<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> lava<00:01:30.090> again<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.540> looks<00:01:30.689> like<00:01:30.810> those

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
with the lava again and looks like those

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.200 
with the lava again and looks like those
train<00:01:31.259> tracks<00:01:31.500> right<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> right<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:33.000> maybe

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
train tracks right on the right so maybe

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.670 
train tracks right on the right so maybe
it's<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.720> or<00:01:34.049> continue<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.530> whole

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
it's a or continue with the whole

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.679 
it's a or continue with the whole
transit<00:01:35.220> idea<00:01:35.520> maybe<00:01:35.729> change<00:01:36.060> oromo<00:01:36.329> involved

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
transit idea maybe change oromo involved

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.210 
transit idea maybe change oromo involved
in<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> left<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> looks<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.799> I

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
in the left it looks like it's the I

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.640 
in the left it looks like it's the I
think<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:38.880> BER<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.900> handgun<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.470> just

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
think it's BER it's the handgun you just

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.789 
think it's BER it's the handgun you just
saw<00:01:40.740> me<00:01:40.770> using<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.630> juggernauts<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.899> but

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
saw me using and juggernauts on but

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.590 
saw me using and juggernauts on but
another<00:01:44.009> perk<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.610> blurred<00:01:44.880> off<00:01:45.060> me<00:01:45.360> because

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
another perk is blurred off me because

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.380 
another perk is blurred off me because
EMP<00:01:46.140> set<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.560> off<00:01:46.680> round<00:01:47.579> 15<00:01:48.000> doesn't<00:01:48.270> mean

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
EMP set it off round 15 doesn't mean

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.060 
EMP set it off round 15 doesn't mean
much<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.780> set<00:01:48.960> rounds<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.290> anything<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
much you can set rounds to anything the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.219 
much you can set rounds to anything the
Lyle<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.520> front<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:50.939> really<00:01:51.329> dark<00:01:51.600> lava<00:01:51.869> and

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
Lyle in front is really dark lava and

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.780 
Lyle in front is really dark lava and
it's<00:01:52.380> kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.649> different<00:01:52.920> design<00:01:53.460> than<00:01:53.490> what

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
it's kind of different design than what

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.310 
it's kind of different design than what
we're<00:01:53.939> used<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.810> doesn't<00:01:55.110> mean<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
we're used to but that doesn't mean it

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.160 
we're used to but that doesn't mean it
isn't<00:01:55.439> still<00:01:55.799> wobba<00:01:56.270> in<00:01:57.270> front<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.630> us<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.990> just

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
isn't still wobba in front of us it just

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.649 
isn't still wobba in front of us it just
seems<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:59.009> know<00:01:59.130> we<00:01:59.790> have<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.240> red<00:02:00.450> light

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
seems like you know we have a red light

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.539 
seems like you know we have a red light
in<00:02:00.689> front<00:02:01.020> maybe<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.649> one<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.100> red<00:02:02.280> drops

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
in front maybe it's one of the red drops

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.819 
in front maybe it's one of the red drops
or<00:02:02.969> maybe<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.659> light<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.320> again<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.740> so

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
or maybe it's a light but again it's so

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.560 
or maybe it's a light but again it's so
damn<00:02:05.130> blurry<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.850> I'm<00:02:05.939> looking<00:02:06.210> at<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.420> in

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
damn blurry and I'm looking at this in

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.570 
damn blurry and I'm looking at this in
Vegas<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.079> well<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:07.469> even<00:02:07.710> smaller<00:02:07.829> it's

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
Vegas as well so it's even smaller it's

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.070 
Vegas as well so it's even smaller it's
not<00:02:08.789> giving<00:02:09.030> me<00:02:09.209> much<00:02:09.360> detailed<00:02:09.840> information

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
not giving me much detailed information

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.260 
not giving me much detailed information
I'm<00:02:10.979> not<00:02:11.099> sure<00:02:11.160> what<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> name<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:12.000> map

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
I'm not sure what the name of this map

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.610 
I'm not sure what the name of this map
would<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.900> tell<00:02:13.410> me

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
would be to tell me

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.820 
would be to tell me
you<00:02:13.680> guys<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:14.159> ideas<00:02:14.580> for<00:02:14.940> what<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.450> new<00:02:16.140> dlc

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
you guys is ideas for what the new dlc

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.199 
you guys is ideas for what the new dlc
zombie<00:02:17.250> map<00:02:17.430> name<00:02:17.640> should<00:02:17.879> be<00:02:17.909> in<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
zombie map name should be in the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.479 
zombie map name should be in the
comments<00:02:18.599> below<00:02:18.900> as<00:02:19.799> we<00:02:19.980> continue<00:02:20.340> looking

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
comments below as we continue looking

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.059 
comments below as we continue looking
here<00:02:20.909> at<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.480> top<00:02:21.810> right<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.200> an<00:02:22.530> odd<00:02:22.739> it

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
here at the top right is an odd it

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.009 
here at the top right is an odd it
almost<00:02:23.400> looks<00:02:23.670> like<00:02:23.760> it's<00:02:24.000> cloud<00:02:24.269> cover<00:02:24.569> which

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
almost looks like it's cloud cover which

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.240 
almost looks like it's cloud cover which
wouldn't<00:02:25.440> be<00:02:25.500> going<00:02:25.799> with<00:02:25.980> our<00:02:26.190> no<00:02:26.909> dystopic

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
wouldn't be going with our no dystopic

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.069 
wouldn't be going with our no dystopic
destroyed<00:02:29.250> apocalyptic<00:02:30.090> world<00:02:30.329> that<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:30.900> know

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
destroyed apocalyptic world that we know

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.530 
destroyed apocalyptic world that we know
and<00:02:31.110> transit<00:02:31.860> what<00:02:32.430> also<00:02:32.640> seems<00:02:33.060> odd<00:02:33.269> is<00:02:33.510> that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
and transit what also seems odd is that

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.050 
and transit what also seems odd is that
we<00:02:34.019> have<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.590> pack<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> punch<00:02:35.190> weapon<00:02:35.640> in<00:02:35.790> front

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
we have a pack a punch weapon in front

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.149 
we have a pack a punch weapon in front
of<00:02:36.150> us<00:02:36.239> but<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.810> can't<00:02:37.140> really<00:02:37.349> tell<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.890> still

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
of us but I can't really tell it still

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.119 
of us but I can't really tell it still
seems<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.579> be<00:02:38.760> our<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.659> almost<00:02:40.140> resembles<00:02:40.709> the

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
seems to be our it almost resembles the

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.589 
seems to be our it almost resembles the
black<00:02:41.489> ops<00:02:41.730> 1<00:02:42.650> camos<00:02:43.650> it's<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.069> dark<00:02:44.610> dark

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
black ops 1 camos it's that dark dark

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.099 
black ops 1 camos it's that dark dark
chrome<00:02:46.470> with<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.129> red<00:02:47.849> digital<00:02:48.359> camo<00:02:48.900> it

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
chrome with the red digital camo it

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.960 
chrome with the red digital camo it
looks<00:02:49.230> like<00:02:49.349> but<00:02:49.470> again<00:02:49.650> blurred<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.099> ship<00:02:50.340> now

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
looks like but again blurred a ship now

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.699 
looks like but again blurred a ship now
that's<00:02:51.150> why<00:02:51.329> I<00:02:51.359> continue<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.109> think<00:02:52.379> it's<00:02:52.530> on

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
that's why I continue to think it's on

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.110 
that's why I continue to think it's on
this<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.400> cry<00:02:53.549> I<00:02:53.579> don't<00:02:53.819> like<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.000> be<00:02:54.090> a

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
this and I cry I don't like to be a

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
this and I cry I don't like to be a
hundred<00:02:54.239> percent<00:02:54.359> wrong<00:02:54.629> guys<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:55.019> this

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
hundred percent wrong guys in this

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.449 
hundred percent wrong guys in this
picture<00:02:55.500> can<00:02:55.620> be<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.739> hundred<00:02:55.920> one<00:02:56.430> hundred

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
picture can be a hundred one hundred

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.099 
picture can be a hundred one hundred
percent<00:02:56.670> fake<00:02:57.090> just<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:57.480> all<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.720> rest<00:02:57.930> of

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
percent fake just like all the rest of

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.440 
percent fake just like all the rest of
them<00:02:58.230> but<00:02:58.769> it's<00:02:58.950> odd<00:02:59.129> the<00:02:59.459> cloud<00:02:59.640> covers<00:03:00.030> like

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
them but it's odd the cloud covers like

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.210 
them but it's odd the cloud covers like
that<00:03:00.659> slight<00:03:01.140> then<00:03:01.409> the<00:03:01.590> lighting<00:03:01.980> so

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
that slight then the lighting so

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.399 
that slight then the lighting so
converse<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.030> then<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.510> got<00:03:03.659> the<00:03:04.049> like

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
converse and then you got the like

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.920 
converse and then you got the like
almost<00:03:04.739> tunnel<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.370> your<00:03:05.489> right<00:03:05.670> there<00:03:05.940> is

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
almost tunnel to your right there is

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.330 
almost tunnel to your right there is
this<00:03:07.109> just<00:03:07.290> another<00:03:07.379> part<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.739> transit<00:03:08.220> that

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
this just another part of transit that

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.860 
this just another part of transit that
we<00:03:08.430> don't<00:03:08.519> know<00:03:08.730> about<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:09.180> don't<00:03:09.450> think<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:09.720> I

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
we don't know about I don't think so I

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.500 
we don't know about I don't think so I
really<00:03:10.769> highly<00:03:11.670> doubt<00:03:11.849> that<00:03:11.879> this<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.329> any

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
really highly doubt that this is any
