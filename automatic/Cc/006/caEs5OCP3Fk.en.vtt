00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:33.950
 Until the end of a wonderful dream about us with you, one I am destined to watch. 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:46.190
 We once began a story that I could not endure. 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:57.770
 Do you remember what we promised then, for the last time and for all? 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:09.910
 Only the sunset witnessed us at that time, I remember, as if everything was yesterday. 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:22.030
 I know that the day will come, and you will forget me, like a dim star, like a vague dream. 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:33.000
 But I will always be alone beside you, as your invisible and faithful companion. 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:45.220
 The fleeting life of people is short, the candles are like in the wind. 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:57.330
 Still, I will be with you always, I will save you from grief. 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:09.040
 Time flows the river, turns the wheel of fate. The dream continues every new day. 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:20.790
 Even if the bond with you is suddenly weakened, even if a gloomy day comes. 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:56.390
 Time flows the river, turns the wheel of fate. The dream continues every new day. 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:08.170
 Even if the bond with you is suddenly weakened, even if a gloomy day comes. 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:19.940
 I know that the day will come, you will remember me again. Heart tremble from anguish, tears fall. 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:31.690
 But while this day has not yet come, our bonds will remain strong.
