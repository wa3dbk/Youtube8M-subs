00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.140
 Mathematics. 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.790
 I have been teaching for the last 21 years. 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.370
 Those who love, they can not, or they do not like. 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.920
 Now there are 27 people in my class 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.550
 Many people now say, "Yes, I like math." 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.530
 [Music] 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.130
 When we started, 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.380
 The students responded very well. 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.340
 I mean, they continued to say it constantly. 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.840
 They were very excited. 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.299
 That revival was going to be seen. 

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.390
 I saw them math after hours 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.100
 I was working on it. 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.670
 They were completely buried in the whole subject. 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.910
 I think the generation we teach as per the teacher's age, 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.290
 They are very influenced by the demographic aspects of technology. 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.840
 They all have technology. 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.360
 [Music] 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.590
 They are very happy to use Khan Academy. 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.790
 They felt, yes, I could. 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.420
 I can now divide this division which I could not do before. 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.390
 I could not believe it 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.900
 They were soaked in the first day class of Khan Academy. 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.940
 The bell has fallen, but no one has the name. 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.920
 Then I was forced to say that you have to go to the next class. 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.690
 You will not be able to math here. 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.380
 I immediately understood that we were in good shape. 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.420
 It is different from math books, but when it takes me good 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.850
 Let's see that everyone is solving the same level of math problem. 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.000
 If their level was higher they would have been boring, 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.390
 If they were lower then they could not fully understand. 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.610
 Direct help from Khan Academy students 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.200
 Because everybody has the opportunity to learn in their own way every day. 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.590
 We have instant feedback here 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.460
 Work with them on their level. 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.100
 Which they will not get in the traditional lecture models. 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.870
 I have seen that everyone is working intensively in their respective fields. 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.860
 They are also very busy with math and talking about it. 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.400
 They are challenging themselves. More specifically, in maths more 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.580
 Experts can take themselves to the desired goal. 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.710
 High school students have many deficits on the basis of math. 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.120
 They have deficiencies, especially in negative numbers, fractions, decimal ones. 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.050
 After they got up in the ninth grade they think 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.570
 That's what they heard about this before and it knows it. 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.420
 But Khan is an academy, you do not know, 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.440
 Because you have given a wrong solution to the problem. 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.110
 So they face their own false self-confidence, 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.320
 And they understand that now they have to learn. 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.320
 And finally they can learn for the first time. 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.260
 Khan Academy is a very good aspect, 36 of my class instant feedbacks 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.290
 I gave up, which I could not give before. 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.980
 So everyone, getting instant feedback on any problem. 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.300
 Their misconceptions are going away. 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.570
 I think Khan Academy 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.850
 Dramatically changed their learning method. 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.120
 They now learn how to do the right way where they did not want to learn before. 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.420
 I think the biggest change 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.820
 It can be seen in their ideas. 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.150
 Students think teachers give their information 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.760
 And they are like magic and they are good. 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.690
 That Khan Academy brought a change 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.480
 Students now understand their work 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.610
 This is the search and they will be able to help. 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.674
 But in this case they have to understand their own responsibility. 

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:32.837
 [Music] 

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:37.000
 Without understanding, Khan Academy helped them understand. 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.940
 Or they help them get connected to different types of maths. 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.800
 It is very good to see them at the Khan Academy 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.436
 They search for the videos they need. 

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:50.596
 Those who learn in class again practice it again and 

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:53.536
 Volunteer is inspired by learning. 

00:03:53.536 --> 00:04:03.536
