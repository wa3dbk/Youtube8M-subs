this<00:01:47.240> time<00:01:47.540> of<00:01:47.659> year<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:49.340> for<00:01:49.790> whatever<00:01:49.940> reason

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
this time of year so for whatever reason

this time of year so for whatever reason
the<00:01:50.810> splice<00:01:51.110> tends<00:01:51.650> to<00:01:51.830> work<00:01:51.950> pretty<00:01:52.010> well

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
the splice tends to work pretty well

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.050 

again<00:02:12.530> I'm<00:02:12.680> using<00:02:15.069> hairline<00:02:16.069> dubbin<00:02:16.519> in<00:02:16.670> rust

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
again I'm using hairline dubbin in rust

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.130 
again I'm using hairline dubbin in rust
color<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.540> can<00:02:17.720> do<00:02:17.870> this<00:02:18.019> in<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.349> creamy<00:02:18.799> orange

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
color you can do this in a creamy orange

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.380 
color you can do this in a creamy orange
whatever<00:02:21.140> dubbing<00:02:21.560> you<00:02:21.680> prefer<00:02:22.099> I<00:02:22.400> just<00:02:23.209> like

whatever dubbing you prefer I just like

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.330 
whatever dubbing you prefer I just like
the<00:02:23.569> natural<00:02:26.769> dubbing<00:02:27.769> a<00:02:27.860> little<00:02:28.099> better

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
the natural dubbing a little better

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.589 
the natural dubbing a little better
through<00:02:28.910> this<00:02:29.060> fly<00:02:30.010> okay<00:02:31.120> so<00:02:32.120> I've<00:02:32.209> got<00:02:32.239> that

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
through this fly okay so I've got that

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.539 
through this fly okay so I've got that
body<00:02:32.840> dub<00:02:33.200> I'm<00:02:33.500> gonna<00:02:33.650> bring<00:02:33.860> my<00:02:33.920> rib<00:02:34.310> up

through<00:02:34.819> there<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:36.319> I'm<00:02:36.500> gonna<00:02:36.650> keep<00:02:36.890> it

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
through there and I'm gonna keep it

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.940 
through there and I'm gonna keep it
fairly<00:02:37.400> close<00:02:38.319> just<00:02:39.319> because<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.590> want<00:02:39.799> that

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
fairly close just because I want that

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.110 
fairly close just because I want that
segmentation<00:02:40.549> of<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:40.970> body<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.970> adds

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
segmentation of the body and it adds

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.880 
segmentation of the body and it adds
durability<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.019> fly<00:02:48.290> after<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.739> gets

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
durability to the fly after it gets

hammered by a bunch of big rainbows next
I'm<00:02:53.599> gonna<00:02:53.720> use<00:02:53.930> some<00:02:53.959> pearl<00:02:54.290> crystal<00:02:54.799> flash

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
I'm gonna use some pearl crystal flash

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.740 
I'm gonna use some pearl crystal flash
I'm<00:02:55.310> gonna<00:02:55.430> pull<00:02:55.670> about<00:02:55.849> three<00:02:56.120> fibers<00:02:56.599> of

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
I'm gonna pull about three fibers of

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.830 
I'm gonna pull about three fibers of
this<00:02:56.870> material<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:58.400> then<00:02:58.640> I'm<00:02:58.700> gonna<00:02:58.849> mmm

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
this material and then I'm gonna mmm

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.979 
this material and then I'm gonna mmm
excuse<00:03:00.230> me<00:03:00.379> double<00:03:00.739> it<00:03:00.859> over<00:03:01.359> and<00:03:02.359> then<00:03:02.690> double

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
excuse me double it over and then double

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.240 
excuse me double it over and then double
it<00:03:03.109> again<00:03:05.290> but<00:03:06.290> what<00:03:06.410> I<00:03:06.440> do<00:03:06.560> is<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:06.890> double<00:03:07.190> it

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
it again but what I do is I double it

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.140 
it again but what I do is I double it
over<00:03:07.400> lay<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.060> on<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.269> side<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.750> fly<00:03:10.150> get

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
over lay it on the side of the fly get

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.420 
over lay it on the side of the fly get
it<00:03:11.239> in<00:03:11.359> there<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.569> try<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:11.989> spread<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.859> out<00:03:12.980> and

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
it in there and try to spread it out and

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.210 
it in there and try to spread it out and
then<00:03:14.060> bring<00:03:14.209> these<00:03:14.450> other<00:03:14.660> fibers<00:03:15.200> over<00:03:15.530> and

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
then bring these other fibers over and

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.520 
then bring these other fibers over and
get<00:03:16.370> those<00:03:16.609> on<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:17.000> side<00:03:17.329> and<00:03:17.810> try<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.230> splay

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
get those on this side and try to splay

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.229 
get those on this side and try to splay
those<00:03:18.769> out<00:03:18.980> as<00:03:19.130> well<00:03:21.489> so<00:03:22.489> that<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:22.700> get<00:03:23.000> a

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
those out as well so that I get a

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.780 
those out as well so that I get a
circumference<00:03:24.109> coverage<00:03:24.799> of<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.130> material

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
circumference coverage of this material

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.330 
circumference coverage of this material
and<00:03:26.599> this<00:03:27.049> just<00:03:27.319> looks<00:03:27.470> like<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:27.919> catice

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
and this just looks like that catice

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.449 
and this just looks like that catice
bubble<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:30.290> I'll<00:03:30.380> pull<00:03:30.620> these<00:03:30.769> back<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.310> cut

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
bubble so I'll pull these back and cut

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.990 
bubble so I'll pull these back and cut
them<00:03:31.639> now<00:03:31.819> and<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.599> want<00:03:32.810> them<00:03:33.049> only<00:03:33.669> about<00:03:34.669> mid

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
them now and I want them only about mid

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.680 
them now and I want them only about mid
tail<00:03:35.299> and<00:03:35.569> length<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.790> twist<00:03:38.209> them<00:03:38.389> in<00:03:38.480> turn

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
tail and length and twist them in turn

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.470 
tail and length and twist them in turn
to<00:03:38.900> get<00:03:39.049> them<00:03:39.139> spread<00:03:39.470> around<00:03:40.299> mm-hmm

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
to get them spread around mm-hmm

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
this off I'm gonna use some hairline

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.420 
this off I'm gonna use some hairline
hair<00:04:37.270> Tron<00:04:37.600> in<00:04:37.810> black<00:04:40.650> this<00:04:41.650> fills<00:04:42.009> the<00:04:42.250> gap

hair Tron in black this fills the gap

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:49.080 
hair Tron in black this fills the gap
gives<00:04:43.180> it<00:04:43.300> that<00:04:43.330> catice<00:04:44.759> head<00:04:45.759> appearance<00:04:48.090> and

gives it that catice head appearance and

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.560 
gives it that catice head appearance and
it<00:04:49.210> doesn't<00:04:49.509> take<00:04:49.690> much<00:04:49.930> of<00:04:49.990> this<00:04:54.389> the<00:04:55.389> nice

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
it doesn't take much of this the nice

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.150 
it doesn't take much of this the nice
thing<00:04:55.810> about<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.320> hairline<00:04:56.620> dubbing<00:04:57.070> the

thing about the hairline dubbing the
rabbit<00:04:57.550> dubbing<00:04:57.910> is<00:04:58.090> that<00:04:58.300> it<00:04:58.479> dubs<00:04:58.780> so<00:04:59.080> nicely

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
rabbit dubbing is that it dubs so nicely

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.370

and<00:04:59.770> you<00:04:59.860> can<00:04:59.889> get<00:05:00.190> it<00:05:00.280> pretty<00:05:00.310> tight<00:05:00.759> on<00:05:00.789> there

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
and you can get it pretty tight on there
