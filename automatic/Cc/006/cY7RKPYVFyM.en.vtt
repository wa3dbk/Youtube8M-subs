00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.050 
qualifying I was trying all sorts of
different<00:01:52.020> tires<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.920> track<00:01:53.190> was<00:01:53.460> changing<00:01:54.000> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
different tires the track was changing a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.990 
different tires the track was changing a
lot<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.900> had<00:01:55.050> rain<00:01:55.350> throughout<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.310> week<00:01:56.580> so

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
lot that had rain throughout the week so

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.700 
lot that had rain throughout the week so
the<00:01:57.180> trap<00:01:57.420> was<00:01:57.570> wondering<00:01:57.900> to<00:01:57.960> dry<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:58.620> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
the trap was wondering to dry then the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.340 
the trap was wondering to dry then the
next<00:01:58.860> minute<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.400> was<00:01:59.550> wet<00:01:59.940> and<00:02:00.150> so<00:02:00.840> some<00:02:01.080> parts

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
next minute it was wet and so some parts

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.690 
next minute it was wet and so some parts
of<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.440> tracker<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.920> all<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.130> grip<00:02:02.460> and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
of the tracker have all this grip and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.219 
of the tracker have all this grip and
the<00:02:02.760> other<00:02:02.880> party<00:02:03.240> was<00:02:03.420> super<00:02:03.750> dusty<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
the other party was super dusty and

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.980 
the other party was super dusty and
loose<00:02:04.490> so<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.640> kind<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.420> think<00:02:06.630> everyone

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
loose so it's kind of a I think everyone

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.600 
loose so it's kind of a I think everyone
was<00:02:07.110> searching<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.770> top<00:02:07.979> like<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.489> know

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
was searching for the top like you know

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.279 
was searching for the top like you know
the<00:02:08.759> right<00:02:08.909> tighter<00:02:09.239> used<00:02:09.629> for<00:02:09.840> qualifying

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
the right tighter used for qualifying

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.360 
the right tighter used for qualifying
and<00:02:10.700> um<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:12.200> got<00:02:13.200> bow<00:02:13.530> ties<00:02:13.800> on<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.040> right<00:02:14.310> now

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
and um I got bow ties on you right now

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.990 
and um I got bow ties on you right now
but<00:02:15.270> um

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
but um

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.320 
but um
carlin<00:02:16.810> came<00:02:16.960> out<00:02:17.110> with<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.260> new<00:02:17.290> bow<00:02:17.590> tie<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.330> I

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
carlin came out with a new bow tie and I

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.000 
carlin came out with a new bow tie and I
was<00:02:19.570> kind<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.900> testing<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.410> bit<00:02:20.650> they<00:02:20.800> seem

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
was kind of testing that a bit they seem

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.370 
was kind of testing that a bit they seem
to<00:02:21.040> work<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.400> best<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:22.120> gave<00:02:23.080> me<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.230> most

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
to work the best it gave me the most

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.090 
to work the best it gave me the most
grip<00:02:23.760> but<00:02:24.760> at<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.480> end<00:02:25.510> of<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.830> semi

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
grip but at the end of that the semi

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.490 
grip but at the end of that the semi
practice<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.760> ended<00:02:27.970> up<00:02:28.030> trying<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:29.050> bow<00:02:29.230> tie

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
practice I ended up trying the bow tie

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.380 
practice I ended up trying the bow tie
in<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.710> rear<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.880> blockade<00:02:31.210> in<00:02:31.330> the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
in the rear and the blockade in the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.180 
in the rear and the blockade in the
front<00:02:31.690> which<00:02:31.990> was<00:02:32.170> kind<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.620> like<00:02:32.830> something

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
front which was kind of like something

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.500 
front which was kind of like something
I've<00:02:33.280> never<00:02:33.370> done<00:02:33.490> before<00:02:33.640> which<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.270> kind<00:02:34.450> of

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
I've never done before which is kind of

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.080 
I've never done before which is kind of
weird<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:35.320> idea<00:02:35.650> was<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.920> yet<00:02:36.310> still<00:02:36.880> have<00:02:37.000> the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
weird the idea was to yet still have the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.360 
weird the idea was to yet still have the
retraction<00:02:37.540> but<00:02:38.380> also<00:02:38.530> kind<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.010> tame<00:02:39.190> down

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
retraction but also kind of tame down

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.040 
retraction but also kind of tame down
the<00:02:39.520> front<00:02:39.730> as<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.030> track<00:02:40.240> was<00:02:40.420> like<00:02:40.630> really

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
the front as the track was like really

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.350 
the front as the track was like really
bumpy<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.860> was<00:02:41.980> kind<00:02:42.190> of<00:02:42.250> cars<00:02:43.150> getting

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
bumpy and it was kind of cars getting

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.730 
bumpy and it was kind of cars getting
bit<00:02:43.540> unsettled<00:02:44.020> so<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:44.230> was<00:02:44.350> just<00:02:44.470> trying<00:02:44.680> to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
bit unsettled so I was just trying to

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.890 
bit unsettled so I was just trying to
tame<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.070> car<00:02:45.280> down<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:45.850> then<00:02:46.000> I<00:02:46.030> could<00:02:46.300> push

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
tame the car down so then I could push

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.350 
tame the car down so then I could push
it<00:02:46.930> through<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.530> bombs<00:02:47.770> as<00:02:48.070> well<00:02:48.640> as<00:02:48.820> keeping

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
it through the bombs as well as keeping

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.890 
it through the bombs as well as keeping
my<00:02:49.510> rear<00:02:49.690> traction<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:51.190> uh<00:02:51.450> yeah<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.480> don't<00:02:52.720> know

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
my rear traction so uh yeah I don't know

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.970 
my rear traction so uh yeah I don't know
I<00:02:52.959> don't<00:02:53.140> know<00:02:53.260> if<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:53.500> was<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.709> right

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
I don't know if that was the right

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.210 
I don't know if that was the right
choice<00:02:54.040> at<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.000> end<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.300> day<00:02:56.040> because<00:02:57.040> in

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
choice at the end of the day because in

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.040 
choice at the end of the day because in
the<00:02:57.340> semi-final<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.120> started<00:02:58.450> for<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.810> grid

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050

my<00:02:59.620> my<00:03:00.310> first<00:03:00.580> lap<00:03:00.850> was<00:03:01.090> one<00:03:01.630> of<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.750> worst

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
my my first lap was one of the worst

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
off the leader on the first lap which is

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.690 
off the leader on the first lap which is
