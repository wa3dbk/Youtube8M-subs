logo<00:01:02.710> um<00:01:03.570> my<00:01:04.570> only<00:01:04.750> problem<00:01:04.930> with<00:01:05.199> this<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:05.619> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
logo um my only problem with this is the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.719 
logo um my only problem with this is the
mountain<00:01:07.479> concept<00:01:08.110> almost<00:01:08.560> like<00:01:08.830> he<00:01:09.460> didn't

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
mountain concept almost like he didn't

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.289 
mountain concept almost like he didn't
the<00:01:10.090> grass<00:01:10.420> was<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.750> bit<00:01:10.990> choppy<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:11.799> uh<00:01:11.920> I<00:01:12.580> feel

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
the grass was a bit choppy and uh I feel

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.240 
the grass was a bit choppy and uh I feel
like<00:01:13.420> he<00:01:13.600> should<00:01:13.840> have<00:01:14.409> made<00:01:14.439> their<00:01:14.920> like

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
like he should have made their like

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.460 
like he should have made their like
there's<00:01:15.610> just<00:01:15.850> bits<00:01:16.510> and<00:01:16.659> pieces<00:01:17.080> of<00:01:17.200> grass

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
there's just bits and pieces of grass

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.590 
there's just bits and pieces of grass
here<00:01:18.250> and<00:01:18.430> there<00:01:18.580> I<00:01:18.850> felt<00:01:19.360> like<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:19.570> should

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
here and there I felt like you should

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.630 
here and there I felt like you should
have<00:01:19.960> made<00:01:20.260> like<00:01:20.530> most<00:01:21.130> of<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.369> mountain

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
have made like most of the mountain

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.940 
have made like most of the mountain
grass<00:01:21.880> in<00:01:22.420> just<00:01:22.630> a<00:01:22.750> little<00:01:22.990> bit<00:01:23.110> of<00:01:23.259> it<00:01:23.470> rocky

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
grass in just a little bit of it rocky

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.820 
grass in just a little bit of it rocky
and<00:01:25.380> definitely<00:01:26.380> should<00:01:26.560> have<00:01:26.650> put<00:01:26.799> more

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
and definitely should have put more

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.920 
and definitely should have put more
trees<00:01:27.340> because<00:01:27.909> if<00:01:28.119> you<00:01:28.240> look<00:01:28.390> at<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.659> actual

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
trees because if you look at the actual

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.230 
trees because if you look at the actual
picture<00:01:29.470> of<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.310> Hollywood<00:01:30.700> sign<00:01:30.850> there's

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
picture of the Hollywood sign there's

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.240 
picture of the Hollywood sign there's
more<00:01:31.630> plant<00:01:32.470> life<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:33.040> trees<00:01:35.250> anything

been<00:02:50.880> placed<00:02:51.209> in<00:02:51.480> better<00:02:52.080> areas<00:02:52.560> besides<00:02:52.890> just

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
been placed in better areas besides just

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.570 
been placed in better areas besides just
randomly<00:02:54.750> placed<00:02:55.170> like<00:02:55.650> one<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.459> right

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
randomly placed like one to the right

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.100 
randomly placed like one to the right
one<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.000> left<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.390> one<00:02:57.420> small<00:02:57.810> one<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.019> the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
one to the left and one small one in the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.960 
one to the left and one small one in the
middle<00:02:58.340> definitely<00:02:59.340> could<00:02:59.459> have<00:02:59.489> placed<00:02:59.760> them

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
middle definitely could have placed them

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.360 
middle definitely could have placed them
better<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.420> maybe<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.500> better<00:03:01.799> man<00:03:02.100> on<00:03:02.280> the

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
original image of Optimus he didn't

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.710 
original image of Optimus he didn't
really<00:04:31.010> have<00:04:31.130> a<00:04:31.160> hand<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:32.210> looks<00:04:32.450> like<00:04:32.600> he

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
really have a hand that looks like he

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.230 
really have a hand that looks like he
could<00:04:32.870> be<00:04:32.930> holding<00:04:33.200> something<00:04:33.620> so<00:04:34.490> that's

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
could be holding something so that's

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.760 
could be holding something so that's
pretty<00:04:35.450> that<00:04:35.660> was<00:04:35.750> pretty<00:04:35.960> neat<00:04:36.169> idea<00:04:36.440> than<00:04:36.680> he

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
pretty that was pretty neat idea than he

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.000 
pretty that was pretty neat idea than he
thought<00:04:36.919> of<00:04:36.980> doing<00:04:37.250> that<00:04:38.260> like<00:04:39.260> you<00:04:39.410> said<00:04:39.650> he

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
thought of doing that like you said he

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.590 
thought of doing that like you said he
could<00:04:40.250> have<00:04:40.340> done<00:04:40.490> better<00:04:40.639> on<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:40.970> hand<00:04:41.210> not

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
could have done better on the hand not

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.909 
could have done better on the hand not
going<00:04:41.630> to<00:04:41.810> get<00:04:41.960> two<00:04:42.200> nit<00:04:42.410> picky<00:04:42.650> with<00:04:42.740> that

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
going to get two nit picky with that

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.960 
going to get two nit picky with that
either<00:04:43.070> um<00:04:44.080> gets<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.200> point<00:04:45.440> across<00:04:45.500> but<00:04:46.400> uh<00:04:46.460> I

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
either um gets the point across but uh I

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.790 
either um gets the point across but uh I
think<00:04:47.419> he<00:04:47.780> should<00:04:48.020> have<00:04:48.169> instead<00:04:48.410> of<00:04:48.560> like

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
think he should have instead of like

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.880 
think he should have instead of like
these<00:04:49.040> two<00:04:49.280> weird<00:04:49.580> horns<00:04:50.180> on<00:04:51.140> it<00:04:51.470> I<00:04:51.590> think<00:04:51.620> he

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
these two weird horns on it I think he

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.530 
these two weird horns on it I think he
should<00:04:52.070> have<00:04:52.160> made<00:04:52.190> it<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.760> Allspark<00:04:53.330> with

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
should have made it the Allspark with

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.620 
should have made it the Allspark with
which<00:04:54.530> was<00:04:54.740> just<00:04:54.980> a<00:04:55.100> square<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.760> understand

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
which was just a square I understand

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.000 
which was just a square I understand
that's<00:04:56.840> why<00:04:57.020> you<00:04:57.080> put<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:57.350> horns<00:04:57.560> make<00:04:57.860> it

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
that's why you put the horns make it

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.880 
that's why you put the horns make it
look<00:04:58.250> more<00:04:58.700> complex<00:04:59.360> rather<00:05:00.260> than<00:05:00.470> just<00:05:00.740> a

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
look more complex rather than just a

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.480 
look more complex rather than just a
square<00:05:01.340> just<00:05:02.150> maybe<00:05:03.050> would<00:05:03.800> have<00:05:03.830> put<00:05:04.040> Gribble

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
square just maybe would have put Gribble

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.210 
square just maybe would have put Gribble
on<00:05:04.580> it<00:05:04.840> yeah<00:05:05.840> sure<00:05:06.169> oh<00:05:06.380> no<00:05:06.620> probably<00:05:07.010> other

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
on it yeah sure oh no probably other

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.430 
on it yeah sure oh no probably other
three<00:05:07.490> maybe<00:05:08.150> ain't<00:05:08.360> looked<00:05:08.540> exactly<00:05:08.870> like<00:05:09.110> it

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
three maybe ain't looked exactly like it

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.860 
three maybe ain't looked exactly like it
maybe<00:05:10.130> he<00:05:10.280> could<00:05:10.460> have<00:05:10.550> made<00:05:11.060> the<00:05:11.300> arrow<00:05:11.600> logo

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
maybe he could have made the arrow logo

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.570 
maybe he could have made the arrow logo
like<00:05:13.240> she<00:05:14.240> called<00:05:14.510> more<00:05:14.900> like<00:05:15.460> easier<00:05:16.460> to

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
like she called more like easier to

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.219 
like she called more like easier to
comprehend<00:05:17.120> it<00:05:17.270> yes<00:05:17.479> like<00:05:17.810> with<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.050> banner
