00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
as a g3 for scale you can see this is

leather edition this is the white color
I<00:00:19.890> guess<00:00:20.189> LG<00:00:21.180> says<00:00:21.420> there<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.720> some<00:00:21.869> kind<00:00:22.109> of

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
I guess LG says there is some kind of

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.529 
I guess LG says there is some kind of
ceramic<00:00:22.769> materials<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.820> white<00:00:24.060> plastic

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.160 
cover I tried to lift it off it does
feel<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.910> little<00:00:27.000> stiffer<00:00:27.599> than<00:00:27.869> your<00:00:28.019> average

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
feel a little stiffer than your average

plastic cover verbum the diamond pattern

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.290 
plastic cover verbum the diamond pattern
on<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.380> actually<00:00:31.590> kind<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.309> cool<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.820> person

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
on it is actually kind of cool in person

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.090 
on it is actually kind of cool in person
I<00:00:33.660> don't<00:00:34.110> know<00:00:34.170> how<00:00:34.290> well<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.710> really<00:00:34.829> comes

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
I don't know how well it really comes

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.700 
I don't know how well it really comes
across<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.790> video<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.840> here<00:00:37.290> at<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> launch

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
across and video but here at the launch

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.709 
across and video but here at the launch
it<00:00:37.950> does<00:00:38.129> look<00:00:38.309> pretty<00:00:38.520> nice<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.510> phone

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
it does look pretty nice the phone

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.530 
it does look pretty nice the phone
itself<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:40.980> see<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.969> aesthetic<00:00:42.420> is

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
itself as you can see the aesthetic is

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.380 
itself as you can see the aesthetic is
very<00:00:42.690> similar<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.890> g3<00:00:44.520> although<00:00:45.180> more

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
very similar the g3 although more

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.360 
very similar the g3 although more
refined<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.050> think<00:00:46.260> you're<00:00:46.379> going<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.530> find<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
refined I think you're going to find the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.819 
refined I think you're going to find the
edges<00:00:47.700> seem<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> little<00:00:48.090> sharper<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.680> get

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
edges seem a little sharper and you get

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.160 
edges seem a little sharper and you get
some<00:00:50.010> design<00:00:50.370> cues<00:00:50.700> from<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> G<00:00:51.270> flex<00:00:51.449> 2<00:00:51.719> we

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
some design cues from the G flex 2 we

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.170 
some design cues from the G flex 2 we
don't<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.620> those<00:00:52.800> with<00:00:53.039> us<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.489> this

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
don't have one of those with us but this

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.760 
don't have one of those with us but this
phone<00:00:54.360> definitely<00:00:54.809> takes<00:00:55.079> from<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.530> device

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
phone definitely takes from that device

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.130 
phone definitely takes from that device
to<00:00:55.949> some<00:00:56.370> extent<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.120> also<00:00:57.420> some<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.690> LG's

big deal out of it but they're

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.099 
big deal out of it but they're

the<00:03:09.000> black<00:03:09.239> version<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.780> probably<00:03:10.079> the<00:03:10.260> least

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
the black version is probably the least

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.099 
the black version is probably the least
offensive<00:03:10.829> in<00:03:11.790> my<00:03:11.940> opinion<00:03:12.209> but<00:03:12.600> these

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
offensive in my opinion but these

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.560 
offensive in my opinion but these
plastic<00:03:13.590> ones<00:03:13.799> they<00:03:14.370> do<00:03:14.609> look<00:03:14.910> nice<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.480> they

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
plastic ones they do look nice and they

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.199 
plastic ones they do look nice and they
feel<00:03:15.840> definitely<00:03:16.380> more<00:03:16.709> premium<00:03:17.160> than<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.640> g3

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
feel definitely more premium than the g3

feel definitely more premium than the g3
I<00:03:18.239> think<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.780> still<00:03:19.709> don't<00:03:19.920> think<00:03:20.010> we're

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
I think I still don't think we're

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.550 
I think I still don't think we're

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.970 
build quality of materials here but
they're<00:03:24.630> nicer<00:03:24.989> than<00:03:25.140> last<00:03:25.380> year's<00:03:25.650> phones

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
all so I think they'll at least be
