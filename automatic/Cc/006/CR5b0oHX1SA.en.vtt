 well let's give to install 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.890
 despite a megabyte so it's not much 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.290
 well here it's settled, let's go 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.960
 we are going to 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.780
 the entry in the expo set installer 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.410
 and we will see it in modules we are going to 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.410
 check the box 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.069
 we are going to give a click and then as you see in 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.600
 this part up here if smart 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.600
 he checked the box 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.730
 in my case, I 'm going to unmark these 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.560
 two and I'm going to leave these three now I'm going to 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:32.420
 order the buttons 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:35.890
 the fungus can pass in the middle of the back 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.890
 I'll pass it up 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:44.270
 so recent is this part is what 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.210
 is doing these 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.040
 these tabs so it stays in that 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.269
 shape and I'm going to select my theme 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.269
 I'm going to learn it 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:01.910
 here comes this button 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.310
 of the lollipop galaxy 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.180
 net 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.180
 of the fact 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.880
 9 in my case nothing else you can select 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.880
 from the pop lobby 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.440
 as well as they see it 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.389
 and in this part I have to do the most 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.389
 small or larger when watering 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.340
 doing it wider hands are smaller 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.879
 there is 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.120
 let's go play a little bit with the 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.120
 bars 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.480
 Now let's go back and let's leave 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:50.110
 the installer wife we ​​mark it 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.050
 and we give frank word we give 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.669
 install and update 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.889
 Now I'm going back because it's going to 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.840
 restart 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.020
 As you can see, it's finished 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.719
 phone on my computer so this is this 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.240
 It is very easy and simple to do with 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:11.499
 these two installer applications 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.870
 poles and xperia 2 nothing because that's how 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:17.670
 I taught them in any this one 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.650
 any this 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.270
 keypad of some terminal that 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.790
 want to put there are the options 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.790
 so that you seek them and 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:30.200
 configure with the two bars to your 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.200
 taste let's check what 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.890
 it works very well there is going back 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.830
