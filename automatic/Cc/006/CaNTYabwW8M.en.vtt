00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
other speakers lately but then I'd have

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.800

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
and then the sound quality will go down

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.160 
and then the sound quality will go down
and<00:00:57.910> plus<00:00:58.090> I'd<00:00:58.270> have<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.510> have<00:00:58.570> my<00:00:58.630> phone<00:00:58.960> out

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
and plus I'd have to have my phone out

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.100 
and plus I'd have to have my phone out
connected<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.830> the<00:00:59.950> speaker<00:01:00.540> so<00:01:01.540> I<00:01:01.570> was

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
connected to the speaker so I was

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.720 
connected to the speaker so I was
actually<00:01:02.260> looking<00:01:02.470> for<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.890> Bluetooth<00:01:03.160> speaker

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
actually looking for a Bluetooth speaker

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.060 
actually looking for a Bluetooth speaker
and<00:01:03.910> I<00:01:04.839> looked<00:01:05.110> it<00:01:05.229> up<00:01:05.259> on<00:01:05.439> Amazon<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:05.950> came

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
and I looked it up on Amazon and came

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.249 
and I looked it up on Amazon and came
across<00:01:06.159> this<00:01:06.430> one<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:06.909> even<00:01:07.810> better<00:01:07.990> it<00:01:08.200> was

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
across this one and even better it was

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.590 
across this one and even better it was
waterproof<00:01:08.799> so<00:01:09.249> that<00:01:09.729> way<00:01:09.880> I<00:01:10.210> wouldn't<00:01:10.450> have

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
waterproof so that way I wouldn't have

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.910 
waterproof so that way I wouldn't have
to<00:01:10.659> worry<00:01:10.810> too<00:01:10.929> much<00:01:10.990> about<00:01:11.079> dust<00:01:11.530> getting<00:01:11.799> in

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
to worry too much about dust getting in

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.580 
to worry too much about dust getting in
there<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.640> also<00:01:13.149> I<00:01:13.179> in<00:01:13.810> my<00:01:14.049> shop<00:01:14.320> where<00:01:14.560> I

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
there and also I in my shop where I

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.169 
there and also I in my shop where I
grind<00:01:14.829> up<00:01:14.979> have<00:01:15.159> a<00:01:15.280> big<00:01:15.579> bucket<00:01:15.789> of<00:01:15.969> water

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
grind up have a big bucket of water

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:17.340

underneath<00:01:16.509> the<00:01:16.600> grinder

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
underneath the grinder

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.200 
underneath the grinder
so<00:01:17.829> I'll<00:01:17.920> just<00:01:18.070> in<00:01:18.219> case<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.520> speaker<00:01:18.729> did<00:01:19.090> my

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
so I'll just in case the speaker did my

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.700 
so I'll just in case the speaker did my
chance<00:01:19.479> to<00:01:19.569> get<00:01:19.630> hit<00:01:19.840> into<00:01:20.109> it<00:01:20.229> or<00:01:20.409> something

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710

things so it was a bonus for me going

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.859 
things so it was a bonus for me going
over<00:01:56.409> some<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.740> other<00:01:56.859> features<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:58.600> has<00:01:58.840> a

over some of the other features it has a

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.019 
over some of the other features it has a
hands-free<00:01:59.499> speakerphone<00:02:00.039> capabilities

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:01.029 
hands-free speakerphone capabilities

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:03.269 
hands-free speakerphone capabilities
which<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.109> far<00:02:02.350> hasn't<00:02:02.560> really<00:02:02.889> worked<00:02:02.920> out

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:03.279 
which so far hasn't really worked out

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:04.949 
which so far hasn't really worked out
well<00:02:03.459> for<00:02:03.490> me<00:02:03.700> just<00:02:04.029> because<00:02:04.149> when<00:02:04.509> I<00:02:04.539> did<00:02:04.630> use

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
well for me just because when I did use

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:07.260 
well for me just because when I did use
it<00:02:05.109> I<00:02:05.200> was<00:02:05.289> wearing<00:02:05.529> my<00:02:05.619> respirator<00:02:06.069> and<00:02:06.399> you

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
it I was wearing my respirator and you

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.270 
it I was wearing my respirator and you
couldn't<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:08.200> personal<00:02:08.890> sockets<00:02:09.190> you

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
couldn't the personal sockets you

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.520 
couldn't the personal sockets you
couldn't<00:02:09.550> hear<00:02:09.670> me<00:02:09.850> so<00:02:10.090> I'm<00:02:10.810> just<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.500> know

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
couldn't hear me so I'm just you know

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.350 
couldn't hear me so I'm just you know
guessing<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.129> sensitive<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.819> is<00:02:12.879> waterproof

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
guessing the sensitive it is waterproof

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.880 
guessing the sensitive it is waterproof
there's<00:02:13.720> probably<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:14.019> barrier<00:02:14.409> in<00:02:14.590> front<00:02:14.620> of

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
there's probably a barrier in front of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.250 
there's probably a barrier in front of
the<00:02:14.950> microphone<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:16.180> since<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.480> had<00:02:16.629> a<00:02:16.659> barrier

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
the microphone so since I had a barrier

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.649 
the microphone so since I had a barrier
in<00:02:17.319> front<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.590> my<00:02:17.680> face<00:02:17.920> also<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.390> wasn't

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
in front of my face also it just wasn't

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.300 
in front of my face also it just wasn't
working<00:02:19.750> out<00:02:20.019> I<00:02:20.290> haven't<00:02:20.739> tested<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:21.069> without

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
working out I haven't tested it without

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.179 
working out I haven't tested it without
it<00:02:21.489> yet<00:02:21.670> though<00:02:21.819> but<00:02:22.000> I'm<00:02:22.120> sure<00:02:22.299> it<00:02:22.420> worked<00:02:22.689> ok

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
it yet though but I'm sure it worked ok

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.009 
it yet though but I'm sure it worked ok
but<00:02:24.189> like<00:02:24.579> I<00:02:24.700> said<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:25.269> know<00:02:25.390> if<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:25.629> really

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
but like I said you know if you really

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.809 
but like I said you know if you really
have<00:02:26.110> an<00:02:26.230> important<00:02:26.590> call<00:02:26.709> out<00:02:26.829> you<00:02:27.489> just<00:02:27.640> use

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
have an important call out you just use

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.319 
have an important call out you just use
your<00:02:27.970> regular<00:02:28.090> phone<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.670> mic<00:02:30.909> does<00:02:31.150> have

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
your regular phone the mic does have

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.449 
your regular phone the mic does have
advance<00:02:31.720> noise<00:02:32.049> cancellation<00:02:32.920> or<00:02:33.129> something

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
advance noise cancellation or something

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.670 
advance noise cancellation or something
like<00:02:33.549> that<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:34.090> that<00:02:34.569> might<00:02:34.780> be<00:02:34.810> why<00:02:35.140> -<00:02:35.200> since

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
like that so that might be why - since

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.750 
like that so that might be why - since
there<00:02:35.769> was<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.920> lot<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.069> ambient<00:02:36.549> background

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
there was a lot of ambient background

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.460 
there was a lot of ambient background
noise<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.120> might<00:02:37.390> have<00:02:37.480> cancelled<00:02:37.870> out<00:02:37.959> my

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
noise I might have cancelled out my

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.410 
noise I might have cancelled out my
speech<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.400> was<00:02:39.519> doing<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.790> know<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:40.030> talking

speech I was doing you know the talking

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.649 
speech I was doing you know the talking
because<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.690> was<00:02:40.810> quieter<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:42.239> can<00:02:43.239> stream

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
because it was quieter you can stream

because<00:03:00.879> you<00:03:00.940> have<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.150> pop<00:03:01.329> a<00:03:01.359> panel<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:01.930> the

so<00:03:06.819> far<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.209> said<00:03:07.359> about<00:03:07.450> five<00:03:07.780> hours

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
so far you said about five hours

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.449 
so far you said about five hours
straight<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.889> with<00:03:09.670> no<00:03:09.790> problem<00:03:10.180> I<00:03:10.389> mean<00:03:11.200> as<00:03:11.349> a

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
straight and with no problem I mean as a

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.770 
straight and with no problem I mean as a
lithium-ion<00:03:12.459> battery<00:03:12.489> so<00:03:13.269> and<00:03:13.659> it's

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
lithium-ion battery so and it's

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.530 
lithium-ion battery so and it's
rechargeable<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.680> works<00:03:15.159> pretty<00:03:15.370> good<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:15.879> it

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
rechargeable so works pretty good and it

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.920 
rechargeable so works pretty good and it
says<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.989> has<00:03:17.139> a<00:03:17.170> 33<00:03:17.889> range<00:03:18.209> 33<00:03:19.209> foot<00:03:19.420> range<00:03:19.599> but

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
says it has a 33 range 33 foot range but

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.949 
says it has a 33 range 33 foot range but
so<00:03:20.769> far<00:03:21.040> that<00:03:21.940> is<00:03:22.150> kind<00:03:22.389> of<00:03:22.449> limited<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:22.930> think

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
so far that is kind of limited I think

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.979 
so far that is kind of limited I think
you<00:03:23.319> need<00:03:23.410> like<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:23.650> clear<00:03:24.099> shot<00:03:24.870> nothing<00:03:25.870> in

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
you need like a clear shot nothing in

here's where you can attach the
carabiner<00:03:54.819> and<00:03:55.530> this<00:03:56.530> is<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:58.139> plug<00:03:59.139> where<00:03:59.440> you

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
carabiner and this is the plug where you

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:48.899 
this in the pond so I will I've turned
down<00:05:47.409> a<00:05:47.469> little<00:05:47.619> bit<00:05:47.829> I<00:05:47.979> want<00:05:48.069> to<00:05:48.189> blast<00:05:48.669> that

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
down a little bit I want to blast that

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:58.519 
down a little bit I want to blast that
fish's<00:05:49.539> ears<00:05:49.929> out<00:05:50.429> so<00:05:54.509> all<00:05:55.509> the<00:05:55.689> way<00:05:55.779> submerged

00:05:58.519 --> 00:05:58.529 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:01.679 

and<00:05:59.699> also<00:06:00.699> what's<00:06:00.939> good<00:06:01.179> about<00:06:01.269> it<00:06:01.389> is<00:06:01.539> it

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:01.689 
and also what's good about it is it

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:04.409 
and also what's good about it is it
floats<00:06:01.989> so<00:06:02.459> that's<00:06:03.459> always<00:06:03.639> good<00:06:03.849> too<00:06:04.059> just<00:06:04.119> in

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
floats so that's always good too just in

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:05.939 
floats so that's always good too just in
case<00:06:04.479> you<00:06:04.719> do<00:06:04.839> drop<00:06:05.110> it<00:06:05.259> off<00:06:05.349> your<00:06:05.499> boat<00:06:05.739> our

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
case you do drop it off your boat our

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.739 
case you do drop it off your boat our
kayak<00:06:06.219> or<00:06:06.399> whatever<00:06:06.639> it's<00:06:07.209> not<00:06:07.269> gonna<00:06:07.509> sink<00:06:07.719> to

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:07.749 
kayak or whatever it's not gonna sink to

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:11.789 
kayak or whatever it's not gonna sink to
the<00:06:07.929> bottom<00:06:08.939> so<00:06:10.229> skin<00:06:11.229> here<00:06:11.439> it's<00:06:11.559> still

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:11.799 
the bottom so skin here it's still

00:06:11.799 --> 00:06:22.229 
the bottom so skin here it's still
working<00:06:20.129> some<00:06:21.129> things<00:06:21.159> that<00:06:21.459> I<00:06:21.489> don't<00:06:21.609> really

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:22.239 
working some things that I don't really

00:06:22.239 --> 00:06:25.139 
working some things that I don't really
I<00:06:22.779> mean<00:06:23.199> it's<00:06:23.379> good<00:06:23.619> in<00:06:23.769> some<00:06:23.979> ways<00:06:24.099> but<00:06:24.309> for<00:06:24.579> me

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:25.149 
I mean it's good in some ways but for me

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:27.629 
I mean it's good in some ways but for me
it<00:06:25.299> kind<00:06:25.539> of<00:06:25.629> doesn't<00:06:26.379> work<00:06:26.469> so<00:06:26.679> great<00:06:26.799> it<00:06:27.459> has

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
it kind of doesn't work so great it has

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.569 
it kind of doesn't work so great it has
like<00:06:27.789> a<00:06:27.819> rubberized<00:06:28.419> coating<00:06:28.899> and<00:06:29.499> it<00:06:30.369> just

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:30.579 
like a rubberized coating and it just

00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:34.169 
like a rubberized coating and it just
traps<00:06:31.329> dust<00:06:31.989> really<00:06:32.559> bad<00:06:32.799> so<00:06:33.189> like<00:06:33.399> when<00:06:34.149> I

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:34.179 
traps dust really bad so like when I

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:36.749 
traps dust really bad so like when I
grabbed<00:06:34.629> it<00:06:34.779> with<00:06:34.929> my<00:06:35.139> add<00:06:36.099> some<00:06:36.309> gloves<00:06:36.549> on

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:36.759 
grabbed it with my add some gloves on

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.149 
grabbed it with my add some gloves on
but<00:06:36.939> they're<00:06:37.119> covered<00:06:37.360> in<00:06:37.569> g10<00:06:38.469> dust<00:06:38.769> it<00:06:38.979> just

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:39.159 
but they're covered in g10 dust it just

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:41.699 
but they're covered in g10 dust it just
like<00:06:39.369> stuck<00:06:39.849> right<00:06:40.089> to<00:06:40.269> the<00:06:40.389> rubber<00:06:40.629> so<00:06:41.589> it's

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:41.709 
like stuck right to the rubber so it's

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:44.029 
like stuck right to the rubber so it's
kind<00:06:41.919> of<00:06:41.979> a<00:06:42.099> pain<00:06:42.279> yes<00:06:42.519> to<00:06:42.699> clean<00:06:42.909> off<00:06:43.089> but<00:06:43.539> I

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 
kind of a pain yes to clean off but I

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:46.769 
kind of a pain yes to clean off but I
mean<00:06:45.039> it's<00:06:45.189> rubberized<00:06:45.459> so<00:06:46.179> that<00:06:46.360> it<00:06:46.449> has<00:06:46.569> good

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:46.779 
mean it's rubberized so that it has good

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:49.199 
mean it's rubberized so that it has good
grip<00:06:47.189> you<00:06:48.189> know<00:06:48.249> if<00:06:48.789> you're<00:06:48.939> gonna<00:06:49.029> be<00:06:49.179> using

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:49.209 
grip you know if you're gonna be using

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:52.199 
grip you know if you're gonna be using
in<00:06:49.539> the<00:06:49.659> water<00:06:49.869> which<00:06:50.110> it's<00:06:50.949> made<00:06:51.189> for<00:06:51.459> so<00:06:51.759> that

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:52.209 
in the water which it's made for so that

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:56.279 
in the water which it's made for so that
makes<00:06:52.419> sense<00:06:54.149> other<00:06:55.149> than<00:06:55.179> that<00:06:55.360> I<00:06:55.389> like<00:06:56.169> I

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289 
makes sense other than that I like I

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:58.169 
makes sense other than that I like I
said<00:06:56.439> it's<00:06:56.619> works<00:06:57.039> perfect<00:06:57.549> for<00:06:57.610> me<00:06:57.819> it<00:06:57.999> works

00:06:58.169 --> 00:06:58.179 
said it's works perfect for me it works

00:06:58.179 --> 00:06:59.459 
said it's works perfect for me it works
good<00:06:58.360> for<00:06:58.419> the<00:06:58.629> use<00:06:58.749> I<00:06:58.899> have<00:06:59.049> you<00:06:59.349> know<00:06:59.439> I

00:06:59.459 --> 00:06:59.469 
good for the use I have you know I

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:02.189 
good for the use I have you know I
wanted<00:06:59.799> it<00:06:59.919> for<00:07:00.099> I<00:07:00.449> look<00:07:01.449> forward<00:07:01.719> to<00:07:01.749> using<00:07:01.959> it

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 
wanted it for I look forward to using it

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:05.839 
wanted it for I look forward to using it
at<00:07:02.499> the<00:07:02.679> beach<00:07:03.039> and<00:07:03.249> stuff<00:07:03.459> also<00:07:04.679> I'm

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:05.849 
at the beach and stuff also I'm

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:07.619 
at the beach and stuff also I'm
interested<00:07:06.849> to<00:07:06.909> see<00:07:07.059> how<00:07:07.149> the<00:07:07.209> saltwater

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:07.629 
interested to see how the saltwater

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:11.189 
interested to see how the saltwater
works<00:07:08.019> on<00:07:08.229> it<00:07:08.729> saltwater<00:07:09.729> usually<00:07:10.179> takes<00:07:11.019> it's

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 
works on it saltwater usually takes it's

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:12.749 
works on it saltwater usually takes it's
all<00:07:11.379> a<00:07:11.409> little<00:07:11.529> more<00:07:11.769> than<00:07:11.949> freshwater<00:07:12.159> so

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:12.759 
all a little more than freshwater so

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:14.669 
all a little more than freshwater so
probably<00:07:13.659> I<00:07:13.719> can<00:07:13.869> be<00:07:13.959> throwing<00:07:14.199> it<00:07:14.379> in<00:07:14.499> and

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:14.679 
probably I can be throwing it in and

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:16.559 
probably I can be throwing it in and
being<00:07:15.189> other<00:07:15.369> waves<00:07:15.610> at<00:07:15.819> Sandy<00:07:16.179> Beach<00:07:16.329> or

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:16.569 
being other waves at Sandy Beach or

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:17.429 
being other waves at Sandy Beach or
anything<00:07:16.749> like<00:07:17.019> that

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:17.439 
anything like that

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:19.769 
anything like that
so<00:07:18.039> the<00:07:18.729> other<00:07:18.849> thing<00:07:19.059> I<00:07:19.209> haven't<00:07:19.599> really

00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:19.779 
so the other thing I haven't really

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:22.079 
so the other thing I haven't really
found<00:07:19.959> up<00:07:20.229> you<00:07:20.709> know<00:07:20.829> Steve<00:07:21.339> you<00:07:21.579> know<00:07:21.729> stated

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:22.089 
found up you know Steve you know stated

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:24.179 
found up you know Steve you know stated
depth<00:07:22.389> that<00:07:22.599> I<00:07:22.629> can<00:07:22.839> go<00:07:22.959> to<00:07:22.989> but<00:07:23.769> I<00:07:23.799> guess<00:07:23.979> since

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:24.189 
depth that I can go to but I guess since

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:26.100 
depth that I can go to but I guess since
it<00:07:24.339> floats<00:07:24.669> they<00:07:25.089> don't<00:07:25.299> really<00:07:25.449> say<00:07:25.779> that<00:07:25.989> it

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110 
it floats they don't really say that it

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.869 
it floats they don't really say that it
can<00:07:26.199> go<00:07:26.349> you<00:07:26.409> know<00:07:26.709> ten<00:07:27.069> meters<00:07:27.399> or<00:07:27.610> something

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 
can go you know ten meters or something

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:28.259 
can go you know ten meters or something
like<00:07:27.999> that

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:28.269 
like that

00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:30.329 
like that
and<00:07:28.809> which<00:07:29.199> you<00:07:29.619> know<00:07:29.769> you<00:07:29.829> probably<00:07:30.009> wouldn't

00:07:30.329 --> 00:07:30.339 
and which you know you probably wouldn't

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:31.140 
and which you know you probably wouldn't
do<00:07:30.399> anyways

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.150 
do anyways

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.420 
do anyways
minutes<00:07:31.690> they<00:07:32.590> don't<00:07:32.770> even<00:07:32.860> recommend<00:07:33.340> that

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:33.430 
minutes they don't even recommend that

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.270 
minutes they don't even recommend that
you<00:07:33.580> submerge<00:07:34.000> it<00:07:34.240> but<00:07:35.110> you<00:07:35.710> know<00:07:35.830> I<00:07:35.860> wanted<00:07:36.130> to

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280 
you submerge it but you know I wanted to

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.240 
you submerge it but you know I wanted to
test<00:07:36.520> it<00:07:36.700> so<00:07:36.940> I<00:07:36.970> did<00:07:37.240> it<00:07:37.440> I<00:07:38.440> guess<00:07:38.920> it's<00:07:39.100> more

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.250 
test it so I did it I guess it's more

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.980 
test it so I did it I guess it's more
for<00:07:39.520> you<00:07:39.670> know<00:07:39.760> if<00:07:39.850> it's<00:07:40.150> splashed<00:07:40.510> and<00:07:40.780> stuff

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:40.990 
for you know if it's splashed and stuff

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.720 
for you know if it's splashed and stuff
in<00:07:41.140> it<00:07:41.230> by<00:07:41.620> chance<00:07:41.860> if<00:07:42.100> it<00:07:42.220> goes<00:07:42.370> in<00:07:42.520> the<00:07:42.580> water

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:42.730 
in it by chance if it goes in the water
