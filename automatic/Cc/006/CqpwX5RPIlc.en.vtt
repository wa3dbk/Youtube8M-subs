00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.420
 freezing makes life much easier 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.490
 of people on a daily basis because 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.610
 You can go to the kitchen to cook a 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.650
 lots of freeze and then 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.619
 serve again but will the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.350
 food does not lose its texture color 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.930
 taste and especially the nutrients 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:31.289
 there are freezing techniques come 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:33.300
 With me, I'm going to teach one of the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.489
 techniques is to choose the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.649
 that goes to the freezer 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.710
 Plastics are a good choice because 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.050
 they do not give much volume and help in 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.510
 circulation of air inside the freezer 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.149
 another technique is you freeze the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.309
 ideal quantity for example if in your 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.989
 house are two people will not freeze 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.690
 killed in it ' of flesh because once 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:01.140
 thawed you can not refuse 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.710
 Do not forget to take out the air and also 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.490
 label shall bear the name of the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.210
 of the product in this case the fillet of hake 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.760
 the date of the freezing day and the date of 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.110
 validity in the case of fish are up to three 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.290
 months 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.119
 do not forget to put a duct tape 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.140
 or a plastic film so it will not catch 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.760
 water and eventually staining and 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.799
 writing 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.939
 the freezing technique for the 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.939
 vegetables or bleaching 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.659
 I'll give an example of broccoli only put 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.720
 in boiling water for a few minutes 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.180
 take it out in very cold water to 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.280
 give a thermal shock so it will not 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.759
 stay soft awaits the moment of 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.759
 thawing 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.289
 another tip is you freeze the vegetables and 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.659
 herbs for example is now fashionable 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.840
 that green punch what can you do 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.360
 until a little cabbage with water in the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.539
 blender and put in paper 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.539
 ice 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.970
 there are foods that should not be frozen 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.159
 mayonnaise and whipped cream yogurts 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.510
 these foods they do not have a good 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.510
 result after thawing 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.230
 to defrost inside you can opt 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.780
 by the refrigerator or even by the microwave 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.620
 low power now that the steaks have already 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.660
 thawed I 'll give the last tip 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.610

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:53.790
 fish that gives a special flavor to the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:58.050
 preparation in a refractory 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.650
 small tomatoes cut into slices 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.470
