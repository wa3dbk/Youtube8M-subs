 do you have 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.940
 23 years when it's a little bit of your 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.210
 trajectory in Chilean soccer 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:57.890
 good me then the 2009 in calera 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:02.010
 you 2010 for anger from there I had to 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.400
 decide where was going to Palestinian that there 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.619
 I was a year and from there now it's again 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.380
 the only one that I do as I was alone 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.600
 that zimmerman greets you 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.050
 how about how are you already in what position 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.140
 play your 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.660
 I am the lateral-steering wheel on the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:26.110
 left but mom comfortable side of the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.950
 left leg the left and whatever 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.810
 your arrival at the u of chile 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.069
 well I think he made a good 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.930
 vocollect championship and no 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:47.560
 almost like a cube the South American that 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:49.689
 he reached the final but he has not had 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.300
 possibility of playing this or being called 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:55.270
 to the selection there at some point 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.990
 in the selection to route had to go to 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.000
 the minor division reach its 20 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.670
 get lost but the adult team does not 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.360
 I had a choice and that's how you do not come 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.360
 to Peru 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.079
 I really do not know him but to know a 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.180
 genius 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:19.069
 There has never been a mind I have come to 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.620
 Carl Icahn loves Arica and we are 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.870
 with me to ortiz the footballer who has 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.420
 the double nationality is the Chilean 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.700
 also Peruvian his father is Peruvian his 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.769
 mother is Chilean there has been some 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.480
 contact with someone from football 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.689
 Peruvian soccer 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.930
 joao there has been some conversation 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:40.500
 directly or indirectly 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.780
 with you 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.459
 not yet not 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.650
 my uncle told me that I was free 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.300
 I will find a Peruvian team but now 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.030
 now there's only option aside and I 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.990
 they bought the pass and 19 for four years 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.200
 here 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.330
 ok you tell you you go through the 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.220
 head if at any time it's the 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.489
 possibility you would have some problem in 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.290
 for example accept some call 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.300
 of the Peruvian team or your goal is 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.030
 defend chile 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.790
 if there is a clear option that would affect 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.890
 the forecasts for a selection of a 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.230
 important country 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.330
 what kind of lateral joao to spend 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.910
 much the attack or defends better than 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.010
 you attack 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:30.530
 Of course I'm more than attacking in his 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.930
 majority to be able to finish the play 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.810
 On the other hand, you're like a mine, let's say 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:40.210
 characteristics clear clear 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.210
 why is there because roughly equal 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.460
 now that I would have to have to pass 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.800
 why 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.610
 there could be a possibility of 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.979
 the least they take into account having to 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.509
 in the Peruvian soccer federation 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.039
 have information as well as have 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.800
 information of all the players 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:04.930
 Peruvians or Peruvian roots that play 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.930
 abroad that would have to happen 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.180
 well I think that there is only the 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.550
 opinion that the economist for it 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.200
 Several I will go to Peru will play but 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.120
 on which the opportunity is given and I 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.430
 I think that first I have to show that 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.850
 encompass will favor the selection because 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.980
 you have to be clear of course, no longer 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:30.330
 they rule out the possibility of giving 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:32.940
 case would be one more of the players that 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.220
 today in the reality of the world has to 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.470
 choose there is no there is a series of 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.390
 footballers I remember thanks to 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.720
 higuaÃ­n and white had to choose between 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.980
 France and Argentina 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.160
 Trezeguet had to choose between France 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.170
 and Argentina there are many young people who were 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.020
 brothers one headed one chose by winning 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.940
 the other plays for germany or is it a 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.100
 possibility that over time and like you 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.070
 well you say with performance playing well 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.340
 you project that it could happen and it would take 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.340
 a decision 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.349
 I would not be here in the elections 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.919
 what your father tells you that tells you 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.229
 Uncle Eloy Ortiz in Peruvian Soccer 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.080
 country in general because we did not step on 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:25.259
 never Peruvian territory we are not leaving 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.629
 but my old man says that going back there 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:30.330
 I think he was passionate about football 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.340
 so I think it would be nice a 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.870
 yesterday ready option has led many 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.300
 thank you for these minute successes that 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.009
 be the best for you in the development 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.400
 of your career successes at the university 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:44.509
 of chile and and thank you for these minutes 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.509
 thank you very much everyone for her
