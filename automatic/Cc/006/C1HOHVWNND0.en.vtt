improve with time the accutane does not

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.780 
improve with time the accutane does not
kill<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.870> follicles<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.920> grow<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.640> hair

guess to me not having met Frank that

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.469 
guess to me not having met Frank that
he'd<00:01:27.570> be<00:01:27.689> classified<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> norwood<00:01:29.400> 3<00:01:29.820> vertex

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
he'd be classified as a norwood 3 vertex

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.469 
he'd be classified as a norwood 3 vertex
to<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> norwood<00:01:31.350> 4<00:01:31.890> pattern<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.790> genetic<00:01:32.970> hair

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
to a norwood 4 pattern of genetic hair

to a norwood 4 pattern of genetic hair
loss<00:01:33.829> so<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.549> key<00:01:35.850> points<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.509> remember<00:01:36.659> are

loss

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.590 
loss
the<00:01:48.679> second<00:01:49.189> thing<00:01:49.399> is<00:01:49.640> is<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:50.329> you're<00:01:50.539> a

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
the second thing is is that you're a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.069 
the second thing is is that you're a
young<00:01:50.899> Frank<00:01:51.289> at<00:01:51.560> 22<00:01:52.130> years<00:01:52.399> old<00:01:52.659> your<00:01:53.659> pattern

young Frank at 22 years old your pattern

young Frank at 22 years old your pattern
of<00:01:54.200> hair<00:01:54.409> loss<00:01:54.619> would<00:01:54.979> probably<00:01:55.460> continue<00:01:55.939> to

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
of hair loss would probably continue to

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.990 
of hair loss would probably continue to
express<00:01:56.569> itself<00:01:56.929> over<00:01:57.350> time<00:01:57.619> maybe<00:01:58.340> end<00:01:58.670> up<00:01:58.880> as

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
express itself over time maybe end up as

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.539 
express itself over time maybe end up as

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.760 
a Norwood five six or even a seven
pattern<00:02:01.789> so<00:02:02.659> we've<00:02:02.810> got<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.170> be<00:02:03.259> conservative

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
pattern so we've got to be conservative

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.999 
pattern so we've got to be conservative
with<00:02:04.219> you<00:02:04.459> in<00:02:04.819> my<00:02:05.329> opinion<00:02:05.990> surgical<00:02:06.829> hair

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
with you in my opinion surgical hair

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.930 
with you in my opinion surgical hair
restoration<00:02:07.250> is<00:02:07.819> not<00:02:08.090> your<00:02:08.360> primary

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
restoration is not your primary
