00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:22.170
 visually, you must share your own 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:26.280
 the length of the marigold into three parts tassel we 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.680

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.820
 wait for a little dry 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.340
 acrylic paint so she doesn't 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.940
 smeared when I will overlap 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:34.820
 repair it and will overlap our design 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.820
