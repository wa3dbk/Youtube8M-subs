00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.880
 Stand in the middle and dodge bullets that fly in you 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 Get under this thing and shoot, dodging shots. 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.080
 Stand on top and slide through the fireballs to pick up bonus items. 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.240
 Just move slowly to the side. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.020
 Mima: Oh? Looks like I'm approaching the goal. Oh, I see a local. 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.080
 Louise: Wow, who are you? ♪ You don't look like a man ... 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.620
 Mima: I'm a man! ♥ (lie) 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.580
 Louise: I am clear. 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.360
 Mima: What? Do you want to leave? 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.060
 Louise: Well ... ♥ Probably yes. 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.420
 Mima: I-clear. 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.580
 Louise: But first, do your best! ♥ 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.120
 Slowly maneuver through the blue bullets, then when she switches to the red ones, stand under her and move slightly to the side. Her bullets always fly straight. 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.400
 Watch the free space between the bullets and move behind it. 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.200
 Like red lasers, blue ones fly straight down 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.340
 Watch the bullets, when between them enough space move through them. However, be careful, the blue laser is approaching from 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.580
 You need to move quickly back and forth in the space between the shots. Although hard to show when you get life 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.640
 Louise: Why did I do it !? (crying) 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:39.000
 Mima: What's the matter with you ... 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:47.440
