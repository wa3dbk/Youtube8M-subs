00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
attack where they are on the ground with

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.080 
attack where they are on the ground with
the<00:01:47.729> fungal<00:01:48.950> but<00:01:49.950> advert<00:01:50.369> getting<00:01:50.670> really<00:01:50.880> low

the fungal but advert getting really low

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.749 
the fungal but advert getting really low
on<00:01:51.119> mineral<00:01:51.659> count<00:01:52.039> so<00:01:53.039> if<00:01:53.130> time<00:01:53.310> maaga<00:01:53.520> can

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
on mineral count so if time maaga can

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.190 
on mineral count so if time maaga can
hold<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.119> off<00:01:54.330> for<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.570> little<00:01:54.690> bit<00:01:54.810> longer<00:01:54.990> I

really<00:03:39.390> just<00:03:39.510> chain<00:03:39.990> funnel<00:03:40.440> here<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.620> guess

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
really just chain funnel here I guess

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.130 
really just chain funnel here I guess

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.040 
you guys but would you like me to add a
little<00:06:14.820> bit<00:06:15.000> of<00:06:15.060> time<00:06:15.360> at<00:06:15.419> the<00:06:15.780> end<00:06:15.810> of<00:06:15.930> my

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
little bit of time at the end of my

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.620 
little bit of time at the end of my
videos<00:06:16.410> so<00:06:17.130> you<00:06:17.220> don't<00:06:17.400> know<00:06:17.550> exactly<00:06:20.630> when

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
videos so you don't know exactly when

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.540 
videos so you don't know exactly when
the<00:06:21.810> game<00:06:22.020> ends<00:06:22.410> I<00:06:22.500> mean<00:06:22.680> you<00:06:23.100> know<00:06:23.190> I<00:06:23.220> cover

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
the game ends I mean you know I cover

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.990 
the game ends I mean you know I cover
the<00:06:23.729> replay<00:06:24.150> timer<00:06:24.450> but<00:06:25.550> who<00:06:26.550> cares<00:06:26.789> and<00:06:26.940> you

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
the replay timer but who cares and you

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.520 
the replay timer but who cares and you
can<00:06:27.120> just<00:06:27.240> look<00:06:27.419> at<00:06:27.539> the<00:06:27.630> YouTube<00:06:27.960> timer<00:06:28.229> right

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
can just look at the YouTube timer right

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.980 
can just look at the YouTube timer right
so<00:06:28.950> maybe<00:06:29.580> I'll<00:06:29.789> just<00:06:29.910> ramble<00:06:30.539> for<00:06:30.570> a<00:06:30.840> little

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
so maybe I'll just ramble for a little

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.250 
so maybe I'll just ramble for a little
bit<00:06:31.940> at<00:06:32.940> the<00:06:32.970> end<00:06:33.270> of<00:06:33.389> the<00:06:33.479> game<00:06:33.510> or<00:06:33.900> something

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
bit at the end of the game or something

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.600 
bit at the end of the game or something
I<00:06:34.440> really<00:06:35.039> don't<00:06:35.280> know<00:06:36.410> but<00:06:37.410> yeah<00:06:38.310> that<00:06:38.490> was<00:06:38.580> a

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
about it when he did not go hide her to

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.280 
about it when he did not go hide her to
deal<00:06:55.730> with<00:06:55.940> those<00:06:56.440> mutis<00:06:57.440> but<00:06:59.030> and<00:06:59.900> it
