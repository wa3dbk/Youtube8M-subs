00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
going to put one seed in each of 12

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.350 
going to put one seed in each of 12
cells<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.280> know<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.640> some<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:16.910> them<00:02:17.120> won't

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
cells and I know that some of them won't

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.980 
cells and I know that some of them won't
germinate<00:02:19.090> but<00:02:20.090> that's<00:02:20.240> fine<00:02:20.510> because<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:20.840> only

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
germinate but that's fine because I only

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.500 
germinate but that's fine because I only
really<00:02:21.380> want<00:02:21.560> two<00:02:22.430> or<00:02:22.610> three<00:02:22.850> plants<00:02:23.180> this

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510
