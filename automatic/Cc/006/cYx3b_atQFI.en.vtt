00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.470
 hello dear friends dear 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.230
 colleagues with you svetlana falcon you 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.990
 my channel and welcome today i'm 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.730
 I want to show you a novelty from 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.860
 brand aimee 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.140
 this is gel paint and foil you 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.170
 gel paint is called voice by them and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.469
 the foil is exactly the same color as 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.379
 gel paint if you wonder how 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.039
 these two tools work stay with 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.960
 I 'm ready to go with me already 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.320
 simulated nail I him 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.739
 polished well and put 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.070
 paint on the palette with bevelled brush 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.380
 draw french to your design 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.290
 turned out perfect you need 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.180
 good gash 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.470
 the surface of the nail to not have any 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.390
 hillocks and I could otherwise give back the foil 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.990
 all the flaws after you 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.009
 put it on the nail paint 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.890
 we put in one middle layer if you from 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.720
 economy and paint thinly then 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.479
 Olga 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.869
 will be translated in places because those places 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.990
 paints that were applied thinly they 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.590
 dry without a sticky layer and then in this 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.409
 place the foil and will not translate 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.060
 I put the middle layer of linen paint 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.799
 and now send in lamp for 2 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.860
 Well, you spent two minutes dried gel 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.990
 paint and now print foil like 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.750
 you can almost see in lviv 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.869
 matches the color of the gel paint and 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.620
 even if suddenly a diet of some small 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:15.930
 plots the foil is not about printed then this 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.930
 very, very quietly 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.549
 almost perfect foil imprinted 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.640
 and now I'll block the finish with sticky 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.640
 by layer 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.849
 Now you need to dry it in the lamp for 2 minutes 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.790
 after the finish is high retire him 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.380
 the sticky layer is such a menu 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.519
 nail almost 99 percent 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.310
 perfect foil transferred 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.320
 Now you can leave the design as well 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.500
 can I add some 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.290
 the surface element I offer you 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.799
 also with the help of new brand 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.459
 aimee which is called gold baroque 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:18.340
 this is their post 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.650
 make the elements on top right in chemistry 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.530
 shock to them post is sold here in such 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:30.350
 tubes and a small amount i'm 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:33.910
 I do not press on the palette did not go hollow and 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.350
 nail right on finish in glossy 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.310
 I'll draw 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:42.830
 lace will draw thin 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:46.300
 how do you schedule moments somewhere lace 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.300
 we'll have 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.919
 two minutes sent ready to lamp 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:52.349
 after the first layer has dried I will put 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:56.009
 re second layer and I will seek 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:59.250
 effect of elevation of design over the leg. 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:02.659
 as many layers as you like 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:06.419
 each layer needs to be dried separately 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:09.030
 when we have volume and you already 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.669
 calculate that it can be enough 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.819
 will on this complete the golden pasta 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:19.020
 I added a little gel paint without 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:23.300
 sticky layer and duplicate some 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:26.159
 elements seeking the play of light and shadow 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:32.180
 thus, an additional 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:32.180
 volume design will become even more interesting 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.020
 now completely drying up all the work two 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:21.960
 minutes 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:25.380
 design is completely dry them to become without 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.349
 the sticky layer is therefore dried completely 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.440
 no residual stickiness additional 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:33.150
 overlap the finish is not necessarily this 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:38.970
 work can be left 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:39.710
 already here in this form if you want you can 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.840
 to add 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:45.210
 pebbles but it seems to me the design and so 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.509
 smart enough enough 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.789
 festive and spectacular and its not at all 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:53.819
 be sure to perform at all leg 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:57.720
 points enough at 2 and it will be 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:59.669
 look very very interesting here 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.949
 This turned out design if you have 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:04.169
 please write me any questions 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:06.710
 under the video I will try to answer them 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:09.380
 do not forget to put fingers top 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:12.630
 subscribe to my video channel see you 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:16.130
