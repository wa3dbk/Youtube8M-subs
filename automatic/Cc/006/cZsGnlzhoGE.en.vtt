00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.720
 I practiced painting as a hobby myself when I was young. 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.720
 You bought cheap paints and mastered guitar instruments, bikes and the like. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.920
 I have continued the same path. 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.600
 My name is Victor Johansson, I am 25 years old, I work as an industrial engineer - 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.600
 - In the specialty of powder coating. 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.800
 Industrial paint is a coating for almost all things except cars. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.320
 Wooden furniture, metal parts, frames, car gents - and everything is possible. 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.840
 In the coating of powder coating uses electrostatic paint - 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.600
 - which is placed with the current, which is grounded with a piece of metal to prove the paint. 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.760
 So it works only in things that connect to the electrical current. 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.560
 Wet paint usually requires more preparation than powders. 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.880
 The powder is much better and thicker. 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.720
 Wet paint can be applied to everything. 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.280
 We begin by commenting what must be painted in the paintings. 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.600
 Then they are immersed in the washbasin and washed, then stalked to the dryer at a temperature of 100 degrees - 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.680
 - Then in the paint cage. 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.360
 Then enter into the oven to be burned at 210 degrees temperature and then come down again for packaging. 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.400
 I entered the profession through an internal study in the company. 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.880
 This is the most commonly used method to become an industrial paint. 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.800
 My mother's husband, who works for a company from one of our clients here, has asked me. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.200
 She began to do everything possible: cleaning places ... 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.240
 ... and preparing, grinding, metal cutting, packaging ... 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.720
 Then she started working as a trainer for a year. 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.120
 A person must have the ease of working in a group and comply with orders. 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.080
 Asthma weakens the possibility of working as a drug. The environment is full of dust. 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.080
 A person must be very capable of carrying it, that is, he is strong and patient. 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.040
 The most important thing to consider is to wear protective gear, to carry things properly - 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.640
 - Be careful in the paint work done by. 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.080
 The environment is very important. 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.240
 These are very dangerous substances: thinner and solvent. 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.160
 It is important to have good exhaust ventilation, protective gloves and protective mask. 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.040
 These things are strictly emphasized by the labor environment and are required to be followed. 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:21.200
 The hardest thing is when you get old things, and the ones that are going to be returned as new. 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.320
 This requires considerable preparatory work. Lots of grating, paste coverage. 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.200
 The envelopes are large pieces with many angles - 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.240
 - so that the person thinks how to start and where will end - 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.040
 -Week work accordingly so it gets the optimum result.
