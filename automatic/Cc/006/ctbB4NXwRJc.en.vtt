00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
around the side of the fish then we're

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.970 
around the side of the fish then we're
going<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:31.150> cut<00:00:31.360> through<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.810> skin<00:00:32.020> around<00:00:32.739> the

onto the fins the critical point is this

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.110 
onto the fins the critical point is this
small<00:00:49.420> edge<00:00:49.750> here<00:00:50.260> where<00:00:50.859> we<00:00:51.010> go<00:00:51.160> down<00:00:51.519> onto

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
inside of the fish here and the best way

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.490 
inside of the fish here and the best way
to<00:02:42.819> do<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.599> to<00:02:43.750> use<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.959> tip<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.319> your

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
to do that is to use the tip of your

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.589 
to do that is to use the tip of your
finger<00:02:44.950> push<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.790> into<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.150> back<00:02:46.329> of<00:02:46.540> the

finger push it into the back of the

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.210 
finger push it into the back of the
blood<00:02:46.840> vessel<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:47.530> then<00:02:47.709> just<00:02:47.950> pull<00:02:48.190> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
blood vessel and then just pull the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.250 
blood vessel and then just pull the
blood<00:02:48.519> forward<00:02:48.849> and<00:02:49.239> it<00:02:49.690> will<00:02:49.840> lift<00:02:50.019> out<00:02:50.230> of

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
blood forward and it will lift out of

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.949 
blood forward and it will lift out of
the<00:02:50.530> fish<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:51.069> then<00:02:51.250> use<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.489> cloth<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:52.209> just
