00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
fifa 13 so i might as well give it a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.889 
fifa 13 so i might as well give it a
fresh<00:00:56.190> start<00:00:56.520> automating<00:00:57.030> as<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> haven't

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
fresh start automating as I haven't

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.290 
fresh start automating as I haven't
really<00:00:58.020> done<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:59.160> much<00:00:59.430> if<00:00:59.609> he<00:00:59.670> for<00:00:59.850> 12<00:01:00.090> I

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
really done that as much if he for 12 I

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.420 
really done that as much if he for 12 I
did<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:01.020> know<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.170> did<00:01:01.379> start<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:01.980> late<00:01:02.219> in

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
did you know I did start really late in

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.789 
did you know I did start really late in
fifa<00:01:02.670> 12<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.750> know<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.870> decided<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.470> it's

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
fifa 12 but you know I decided that it's

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.530 
fifa 12 but you know I decided that it's
no<00:01:05.010> real<00:01:05.250> point<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.640> carrying<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.060> fifa<00:01:06.330> tall

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
no real point of carrying on fifa tall

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.660 
no real point of carrying on fifa tall
as<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.990> know<00:01:07.140> fifa<00:01:07.560> 13<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.369> around<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
as you know fifa 13 was just around the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.670 
as you know fifa 13 was just around the
corner<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.689> now<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.409> might<00:01:10.590> as

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
corner and here it is now so might as

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.770 
corner and here it is now so might as
well<00:01:10.860> give<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.400> fresh<00:01:11.580> start<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.210> see<00:01:12.689> how

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
well give it a fresh start and see how

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.840 
well give it a fresh start and see how
it<00:01:12.930> goes<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.350> see<00:01:13.470> how<00:01:13.560> far<00:01:13.590> i<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.790> this

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it goes and see how far i get so in this

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.190 
it goes and see how far i get so in this
game<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.360> was<00:01:15.450> quite<00:01:15.659> interesting<00:01:15.689> because

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
game it was quite interesting because

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
game it was quite interesting because
this<00:01:16.500> guy<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:16.979> playing<00:01:17.280> against<00:01:17.700> had<00:01:17.790> a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
this guy was playing against had a

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.550 
this guy was playing against had a
really<00:01:18.030> decent<00:01:18.240> team<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.900> his<00:01:19.020> goalkeeper

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
really decent team but his goalkeeper

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.710 
really decent team but his goalkeeper
was<00:01:19.680> kind<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.549> don't<00:01:21.060> know<00:01:21.090> why<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.659> I'm

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
was kind of I don't know why so I'm

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.030 
was kind of I don't know why so I'm
gonna<00:01:21.840> make<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> team<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.500> forget<00:01:22.860> about

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
gonna make a team like that forget about

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.090 
gonna make a team like that forget about
a<00:01:23.159> gold<00:01:23.369> key<00:01:23.580> because<00:01:24.000> once<00:01:24.780> once<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.860> started

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
a gold key because once once I started

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.819 
a gold key because once once I started
to<00:01:26.220> attack<00:01:26.460> i<00:01:26.729> saw<00:01:26.939> uh<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:28.140> know<00:01:28.259> didn't

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
to attack i saw uh you know didn't

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.260 
to attack i saw uh you know didn't
really<00:01:29.009> miss<00:01:29.159> my<00:01:29.369> opportunities<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.119> I

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
really miss my opportunities and I

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.370 
really miss my opportunities and I
should<00:01:30.509> think<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.840> should<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.079> scored<00:01:31.229> more

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
should think I should have scored more

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.039 
should think I should have scored more
than<00:01:31.729> wooden<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.150> actually<00:01:33.420> gotta<00:01:33.810> find<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
than wooden what I actually gotta find a

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.800 
than wooden what I actually gotta find a

know graphics wise it's sort of the

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.159 
know graphics wise it's sort of the
whole<00:05:22.550> thing<00:05:22.910> schemes<00:05:23.330> changes<00:05:23.810> what<00:05:23.960> i<00:05:23.990> can

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
whole thing schemes changes what i can

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.310 
whole thing schemes changes what i can
see<00:05:24.350> that<00:05:24.380> and<00:05:25.280> also<00:05:25.600> when<00:05:26.600> it<00:05:26.720> comes<00:05:27.020> to

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
see that and also when it comes to

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.120 
see that and also when it comes to
dribbling<00:05:28.280> goes<00:05:28.430> wrong<00:05:28.640> it's<00:05:28.910> even<00:05:29.270> more

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
dribbling goes wrong it's even more

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.400 
dribbling goes wrong it's even more
chances<00:05:31.130> to<00:05:31.190> actually<00:05:31.610> fell<00:05:31.970> in<00:05:32.200> having<00:05:33.200> to

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
chances to actually fell in having to

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.560 
chances to actually fell in having to
control<00:05:34.220> the<00:05:34.370> ball<00:05:34.550> once<00:05:34.850> you<00:05:35.000> receive<00:05:35.330> it

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
control the ball once you receive it

really equal distance apart when you

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.760 
really equal distance apart when you
really<00:05:46.400> compare<00:05:46.790> it<00:05:46.910> this<00:05:47.240> to<00:05:47.479> fifa<00:05:48.380> 12<00:05:48.620> fifa
