00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
you know the time when it arrives in a

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.460 
you know the time when it arrives in a
particular<00:02:36.720> phone<00:02:36.930> is<00:02:37.140> up<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.410> each

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
particular phone is up to each

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.250 
particular phone is up to each
individual<00:02:38.010> manufacturer<00:02:38.640> right<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:40.080> there

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
individual manufacturer right is there

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.500 
individual manufacturer right is there
any<00:02:40.410> expectation<00:02:41.340> no<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.790> again<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.060> know<00:02:42.240> it's

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
any expectation no and again I know it's

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.690 
any expectation no and again I know it's
up<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.870> manufacturers<00:02:43.770> but<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.610> it

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
up to the manufacturers but that it

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.300 
up to the manufacturers but that it
would<00:02:44.820> happen<00:02:44.970> faster<00:02:45.810> than<00:02:46.140> in<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.740> past<00:02:46.920> or

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
would happen faster than in the past or

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.010 
would happen faster than in the past or
is<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.580> expectation<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.330> will<00:02:48.480> be<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.750> same

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
is the expectation it will be the same

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.070 
is the expectation it will be the same
so<00:02:49.860> this<00:02:50.100> year<00:02:50.340> we<00:02:50.970> released<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.540> preview<00:02:51.930> at

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
so this year we released a preview at

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.960 
so this year we released a preview at
i/o<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.800> we've<00:02:52.980> released<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.550> version<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
i/o so we've released a version of the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.450 
i/o so we've released a version of the
operating<00:02:54.090> system<00:02:54.660> for<00:02:54.900> OEMs<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:55.980> developers

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
operating system for OEMs and developers

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.010 
operating system for OEMs and developers
to<00:02:56.610> look<00:02:56.760> at<00:02:56.940> earlier<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.690> year<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.990> know

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
to look at earlier in the year you know

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.750 
to look at earlier in the year you know
those<00:02:58.290> several<00:02:58.890> months<00:02:59.010> ago<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.370> late<00:02:59.550> June

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
those several months ago in late June

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.580 
those several months ago in late June
and<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:00.720> do<00:03:00.840> expect<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.530> will

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
and so we do expect that that will

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.470 
and so we do expect that that will
accelerate<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.280> process<00:03:02.460> of<00:03:02.820> OEMs<00:03:03.210> rolling

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
accelerate the process of OEMs rolling

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.550 
accelerate the process of OEMs rolling
out<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.720> update<00:03:04.020> because<00:03:04.230> essentially

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
out the update because essentially

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.930 
out the update because essentially
they've<00:03:04.800> had<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.040> chance<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.520> look<00:03:05.670> at<00:03:05.790> it
