00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
doing it and you would think that

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.380 
doing it and you would think that
putting<00:02:20.220> them<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:20.580> him<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.910> good<00:02:21.180> thing

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
you know again it's it's giving them a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.920 
you know again it's it's giving them a
