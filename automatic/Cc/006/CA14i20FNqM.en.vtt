00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.640 
figure the only real problem he has is
the<00:06:38.060> fact<00:06:38.510> that<00:06:38.570> mines

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
the fact that mines

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.670 
the fact that mines
is<00:06:40.090> puffed<00:06:41.090> out<00:06:41.270> like<00:06:41.540> that<00:06:41.810> but<00:06:42.199> again<00:06:42.320> I<00:06:42.470> can

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
is puffed out like that but again I can

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.499 
is puffed out like that but again I can
probably<00:06:42.860> fix<00:06:43.130> that<00:06:43.460> with<00:06:43.729> some<00:06:44.030> hot<00:06:44.240> water

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:44.509 
probably fix that with some hot water

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:45.850 
probably fix that with some hot water
put<00:06:44.750> in<00:06:44.840> the<00:06:44.930> comment<00:06:45.199> section<00:06:45.500> if<00:06:45.560> you<00:06:45.680> think
