pintuck feet there's four sizes starting

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.019 
pintuck feet there's four sizes starting
off<00:00:21.439> with<00:00:21.680> depending<00:00:22.099> on<00:00:22.220> how<00:00:22.460> many<00:00:22.520> grooves

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
off with depending on how many grooves

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.720 
off with depending on how many grooves
you<00:00:23.180> see<00:00:23.450> on<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:23.840> bottom<00:00:24.020> then<00:00:24.829> each<00:00:25.189> pintuck

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
you see on the bottom then each pintuck

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.970 
you see on the bottom then each pintuck
foot<00:00:26.059> is<00:00:26.270> matched<00:00:26.630> up<00:00:26.989> with<00:00:27.290> a<00:00:27.349> double<00:00:27.770> needle

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
foot is matched up with a double needle

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.429 
foot is matched up with a double needle
that<00:00:28.399> fits<00:00:28.759> this<00:00:29.090> particular<00:00:29.450> size<00:00:29.960> of<00:00:30.200> foot

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
that fits this particular size of foot

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.069 
that fits this particular size of foot
if<00:00:30.710> this<00:00:31.430> one<00:00:31.700> has<00:00:32.059> three<00:00:32.509> grooves<00:00:32.809> that's

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
if this one has three grooves that's

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.049 
if this one has three grooves that's
going<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.290> be<00:00:33.380> set<00:00:33.590> up<00:00:33.620> for<00:00:33.710> thicker<00:00:34.219> fabrics

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
going to be set up for thicker fabrics

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.349 
going to be set up for thicker fabrics
so<00:00:35.600> we<00:00:35.719> go<00:00:35.839> from<00:00:36.050> three<00:00:36.410> groups<00:00:37.000> to<00:00:38.000> five

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:38.359 
so we go from three groups to five

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.650 
so we go from three groups to five
grooves<00:00:39.429> seven<00:00:40.429> grooves<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:40.999> all<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.510> way<00:00:41.629> up

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
grooves seven grooves and all the way up

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.869 
grooves seven grooves and all the way up
to<00:00:41.989> nine<00:00:42.289> grooves<00:00:42.649> now<00:00:42.920> see<00:00:43.160> how<00:00:43.249> find<00:00:43.640> those

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
to nine grooves now see how find those

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.319 
to nine grooves now see how find those
pintuck<00:00:44.839> feet<00:00:45.140> grooves<00:00:45.949> are<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:46.879> those<00:00:47.149> are

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
pintuck feet grooves are so those are

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.810 
pintuck feet grooves are so those are
going<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:47.480> be<00:00:47.629> for<00:00:47.870> finer<00:00:48.199> fabrics<00:00:49.039> as<00:00:49.280> you

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
going to be for finer fabrics as you

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.810 
going to be for finer fabrics as you
match<00:00:49.999> up<00:00:50.030> your<00:00:50.899> double<00:00:51.559> needle<00:00:51.800> you<00:00:52.489> almost

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
match up your double needle you almost

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.669 
match up your double needle you almost
could<00:00:53.030> just<00:00:53.210> lay<00:00:53.480> it<00:00:53.690> in<00:00:53.989> one<00:00:54.170> of<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:54.379> grooves

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
could just lay it in one of the grooves

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.919 
could just lay it in one of the grooves
and<00:00:54.949> see<00:00:55.190> if<00:00:55.309> it<00:00:55.460> matches<00:00:55.640> for<00:00:56.300> example<00:00:56.749> this

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:56.929 
and see if it matches for example this

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.229 
and see if it matches for example this

of the machine where you come down and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.440 
of the machine where you come down and
that's<00:01:43.220> actually<00:01:43.610> where<00:01:43.730> the<00:01:43.790> tensions<00:01:44.240> are

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
that's actually where the tensions are

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.450 
that's actually where the tensions are
when<00:01:44.810> you're<00:01:44.930> using<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.350> double<00:01:45.620> needle<00:01:45.650> what

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
when you're using a double needle what

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.040 
when you're using a double needle what
you<00:01:46.580> want<00:01:46.760> to<00:01:46.850> do<00:01:47.000> is<00:01:47.180> separate<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.720> two

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
you want to do is separate the two

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.800 
you want to do is separate the two
threads<00:01:48.440> put<00:01:48.890> one<00:01:49.250> thread<00:01:49.610> on<00:01:49.820> one<00:01:50.090> side<00:01:50.450> and

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
threads put one thread on one side and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.990 
threads put one thread on one side and
one<00:01:51.350> thread<00:01:51.680> on<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.010> other<00:01:52.190> side<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.760> fin

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
one thread on the other side of the fin

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.360 
one thread on the other side of the fin
and<00:01:53.270> then<00:01:53.660> that<00:01:53.840> will<00:01:54.020> give<00:01:54.260> each<00:01:54.650> thread<00:01:55.130> its

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
and then that will give each thread its

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.550 
and then that will give each thread its
own<00:01:55.610> tension<00:01:56.330> desk<00:01:56.540> to<00:01:56.750> keep<00:01:56.960> for<00:01:57.170> even

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
own tension desk to keep for even

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.590 
own tension desk to keep for even
stitching<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.370> then<00:01:58.820> just<00:01:59.030> put<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.390> two

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
stitching and then just put the two

now<00:03:01.880> I've<00:03:02.060> used<00:03:02.360> some<00:03:02.630> threads<00:03:03.350> that<00:03:04.069> are

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
now I've used some threads that are

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.510 
now I've used some threads that are
visible<00:03:05.930> here<00:03:06.260> so<00:03:06.380> we<00:03:06.440> got<00:03:06.590> two<00:03:06.830> blue<00:03:07.100> threads

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520

visible here so we got two blue threads
going<00:03:08.030> through<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.390> needles<00:03:08.750> now<00:03:09.440> here's

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
going through the needles now here's

going through the needles now here's
where<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.069> pintuck<00:03:10.400> foot<00:03:10.640> comes<00:03:10.910> into<00:03:11.209> play

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
where the pintuck foot comes into play

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.050 
where the pintuck foot comes into play
as<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:12.350> go<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.530> stitch<00:03:12.770> the<00:03:12.980> next<00:03:13.370> row<00:03:13.580> you

as you go to stitch the next row you

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.790 
as you go to stitch the next row you
take<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:14.390> pin<00:03:14.600> tuck<00:03:15.110> you've<00:03:15.350> made<00:03:15.620> in<00:03:15.770> your

the grooves are going to guide the tucks
down<00:04:18.400> keeping<00:04:19.120> everything<00:04:19.450> perfectly

parallel

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.860 

and<00:04:27.490> one<00:04:28.490> more<00:04:28.790> just<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.180> see<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.510> final

and one more just to see the final
result<00:04:30.260> this<00:04:30.770> would<00:04:30.980> allow<00:04:31.190> for<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.520> little

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
result this would allow for a little

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.670 
result this would allow for a little
detail<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:32.870> could<00:04:32.990> add<00:04:33.170> some<00:04:33.410> decorative

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
stitches in between the tucks as you

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.909 
stitches in between the tucks as you
spread<00:04:36.290> them<00:04:36.470> out<00:04:37.720> whatever<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:38.840> want<00:04:38.990> to<00:04:39.080> do

isn't that pretty and then for the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.320 
isn't that pretty and then for the
backside<00:04:47.110> you'll<00:04:47.440> see<00:04:47.650> that<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:48.330> bobbin
