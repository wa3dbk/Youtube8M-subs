00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
I'm doing here there we go ok so that

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.050 
I'm doing here there we go ok so that
doesn't<00:02:07.590> look<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.770> much<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.369> ramp<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.910> I'm

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
doesn't look like much of a ramp so I'm

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.229 
doesn't look like much of a ramp so I'm
kind<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.330> put<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.599> ramp<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.200> right<00:02:10.349> now<00:02:11.239> and

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
kind of put a ramp on it right now and

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.110 
kind of put a ramp on it right now and
we<00:02:12.510> want<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.750> large<00:02:13.050> ramp

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
we want a large ramp

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.800 
we want a large ramp
and<00:02:16.730> normally<00:02:17.730> when<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.120> go<00:02:18.270> over<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.540> top<00:02:18.660> of

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and normally when you go over the top of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.060 
and normally when you go over the top of
things<00:02:19.020> this<00:02:19.380> is<00:02:19.500> what<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.680> was<00:02:19.740> talking<00:02:19.890> about

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
things this is what I was talking about

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.400 
things this is what I was talking about
earlier<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.820> can't<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:21.270> place<00:02:21.570> items<00:02:21.930> on

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
earlier is you can't just place items on

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.040 
earlier is you can't just place items on
top<00:02:22.620> because<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.040> get<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.340> kind<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:24.050> select

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
top because you get this kind of select

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.360 
top because you get this kind of select
tool<00:02:25.320> over<00:02:25.530> for<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.770> stuff<00:02:25.980> you've<00:02:26.130> already

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
tool over for the stuff you've already

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.420 
tool over for the stuff you've already
placed<00:02:26.610> but<00:02:27.510> if<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.990> place<00:02:28.710> down<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.190> ramp

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
placed but if you place down the ramp

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.810 
placed but if you place down the ramp
and<00:02:29.610> then<00:02:29.880> pick<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.150> back<00:02:30.330> up<00:02:30.390> again<00:02:31.730> there<00:02:32.730> you

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
and then pick it back up again there you

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.780 
and then pick it back up again there you
go<00:02:32.970> actually<00:02:33.690> appears<00:02:34.200> right<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:34.830> top<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.220> the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
go actually appears right on top of the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.150 
go actually appears right on top of the
boxes<00:02:36.390> you've<00:02:36.690> just<00:02:36.930> placed<00:02:37.140> down<00:02:37.320> now<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
boxes you've just placed down now the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.310 
boxes you've just placed down now the
reason<00:02:38.400> why<00:02:38.700> you've<00:02:38.880> used<00:02:39.090> these<00:02:39.360> boxes<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.290> I

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
reason why you've used these boxes and I

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.990 
reason why you've used these boxes and I
think<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.890> me<00:02:41.100> just<00:02:41.280> see<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:41.460> I<00:02:41.580> can<00:02:41.730> actually

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
think I me just see if I can actually

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.810 
think I me just see if I can actually
place<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:42.450> on<00:02:42.630> oh<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:43.080> don't<00:02:43.820> slowest

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
place this on oh I don't slowest

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.580 
place this on oh I don't slowest
sensitive<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.980> little<00:02:46.980> bit<00:02:47.160> more<00:02:48.290> but<00:02:49.290> is

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
sensitive this a little bit more but is

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.660 
sensitive this a little bit more but is
because<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.460> is<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.730> perfect<00:02:51.000> height<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:52.670> do

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
because it is the perfect height to do

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.040 
because it is the perfect height to do
that<00:02:53.850> now<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.630> see<00:02:54.810> there's<00:02:54.960> a<00:02:55.020> little

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
that now you can see there's a little

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.920 
that now you can see there's a little
gap<00:02:55.380> but<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.650> doesn't<00:02:55.890> matter<00:02:55.950> because<00:02:56.930> it

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
gap but it doesn't matter because it

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.710 
gap but it doesn't matter because it
just<00:02:58.050> does<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.730> if<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.090> want<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.360> three

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
just does that so if you want a three

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.410 
just does that so if you want a three
tower<00:03:01.460> we<00:03:02.460> can<00:03:02.640> do<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.880> as<00:03:03.000> well<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.360> can

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
tower we can do that as well you can

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.750 
tower we can do that as well you can
actually<00:03:03.630> do<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.250> infinitely<00:03:05.250> amount<00:03:05.670> of

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
actually do this infinitely amount of

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.090 
actually do this infinitely amount of
times<00:03:06.000> up<00:03:06.210> until<00:03:06.480> 50<00:03:06.870> props<00:03:07.170> which<00:03:07.830> I'll<00:03:07.980> talk

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
times up until 50 props which I'll talk

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.660 
times up until 50 props which I'll talk
about<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.490> look<00:03:08.670> second<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:10.230> if<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.640> make<00:03:11.640> a

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
about in a look second so if you make a

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.620 
about in a look second so if you make a
little<00:03:11.970> gap<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:13.310> actually<00:03:14.310> want<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.730> be

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
little gap I actually want it to be

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.110 
little gap I actually want it to be
parallel<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.500> ramp<00:03:16.860> so<00:03:17.100> much<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.550> cannot

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
parallel to that ramp so much you cannot

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.680 
parallel to that ramp so much you cannot
follow<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.570> too<00:03:18.750> closely<00:03:19.020> so<00:03:20.010> go<00:03:20.340> here<00:03:20.880> another

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
follow it too closely so go here another

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:33.230 
follow it too closely so go here another
one<00:03:22.020> here<00:03:25.550> another<00:03:26.550> one<00:03:30.350> now<00:03:31.350> go<00:03:31.850> now<00:03:32.850> same

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
one here another one now go now same

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.090 
one here another one now go now same
problem<00:03:33.570> applies<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.200> can't<00:03:34.709> just<00:03:34.890> place

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
problem applies I can't just place

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.830 
problem applies I can't just place
another<00:03:35.340> box<00:03:35.670> on<00:03:36.000> top<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.330> that<00:03:36.450> otherwise

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
another box on top of that otherwise

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.380 
another box on top of that otherwise
we'd<00:03:37.110> have<00:03:37.140> two<00:03:37.920> of<00:03:38.070> this<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:39.090> what<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.270> need

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
we'd have two of this so what you need

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.760 
we'd have two of this so what you need
to<00:03:39.480> do<00:03:39.570> is<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:39.840> need<00:03:39.990> to<00:03:40.020> place<00:03:40.290> four<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.680> these

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
to do is you need to place four of these

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.900 
to do is you need to place four of these
little<00:03:41.310> little<00:03:41.940> boxes<00:03:42.300> pick<00:03:43.290> one<00:03:43.440> up<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.910> do

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
little little boxes pick one up and do

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.130 
little little boxes pick one up and do
exactly<00:03:45.030> what<00:03:45.330> you<00:03:45.420> did<00:03:45.600> with<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.810> ramp<00:03:45.990> on

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
exactly what you did with the ramp on

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.330 
exactly what you did with the ramp on
the<00:03:46.170> first<00:03:46.470> one<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.830> just<00:03:47.340> place<00:03:47.550> them<00:03:47.730> on<00:03:48.060> top

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
the first one and just place them on top

00:03:49.340 --> 00:04:01.369 
the first one and just place them on top
just<00:03:50.340> like<00:03:50.580> underneath<00:03:55.520> here<00:03:56.520> we<00:03:56.610> go
