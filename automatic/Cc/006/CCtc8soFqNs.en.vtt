00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
gonna try and eat them anyway obviously

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.810 
gonna try and eat them anyway obviously
we'll<00:02:32.060> see<00:02:32.269> how<00:02:32.420> they<00:02:32.569> taste<00:02:32.829> yeah<00:02:33.829> there's

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
we'll see how they taste yeah there's

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.039 
we'll see how they taste yeah there's
two<00:02:34.970> more<00:02:35.000> things<00:02:35.329> that<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.540> think<00:02:35.600> are<00:02:35.840> worthy

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
two more things that I think are worthy

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.800 
two more things that I think are worthy
of<00:02:36.200> showing<00:02:36.859> our<00:02:37.280> basil<00:02:38.000> here<00:02:38.239> started<00:02:38.690> to

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
of showing our basil here started to

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.180 
of showing our basil here started to
actually<00:02:38.989> flower<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:42.470> we<00:02:42.590> clipped<00:02:42.859> off<00:02:43.010> the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
actually flower so we clipped off the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.460 
actually flower so we clipped off the
flowering<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:44.090> why<00:02:44.480> was<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:44.870> why<00:02:45.170> do<00:02:45.230> we<00:02:45.380> do

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
flowering to why was it why do we do

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.849 
flowering to why was it why do we do
that<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.769> me<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:46.660> don't<00:02:47.660> know<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.170> think<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.739> has

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
that to me I don't know I think it has

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.099 
that to me I don't know I think it has
something<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.340> do<00:02:49.519> with<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.540> way<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.840> plant

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
something to do with the way the plant

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.020 
something to do with the way the plant
will<00:02:51.260> grow<00:02:51.290> it's<00:02:51.530> also<00:02:51.680> variable<00:02:52.400> T<00:02:52.670> because

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
will grow it's also variable T because

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.350 
will grow it's also variable T because
it<00:02:53.180> wasn't<00:02:53.450> getting<00:02:53.660> enough<00:02:53.750> water<00:02:53.920> but<00:02:54.920> um

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
it wasn't getting enough water but um

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.570 
it wasn't getting enough water but um
it's<00:02:57.020> something<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.560> do<00:02:57.710> with<00:02:57.890> have<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.250> how

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
it's something to do with have it how

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.010 
it's something to do with have it how
the<00:02:58.640> plant<00:02:59.000> grows<00:02:59.210> and<00:02:59.540> you're<00:02:59.630> not<00:02:59.750> supposed

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
the plant grows and you're not supposed

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.490 
the plant grows and you're not supposed
to<00:03:00.110> let<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.970> mm-hmm<00:03:01.970> our<00:03:02.750> green<00:03:03.050> onion<00:03:03.350> is

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
to let it mm-hmm our green onion is

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.230 
to let it mm-hmm our green onion is
really<00:03:03.740> just<00:03:03.890> thriving<00:03:04.280> at<00:03:04.610> this<00:03:04.760> point<00:03:05.000> which

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
really just thriving at this point which

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.360 
really just thriving at this point which
is<00:03:05.390> great<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.870> just<00:03:06.260> had<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.530> little<00:03:06.710> and<00:03:06.950> tasted

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
is great I just had a little and tasted

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.240 
is great I just had a little and tasted
very<00:03:07.550> much<00:03:07.820> like<00:03:08.090> green<00:03:08.390> onion<00:03:08.830> so<00:03:09.830> here's<00:03:10.070> the

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
very much like green onion so here's the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.740 
very much like green onion so here's the
last<00:03:10.400> thing<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:10.940> think<00:03:10.970> is<00:03:11.300> worthy<00:03:11.570> of

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
last thing and I think is worthy of

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.540 
last thing and I think is worthy of
showing<00:03:12.080> this<00:03:12.410> week<00:03:12.650> has<00:03:13.070> to<00:03:13.100> do<00:03:13.400> with

it suckers are a situation where you
have<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.590> big<00:03:25.520> branch<00:03:25.850> coming<00:03:26.300> out<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.810> then

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
have a big branch coming out and then

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.800 
have a big branch coming out and then
there's<00:03:27.380> this<00:03:27.590> little<00:03:27.920> other<00:03:28.730> little<00:03:29.240> branch

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
there's this little other little branch

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.570 
there's this little other little branch
that<00:03:30.050> will<00:03:30.200> come<00:03:30.410> out<00:03:30.560> but<00:03:30.800> this<00:03:30.920> branch<00:03:31.250> that

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
that will come out but this branch that

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.870 
that will come out but this branch that
comes<00:03:31.850> out<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.180> middle<00:03:33.430> will<00:03:34.430> never<00:03:34.670> ever

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
comes out in the middle will never ever

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.150 
comes out in the middle will never ever
produce<00:03:35.180> any<00:03:35.450> fruit<00:03:35.780> it's<00:03:36.560> pretty<00:03:36.920> much<00:03:37.100> just

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
produce any fruit it's pretty much just

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.930 
produce any fruit it's pretty much just
something<00:03:37.820> that<00:03:38.030> saps<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.989> plant's<00:03:39.470> growth

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
something that saps the plant's growth

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.520 
something that saps the plant's growth
and<00:03:40.940> so<00:03:41.330> it<00:03:41.480> puts<00:03:41.690> all<00:03:41.840> its<00:03:42.020> energy<00:03:42.170> into

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
and so it puts all its energy into

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.460 
and so it puts all its energy into
creating<00:03:42.739> these<00:03:43.070> little<00:03:43.340> pointless<00:03:43.640> things

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
creating these little pointless things

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.850 
creating these little pointless things
and<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:45.910> instead<00:03:46.910> of<00:03:46.970> creating<00:03:47.480> but<00:03:48.440> we<00:03:48.590> wanted

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
and it instead of creating but we wanted

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.060 
and it instead of creating but we wanted
to<00:03:48.920> create<00:03:49.190> which<00:03:49.820> is<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.270> fruits<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:51.739> actual

noticed<00:04:08.320> but<00:04:09.880> there<00:04:10.880> we<00:04:11.030> go<00:04:11.180> see<00:04:11.390> we're<00:04:12.380> doing

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
noticed but there we go see we're doing

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.670 
noticed but there we go see we're doing
that<00:04:12.799> now<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.730> we<00:04:14.600> just<00:04:14.780> went<00:04:14.930> through<00:04:15.080> and<00:04:15.530> got

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680

that now so we just went through and got
a<00:04:15.739> whole<00:04:16.010> bunch<00:04:16.310> of<00:04:16.430> them<00:04:16.580> and<00:04:16.790> we're<00:04:17.299> going<00:04:17.419> to

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
a whole bunch of them and we're going to

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.409
