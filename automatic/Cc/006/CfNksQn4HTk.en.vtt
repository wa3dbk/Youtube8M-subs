00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
this screen up here is a little bit

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.250 
this screen up here is a little bit
different<00:05:34.280> from<00:05:34.340> previous<00:05:34.610> years<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.330> lot<00:05:35.810> more

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
different from previous years a lot more

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.040 
different from previous years a lot more
information<00:05:37.030> it's<00:05:38.030> telling<00:05:38.360> me<00:05:38.480> that<00:05:38.720> we<00:05:38.870> need

to put our seatbelts on
all<00:05:42.800> right<00:05:43.040> so<00:05:43.640> one<00:05:43.820> of<00:05:43.850> the<00:05:44.090> other<00:05:44.470> major

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
all right so one of the other major

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.130 
all right so one of the other major
improvement<00:05:46.700> this<00:05:46.940> year<00:05:47.180> which<00:05:47.450> is<00:05:47.720> a<00:05:48.110> huge

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140

bonus<00:05:48.830> is<00:05:49.510> it<00:05:50.510> has<00:05:51.230> a<00:05:51.260> 2.5<00:05:52.210> boxer<00:05:53.210> engine<00:05:53.750> and

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
bonus is it has a 2.5 boxer engine and

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.250 
bonus is it has a 2.5 boxer engine and
they<00:05:55.520> put<00:05:55.790> the<00:05:55.940> new<00:05:56.120> improved<00:05:56.570> CVT

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
they put the new improved CVT

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.950 
they put the new improved CVT
transmission<00:05:57.980> in<00:05:58.130> it<00:05:58.280> and<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:59.270> big<00:05:59.600> point

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
transmission in it and the big point

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.050
