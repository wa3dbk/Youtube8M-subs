00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
you are you try and analyze and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.459 
you are you try and analyze and
reanalyze<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.540> talk<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.960> your<00:02:04.079> constituents

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
if there's a new or different approach

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
or a new or different argument you can

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.219 
or a new or different argument you can
make<00:02:08.399> or<00:02:08.759> suggestion<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.420> other<00:02:09.660> side<00:02:09.899> or

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
a new and different analysis somehow you

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.309 
a new and different analysis somehow you
realize

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
realize

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.110 
realize
of<00:02:13.439> what<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.829> status<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.370> proposals<00:02:14.909> is

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
of what the status of the proposals is

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.300 
of what the status of the proposals is
you<00:02:15.749> take<00:02:16.019> that<00:02:16.230> into<00:02:16.439> account<00:02:16.469> you<00:02:16.950> go<00:02:17.069> back

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
you take that into account you go back

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.190 
you take that into account you go back
to<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.609> bargaining<00:02:17.819> table<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.689> continue

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
to the bargaining table and you continue

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.940 
to the bargaining table and you continue
the<00:02:19.319> discussions<00:02:19.859> until<00:02:21.349> you<00:02:22.349> find<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.769> way<00:02:22.799> to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
the discussions until you find a way to

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.160 
the discussions until you find a way to
make<00:02:23.069> an<00:02:23.280> agreement<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.849> if<00:02:24.180> that's<00:02:24.569> Tuesday

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
make an agreement and if that's Tuesday

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.379 
make an agreement and if that's Tuesday
or<00:02:25.439> a<00:02:25.499> week<00:02:25.709> from<00:02:25.859> Tuesday<00:02:26.069> it's<00:02:26.790> whenever<00:02:27.239> it

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:27.389 
or a week from Tuesday it's whenever it

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.759 
or a week from Tuesday it's whenever it
is<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.249> process<00:02:29.989> will<00:02:30.989> take<00:02:31.019> as<00:02:31.379> long<00:02:31.590> as

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
is and the process will take as long as

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.069 
is and the process will take as long as
it<00:02:31.889> takes<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.760> optimum<00:02:33.269> of<00:02:33.389> course<00:02:33.659> is<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.959> get

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
it takes the optimum of course is to get

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.979 
it takes the optimum of course is to get
a<00:02:34.109> deal<00:02:34.319> done<00:02:34.349> before<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.609> one<00:02:35.819> expires<00:02:36.269> and

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
a deal done before this one expires and

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.409 
a deal done before this one expires and
we<00:02:37.290> certainly<00:02:37.439> hope<00:02:37.769> that's<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:38.129> case<00:02:38.219> but<00:02:38.419> we

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:39.419 
we certainly hope that's the case but we

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.550 
we certainly hope that's the case but we
have<00:02:39.629> to<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.319> wait<00:02:40.919> to<00:02:41.099> see<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:42.560> that's

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
have to to wait to see and that's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.379 
have to to wait to see and that's
basically<00:02:43.829> where<00:02:44.189> we<00:02:44.249> are<00:02:44.489> so<00:02:44.730> we<00:02:44.939> take<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.209> few

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
basically where we are so we take a few

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:46.789 
basically where we are so we take a few
questions<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.049> as<00:02:46.169> I<00:02:46.260> said<00:02:46.319> there's<00:02:46.650> not<00:02:46.769> a

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
questions but as I said there's not a

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.949 
questions but as I said there's not a
lot<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.010> news<00:02:47.219> yes<00:02:47.669> we're<00:02:47.849> live<00:02:48.030> on<00:02:48.060> cp24<00:02:48.540> news

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
help get to a solution well I tend to

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:09.589 
help get to a solution well I tend to
look<00:03:05.790> at<00:03:05.969> it<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.239> way<00:03:06.299> if<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:08.069> object<00:03:08.579> is<00:03:08.760> to

look at it this way if the object is to

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.159 
look at it this way if the object is to
reach<00:03:10.109> a<00:03:10.319> solution<00:03:10.969> before<00:03:11.969> you<00:03:12.810> have<00:03:13.019> an

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
reach a solution before you have an

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.920 
reach a solution before you have an
interruption<00:03:13.680> in<00:03:13.919> a<00:03:14.489> normal<00:03:14.730> course<00:03:15.659> of<00:03:15.810> the

season in this case training camps will

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.409 
season in this case training camps will
be<00:03:17.939> September<00:03:18.419> 15<00:03:19.639> then<00:03:20.639> you<00:03:20.790> have<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.180> wonder

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
be September 15 then you have to wonder

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.390 
be September 15 then you have to wonder
why<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.049> is<00:03:22.229> that<00:03:22.379> you're<00:03:22.739> shutting<00:03:23.159> things

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
why it is that you're shutting things

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.849 
why it is that you're shutting things
down<00:03:23.609> at<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.299> point<00:03:24.599> unless<00:03:25.319> your<00:03:25.500> purpose

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
down at that point unless your purpose

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.490 
down at that point unless your purpose
is<00:03:26.009> you<00:03:26.310> know<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.699> think<00:03:26.909> to<00:03:27.060> get<00:03:27.209> leverage

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
is you know you think to get leverage

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.929 
is you know you think to get leverage
problem<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:28.620> this<00:03:28.739> industry<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.609> history

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
problem in this industry is that history

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.270 
problem in this industry is that history
suggests<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.870> doesn't<00:03:31.259> work<00:03:31.409> given<00:03:32.129> what

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
suggests that doesn't work given what

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.159 
suggests that doesn't work given what
happened<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.699> last<00:03:32.729> time<00:03:33.030> from<00:03:33.959> our

happened the last time from our
standpoint<00:03:34.729> we<00:03:35.729> treat<00:03:36.090> on<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.540> player<00:03:36.750> side

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
standpoint we treat on the player side

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.679 
standpoint we treat on the player side
the<00:03:37.590> possibility<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.310> a<00:03:38.400> strike<00:03:38.699> as<00:03:38.909> a<00:03:38.970> last

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
the possibility of a strike as a last

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:44.390 
the possibility of a strike as a last
resort<00:03:40.409> and<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:41.310> last<00:03:41.699> resort<00:03:42.239> means<00:03:43.009> that<00:03:44.009> you

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
resort and a last resort means that you

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.030 
resort and a last resort means that you
negotiate<00:03:44.909> in<00:03:45.030> good<00:03:45.060> faith<00:03:45.379> you<00:03:46.379> do<00:03:46.560> what<00:03:46.889> you

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
that's a judgment that everybody will

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.909 

I'm<00:06:18.449> not<00:06:18.750> going<00:06:19.169> to<00:06:19.229> comment<00:06:19.410> on<00:06:19.620> that<00:06:19.800> because

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
I'm not going to comment on that because

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.140 
I'm not going to comment on that because
I'm<00:06:20.160> still<00:06:20.370> hopeful<00:06:20.729> that<00:06:20.849> we're<00:06:20.970> going<00:06:21.090> to

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
I'm still hopeful that we're going to

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.719 
I'm still hopeful that we're going to
find<00:06:21.360> a<00:06:21.479> way<00:06:21.630> not<00:06:21.660> to<00:06:22.310> that's<00:06:23.310> not<00:06:23.520> a<00:06:23.550> question

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
find a way not to that's not a question

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.610 
find a way not to that's not a question
I<00:06:24.060> ever<00:06:24.210> hope<00:06:24.389> we<00:06:24.569> have<00:06:24.720> to<00:06:24.870> have<00:06:25.020> answered<00:06:25.349> and

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
I ever hope we have to have answered and

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.339 
I ever hope we have to have answered and
I<00:06:25.979> certainly<00:06:26.280> hope<00:06:26.430> that's<00:06:26.520> not<00:06:26.789> the<00:06:26.880> case

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
I certainly hope that's not the case

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.540 
I certainly hope that's not the case
where<00:06:28.349> you<00:06:28.440> starting<00:06:28.860> to<00:06:28.949> sit<00:06:29.099> down<00:06:29.220> for<00:06:29.280> me

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
where you starting to sit down for me

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.420 
where you starting to sit down for me
again<00:06:29.849> it<00:06:30.090> seems<00:06:30.300> like<00:06:30.449> the<00:06:30.599> positions<00:06:31.050> are

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
again it seems like the positions are

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.879 
again it seems like the positions are
the<00:06:32.430> crevasse<00:06:32.699> well<00:06:32.970> I<00:06:33.090> was<00:06:33.560> how<00:06:34.560> to<00:06:34.590> breathe

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889 
the crevasse well I was how to breathe

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.400 
the crevasse well I was how to breathe
start<00:06:35.220> I<00:06:35.720> suppose<00:06:36.720> we<00:06:36.900> could<00:06:37.020> get<00:06:37.199> into

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
start I suppose we could get into

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.900 
start I suppose we could get into
adjectives<00:06:37.860> we<00:06:38.039> could<00:06:38.160> have<00:06:38.280> gap<00:06:38.490> we<00:06:38.729> could

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
adjectives we could have gap we could

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.050 
adjectives we could have gap we could
have<00:06:39.060> crevasse<00:06:39.800> sometimes<00:06:40.800> I<00:06:41.069> I<00:06:41.099> listen<00:06:41.940> to

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
have crevasse sometimes I I listen to

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.279 
have crevasse sometimes I I listen to
what<00:06:42.180> you<00:06:42.300> guys<00:06:42.449> say<00:06:42.720> and<00:06:42.870> I<00:06:42.900> think<00:06:43.110> maybe

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:43.289 
what you guys say and I think maybe

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:46.850 
what you guys say and I think maybe
abyss<00:06:43.650> is<00:06:43.860> the<00:06:43.979> right<00:06:44.130> word<00:06:44.280> I<00:06:44.430> don't<00:06:44.460> know<00:06:45.860> but

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
abyss is the right word I don't know but

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.350 
abyss is the right word I don't know but
the<00:06:47.009> short<00:06:47.250> answer<00:06:47.370> is<00:06:47.610> the<00:06:47.970> owners<00:06:48.240> are

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
the short answer is the owners are

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.899 
the short answer is the owners are
thinking<00:06:48.720> about<00:06:49.130> where<00:06:50.130> we<00:06:50.310> are<00:06:50.340> in<00:06:50.520> light<00:06:50.880> of

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:50.909 
thinking about where we are in light of

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:52.399 
thinking about where we are in light of
the<00:06:51.060> players<00:06:51.300> last<00:06:51.599> proposal<00:06:51.840> and<00:06:52.319> the

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:52.409 
the players last proposal and the

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:55.279 
the players last proposal and the
discussions<00:06:53.220> we've<00:06:53.400> had<00:06:53.430> and<00:06:53.940> we're<00:06:54.900> thinking

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
discussions we've had and we're thinking

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.870 
discussions we've had and we're thinking
about<00:06:55.500> where<00:06:55.710> we<00:06:55.860> are<00:06:55.889> and<00:06:56.250> we'll<00:06:56.400> sit<00:06:56.849> down

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 
about where we are and we'll sit down

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.510 
about where we are and we'll sit down
and<00:06:57.060> we'll<00:06:57.240> talk<00:06:57.479> about<00:06:57.659> that<00:06:57.780> on<00:06:58.110> on<00:06:58.919> Tuesday

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
and we'll talk about that on on Tuesday

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.520 
and we'll talk about that on on Tuesday
I<00:06:59.759> can't<00:07:00.389> tell<00:07:00.599> you<00:07:00.780> who's<00:07:00.960> going<00:07:01.139> to<00:07:01.199> say<00:07:01.319> what

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
I can't tell you who's going to say what

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.809 
I can't tell you who's going to say what
first<00:07:01.770> I<00:07:01.949> can't<00:07:02.460> tell<00:07:02.639> you<00:07:02.699> it<00:07:02.759> probably

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 
first I can't tell you it probably

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:04.820 
first I can't tell you it probably
doesn't<00:07:03.150> matter<00:07:03.300> very<00:07:03.599> much<00:07:03.690> you<00:07:04.560> know<00:07:04.680> my

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
doesn't matter very much you know my

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.350 
doesn't matter very much you know my
guess<00:07:04.979> is<00:07:05.130> initially<00:07:05.580> we'll<00:07:05.699> have<00:07:05.849> coffee<00:07:06.030> and

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
guess is initially we'll have coffee and

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.879 
guess is initially we'll have coffee and
and<00:07:06.900> go<00:07:07.680> from<00:07:07.860> there<00:07:08.840> there<00:07:09.840> is<00:07:10.020> this<00:07:10.199> notion<00:07:10.470> I

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:10.889 
and go from there there is this notion I

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.499 
and go from there there is this notion I
think<00:07:11.370> sometimes<00:07:11.699> when<00:07:12.120> you<00:07:12.210> haven't<00:07:12.389> been

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:12.509 
think sometimes when you haven't been

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:15.200 
think sometimes when you haven't been
involved<00:07:12.990> in<00:07:13.050> these<00:07:13.229> discussions<00:07:14.030> that<00:07:15.030> this

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
involved in these discussions that this

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.330 
involved in these discussions that this
is<00:07:15.360> a<00:07:15.389> formalistic<00:07:16.169> process<00:07:16.860> with<00:07:17.069> sort<00:07:17.250> of

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 
is a formalistic process with sort of

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.149 
is a formalistic process with sort of
fixed<00:07:17.610> rules<00:07:17.849> about<00:07:18.150> who<00:07:18.870> says<00:07:19.620> what<00:07:19.860> when<00:07:20.130> and

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:20.159 
fixed rules about who says what when and

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:22.040 
fixed rules about who says what when and
under<00:07:20.400> what<00:07:20.520> circumstances<00:07:20.669> and<00:07:21.659> at<00:07:21.719> least<00:07:21.840> in

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
under what circumstances and at least in

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.719 
under what circumstances and at least in
my<00:07:22.199> experience<00:07:22.289> it<00:07:22.830> isn't<00:07:23.039> that<00:07:23.190> a
