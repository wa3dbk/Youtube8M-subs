00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:36.809
 open all together you know very 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.090
 although I am very good at 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:49.489
 boxes in the force when you 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:49.489
 start to get used to that so 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.170
 where if we go fast so the cards 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.140
 go back the meals just came on the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.320
 side you 've already seen there of a fraud 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:13.310
 the way we will focus on 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:13.310
 mega pack up first twenty 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.899
 so then start with our five 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.119
 common therefore forks of strength 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.189
 resurrection of immortals road 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.459
 synchronic to easter falls 92 raptors 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:37.229
 maral nordic fire 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:42.729
 then we have tgx years the chain in ultra 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.829
 machined close in super old books 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.270
 sacred in secret rare this is a very 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.619
 very good between sync it can be 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.630
 really very very very powerful if 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.049
 it's well played it's a very good 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:00.789
 divine league map and mjolnir is going for 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:02:01.959
 our computer monsters all that I'm drinking 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.909
 wrong in intense after agreement of his 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.670
 hammer like that in this box that 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.079
 would be funny then she dies mistral 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.869
 silver shield and mr aux 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:12.489
 bombarding petals she black 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.440
 squalls settings it was a very 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.489
 good card too when the hollow the maxe 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.140
 this is one of these reissues 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.540
 which is really fantastic between the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.530
 mac sense of work it was very played 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.870
 for a year just that still 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.519
 really a clearly playable it's 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.260
 great to see as soon as you dig to max 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.310
 like that without much difficulty in 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.829
 the pacsÃ©s really is fantastic 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.389
 a super one has only to infinities in 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.829
 secret hedgehog a bolt that's it 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.020
 really just for the max scarcity for 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.480
 the beauty of the form 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.460
 he was easily found in common 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.670
 but it's always nice to have 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.410
 a blue hedgehog in this 4 ha and meggie 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:58.650
 niort but I do not know pardon relics 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:03:01.650
 Nordic Booster Wins Turbo In Common 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.210
 cruel dragon explosion guy bomber of 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.920
 shock of being nerves that banned me 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.170
 believe if I remember correctly because of 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.290
 its effect that a little bit too much 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.550
 too powerful unless even though I 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.500
 do not know if really forbidden or if 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.220
 this version there and is allowed just 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.180
 because it seems to me that they had 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.190
 made a change the text a bit like 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.240
 often tortuous catapulting made for 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.500
 regulate the facts I know more it will take 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.000
 that eventually diploma in 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.860
 comment if I have not seen by then but 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.990
 it seems even feel that this version 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.780
 authorizes t roaring then what 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.640
 we are interested in the rare inover tg in 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.930
 Ultra for Actelis rose you 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.840
 a stay in two cases is enough 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.210
 friendly allocated I like that a 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.530
 month the bar tg bastien is really 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.940
 jumped just before halo gun halo 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.120
 now who before were in ultra 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.250
 in absolute victory in secret is 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.270
 magician of wonders tg abbas 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.410
 expectations very well because I had 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.570
 almost all the cards 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.680
 the archetype tg except this one so I have 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.000
 really to ride me with tg 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.130
 now it's done that makes me happy 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.870
 it's rather fun it's cool here 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.290
 it's the tuner sync monster 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.580
 tech genius and pommel of gold that is 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.350
 also a map that is relatively 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.459
 useful if played well finally it seems to me 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.720
 that during a period it was very very 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.190
 played it is a little less now I 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.330
 believe but it's still something 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.750
 nice enough thing then to the year 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.750
 last twitter 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:27.580
 catapult dragon tg reboot tgs x1 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.030
 tuning fork clock laudun for our 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.610
 common 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.460
 then out-of-law synchronic in 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:39.970
 ultra kitchen etc during a super top 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.190
 ten years sausage line austra whore or 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.780
 the base and not Nordic not know 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.260
 necessarily super simple to pronounce stupid 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.820
 Nordic 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.680
 so here's a Nordic beast monster in 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.180
 secret traced that too it's mostly for 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.169
 the extreme scarcity max intense it was 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.370
 I believe would have been much lower 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.490
 in common I just think where 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.260
 we are going we are always happy and 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.970
 to retain nordic relics and finally 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.880
 last pack of this second part this 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.669
 are also legendary collection 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.870
 crazy it's cool to have less 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.550
 someone from the football team 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.900
 of starred was really be careful in 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.720
 three parties are in this mission 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:18.850
 they all have robot swordsmen then place 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.680
 room were halfen nordic and black 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.599
 squalls dragon red arles demons in 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.880
 common is not that fun 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.080
 frankly is a turbo warrior with two 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.590
 monsters synchro to the Commons remove 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.880
 our leaders even boost his classes 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.110
 1 for 1 this is a war that is 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.270
 always very very friendly to play 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.560
 in a live white dragon I think 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.030
 it can be not bad for example for 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.610
 throw a stone a white stone 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.229
 legendary invoked specially a 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.400
 damsel for example it can be 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.660
 quite useful dragon without having a super at that 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.639
 it's one of those monsters he was doing 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.430
 part of dark synchro also for those 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:53.080
 who saw the series all that 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.550
 necessarily on a little disappointed him coming out 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.020
 Synchro daggers as monsters 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.699
 normal sync with justin will be 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.960
 darkness tuner really liked 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.479
 that they really adapt the real 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.580
 concept docks over a third a 1 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.419
 tuner at least the level of a 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.430
 show an hour all this for a 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.720
 negative level etc are recurrent from 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.949
 the other one a lot more complicated but that 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.479
 would have been really really really 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.740
 really fun I think it's a pity 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.740
 that they have who is not really going 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.000
 pushed concept to the end unveiling 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.819
 so that's a trap card that's 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.229
 really very very very very very nice 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.180
 its effect is good going fast enough 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:23.680
 giuly when a mons effect is 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.449
 activated in the hand at the cemetery to him 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.789
 creation is if you banish 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.460
 it's really very 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:32.229
 very very very cool like because you know I 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.240
 think it's really nice, like 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:36.099
 finally rape witch is a monster 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.750
 magician but that's for it's a 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.460
 guardian for plants it's julie 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.379
