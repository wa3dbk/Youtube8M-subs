00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
high high step this is more for me it's

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.130 
high high step this is more for me it's
just<00:06:15.950> more<00:06:16.160> of<00:06:16.190> a<00:06:16.310> glute<00:06:16.520> activation<00:06:16.780> move<00:06:17.780> and

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
just more of a glute activation move and

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.310 
just more of a glute activation move and
i<00:06:18.950> believe<00:06:19.220> i<00:06:19.370> was<00:06:19.490> doing<00:06:19.880> 12<00:06:20.180> 12<00:06:20.810> maybe<00:06:21.140> 15

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
i believe i was doing 12 12 maybe 15

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.909 
i believe i was doing 12 12 maybe 15
reps<00:06:21.830> per<00:06:21.950> leg<00:06:22.750> but<00:06:23.750> I<00:06:23.780> always<00:06:23.990> finish<00:06:24.620> my

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
reps per leg but I always finish my

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.650 
reps per leg but I always finish my
workouts<00:06:25.340> with<00:06:25.640> some<00:06:26.030> sort<00:06:26.270> of<00:06:26.330> a<00:06:26.419> glute

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
workouts with some sort of a glute

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.650 
workouts with some sort of a glute
activation<00:06:26.810> movement<00:06:27.820> just<00:06:28.820> because<00:06:29.120> you

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660 
activation movement just because you

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.130 
activation movement just because you
know<00:06:29.780> again<00:06:30.560> I<00:06:30.620> can't<00:06:31.010> do<00:06:31.130> squats<00:06:31.550> I<00:06:32.270> might

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.450 
know again I can't do squats I might
have<00:06:33.230> said<00:06:33.350> that<00:06:33.440> my<00:06:33.620> first<00:06:33.890> video<00:06:34.190> but<00:06:34.430> I

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
have said that my first video but I

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.820 
have said that my first video but I
can't<00:06:34.729> do<00:06:34.850> squats<00:06:35.180> like<00:06:35.390> most<00:06:35.870> people<00:06:36.229> because
