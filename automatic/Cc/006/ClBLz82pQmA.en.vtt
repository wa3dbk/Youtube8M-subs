 Percent as the upper limit in this occurs bullies 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:14.579
 then here is who 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:16.129
 approaches 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.129
 usually then elo c from the princely house Ras

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.650
 Teva Niese Unia yes 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.770
 the 1 i'm just kinda confused the intelligence thing 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.050
 It totally upset me 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.689
 dgap-dd Genz mostly complains that it's somehow tied to my own 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.160
 intelligence 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.080
 Living with me I knew this incredible brought here in Salzburg 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.080
 probably was easy 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.030
 and mighty expand with the remark that we finally have 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.600
 There Talaga are the gates of the beginning little with the Taiwanese hair pieces 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.810
 confounded 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.810
 from the perception of another no longer be made 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.200
 that's something of unfair 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.070
 that's something of a typical percentage 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.560
 should breeze through the hole thank you 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.560
 Roberto m 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.430
 to be real happy 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.630
 I'm looking forward to it even when that undertone thing is over 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 we welcome under it otherwise 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 whatever you want the answer is no 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.100
 these 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.390
 Nanu Miep Gies Taiwan j Action Quest Percent these are good dialogues we have 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.010
 also percent full 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.920
 lying by 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.480
 I would like to become a father myself 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.620
 Warta Tor warlords losses were next needed why clear me 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.760
 nobody on these things 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.340
 so once the cost side qualifies well 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.340
 then it just does not matter to me since the rotator cuff 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.450
 under it should 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.729
 we welcome you have broken your entire character Krad with the sentence 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.230
 made 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.850
 only that was usually Denny Latzke for the post was all the same, he is so the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.570
 typical great Red Troll when lie the typical guy from intel was never like that 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:19.009
 the typical Taiwan e-type also already have the agitation and I search and 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.089
 the exit and the niece Taiwan held 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.549
 that was already the first quest, my principle does not have to do anything 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.730
 Alternatively, you can do something Middle East al-Bani 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:31.909
 all 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.329
 Council members 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.339
 also no representation 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:40.669
 I will not do that now, logically, it can lead to conflicts 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.909
 my membership in the Prince of Taiwan 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.980
 but it is possible there is not so in the other houses 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.109
 Feldmann clock 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.049
 we now visit virtually all Tel cities 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.049
 right 4 i take 1 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.119
 but it can be a bit longer series 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:04.279
 I'm scratching 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:06.189
 Klopp hiding the city 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.189
 Today the city was hidden 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.469
 I'm exactly the same at 18 Mohawk Karastan 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:19.119
 also riders are few people who will ignore now 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:28.220
 that was so unnecessary of this 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.889
 OT to fly 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.889
 they liked it on the trailer so I'm doing it now 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:41.089
 a Robert has been 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:53.529
 somehow you have the calves never architecture also a bit Kay 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:55.739
 Wehner it came differently that means 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.759
 here we are masters have ideas to meet 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:01.839
 We would have thanked two out of five 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:04.839
 No, um 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:08.659
 Hi Master Trainer Question "I have to go here and there now 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.859

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.969
 No, I want 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:22.219
 Be the auctioneer of the house of the band 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:26.529
 of course it's a box of steel keeping things like bitter green 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:30.179
 Rooted in it and keeps it with a little nice play and sassy 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.400

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.000
 Yes

 or voices in the can dispenser she receives speaks with matchpuck 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.460
 The small report I am therefore asked good fresh 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.279
 Show me the answer

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.800

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.669
 I say big donations 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.520
 So you need a big rotation 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.990
 and beat and beat yourself 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.199
 here is 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.199
 I do not boulge the regional planes 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.889
 Not 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.460
 Germany's smallest will be rushed 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.969
 Of course, even as a little mermaid, that's how it already was 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:29.110
 just because 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.219
 after that, he never stopped Obernhain identical for, of course, as good as 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.800
 the old "yes yes Raphael Seitz Marko like Werner Fleischer 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.639
 the name will be the world 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.169
 I am 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.220
 the city wants 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.219
 This is 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.219
 Tirana forever they hold the Glarner 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.129
 Percent an old lady

 Year a few memory problems resin 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.850
 and percent was slightly in Brussels 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.409
 drifts 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:00.540
 around 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.540
 we can help here to hear 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.939
 I should do it again 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:09.039
 one more time 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.300
 FCC continues black mastering Zahner continues to make no effort to stop her 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.349
 Both of them can go on forever 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:17.069
 and if we continue to 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.219

 but as far as the insert has small intricacies secure store into the marrow of it 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:53.689
 Suicide is not enough in my opinion 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:56.689
 things that give character to people 

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:00.809
 if you still have a dialogue with Eliane 

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:04.229
 If you did not see their names you would laugh that's the old one

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.240

 Killarney Hirano and Mono Serdar and Modrow is never that and what's his name 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:32.930

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:41.480
 if only they did something clever 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.870
 or the quick that or funny or something that has to do with donations but 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.870
 nothing there 

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:53.149
 Watching the Internet fell asleep with sleep 

00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:55.550
 to end up with Cadan 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.009
 fell asleep in the middle of the sentence 

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:03.169
