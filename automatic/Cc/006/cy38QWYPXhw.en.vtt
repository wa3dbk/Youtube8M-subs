00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
first of all it's half the cost of the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.280 
first of all it's half the cost of the
average<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.119> know<00:01:18.210> product<00:01:18.570> out<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
average you know product out there the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.039 
average you know product out there the
program<00:01:19.619> out<00:01:19.799> there<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.270> it<00:01:21.270> really<00:01:21.720> really

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
program out there and it really really

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.810 
program out there and it really really
over<00:01:22.380> delivers<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> 12-week

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
over delivers you know it's a 12-week

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.929 
over delivers you know it's a 12-week
program<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:25.380> broken<00:01:25.710> down<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.070> simply

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
program and it's broken down so simply

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.060 
program and it's broken down so simply
that<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.810> my<00:01:27.990> opinion<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.500> beats<00:01:28.740> all<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that in my opinion it beats all the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.550 
that in my opinion it beats all the
other<00:01:29.189> programs<00:01:29.610> out<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:30.030> because<00:01:30.560> it's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
other programs out there because it's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.109 
other programs out there because it's
written<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.159> such<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> way<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.970> average

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
written in such a way that the average

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.060 
written in such a way that the average
person<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.530> stick<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
person can do it and can stick to it

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.580 
person can do it and can stick to it
every<00:01:35.430> single<00:01:35.640> day<00:01:36.200> there's<00:01:37.200> no<00:01:37.380> guesswork

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
every single day there's no guesswork

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.080
