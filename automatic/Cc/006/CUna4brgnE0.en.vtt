00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.499
 how about friends as they are fired then explain how to make the adjustments 

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:06.330
 of the viper 6 5 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.460
 teach them how the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.719
 there is no discrimination 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.419
 bm 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.369
 to learn from the past 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.980
 start 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.980
 we have to put it on the knob years to the fullest 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:22.900
 lestat open 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.660
 it's a ten-turn knob does not mean we have to find the 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.950
 mid point bread against the middle point we give it five laps 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:32.600
 two 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.840
 3 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.360
 4 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.270
 and there he came in half 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.250
 we turn on the device 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.250
 until you get an amount are gone 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.300
 we have always done background 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.440
 and with him before 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.700
 we put more volume 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.280
 with less volume 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.730
 in a debate on a point detector one should always have 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.310
 a background sound 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.310
 that is light that does not bother 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.360
 well the frequency 1 when choosing depending on the type of terrain there is 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.270
 lands that are a bit more minorized ones -9 smoothed areas with 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.620
 a lot of mineralization 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.120
 then one puts the head in him 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.550
 on the ground as if to detect and choose the frequency and one usually 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.390
 you do not have to change it again 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.790
 the accessibility the sensitivity if we do not machine or mentally 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.930
 spectrum of 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.439
 of detection we will have more depth between less sensitivity 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.250
 between less sensitivity less depth 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.400
 in the mineralized lands 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.930
 It is good to always be technician and lower sensitivity a bit 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.090
 so that it does not bother so much 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.140
 the the detect minimum 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.729
 let former Chilean minister used to post searches to less depth in 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.180
 those that are not required 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.190
 so deep 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.240
 He knew how to use on beaches 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.070
 was I use it a lot when they access the lagoon looking for a treasure in a house 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.210
 A ranch 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.830
 a place so that the soil is very contaminated use the typical head 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.380
 nati your head of 20 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.739
 centimeters of 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.229
 diameter 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.419
 party pack 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:14.350
 as 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.359
 it's easier to locate an object with it 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:22.719
 do not need there is a nail deep here is another nail about 10 15 centimeters with 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.629
 the head of gÃ¡mez or hinder a little bit because very large and one by one to 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.549
 be able to locate the object well 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.250
 after heading we put that head and we have to clean up in April in 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:35.639
 some 1goal land taking out the nails and all the garbage that is or 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.639
 consult very quickly 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.799
 now we have two sound sounds 1 sound 2 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.949
 then teach 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:55.649
 the sound 1 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:58.409
 hear 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.239
 it's the sound 2 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.239
 little safer 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.189
 if that what is again of great difference is unknown because it was canceled if 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.159
 they like a sound more because they can change it 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.550
 but I did recommend that for 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.489
 with will do for this one a search 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.129
 of an object that focused very deep is better to use the sound ones 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.379
 Now I'm going to teach you how to use fezzan discrimination 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.739
 to use it to discrimination 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.549
 that's more discrimination does the right if it goes on like this and just having the 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.749
 maximum and gyms 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:45.849
 a bear until the led 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.249
 Even though the red is on I do not know if the song to see I say it again 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:51.779
 here and gera minds the left 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:55.019
 assange turns green 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.019
 just two years later united 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.229
 your background study 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:02.879
 there we have 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.879
 maximum discrimination 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.219
 not all the annoying objects with which 13 are the grounds 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.369
 as those who discriminate 

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:16.120
 putting the device in detection here 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.319
 jessica how it supports sound 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:23.270
 and forges sound means that becks history mind some mental moment and 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.180
 I'm probably charged were the ones that are first 

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:28.509
 centimeters of 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:29.689
 welcome 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.689
 lampa pacts 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:53.560
 it is important explain it 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.110
 how dipae discrimination works 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.340
 what we are looking for a good python to know that a moment was of value 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.930
 always found 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.150
 hidden generally I believe that more than 90% of the DNA of the times in which 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.669
 they are integrated to more than 25 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.559
 centimeters 20 25 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:15.449
 and 80 centimeters it is very rare that they are going to find some some funeral 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.679
 of value I did not blur of less than 25 centimeters 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.020
 in concrete minus 25 centimeters roberto matta 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:27.240
 there jarque I am an iron object 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.370
 if it is probably a sovereign state instead, or imagine that 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.240
 this capital I want to put a gold plate some jewels 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.909
 something like that 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.969
 nothing more than 25 centimeters deep 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.969
 stevens will do it this is 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:49.189
 the f1 disk that nobody can want to be left with the doubt 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.629
 those that are locked more than 25 centimeters deep since 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:58.629
 it can be something interesting 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.910
 you're one with the garbage imagine that there was a centenary 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:07.249
 a silver coin 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:08.849
 does not care 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:11.529
 although the discrimination is maximized 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.529
 try to detect exactly 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.569
 I showed them what he acesa head reads 23 20 centimeters in diameter efe 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.110
 the hypertensive head 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.469
 for these deep deep 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:31.240
 more serious searches 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.050
 this is the detection box that one can not do this 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.379
 findings up to three and a half meters four meters 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:42.759
 eye that it is important that they know what is p 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:46.740
 the art the volume of this tax metal matters a lot 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.470
 if it is a box a big box like lara like the previous bid that gives them 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.550
 a box of cookies is three meters deep full of coins 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.550
 after detecting without any problem 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:02.339
 good friends that's all I hope that lg has given 

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.599
 the video so that they understand the operation of dif costs that x5 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:09.739
 sent a strong greeting and do not give the next leo
