first<00:00:30.529> spritz<00:00:31.529> our<00:00:31.679> little<00:00:31.890> spring<00:00:32.099> create

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
first spritz our little spring create

first spritz our little spring create
clothes<00:00:32.880> get<00:00:33.239> them<00:00:33.390> already<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.110> we're<00:00:34.739> going

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
clothes get them already and we're going

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.650 
clothes get them already and we're going
to<00:00:34.920> spritz<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.670> fabric<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.149> see<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.630> I

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
to spritz the fabric you can see that I

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.139 
to spritz the fabric you can see that I
already<00:00:36.899> started<00:00:37.489> three<00:00:38.489> pieces<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:39.000> ribbon

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
already started three pieces of ribbon

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.139 
already started three pieces of ribbon
just<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> fabric<00:00:40.620> nice<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.980> wet

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
just get the fabric nice and wet

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.250 
just get the fabric nice and wet
typically<00:00:42.149> when<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.360> die<00:00:42.540> fabric<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.110> have

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
typically when you die fabric you have

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.310 
typically when you die fabric you have
to<00:00:43.440> get<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.680> wet<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.809> the<00:00:45.809> dye<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
to get it wet so that the the dye or the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.340 
to get it wet so that the the dye or the
paint<00:00:46.590> saturates<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.730> fibers<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.260> this

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
paint saturates the fibers so for this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.110 
paint saturates the fibers so for this
particular<00:00:49.530> one<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.219> last<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:50.969> we're

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
particular one the last one here we're

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.119 
particular one the last one here we're
going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.300> go<00:00:51.449> ahead<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.870> use<00:00:52.110> some<00:00:52.530> olivine

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
going to go ahead and use some olivine

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.670 
going to go ahead and use some olivine
green<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.120> see<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.050> tell<00:00:55.260> how<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.590> kind

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
green and see you can tell how it kind

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.150 
green and see you can tell how it kind
of<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:55.949> flows<00:00:56.340> into<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> fibers<00:00:58.160> super

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
of just flows into the fibers super

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.510 
of just flows into the fibers super
pretty<00:00:59.480> it's<00:01:00.480> keep<00:01:00.809> loading<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
pretty it's keep loading it up all the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.789 
pretty it's keep loading it up all the
way<00:01:02.760> down<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:04.580> this<00:01:05.580> will<00:01:05.760> dry<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.960> forty

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
way down and this will dry about forty

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.550 
way down and this will dry about forty
percent<00:01:08.250> lighter<00:01:08.760> than<00:01:09.630> maybe<00:01:10.200> not<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.409> much

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
percent lighter than maybe not that much

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.469 
percent lighter than maybe not that much
maybe<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.130> twenty-five<00:01:11.700> percent<00:01:11.970> lighter

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
maybe like twenty-five percent lighter

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.120 
maybe like twenty-five percent lighter
so<00:01:12.780> you're<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.110> want<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.890> want<00:01:14.040> it

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
so you're going to want if you want it

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.399 
so you're going to want if you want it
rich<00:01:14.369> go<00:01:15.150> ahead<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.450> layer<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.049> color<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
rich go ahead and layer the color on and

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.240 
rich go ahead and layer the color on and
you<00:01:19.409> know<00:01:19.530> there's<00:01:19.710> one<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.920> those<00:01:20.040> things

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
you know there's one of those things

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.429 
you know there's one of those things
where<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.060> always<00:01:21.240> add<00:01:21.540> more<00:01:21.600> color<00:01:22.140> it's

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
where you can always add more color it's

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.620 
where you can always add more color it's
a<00:01:22.470> little<00:01:22.680> hard<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.950> take<00:01:22.979> color<00:01:23.460> away<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.570> I'm

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
a little hard to take color away so I'm

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.850 
a little hard to take color away so I'm
just<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.930> keep<00:01:25.080> layering<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.799> layering

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
just going to keep layering and layering

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.679 
just going to keep layering and layering
as<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:26.909> I've<00:01:27.000> got<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.150> little<00:01:27.299> purple

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
as you can see I've got a little purple

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.499 
as you can see I've got a little purple
that<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:27.990> no<00:01:28.140> big<00:01:28.290> deal<00:01:28.729> then<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.270> see

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
that it's no big deal then if you see

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.330 
that it's no big deal then if you see
like<00:01:30.720> little<00:01:30.990> spots<00:01:31.439> where<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> kind<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.159> feels

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
like little spots where it kind of feels

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.660 
like little spots where it kind of feels
like<00:01:32.640> maybe<00:01:33.000> you've<00:01:33.299> got<00:01:33.540> little<00:01:34.259> blotches

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
like maybe you've got little blotches

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.100 
like maybe you've got little blotches
that<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:35.850> bothers<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.420> go<00:01:36.600> ahead<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
that really bothers you go ahead and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.710 
that really bothers you go ahead and
switch<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:38.520> I'm<00:01:38.610> kind<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.060> smooth

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
switch it and then I'm kind of smooth

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.550 
switch it and then I'm kind of smooth
itself<00:01:40.409> out<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.750> see<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.140> pick<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.500> up

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
itself out you can see if I pick this up

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.090 
itself out you can see if I pick this up
it's<00:01:44.340> going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.549> be<00:01:44.640> very<00:01:44.670> cool<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:46.770> I

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
it's going to be very cool to this one I

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.120 
it's going to be very cool to this one I
used<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.700> quarrel<00:01:48.090> burien<00:01:48.509> rib

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
used a quarrel burien rib

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.000 
used a quarrel burien rib
then<00:01:50.130> my<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.760> trick<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.500> you<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
then my the trick is you can see the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.280 
then my the trick is you can see the
water<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.700> kind<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.360> burgundy<00:01:55.049> color

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
water here is kind of a burgundy color

water here is kind of a burgundy color
I'm<00:01:56.010> just<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.369> go<00:01:56.520> ahead<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.850> stick<00:01:57.510> a

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
I'm just going to go ahead and stick a

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.910 
I'm just going to go ahead and stick a
piece<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.159> here<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.960> already<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.229> another<00:02:01.650> one

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
piece in here I already have another one

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.530 
piece in here I already have another one
that's<00:02:02.190> been<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> little<00:02:03.270> while

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
that's been in here for a little while

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.359 
that's been in here for a little while
and<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.080> can<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:06.470> use<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.650> other<00:02:07.800> end<00:02:08.100> of<00:02:08.250> my

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
and you can see use the other end of my

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.920 
and you can see use the other end of my
paintbrush<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.209> out<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:10.080> can<00:02:10.289> see<00:02:11.930> how

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
paintbrush to get it out you can see how

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.470 
paintbrush to get it out you can see how
hard<00:02:13.140> did<00:02:13.319> one<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.770> go<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.610> can<00:02:14.790> see<00:02:15.060> that

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
hard did one and a go you can see that

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.949 
hard did one and a go you can see that
it<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.230> going<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.310> be<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:17.520> really<00:02:18.060> cool<00:02:18.360> dusty

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
it is going to be a really cool dusty

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.790 
it is going to be a really cool dusty
rose<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:20.450> that's<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.810> don't<00:02:22.140> know<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.470> kind<00:02:22.769> of

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
rose and that's I don't know I kind of

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.970 
rose and that's I don't know I kind of
like<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.370> usually<00:02:23.580> your<00:02:24.540> pit<00:02:25.410> color<00:02:25.709> of

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
like that and usually your pit color of

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.710 
like that and usually your pit color of
your<00:02:26.160> water<00:02:26.400> becomes<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.120> same<00:02:27.300> as<00:02:27.360> whatever

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
your water becomes the same as whatever

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.780 
your water becomes the same as whatever
project<00:02:28.170> you're<00:02:28.290> working<00:02:28.350> on<00:02:28.709> so<00:02:29.040> if<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.640> wait

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
project you're working on so if you wait

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.759 
project you're working on so if you wait
to<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.000> end<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.330> dye<00:02:30.510> your<00:02:30.690> fabric<00:02:31.140> typically

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
to the end and dye your fabric typically

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.080 
to the end and dye your fabric typically
is<00:02:31.890> going<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.130> match<00:02:32.310> what<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.940> project

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
is going to match what the project

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.150 
is going to match what the project
you're<00:02:33.420> going<00:02:33.450> maybe<00:02:34.350> not<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> exact<00:02:34.950> same

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
you're going maybe not the exact same

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.479 
you're going maybe not the exact same
color<00:02:35.370> but<00:02:35.730> it'll<00:02:36.060> probably<00:02:36.239> go<00:02:36.600> with<00:02:36.780> it

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
color but it'll probably go with it

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.590 
color but it'll probably go with it
