00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.740
 squeeze the 5 force I was shy I 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.770
 It was hard to socialize but one day everything 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.550
 change 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.120
 attacking on facebook or we are 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.120
 commented 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.540
 this exists 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.470
 if you have 4 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.289
 that's not why I do not 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.519
 it was easier with my clear but I read 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.039
 because he is believed 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.849
 new year new life nothing better than being 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.980
 Clear 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:39.590
 and they count if the most experienced or 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.110
 they let it combine with the story I'm going 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.720
 saying let us combine can not 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.750
 have to anticipate Honduras leave us 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.550
 combine and tenacity for the goal yes but there 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.620
 is where he changed his pace and apply it 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.170
 let's see how the defense in Honduras 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.510
 line and but the player who knows best 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.129
 of the united states france and lifts 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.010
 your head and they're going to give you the ball to talk 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.860
 it's not jones or perfect month there 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.780
 when they are able to unfold in word that 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.010
 You know clearances 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.619
 there's the action to ife inside 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.270
 established and the book items and had 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.580
 back then with what value with a 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.890
 great technique very well elaborated in the 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.049
 Team play 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.950
 American grant and definition without 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.079
 drop it perfect at a technical level to 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.450
 the 36 minutes of the first part wins 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.369
 us 10 with this goal from right that 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.890
 we see in repetition annotated by clint 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.399
 dempsey the number 8 of the team 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.220
 American did not seem like but the 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.850
 weather is if there is a player telling you 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.850
 that the one that achieves 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:51.550
 of chile should work the part of chile 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.550
 can not stop 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.930
 and it's not like that 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:14.340
 it can not be life I have to pick up the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:19.800
 ball has chips meter center 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:24.000
 by juan carlos garcÃ­a de chilenas 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.700
 He stared dugout watching the body 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.360
 the film looking back I can see 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.940
 great the worst that reaches us although 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.410
 is that the center tests it with the chest 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.820
 they are banking to support them and 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.210
 justifies its inclusion in the team 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.210
 headline 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.020
 with all the advantages when it comes to 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.580
 center and it seemed that the 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.580
 action but minor very well 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.760
 so the ball with the chest when 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.890
 figueroa the mind with the chest and his 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.610
 route is the Chilean take off with the left 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.100
 Juan Carlos GarcÃ­a 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.320
 the match was tied this goal can be 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.110
 psychological this goal can be 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.790
 psychological this goal can lift the 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.500
 catracha selection we are one by one 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.500
