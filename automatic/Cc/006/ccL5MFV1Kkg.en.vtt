I'm<00:00:01.439> working<00:00:01.890> on<00:00:02.010> replacing<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:03.799> oxygen

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
I'm working on replacing the oxygen

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.480 
I'm working on replacing the oxygen
sensor<00:00:05.220> rear<00:00:05.640> oxygen<00:00:06.180> sensor<00:00:06.629> for<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.500> 2009

Jetta<00:00:09.360> TDI<00:00:12.620> so<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.650> just<00:00:13.980> replaced<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.120> o2

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
Jetta TDI so I just replaced the o2

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.170 
Jetta TDI so I just replaced the o2
sensor<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:16.500> up<00:00:16.650> in<00:00:16.770> here<00:00:17.100> hopefully<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.029> can

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
sensor it's up in here hopefully you can

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.870 
sensor it's up in here hopefully you can
see<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.770> wire<00:00:19.920> loops<00:00:20.250> back<00:00:20.490> through

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
see it and the wire loops back through

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.950 
see it and the wire loops back through
here<00:00:21.210> here's<00:00:21.539> some<00:00:21.769> heat<00:00:22.769> shield<00:00:23.070> material

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
here here's some heat shield material

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.589 
here here's some heat shield material
and<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.050> crosses<00:00:25.470> over<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.310> strut<00:00:27.210> here

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and it crosses over this this strut here

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.009 
and it crosses over this this strut here
then

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
then

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.770 
then
omoro<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.880> material<00:00:29.880> here<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.349> see<00:00:31.619> that

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
omoro to material here you can see that

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.540 
omoro to material here you can see that
there's<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> snap<00:00:34.380> connector<00:00:34.890> here<00:00:35.040> holds<00:00:35.430> in

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
there's a snap connector here holds in

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.250 
there's a snap connector here holds in
here<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.329> extra<00:00:36.989> wire<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.340> kind<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.820> loops

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
here the extra wire just kind of loops

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.709 
here the extra wire just kind of loops
around<00:00:40.260> here<00:00:40.829> comes<00:00:41.190> back<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.300> then<00:00:42.600> it

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
around here comes back and then it

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.799 
around here comes back and then it
connects<00:00:43.079> into<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.610> connector<00:00:44.610> here<00:00:45.059> this

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
connects into this connector here this

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.170 
connects into this connector here this
is<00:00:46.020> covered<00:00:46.530> normally<00:00:47.039> covered<00:00:47.399> by<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> plastic

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
is covered normally covered by a plastic

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.630 
is covered normally covered by a plastic
shield<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.200> not<00:00:49.500> too<00:00:49.800> bad<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.250> take<00:00:50.399> off

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
shield that is not too bad to take off

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.369 
shield that is not too bad to take off
so<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.030> plastic<00:00:51.480> shield<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.930> goes<00:00:52.140> all<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
so this plastic shield this goes all the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.970 
so this plastic shield this goes all the
way<00:00:52.530> back<00:00:52.590> here<00:00:53.100> y'all<00:00:53.760> screw<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.210> off

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
way back here y'all screw it off

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.939 
way back here y'all screw it off
overall<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.160> took<00:00:56.399> me<00:00:56.550> about<00:00:56.579> an<00:00:56.969> hour<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
overall this took me about an hour to

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.290 
overall this took me about an hour to
accomplish<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.219> take<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.850> off<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.149> heat

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
accomplish this take it off the heat

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.930 
accomplish this take it off the heat
shields<00:01:01.190> actually<00:01:02.190> was<00:01:02.309> kind<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.579> hard

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
shields actually was kind of hard

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.390 
shields actually was kind of hard
pulling<00:01:03.329> out<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.750> o2<00:01:03.989> sensor<00:01:04.589> up<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.920> here

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
pulling out this o2 sensor up in here

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.690 
pulling out this o2 sensor up in here
hopefully<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:07.400> you<00:01:08.400> know<00:01:08.520> you're

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
hopefully you can see it you know you're

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.250 
hopefully you can see it you know you're
gonna<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> torque<00:01:10.080> bar

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
gonna have to have it like a torque bar

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.570 
gonna have to have it like a torque bar
or<00:01:10.409> something<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.770> pull<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.130> off<00:01:11.340> because

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
or something to pull that off because

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.780 
or something to pull that off because
that<00:01:11.850> actually<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.659> there<00:01:12.869> pretty<00:01:13.080> hard<00:01:13.790> so

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
that actually is in there pretty hard so

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.090 
that actually is in there pretty hard so

this<00:01:38.220> bolt<00:01:38.880> off<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.479> here<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.909> again

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
this bolt off up in here and it again

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.240 
this bolt off up in here and it again
like<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.020> said<00:01:43.079> my<00:01:43.380> earlier<00:01:43.710> video<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.220> actually

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
like I said my earlier video it actually

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.370 
like I said my earlier video it actually
is<00:01:44.670> pretty<00:01:44.880> hard<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.450> pull<00:01:45.659> off<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.350> I

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
is pretty hard to pull off and so I

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.460 
is pretty hard to pull off and so I
would<00:01:46.680> recommend<00:01:46.860> borrowing<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.790> kit<00:01:48.470> from

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
would recommend borrowing that kit from

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.380 
would recommend borrowing that kit from
O'Reilly<00:01:50.189> because<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.549> will<00:01:50.640> help<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.909> lot<00:01:51.060> in

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
O'Reilly because it will help a lot in

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.440 
O'Reilly because it will help a lot in
terms<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.840> getting<00:01:52.110> good<00:01:52.409> torque<00:01:52.770> or<00:01:53.100> good

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
terms of getting good torque or good

terms of getting good torque or good
hold<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:56.130> bolt<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.579> has<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.880> come

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
hold on that that bolt that has to come

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.130 
hold on that that bolt that has to come
off<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:59.810> this<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:02.000> tip<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.360> borrowed

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
off so this is the tip that I borrowed

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.260 
off so this is the tip that I borrowed
