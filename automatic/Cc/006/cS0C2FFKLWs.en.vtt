00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
Turkish journalist was injured so when

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.510

you look at what was happening actually

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.870 
you look at what was happening actually
I<00:05:08.880> mean<00:05:09.420> the<00:05:10.170> purchases<00:05:10.860> is<00:05:11.070> spreading<00:05:11.850> to

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
I mean the purchases is spreading to

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.660 
I mean the purchases is spreading to
other<00:05:12.150> parts<00:05:12.270> of<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.840> country<00:05:13.320> in<00:05:13.500> in<00:05:13.920> Ankara

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
other parts of the country in in Ankara

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.790 
other parts of the country in in Ankara
the<00:05:14.790> capital<00:05:14.910> city<00:05:15.570> of<00:05:15.660> Ankara<00:05:16.050> is<00:05:16.290> meet<00:05:16.590> one

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
the capital city of Ankara is meet one

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.280 
the capital city of Ankara is meet one
of<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:17.040> largest<00:05:17.370> technically<00:05:18.150> secular<00:05:18.900> city

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
of the largest technically secular city

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.440 
of the largest technically secular city
so<00:05:19.770> I<00:05:19.800> think<00:05:20.070> it's<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.490> danger<00:05:20.880> is<00:05:21.030> it<00:05:21.210> might

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
so I think it's the danger is it might

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.290 
so I think it's the danger is it might
actually<00:05:21.690> split<00:05:22.110> to<00:05:22.230> other<00:05:22.440> city<00:05:22.800> get<00:05:23.730> out<00:05:23.940> of
