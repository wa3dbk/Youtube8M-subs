00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.700
 know the new sun jet x efe a 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.640
 printer designed with only one thing in 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.650
 mind speed in the old days 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.140
 meant the speed of the head in the 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.840
 moment of printing in the world of the x 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.390
 f means high quality production at 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.800
 a supersonic speed that can 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.230
 do for your productivity 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.060
 let's say it prints is 15 banners 20 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.520
 posters and 2 graphics to label 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.980
 vehicles in a day is not bad now 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.320
 double think about how much money you could 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.940
 win in that powerful world that's what 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.100
 that the high-speed printing of the 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.140
 xf can do for you and it's not for 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.300
 chance the technology under which 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.070
 has developed is incomparable 16 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.199
 channels that supply more ink in 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.239
 less time with greater precision thanks 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.339
 to the stepped system of heads of 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.199
 print set in cm e ica 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.149
 mirror and improved stability 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.070
 mechanical all this speed comes 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.929
 accompanied by absolute quality and 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.670
 that the ecosol max 2 ink that is more 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.589
 Tense allows you to create more colors 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.600
 Vibrating at high speed speed 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.000
 Printing does not matter unless the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.620
 material can stand the rhythm the xf 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.080
 has a new charging architecture 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.150
 material with 16 pin rollers a better 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.130
 feeding and collection system and a 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.840
 drying system redesigned to dry 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.270
 quickly throughout the entire 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.430
 investment the xf has been designed to 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.470
 gain performance charge of cartridges 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.910
 frontal ink front opening cover 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.310
 in one click for easy cleaning 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.200
 Levers on the front and back 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.450
 to load the material and if the material 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.640
 It is very heavy support to hold it and 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.710
 make loading easier roland versa 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.450
 works includes pantone libraries for 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.010
 the color correspondence a 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.750
 calculator of the ink prevents the 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.300
 work is canceled halfway through printing 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.740
 roland a support sends notifications to 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.900
 your smartphone about the state of 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.970
 work job grouping option 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.680
 for the use of the control material 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.810
 up to four roland teams of form 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.390
 Simultaneous service and support through 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.920
 of the roland care program all this makes 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.140
 advance your business at a fast pace 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.030
 spectacular so here's the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:07.590
 true speed equation 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.590
 solier xf calls the supersonic
