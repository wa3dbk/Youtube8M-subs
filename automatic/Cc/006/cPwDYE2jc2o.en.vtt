thing<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.960> check<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.769> have<00:00:25.890> all<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
thing to check is that you have all the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.580 
thing to check is that you have all the
lines<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> right<00:00:27.210> spot<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:28.140> inlet

the drain the tank and the faucet the
next<00:00:32.790> thing<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.030> check<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.510> there's<00:00:33.989> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
next thing to check is that there's a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.229 
next thing to check is that there's a
