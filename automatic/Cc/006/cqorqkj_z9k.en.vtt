00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.910
 so this famous apple watch you 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.359
 you ask the fact how she 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.309
 works 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.769
 Well, look, we'll make you a 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.210
 small guided tour of the main 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.380
 main ways to interact with the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.080
 shows project approach 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.850
 so here they already light up 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.920
 automatically when one turns to 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.650
 wrist that's the base if not very 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.900
 turned on manually and here I can 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.039
 to change quadrants simply 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.660
 we press the main image and I 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.489
 are going to change quadrant we are not 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.620
 not 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.790
 with a slide from top to bottom I 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.739
 show the latest 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.410
 notifications these are the notifications 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.050
 from either the watch's apps 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.200
 simply applications 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:50.219
 coming from my iphone a slip of 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.870
 bottom finger up gives access to 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.969
 other information to others 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.129
 shortcuts in reality what's called 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.420
 the look and the look is 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.719
 what is for example commands 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.280
 like here the music or the 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.780
 heart rate or the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.570
 percentage of batteries remaining 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.400
 available etc and his looks this 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.990
 parameter easily at the level of 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.390
 the application of the watch on the iphone 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.810
 obviously all this is customizing itself 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.299
 configure at will you can remove 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.030
 peek or add the big 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.430
 piece which is so the main button 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.619
 this one allows either to launch the 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.420
 voice command siri leaving the must 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.680
 to sort out at age you did not understand this 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.900
 that I said syria since there I said 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.880
 whatever 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:40.560
 care to display the application cloud 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.560
 the button zooms in or out 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.619
 to dive into this cloud 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.500
 of applications obviously the screen is 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:52.030
 touch is where we will choose 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.100
 this or that application that we 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.600
 wish to launch and finally the button the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.970
 down well it's kind of a shortcut 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.210
 in the first function and displayed 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.860
 very easily all your contacts 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.630
 the contacts with which one makes 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.700
 then interact with different 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.739
