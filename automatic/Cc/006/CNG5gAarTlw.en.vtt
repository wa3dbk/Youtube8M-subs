00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.040
 which animals kill the greatest number of 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.230
 people the following figures usually 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.129
 be a surprise the number 1 will make you 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.740
 keep your mouth open with 20 sharks 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:16.259
 the last place is certainly a surprise 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.240
 because the shark is so bad 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.460
 reputation thanks to movies about 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.439
 they are hard to believe that only 10 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.300
 people die from shark attacks 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.210
 to the year 19 leopards 15 people die 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.150
 annually because of leopards 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.940
 especially in India 18 horses 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.950
 the horses are the cause of 20 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.420
 deaths of people per year although the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.530
 most of them are really 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.470
 accidents in rodeos and other events 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.050
 17 cows are usually quite 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.570
 harmless but immensely powerful 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.490
 you only have to kick just once to 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.110
 that a human dies as a result of 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:01.140
 this injury 16 ants the ants of 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.450
 fire are especially dangerous 30 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.600
 people are victims of these every year 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:10.770
 in the worst of circumstances they suffer 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.780
 anaphylactic shock 15 spiders other 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.850
 little surprise since most of 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.100
 we think that this number is 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.020
 much higher around 50 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.850
 people die every year as a result 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.100
 of spider bites 14 bees just 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.619
 a bit above the previous ones a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.470
 average of 53 annual deaths are 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.899
 caused by bees the main reason 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.250
 here is the allergic crisis caused by 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:40.140
 the stings 13 tigers close to 100 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.720
 people die every year after being 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.759
 attacked by tigers it is very likely that 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.229
 be the fault of the same human in these 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.149
 cases for causing the animal 12 deer 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.429
 death by deer is not caused by 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.990
 the timid animals themselves but for 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.500
 traffic accidents related 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.000
 with them around 120 people 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.130
 they die this way every year 11 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.009
 Caution jellyfish in the ocean near 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.709
 150 people die every year because of 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.569
 jellyfish the smallest of them are usually 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.799
 be the most dangerous 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.530
 ten elephants around 500 people 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.109
 die because of elephants the most 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.819
 of the times people are trampled 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:28.859
 to death for these colossal animals 9 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.349
 crocodiles the crocodiles snatch the 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:34.969
 double of victims every year around 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.349
 one thousand eight you had these parasites 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:39.750
 unpleasant are lodged in the body and 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.419
 can go unnoticed by up to 20 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.859
 years as a result two thousand people 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:48.689
 7 scorpions die every year as 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.639
 we know thanks to the films of 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.189
 indiana jones the scorpions more 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:55.560
 small are the most dangerous of them 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.090
 complete a figure of around 5000 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.120
 victims per year 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.090
 vinchucas las vinchucas not really 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.459
 They are dangerous in themselves but 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.260
 can transmit diseases 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.910
 dangerous and cause around 10,000 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.310
 deaths every year 5 flies setse almost with 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.680
 the same number of victims around 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.230
 10 thousand the tsets fly is transmitted a 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.450
 sleep disorder this may not be 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.019
 mortal until months or years after the 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.540
 four dogs transmission 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.480
 another surprise 25 thousand deaths a year are 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.360
 caused by dogs leaving the surprise 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.610
 aside only 186 deaths can be 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.010
 attributed to aggressive pet dogs 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.200
 the rest is caused by dogs 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.640
 street that can transmit rage 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.290
 for example 3 snakes the number 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.049
 exact deaths caused by 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.690
 snakes is not yet definite oscillates 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.790
 between 50,000 and 100,000 victims who 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.910
 die as a result of bites 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.840
 poisonous 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.000
 mosquitoes 725 thousand deaths a year are 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.750
 caused by mosquito bites and 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.640
 the diseases that they transmit from these 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.570
 600,000 alone are victims of 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.580
 malaria 1 humans the most 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.850
 deadly of all animals are 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.950
 ourselves humans this 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.380
 it is not necessarily shown in figures 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.300
 since it is very difficult to keep a record 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.790
 but they are in the range of half a million 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.550
 and while animals usually kill 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.800
 by accident or kill to survive the 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.050
 human being is the only species that kills 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.220
 to their peers on the subject of many 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.160
 different ways 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.290
 every day there are furious wars 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.690
 constantly and the desire to profit 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.610
 destroys the dreams of all life the 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.800
 civilization snatches victims through 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.570
 of accidents and many other things this 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.490
 sad first place gives a lot for 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.350
 reflect 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.830
 that's all people do not leave without 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.830
