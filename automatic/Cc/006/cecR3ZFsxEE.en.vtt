00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:12.219
 hi guys with you dzhonik and you 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.799
 watch gear under high efficiency 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.760
 today we are playing batchat on the map 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.730
 South coast 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.400
 player nickname serga von 42 ru experienced 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.300
 tankers behind which more than 35 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.810
 thousand battles 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.930
 wargaming system rating 9 thousand 831 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.660
 the point of the very beginning of the battle our hero goes 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.489
 take an interesting position to do 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.829
 this point battsat fits almost 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.560
 perfect low silhouette good 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.630
 masking good visibility but great 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.950
 the disadvantage here is not the most accurate 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.660
 gun battsat 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.060
 this is not the perfect tank for shooting on 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.239
 long distances we are not the best 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.140
 accuracy plus everything is complicated by small 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.140
 ammunition 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.000
 great from this position 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.100
 lumbago for opponents who occupied 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.680
 the hill of enemy spawn is our hero 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.899
 gets a pair of plume rolls back 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.240
 nonetheless he is trying to discharge 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.710
 drum tablets on the bushes in which 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.340
 in his opinion should be 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.229
 opponents this idea is not devoid of meaning 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.890
 especially at the beginning of the fight anyone there before 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.890
 hide 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.250
 if we look at the minimap we will understand 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.950
 that our team is doing a very big 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.020
 error allies almost completely 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.580
 focused on one direction 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.560
 why is that bad 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.689
 firstly because the excess amount 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.670
 vehicles in one direction 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.369
 sometimes leads to allies 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.110
 simply start interfering with each other 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.539
 second because sometimes in such 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.250
 situations our technique is under 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.289
 crossfire and thirdly 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.369
 significantly increases the risk of breakthroughs 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.590
 one of the flanks 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.780
 let's say if now a couple 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.420
 enemy medium tanks would drive along 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.780
 center and surround our allies on 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.640
 j4 then most likely they would destroy them 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.740
 practically lossless and own 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.390
 health and so our hero serga von 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.459
 shoots down another drum and 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.580
 understands that in this fight you need something 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:12.489
 change in his head matures treacherous 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.350
 plan surrounding the enemy battsat this 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.810
 tank which is perfect for 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.239
 similar maneuvers in the second half of the battle 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.519
 when opponents already know where they are 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.650
 Our whole battat team can 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.200
 make a very unpleasant surprise 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.329
 drove into the stern or board and throw 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.820
 full of reels look how elegant 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.010
 effectively serga background us realizes its 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.290
 drum all five shells found themselves 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.350
 haven and while we last 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.049
 recharging is the time to do that 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.180
 correctly change the position serga background u 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.670
 occupies another interesting place on 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.190
 which I, too, hedgehogs when there is a breakthrough 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.440
 of this flank especially from this point 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.650
 work effectively when you have a tank with 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.900
 strong tower 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.879
 nevertheless, even battsat effectively 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.110
 played in this moment exchanging three of his 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.110
 shots at 1 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.819
 seems to be in a battle is not so bad our 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.209
 sovzvodny finishes t110 and 5 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.610
 the bill becomes 1011 but will not have time yet 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.410
 will complete recharge drum our 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.260
 ward as we shall see 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.140
 in the harsh truth of the world of tanks namely 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.599
 the speed with which can merge 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.129
 the allies did not have time to look back 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:28.019
 10:13 and opponents are trying to crush with might and main 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:30.209
 our platoon is trying to intelligently breed them 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.549
 through the crossfire but the stock 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.920
 there is very little health left 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.099
 now literally any mistake can 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.630
 become fatal opponents were not 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.150
 stupid and understand what to lead in this 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.849
 situation in the positional struggle is unprofitable 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.700
 easier to roll out in a brazen and exchange 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.069
 on safety factor what happens 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.900
 unfortunately our sovzvodny dies and we 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.590
 stay alone against five 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.739
 tanks 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.260
 by the way, we have only 383 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.590
 units of strength and tanks almost 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.079
 completely missing armor + map 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.120
 obviously does not have to shoot from a distance 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.730
 distances where at batts and thanks 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.069
 There could be advantages to the review 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.530
 x 50 b and we are very happy that 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.169
 He did not pass the average damage in 400 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.349
 otherwise this battle would have been 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:22.289
 ended however we have left 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:24.720
 59 halls points and three opponents two of 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:27.090
 which capture our base and percentage 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.610
 capture already nearing hundred percent what 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.830
 Now our hero will do elegantly 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.139
 breeds apt-4 takes remains 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.660
 centurion to fraction 1 which is also not 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.460
 withstands strength test 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.070
 like guys serga background in this 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.620
 episode really pulled this fight up to him 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.370
 a little lucky yes not passed alpha amx 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.039
 50b 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.410
 and opponents missed but if our 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.780
 the hero stupidly resisted b and would not show 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.810
 his skill, then nothing he would not 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.210
 it turned out so we are left alone 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.979
 with arta what do we do the thing is 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.480
 until the end of the battle is not so much 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.200
 at 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.130
 name of art from the enemy pretty quickly 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.950
 perfect for us now this 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.350
 seizing the enemy base but by the same token we 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.680
 putting ourselves in a vulnerable position giving out 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.050
 your location and the miracle begins 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.450
 capture our base and that means that 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.180
 enemy art is on our sharp 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.880
 and we become for this pebble which 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.950
 completely on protects against its lumbago and 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.130
 We are winning this fight 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:31.550
