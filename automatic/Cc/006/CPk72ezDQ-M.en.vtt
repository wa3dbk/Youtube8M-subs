00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.259 

looking<00:00:21.619> at<00:00:21.710> the<00:00:21.800> mountain<00:00:22.039> rescue

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269 
looking at the mountain rescue

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.730 
looking at the mountain rescue
statistics<00:00:23.269> in<00:00:23.480> Scotland<00:00:24.019> historically

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
statistics in Scotland historically

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.710 
statistics in Scotland historically
there's<00:00:24.980> several<00:00:25.279> areas<00:00:25.520> where<00:00:25.820> there's<00:00:26.330> a

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
there's several areas where there's a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.300 
there's several areas where there's a
real<00:00:27.699> concentration<00:00:28.699> of<00:00:29.029> accidents<00:00:29.779> and<00:00:30.310> if

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
real concentration of accidents and if

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.979 
real concentration of accidents and if
you<00:00:31.430> heading<00:00:31.669> out<00:00:31.730> into<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.239> Scottish<00:00:32.720> hills

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
you heading out into the Scottish hills

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.139 
you heading out into the Scottish hills
then<00:00:33.410> it's<00:00:34.220> a<00:00:34.280> good<00:00:34.399> idea<00:00:34.460> to<00:00:34.850> do<00:00:34.940> a<00:00:34.970> bit<00:00:35.120> of

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
then it's a good idea to do a bit of

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.880 
then it's a good idea to do a bit of
research<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:35.870> bit<00:00:35.989> of<00:00:36.079> prior<00:00:36.290> planning<00:00:36.739> to

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
research and a bit of prior planning to

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.590 
research and a bit of prior planning to
where<00:00:37.040> those<00:00:37.190> are<00:00:37.460> because<00:00:37.820> they<00:00:38.030> are<00:00:38.059> a<00:00:38.180> very

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
where those are because they are a very

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.900 
where those are because they are a very
popular<00:00:38.980> locations<00:00:39.980> where<00:00:40.309> a<00:00:40.339> lot<00:00:40.640> of<00:00:40.730> folk

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
popular locations where a lot of folk

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.640 
popular locations where a lot of folk
Bizet's<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:41.540> that's<00:00:41.960> one<00:00:42.140> of<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.320> reasons

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
Bizet's and that's one of the reasons

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.290 
Bizet's and that's one of the reasons
why<00:00:42.829> there's<00:00:43.129> a<00:00:43.190> large<00:00:43.400> concentration<00:00:43.760> of

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
why there's a large concentration of

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.000 
why there's a large concentration of
accidents<00:00:44.809> because<00:00:45.079> in<00:00:45.230> fact<00:00:45.470> there's<00:00:45.769> a<00:00:45.829> lot

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
accidents because in fact there's a lot

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.829 
accidents because in fact there's a lot
of<00:00:46.100> people<00:00:46.460> go<00:00:46.610> there<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.480> I<00:00:47.510> just<00:00:47.540> want<00:00:47.809> to

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
of people go there so I just want to

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.840 
of people go there so I just want to
highlight<00:00:48.079> a<00:00:48.260> few<00:00:48.379> of<00:00:48.739> those<00:00:48.890> popular<00:00:49.519> places

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
highlight a few of those popular places

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.569 
highlight a few of those popular places
where<00:00:50.239> we've<00:00:50.420> seen<00:00:50.659> a<00:00:50.720> series<00:00:51.379> of<00:00:51.579> incidents

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
where we've seen a series of incidents

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.119 
where we've seen a series of incidents
and<00:00:52.760> one<00:00:53.449> of<00:00:53.539> those<00:00:53.660> is<00:00:53.960> book<00:00:54.559> collected<00:00:54.920> more

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
and one of those is book collected more

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.090 
and one of those is book collected more
down<00:00:55.370> in<00:00:55.520> Glencoe<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.469> the<00:00:57.469> normal<00:00:57.800> of<00:00:57.890> sin

Tullock onto the the Alec and then heads

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.469 
Tullock onto the the Alec and then heads

00:01:08.169 --> 00:01:08.179 
that route in summer in is very

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:10.660 
that route in summer in is very
straightforward<00:01:08.899> albeit<00:01:09.710> quite<00:01:09.920> loose<00:01:10.340> it's

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
straightforward albeit quite loose it's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.380 
straightforward albeit quite loose it's
a<00:01:10.820> very<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.390> screen<00:01:12.350> filled<00:01:12.770> quarry<00:01:13.220> but<00:01:14.210> in

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
a very and screen filled quarry but in

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.810 
a very and screen filled quarry but in
winter<00:01:14.570> because<00:01:15.500> of<00:01:15.679> it<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:16.100> nature<00:01:16.580> of<00:01:16.610> the

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
winter because of it the nature of the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.270 
winter because of it the nature of the
aspect<00:01:17.450> of<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.720> quarry<00:01:17.960> it<00:01:18.110> faces<00:01:18.560> north<00:01:18.890> and

aspect of the quarry it faces north and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.380 
aspect of the quarry it faces north and
our<00:01:19.340> prevailing<00:01:19.759> winds<00:01:20.060> are<00:01:20.210> from<00:01:20.300> the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
our prevailing winds are from the

our prevailing winds are from the
southwest

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
southwest

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.139 
southwest
it<00:01:21.289> tends<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.619> build<00:01:21.920> up<00:01:22.100> quite<00:01:22.759> a<00:01:22.820> large

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
it tends to build up quite a large

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.969 
it tends to build up quite a large
amount<00:01:23.479> of<00:01:23.630> snow<00:01:23.840> which<00:01:24.170> strips<00:01:24.560> off<00:01:24.770> the

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
amount of snow which strips off the

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.190 
amount of snow which strips off the
mountain<00:01:25.430> ridge<00:01:25.640> behind<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.689> therefore

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
mountain ridge behind and therefore

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.649 
mountain ridge behind and therefore
there's<00:01:27.890> times<00:01:28.640> when<00:01:28.939> the<00:01:29.270> avalanche

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
there's times when the avalanche

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.080 
there's times when the avalanche
conditions<00:01:29.930> there<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:30.799> not<00:01:30.979> safe<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:31.759> it's<00:01:32.000> a

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
conditions there and not safe so it's a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.080 
conditions there and not safe so it's a
good<00:01:32.680> place<00:01:33.680> to<00:01:33.890> do<00:01:34.040> some<00:01:34.280> serious<00:01:34.850> research

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
good place to do some serious research

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.300 
good place to do some serious research
first<00:01:35.630> on<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.079> avalanche<00:01:36.470> conditions<00:01:36.770> on

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
first on the avalanche conditions on

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.460 
first on the avalanche conditions on
that<00:01:37.490> slope<00:01:38.360> aspect<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:39.110> we<00:01:39.290> have

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
that slope aspect and we have

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.440 
that slope aspect and we have
historically<00:01:40.070> seen<00:01:40.369> several<00:01:41.240> quite

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
historically seen several quite

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.690 
historically seen several quite
high-profile<00:01:42.320> incidents<00:01:42.649> where<00:01:43.280> people

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
high-profile incidents where people

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.730 
high-profile incidents where people
unfortunately<00:01:44.000> have<00:01:44.360> died<00:01:44.630> in<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.110> area<00:01:45.500> and

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
unfortunately have died in the area and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.889 
unfortunately have died in the area and
just<00:01:46.670> because<00:01:46.909> it's<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.149> high<00:01:47.299> avalanche<00:01:47.659> risk

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
just because it's a high avalanche risk

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.389 
just because it's a high avalanche risk
doesn't<00:01:48.229> mean<00:01:48.439> to<00:01:48.530> say<00:01:48.649> that<00:01:48.680> you<00:01:48.890> can't<00:01:49.130> go<00:01:49.310> on

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
doesn't mean to say that you can't go on

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.800 
doesn't mean to say that you can't go on
climb<00:01:49.579> but<00:01:49.820> collecting<00:01:50.210> more<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.570> day<00:01:50.750> you

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
climb but collecting more that day you

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.469 
climb but collecting more that day you
just<00:01:51.020> need<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.549> think<00:01:52.549> about<00:01:52.790> an<00:01:52.909> alternative

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
just need to think about an alternative

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.300 
just need to think about an alternative
route<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.049> an<00:01:54.140> alternative<00:01:54.710> route<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.159> you

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
route and an alternative route that you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.550 
route and an alternative route that you
could<00:01:55.520> choose<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:56.210> a<00:01:56.270> ridge<00:01:56.899> which<00:01:57.140> follows

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
could choose is a ridge which follows

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.499 
could choose is a ridge which follows
that<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.189> right-hand<00:01:58.700> side<00:01:58.939> on<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.210> west

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
that the the right-hand side on the west

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.590 
that the the right-hand side on the west
side<00:01:59.990> of<00:02:00.350> Korean<00:02:00.799> Tala

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
side of Korean Tala

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.140 
side of Korean Tala
and<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.799> lot<00:02:03.189> of<00:02:03.280> conditions<00:02:03.790> that<00:02:03.850> would<00:02:04.090> be

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
and in a lot of conditions that would be

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.109 
and in a lot of conditions that would be

down the side of the clock a gully and

down the side of the clock a gully and
it's<00:02:48.550> always<00:02:48.880> been<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.660> problem<00:02:50.260> down<00:02:50.650> the

it's very loose and obviously as the

it's very loose and obviously as the
years<00:02:55.180> have<00:02:55.299> gone<00:02:55.569> by<00:02:55.650> it's<00:02:56.650> become<00:02:56.920> more<00:02:57.160> and

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
more eroded so places as you descend

if you choose to descend that rule you

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.090 
if you choose to descend that rule you
certainly<00:03:17.109> need<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:17.350> be<00:03:17.500> aware<00:03:17.829> of<00:03:17.890> the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
certainly need to be aware of the

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.370 
certainly need to be aware of the
dangers<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:18.820> keep<00:03:19.090> well<00:03:19.359> away<00:03:19.390> from<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:20.200> big

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
dangers and keep well away from the big

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.740 
dangers and keep well away from the big
drops<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.950> choose<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.280> route<00:03:21.609> accordingly<00:03:21.940> but

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
drops and choose a route accordingly but

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.509 
drops and choose a route accordingly but
again<00:03:23.049> there's<00:03:23.470> alternatives<00:03:24.100> you<00:03:24.310> could

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
again there's alternatives you could

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.789 
again there's alternatives you could
head<00:03:24.700> south<00:03:25.000> of<00:03:25.269> a<00:03:25.299> final<00:03:25.780> Wesson's<00:03:26.200> limit<00:03:26.560> and

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
head south of a final Wesson's limit and

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.090 
head south of a final Wesson's limit and
head<00:03:27.160> down<00:03:27.400> towards<00:03:27.850> Glencoe<00:03:28.359> but<00:03:29.019> again<00:03:29.890> not

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
head down towards Glencoe but again not

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.069 
head down towards Glencoe but again not
to<00:03:30.220> be<00:03:30.310> trapped<00:03:30.579> like<00:03:30.700> there<00:03:31.120> is<00:03:31.299> loose

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
to be trapped like there is loose

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.720 
to be trapped like there is loose
steeped<00:03:32.530> ground<00:03:32.799> there<00:03:33.100> or<00:03:33.400> another

steeped ground there or another

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.310 
steeped ground there or another
alternative<00:03:34.359> is<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.540> head<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.079> north

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
alternative is to head to the north

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.740 
alternative is to head to the north
towards<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:35.890> path<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.640> then<00:03:36.880> descend<00:03:37.390> down

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
towards the path and then descend down

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.780 
towards the path and then descend down
from<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.140> Bialik<00:03:38.620> between<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.220> path<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.670> the

from the Bialik between the path and the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.390 
from the Bialik between the path and the
final<00:03:40.209> Western<00:03:40.450> summit<00:03:40.959> so<00:03:41.470> again<00:03:42.160> it's<00:03:42.340> kind

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
final Western summit so again it's kind

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.370 
final Western summit so again it's kind
of<00:03:42.609> not<00:03:42.760> been<00:03:42.940> blinkered<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.750> not<00:03:43.930> just<00:03:44.170> sort

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
of not been blinkered and not just sort

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.080 
of not been blinkered and not just sort
of<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.829> know<00:03:44.859> peak<00:03:45.250> bagging<00:03:45.670> and<00:03:45.790> heading<00:03:46.060> for

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
of you know peak bagging and heading for

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.550 
of you know peak bagging and heading for
the<00:03:46.299> obvious<00:03:46.450> thing<00:03:46.930> it's<00:03:47.079> looking<00:03:47.380> at<00:03:47.470> the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
the obvious thing it's looking at the

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.590 
the obvious thing it's looking at the
bigger<00:03:47.739> picture<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.430> choosing<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.269> route

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
bigger picture and choosing a route

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.680 
bigger picture and choosing a route
choice<00:03:49.870> that's<00:03:50.170> appropriate<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.890> yourself

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
choice that's appropriate to yourself

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.060 
choice that's appropriate to yourself
then<00:03:52.690> there<00:03:52.900> is<00:03:53.019> obviously<00:03:53.380> because<00:03:53.680> it's<00:03:53.980> the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
then there is obviously because it's the

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.550 
then there is obviously because it's the
highest<00:03:54.220> mountain<00:03:54.430> has<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.870> highest<00:03:56.230> number

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
highest mountain has the highest number

the<00:04:30.210> cans<00:04:30.479> then<00:04:31.169> navigation<00:04:31.889> is<00:04:32.010> not<00:04:32.250> so<00:04:32.490> easy

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
the cans then navigation is not so easy

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.270 
the cans then navigation is not so easy
and<00:04:33.150> we<00:04:33.330> see<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.630> spirit<00:04:34.260> of<00:04:34.380> accidents<00:04:35.100> where

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
and we see a spirit of accidents where

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.150 
and we see a spirit of accidents where
fog<00:04:35.580> heads<00:04:35.850> too<00:04:36.330> far<00:04:36.570> south<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:37.199> they<00:04:37.380> end<00:04:37.680> up

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
fog heads too far south and they end up

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.300 
fog heads too far south and they end up
in<00:04:38.340> fighting<00:04:38.880> a<00:04:39.000> gully<00:04:39.300> or<00:04:39.600> down<00:04:40.199> in<00:04:40.620> Corey

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
or if you're in there in thawing

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.800 
or if you're in there in thawing
conditions<00:05:59.610> and<00:05:59.849> it<00:05:59.940> could<00:06:00.090> be<00:06:00.240> as<00:06:00.330> a<00:06:00.360> result

a history of accidents and you could

a history of accidents and you could
call<00:06:12.240> them<00:06:12.360> black<00:06:12.510> spots<00:06:12.900> but<00:06:13.050> it<00:06:13.169> doesn't

there<00:06:14.880> you<00:06:15.330> just<00:06:15.450> need<00:06:15.570> to<00:06:15.750> be<00:06:15.840> aware<00:06:16.110> of<00:06:16.169> them

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
there you just need to be aware of them

there you just need to be aware of them
aware<00:06:16.830> of<00:06:17.010> the<00:06:17.130> dangers<00:06:17.610> and<00:06:17.639> perhaps
