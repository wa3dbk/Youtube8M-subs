00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.109 
a shot but his finessed very consistent
and<00:01:40.229> really<00:01:41.009> good<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.369> useful<00:01:41.579> for<00:01:41.939> him<00:01:42.030> he

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
and really good and useful for him he

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.530 
and really good and useful for him he
also<00:01:42.299> has<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> think<00:01:42.810> 85<00:01:43.500> pace<00:01:43.770> or<00:01:44.119> 85<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.329> above

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
also has I think 85 pace or 85 and above

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.929 
also has I think 85 pace or 85 and above
that's<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:45.960> sure<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:47.130> keeps<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.549> pace<00:01:47.729> up

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
that's for sure so it keeps the pace up

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.550 
that's for sure so it keeps the pace up
there<00:01:48.119> pretty<00:01:48.299> good<00:01:48.509> considering<00:01:48.930> el<00:01:49.200> jawaari

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
there pretty good considering el jawaari

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.310 
there pretty good considering el jawaari
only<00:01:50.009> has<00:01:50.189> 81<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.390> moving<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> center

only has 81 and moving to the center
attacking<00:01:52.740> mid<00:01:52.890> now<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.070> could<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.430> had

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
attacking mid now I could have had

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.060 
attacking mid now I could have had
Robinho<00:01:54.299> here<00:01:54.659> although<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.229> decided<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.829> wanted

as well anyways moving to the highest
rated<00:02:10.770> player<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.819> team<00:02:11.970> which<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.390> a

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
rated player in the team which is a

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.670 
rated player in the team which is a
Ronaldo<00:02:13.020> and

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
Ronaldo and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.770 
Ronaldo and
I<00:02:13.709> will<00:02:14.189> to<00:02:14.549> be<00:02:14.670> honest<00:02:14.909> I<00:02:15.000> will<00:02:15.209> probably<00:02:15.420> sell

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
I will to be honest I will probably sell

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.720 
I will to be honest I will probably sell
him<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.140> because<00:02:16.290> not<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.400> fact<00:02:17.549> I<00:02:17.670> think

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
him just because not the fact I think

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.819 
him just because not the fact I think
he's<00:02:18.120> an<00:02:18.329> amazing<00:02:18.659> player<00:02:19.019> in<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.349> game<00:02:19.439> but

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
he's an amazing player in this game but

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.530 
he's an amazing player in this game but
I<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.189> don't<00:02:20.430> see<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.969> need<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.329> six

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
I just don't see the need for six

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.789 
I just don't see the need for six
hundred<00:02:21.659> thousand<00:02:22.140> coins<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.469> one<00:02:22.650> particular

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
hundred thousand coins on one particular

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.890 
hundred thousand coins on one particular
player<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.670> i'll<00:02:24.090> probably<00:02:24.329> do<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.629> and<00:02:24.810> make

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
player so i'll probably do that and make

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.899 
player so i'll probably do that and make
some<00:02:25.079> other<00:02:25.200> teams<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:25.829> you<00:02:26.489> guys<00:02:26.640> aren't

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
some other teams but you guys aren't

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.369 
some other teams but you guys aren't
over<00:02:27.180> now<00:02:27.299> though<00:02:27.510> he's<00:02:27.689> done<00:02:27.870> really<00:02:28.170> well

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
over now though he's done really well

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
he has that line chemistry one thing I

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.349 
he has that line chemistry one thing I
forgot<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.980> mention<00:02:53.129> was<00:02:53.609> that<00:02:53.639> I<00:02:53.819> think<00:02:54.090> three

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
forgot to mention was that I think three

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.780 
forgot to mention was that I think three
people<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:54.870> this<00:02:54.989> don't<00:02:55.439> have<00:02:55.769> nine<00:02:56.250> chemistry

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790

ronaldo Cassano ultra woori and Pato and
then<00:04:53.740> also<00:04:54.280> Valbuena<00:04:54.819> who's<00:04:55.000> forced<00:04:55.330> our

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
then also Valbuena who's forced our

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.390 
then also Valbuena who's forced our
skills<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:55.990> a<00:04:56.139> lot<00:04:56.289> of<00:04:56.319> pace<00:04:56.530> so<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:56.770> mean<00:04:56.979> that

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
skills and a lot of pace so I mean that

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.430 
skills and a lot of pace so I mean that
attacking<00:04:57.729> force<00:04:58.150> is<00:04:58.330> absolutely<00:04:58.960> deadly<00:04:59.169> and

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
attacking force is absolutely deadly and

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.930 
attacking force is absolutely deadly and
I<00:04:59.470> recommend<00:04:59.919> this<00:05:00.039> team<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.400> anyone<00:05:00.759> who<00:05:00.909> can

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
I recommend this team to anyone who can

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.570 
I recommend this team to anyone who can
afford<00:05:01.180> it<00:05:01.569> and<00:05:01.750> obviously<00:05:02.319> Ronaldo<00:05:03.130> he<00:05:03.400> can

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
afford it and obviously Ronaldo he can

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.450 
afford it and obviously Ronaldo he can
be<00:05:03.699> replaced<00:05:04.090> with<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.330> few<00:05:04.599> players<00:05:04.840> and<00:05:05.460> just

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
be replaced with a few players and just

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.420 
be replaced with a few players and just
whoever<00:05:06.940> whoever<00:05:07.270> you<00:05:07.539> want<00:05:07.690> to<00:05:07.750> put<00:05:07.900> there

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
whoever whoever you want to put there

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.189 
whoever whoever you want to put there
but<00:05:09.430> I<00:05:09.460> will<00:05:10.000> probably<00:05:10.360> sell<00:05:10.569> Ronaldo<00:05:11.020> and

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
but I will probably sell Ronaldo and

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.170 
but I will probably sell Ronaldo and
just<00:05:11.979> because<00:05:12.250> I<00:05:12.460> don't<00:05:12.789> think<00:05:12.970> he's

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
just because I don't think he's

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.809
