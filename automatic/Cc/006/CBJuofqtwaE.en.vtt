00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello people and today shows you guys 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.590
 again a small command and you 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.420
 here is really relatively small to me 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.760
 so first points of course again 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.590
 you then set a commando blog 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.090
 somewhere 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.699
 then he goes in the description on the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.160
 link copies the long roman I am there 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.099
 have written and presses ctrl and v 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.099
 then sack a little redstone 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:38.370
 put the signal next to it and the machine 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:41.250
 it's done again it's a small one 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.270
 command I have already said 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.059
 but I'll just say it now 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.629
 like to do it again for this one 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.800
 command a useful and great single 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:56.629
 and a magic mirror 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.149
 like the legend of zelda 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:04.170
 this mirror causes when you are in the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.680
 underground is or somewhere under something 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.799
 among them 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.220
 that makes you look at the surface 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:16.409
 so can porten around this mirror too 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:21.540
 Buy her four quartz needs an end 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.670
 pearl and a glass and the values 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.100
 then somehow indiscriminate on the floor and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.659
 With a little luck, you will get 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.659
 your magic mio 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.280
 that was not because of lab but that was up to 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.660
 me 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.070
 that was just a bug at the moment 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.600
 should not actually be with you 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.520
 I have a mistake 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.170
 made that way i am now 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.330
 here in the cave and have mine here 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:58.250
 magic mirror crafted because i like him 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:02:00.260
 He teleports me in hand 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.740
 to the surface and I find it very much 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.120
 cool 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.220
 I can not explain it like that 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.410
 works if you are somewhere 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.899
 below is underneath and the magic mirror 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.850
 then you will use it on top 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.710
 Teleported or somehow wrong 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.900
 this works with the spread playoffs 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.770
 command of distributed entities on the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.720
 radius so under surface and that has 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.820
 the effect that if somehow 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.000
 blocks over his head has that one 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.190
 can be teleported to it 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.220
 but I'm just too good for that 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.480
 with me just does not work 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.080
 now I worked so now I stand 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.640
 on the floor 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.350
 So you can somehow get along with it 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.100
 something very high up the 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.200
 teleport 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.580
 but it's also a small radius 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.690
 that is when I hold in hand 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.940
 I'll vote them left or right 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.750
 teleported right or so with the 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.130
 cool particle effects display velvet but 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.780
 if you do what I did before 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.340
 made that one the mirror 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.060
 while he is teleporting out of the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.430
 hand takes 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.650
 this is unhealthy because the machine has one 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.450
 then just keep teleporting because 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.670
 the machines do as if you have the 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.200
 Mirror in hand holds the komanis 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.330
 then when you suddenly run 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.530
 you should not have it in hand anymore 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.580
 really take it out of hand 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.140
 if you have seen the article effect 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.090
 Otherwise something like that happens 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.620
 and what if you're the playful one 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.870
 wise you should not use it in 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.600
 the home bar but because you have each 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.090
 times if you scroll over it that way 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.200
 mirror a bit used 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.580
 you do not notice that yourself but the 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.410
 machine so if you notice the mirror 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.750
 then for a very long time over here 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.850
 stumbled and then you are very deep in 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.470
 the cave and you have it very short 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.110
 in the hand then you go up again 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.820
 teleporting it is not so good 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.410
 By the way, you can easily do that too 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.950
 picture click to magic out to me 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.760
 to get 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.140
 they are really great 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.810
 I'm just on the idea yesterday 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.080
 come as I terraria with the foot 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.100
 fabian fabian and the 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.770
 magic mirror 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.290
 used it and came to me 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.490
 that 's pretty cool and that's why 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.890
 I have you in the small now synonymous 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.060
 command for that made yes so you 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.190
 can you with it to the surface 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.170
 teleport 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:13.180
 if you were under things and that was yes 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.860
 and if you're wondering why I am 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.210
 now the recording is different 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.340
 then it probably rings 

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:24.880
 because I just after the 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:28.930
 i have liked to get up 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.910
 command blocks yes yes and if you 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.320
 this magic mirror has fallen 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.320
 then let it be easier
