00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:36.005
 Still can't escape 

00:00:36.084 --> 00:00:37.584
 Think of your gentleness 

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:40.038
 Your kiss, your stupid 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.240
 Also imprinted in my heart 

00:00:42.632 --> 00:00:44.132
 You told me 

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.177
 When the meteor falls 

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:47.208
 Promised 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:48.729
 How rare is it? 

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.315
 I really want to hear you say to me. 

00:00:51.432 --> 00:00:54.032
 (You are the most beautiful and unique in my life) 

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.554
 You said to me 

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:58.765
 (I want us to be together forever and ever) 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.679
 Flip flips bad future 

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:02.794
 Get back the good past 

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:04.542
 Tell me you to tell me 

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:06.865
 Is there any other answer? 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.920
 Flip flips bad future 

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.102
 Bring all your love back 

00:01:11.262 --> 00:01:12.762
 Tell me you to tell me 

00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:14.711
 I believe you can solve it. 

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:18.791
 The future is still coming 

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:20.646
 If you are not there 

00:01:20.782 --> 00:01:22.782
 There is always one less piece 

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:26.849
 Then you turned around 

00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:30.936
 Turn now into the future 

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:55.540
 Still can't escape 

00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:57.140
 Think of your gentleness 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.040
 Your kiss, your stupid 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 Also imprinted in my heart 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.580
 You told me 

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:05.140
 When the meteor falls 

00:02:05.574 --> 00:02:06.570
 Promised 

00:02:06.647 --> 00:02:08.150
 How rare is it? 

00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:11.110
 I really want to hear you say to me. 

00:02:11.182 --> 00:02:12.680
 (You are the most beautiful and unique in my life) 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.840
 You said to me 

00:02:14.972 --> 00:02:17.970
 (I want us to be together forever and ever) 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.440
 Flip flips bad future 

00:02:20.537 --> 00:02:22.540
 Get back the good past 

00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:24.130
 Tell me you to tell me 

00:02:24.668 --> 00:02:26.170
 Is there any other answer? 

00:02:26.477 --> 00:02:28.480
 Flip flips bad future 

00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:31.160
 Bring all your love back 

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:32.820
 Tell me you to tell me 

00:02:33.114 --> 00:02:35.110
 I believe you can solve it. 

00:02:35.178 --> 00:02:37.680
 The future is still coming 

00:02:38.362 --> 00:02:41.360
 If you are not missing forever 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.270
 Then you turned around 

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:49.380
 Turn now into the future 

00:02:50.243 --> 00:02:52.740
 When love wants to leave 

00:02:54.332 --> 00:02:57.330
 Who can we stay? 

00:02:58.088 --> 00:03:01.590
 Lost is impossible to come back 

00:03:02.476 --> 00:03:06.480
 But I am still waiting here 

00:03:07.346 --> 00:03:08.850
 Flip flips bad future 

00:03:09.061 --> 00:03:11.060
 Get back the good past 

00:03:11.312 --> 00:03:12.810
 Tell me you to tell me 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.110
 Is there any other answer? 

00:03:15.214 --> 00:03:16.710
 Flip flips bad future 

00:03:17.117 --> 00:03:19.120
 Bring all your love back 

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:20.960
 Tell me you to tell me 

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:22.930
 I believe you can solve it. 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.560
 The future is still coming 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.350
 If you are not missing forever 

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:34.290
 Then you turned around 

00:03:34.897 --> 00:03:38.400
 Turn now into the future
