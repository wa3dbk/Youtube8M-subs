had it before so for us it's a big thing
as<00:02:47.570> well<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:48.260> important<00:02:48.710> because<00:02:48.770> we<00:02:49.070> want

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
as well it's important because we want

that<00:02:49.340> mode<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.600> game<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.110> hopefully

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
that mode to in the game to hopefully

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.710 
that mode to in the game to hopefully
cater<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.640> people<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.970> perhaps<00:02:53.270> want<00:02:53.660> to

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
cater to the people that perhaps want to

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.440 
cater to the people that perhaps want to
have<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.890> more<00:02:54.890> infantry<00:02:55.400> focus<00:02:55.910> than<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.180> more<00:02:56.420> a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
have a more infantry focus than a more a

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.590 
have a more infantry focus than a more a
bit<00:02:56.690> tighter<00:02:56.990> kind<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.890> game<00:02:58.130> mode<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:59.420> more

bit tighter kind of a game mode the more

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.060 
bit tighter kind of a game mode the more
hardcore<00:02:59.990> battlefield<00:03:00.410> fans<00:03:00.590> maybe<00:03:00.890> they

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
hardcore battlefield fans maybe they

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.070 
hardcore battlefield fans maybe they
want<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.310> play<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.820> conquest<00:03:02.300> especially<00:03:02.990> the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
large 64 player maps it's very different

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.180 
large 64 player maps it's very different
so<00:03:05.510> we<00:03:05.630> want<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.960> have<00:03:06.470> different<00:03:06.830> modes<00:03:07.010> that

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
so we want to have different modes that

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.490 
so we want to have different modes that
can<00:03:07.880> give<00:03:08.420> people<00:03:08.450> different<00:03:09.050> experience<00:03:09.380> and
