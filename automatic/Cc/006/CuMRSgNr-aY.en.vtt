00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:17.160
 I hope to make a continuation of Gundam x Mao again this time . 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:25.240
 I think it's been a week or more since the last video, but I can only make a torso and head 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:26.789
 So I want to show off in front of the finished appearance in what serves as the current video 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.730
 Then 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.730
 I think I want to keep going 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.990
 With the work process 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.329
 Also this time because the result if there is a time 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.150
 With dad 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.870
 I think that want to go 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.870
 I will go 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.899
 Of Udeude Hi 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.899
 Position the foot 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.340
 Voiced 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.180
 this 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.430
 Mr. Iwabe is good 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.460
 No 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.990
 It was more than imagined 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.990
 Right behind the weapon 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.130
 And this flashy minute 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.650
 It was more than imagined 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.990
 Well 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.740
 to place 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.740
 A pose that you 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.630
 Month issue 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.170
 Also it comes with several weapons 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.260
 No a little various poses 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.460
 I would like to 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.460
 First of all is standard 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.080
 4 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.080
 Spotto 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.810
 Sword flow 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.220
 Finally high power avoided Canon 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.220
 It is a model 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.300
 queen 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:39.690
 It took three weeks swastika, which was finally completed 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.319
 But at first I thought that parts were thin and difficult 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.450
 Teacher There is no such thing and novice 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.670

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.860
 I was able to 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.600
 Also 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:55.430
 I want to challenge something in December 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:59.260
 I would like to adjust as the aircraft which was on the ferry was released 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.260
