00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.030
 I was about 4 or 5 years old we were 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.370
 visit in the country house of one of my 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.710
 uncles and tried to ride a horse 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.490
 huge my engineer left me alone 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.150
 then I asked why because I did not 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.789
 rest 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.120
 I started crying I was four years old and 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.890
 crying I told him 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.529
 because no it is not a good answer 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.480
 it's never a good answer 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.520
 apparently I have always been 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.800
 worried the authoritarian attitudes and 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.660
 that's why I'm so worried about this world of 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.559
 today where everything is governed by those who 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.559
 they lift more sides 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.950
 the scandal has become a fuel 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.380
 in a bonfire where more than vanity 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.560
 flames are burned to deploy a 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.350
 vulgar and ostentatious but in the end 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.770
 of accounts must be said that power is 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.120
 also pretty empty pretty hollow in 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.090
 that swing almost everyone involved 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.890
 they lose sight of a fundamental issue to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.840
 who the hell it suits to be 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.909
 involved being the protagonist of a 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.729
 scandal 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.100
 as a good conciliator that I am always 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.289
 I try to understand why people do 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.149
 what it does however I have 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.090
 absolutely clear that it does not matter 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.700
 how much reason do you have 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.490
 love and pain sadness and 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.850
 happiness are feelings that are lived 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.090
 much but much but much better in the 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.250
 privacy 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.469
 and exhibit them is a kind of vanity 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.550
 misunderstood very badly understood by 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.740
 true 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.840
 that's what 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.990
 It works in the same way as lifting 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.990
 the voice that will set up a scandal 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.000
 I like to understand 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.420
 and to understand you have to calm down 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.030
 but above all you have to leave a little 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.210
 aside personal interests and look 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.610
 with attention those of others what 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.790
 curious 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.590
 several decades passed from that day 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.440
 that I wanted to ride a horse and my 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.920
 mom did not let me 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.680
 but I still think the same 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.900
 that is because it is not not good 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.909
 answer 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.909
 it's never a good answer
