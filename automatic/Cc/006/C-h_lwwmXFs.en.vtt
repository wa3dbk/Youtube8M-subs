00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.420
 As you can see, I have here a 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.170
 Butterflies have just put it on me 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.410
 a few minutes why why why in 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.490
 this moment just gave me the idea of 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.480
 teach them how they can decorate their 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.480
 lemons for chad 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.610
 and I'm going to show you the materials here 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.700
 they come 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:35.050
 the first materials are glue and 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.059
 carnitas color glaze 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.559
 and then you glaze that is colored 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.590
 half carnitas 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.390
 if he can see 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.470
 and they also need transparent enamel 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.560
 and glue 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.480
 manasÃ©s you help that is not seen in everything 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.020
 glues gets like this medium 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.620
 transparent every time you use it 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.290
 good 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.290

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.890
 both have qualified as diamanti 2 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.570
 well these are the little stars an idea 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.210
 only that the stars are not good 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.159
 idea because all yes to all the breasts 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.619
 you put them on the same earrings they looked 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.180
 ugly then like there almost was not the 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.729
 idea 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.940
 congratulations of these and if you want kid 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.159
 which are like many colors and drawings 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.369
 or for example there are music keys 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.399
 stars reasons also like these 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.740
 like necklaces like for example from 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.530
 these who are like whose milestones by 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.789
 example I had this but it burst 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.950
 so I grabbed all the pearls and that 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.700
 I stayed 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.700
 good 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.729
 I'm going to show you how a breast is 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.070
 with these materials below ok 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.310
 so there is a link so that every time 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.310
 that this thing transforms it already 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.050
 I had and you can clean it as much as 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.270
 you can before you do it to make them look 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.790
 very nice for example from here I could not 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.840
 clean them and here back like feito but 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.010
 good 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.410
 but forward have good love with the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.599
 transparent enamel you paint your eyes 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.019
 that makes it shine, I do not know 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.250
 if really and with diamonds like 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:32.560
 example of these 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:36.280
 when here already and with this one fixes 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.090
 noses ears for example for 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.819
 this chest 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.760
 I put little hearts and I gave him the 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.550
 ears with transparent enamel and 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.910
 also to this other chest in the nose he 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.819
 I put I do not know if this one is very very thick 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.560
 because I reach to bathe it but good 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.599
 it's not pretty 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.440
 ok we're going to need a patio that does not 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.170
 be decorated 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.380
 and then we can not decorate it with 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.780
 this so I can not prove it to 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.390
 see either a fact that I can 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.370
 teach to put this so that they see 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.370
 how will you be ok wait machine 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.580
 and here is 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:30.230
 I have two equal 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.409
 let's use this little stick 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.360
 ok they 're going to need to put the glue 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.239
 a droplet anywhere in 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.660
 newspaper where for example I put a 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.050
 droplet on the ground 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.660
 and for first they will need the 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.860
 enamel 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.710
 very carefully you are going to put it with 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.310
 their little ears so they can see 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.870
 I do not know if well 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.870
 that I'm decorating 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:17.080
 I stay 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:20.250
 it is for the breasts that their 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.250
 noses or something 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:28.000
 I think this is fine from the ears 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.220
 so if it does not help but go like this 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.500
 it's okay 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.860
 now we are going to put enamel 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.860
 transparent 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:45.520
 therefore the world abc little 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.520
 they are going to put it 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:17.160
 ready if you see it shows in the camera that 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.280
 it is painted 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.330
 ok no forgiveness also naricita that 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.200
 can you just put it 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.500
 okay 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.400
 and then we're going to take the earrings that 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.400
 they want to put him 

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:39.269
 for example, they can put 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.999
 these square earrings 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.909
 if they look pretty 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:51.659
 human for a little piece of glue in 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:51.659
 your little finger 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:25.819
 one 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:32.039
 do not 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.630
 tradition and verse what usually slip 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.630
 so 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.349
 so I give 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.060
 only that they can not be taught well 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.420
 because as they are squares they are more 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.889
 weak 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.949
 so then you have to love 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:08.199
 Then I teach it in another life because 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:08.199
 he slips the squares I'm ok 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.620
 that has been all friends and thousands of 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.420
 youtube by the way also with the 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.680
 diamonds can be put on the 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.310
 head 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:23.750
 for example with me of earrings that 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:26.380
 I no longer had children 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.380
 they hurt 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.770
 they enjoy being in the body 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:41.139
 well I'm sorry, I had two of this 

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:43.240
 you can not put one here 

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:47.949
 example to this one can be put equal 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:51.960
 in this way or there is also forgiveness and 

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:56.520
 that way or also a diamond 

00:07:51.960 --> 00:08:00.220
 who blesses here or also with the 

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:02.830
 men can put on these 

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.040
 of these in one ear so you can see him 

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.040
 A) Yes
