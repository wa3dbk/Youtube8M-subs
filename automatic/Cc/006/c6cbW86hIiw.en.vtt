00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
and they're certainly making that that

and they're certainly making that that
quite<00:00:21.600> obvious<00:00:22.109> early<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.760> and<00:00:23.760> he<00:00:23.850> gone<00:00:24.029> about

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
quite obvious early on and he gone about

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.060

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.510 
represent this state we have a couple of
pacemakers<00:03:22.870> there<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.590> think<00:03:23.709> Ben<00:03:24.070> -<00:03:24.340> he's

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
pacemakers there I think Ben - he's

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.330 
pacemakers there I think Ben - he's
going<00:03:24.850> through<00:03:25.080> 15k<00:03:26.080> I<00:03:26.110> think<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:27.100> Keith

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
going through 15k I think and Keith

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.280 
going through 15k I think and Keith
McPherson<00:03:27.970> probably<00:03:28.420> through<00:03:28.750> halfway<00:03:28.959> so<00:03:29.170> I

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
McPherson probably through halfway so I

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.020 
McPherson probably through halfway so I
think<00:03:29.350> Scotty's<00:03:30.160> tried<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.520> get<00:03:30.670> these<00:03:30.790> guys

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
think Scotty's tried to get these guys

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.260 
think Scotty's tried to get these guys
to<00:03:31.450> set<00:03:31.989> out<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.440> even<00:03:33.280> pace<00:03:33.520> probably<00:03:34.030> about

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
to set out and even pace probably about

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.000 
to set out and even pace probably about
68<00:03:34.840> minutes<00:03:34.870> through<00:03:35.290> halfway<00:03:35.470> I<00:03:35.709> think

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
68 minutes through halfway I think

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.620 
68 minutes through halfway I think
they'll<00:03:36.130> talk<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.640> so<00:03:36.760> that's<00:03:37.150> it's<00:03:37.420> great

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
they'll talk and so that's it's great

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.600 
they'll talk and so that's it's great
