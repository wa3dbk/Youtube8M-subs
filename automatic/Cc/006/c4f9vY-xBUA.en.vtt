00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.540
 Hi all 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.640
 good as you see today I will explain to 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.640
 do this kitten is a brooch 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.520
 to do it, you're just going to need 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:35.340
 felt scissors threads needles 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.730
 and gualda or cotton something to fill what 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.160
 that is soft 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.190
 in the page 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.270
 on my page you will find what are the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.150
 patterns and as I always tell you this 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.700
 pattern is to fit this size 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.860
 but you can capture what is 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.060
 the image and make it smaller for 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.850
 make it the smallest brooch 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.490
 you would have to count two of these two from 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.680
 this and one that is the nose or is the 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.810
 nose has a trick because I eat 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.710
 you will see is chubby 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:15.250
 well it's not like that then then it 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.640
 explained how to do it and well that's very 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.300
 simple as always and is super rich 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.000
 good 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.350
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.350
 cut the pieces as we talked 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.180
 and let's start working the body 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.909
 the body we are going to join we are going to join 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.860
 the two pieces and we're going to start 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:45.520
 work sewing from here 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.030
 all this area here all until 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.740
 let's get here again to the other side 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.500
 then there we will begin to fill in 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.690
 wadding all the bottom part then 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.670
 we sew the top part 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.230
 before closing everything we put more 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.200
 wadding to be back to fill 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.750
 the little legs and this part of here what 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.100
 is the neck you have to leave them with nothing or 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.619
 be all this piece there is no need 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.599
 fill it 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.989
 okay girls I'm going to do it and now I'll 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.989
 I teach 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.380
 good girls as you see I already have the 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.230
 little body stuffed 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.430
 And now I'll teach you to do 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.430
 Nose because it has a trick 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.950
 As you can see, it's not flat, it's not a 10 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.189
 flat then I'll show you how the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.189
 Water 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.370
 first we take a little bit of wadding 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.530
 and we're going to roll it up a lot so that 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.530
 stay as close as possible 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.900
 we celebrate the dark to match the 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.410
 color of the filter that we are going to use 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.740
 to make the little nose what we're going to 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.740
 do is 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.569
 to do with a stitching to all the 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.569
 around 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.620
 we are doing the stitching 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.750
 now you will see why it is for 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.750
 put the wadding inside 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.760
 and who will stay to visit round 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.760
 round 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.870
 once we have done all the stitching 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.200
 of everything 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.519
 the outline what we do is put the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.519
 ball of wadding we have made 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.569
 we wait for the wine 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.670
 we breathe hard 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.110
 and the nose is left 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.110
 now so they do not go away 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.200
 We are going to sew several times this way 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.200
 extremes 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.460
 and that's how it stays then they have caught me 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.940
 now once we have it done 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.840
 what we have to do is position 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.760
 the on the face of the cat 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.090
 Well, we want it there, because there 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.090
 we own 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.360
 it's just to sew it 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.660
 so that it stays well congenital and good 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.289
 girls let's finish decorating the 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.360
 little face 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.800
 when we finish decorating what 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.139
 we have to do is put together the two 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.849
 pieces putting wadding in the middle but 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:58.050
 before putting the batting to start 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.279
 sew from here from this area here and so 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.979
 to the ear when you are there 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:04.330

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:09.270

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.270
 little ears are worth now we follow girls 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:18.190

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.740

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.940
 what we have to do is sew it here 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.940
 you have to place it 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.779
 and sew it 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:53.150
