take a look at the advantage of an

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.490 
take a look at the advantage of an
instant<00:00:29.460> attack<00:00:29.760> over<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.539> ranged<00:00:31.019> attack<00:00:31.140> an

instant attack over a ranged attack an

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.319 
instant attack over a ranged attack an
attack<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.769> has<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> projectile<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.880> how<00:00:33.270> you

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
attack that has a projectile and how you

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.200 
attack that has a projectile and how you
can<00:00:33.600> manipulate<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.500> using<00:00:35.489> any<00:00:35.730> sort<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.090> a

can manipulate this using any sort of a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.750 
can manipulate this using any sort of a
dropship<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.980> specific<00:00:37.980> example<00:00:38.190> looking<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.700> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
dropship a specific example looking at a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.910 
dropship a specific example looking at a
Terran<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.840> siege<00:00:40.079> tank<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.469> Terran<00:00:40.770> player

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
Terran and a siege tank a Terran player

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.190 
Terran and a siege tank a Terran player
with<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.100> siege<00:00:41.280> tank<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> medivac<00:00:42.200> taking

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
with a siege tank and a medivac taking

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.350 
with a siege tank and a medivac taking
advantage<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.800> by<00:00:44.219> lifting<00:00:44.700> off<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
advantage with that by lifting off the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.479 
advantage with that by lifting off the
unit<00:00:45.780> before<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.230> gets<00:00:46.410> hit<00:00:46.710> by<00:00:46.980> those<00:00:47.129> range

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
unit before it gets hit by those range

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.610 
unit before it gets hit by those range
projectiles<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.690> specifically<00:00:49.289> let's<00:00:49.469> take<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
projectiles so specifically let's take a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.900 
projectiles so specifically let's take a
look<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:49.980> scenario<00:00:50.100> we're<00:00:50.640> gonna<00:00:50.760> have

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
look at this scenario we're gonna have

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.049 
look at this scenario we're gonna have
one<00:00:51.059> siege<00:00:51.390> tank<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.350> siege<00:00:52.590> versus<00:00:53.520> three

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
one siege tank on the siege versus three

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.430 
one siege tank on the siege versus three
roaches<00:00:54.600> let's<00:00:54.780> take<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> look<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
roaches let's take a look at how that

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.670 
roaches let's take a look at how that
would<00:00:55.559> typically<00:00:55.860> look<00:00:57.260> alright<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.559> is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
would typically look alright so here is

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.590 
would typically look alright so here is
our<00:00:58.800> one<00:00:58.859> hero<00:00:59.250> siege<00:00:59.520> tank<00:00:59.820> up<00:01:00.000> against<00:01:00.359> these

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
our one hero siege tank up against these

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.200 
our one hero siege tank up against these
three<00:01:00.899> roaches<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.530> siege<00:01:02.059> unseeded<00:01:03.059> siege

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
three roaches on siege unseeded siege

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.759 
three roaches on siege unseeded siege
tanks<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> lot<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.899> damage<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.650> be

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
tanks do a lot of damage and they can be

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.830 
tanks do a lot of damage and they can be
very<00:01:04.920> good<00:01:05.159> at<00:01:05.250> harassing<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.180> but

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
very good at harassing with that but

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.149 
very good at harassing with that but
obviously<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.470> come<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:07.680> against<00:01:08.070> these

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
obviously if you come up against these

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.560 
obviously if you come up against these
three<00:01:08.369> roaches<00:01:08.760> let's<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.119> take<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> look<00:01:09.420> how

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
three roaches let's just take a look how

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.690 
three roaches let's just take a look how
this<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.840> gonna<00:01:10.049> work<00:01:10.260> out<00:01:10.470> unfortunately<00:01:11.340> for

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
this is gonna work out unfortunately for

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.190 
this is gonna work out unfortunately for
the<00:01:11.790> siege<00:01:12.000> tank<00:01:12.240> doesn't<00:01:12.600> really<00:01:12.750> work<00:01:12.990> out

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the siege tank doesn't really work out

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.020 
the siege tank doesn't really work out
in<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.799> favor<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.369> see<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.640> instant

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
in the favor you can see that instant

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.969 
in the favor you can see that instant
attack<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.509> hits<00:01:15.689> instantly<00:01:16.259> after<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
attack that hits instantly after the

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.679 
attack that hits instantly after the
animation<00:01:17.520> comes<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.060> muzzle<00:01:18.299> flash<00:01:18.659> from

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
animation comes that muzzle flash from

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.940 
animation comes that muzzle flash from
the<00:01:19.080> front<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.560> tank

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the front of the tank

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.399 
the front of the tank
but<00:01:20.610> these<00:01:20.759> range<00:01:21.060> attacks<00:01:21.659> actually<00:01:21.990> take

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
but these range attacks actually take

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.170 
but these range attacks actually take
some<00:01:22.619> time<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.100> reach<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.520> unit<00:01:23.790> before<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
some time to reach the unit before the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.149 
some time to reach the unit before the
damage<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.659> dealt<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.409> let's<00:01:25.590> take<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> look<00:01:25.920> at

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
damage is dealt so let's take a look at

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.179 
damage is dealt so let's take a look at
that<00:01:26.340> situation<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.750> by<00:01:27.990> trying<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.650> avoid

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that situation but by trying to avoid

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.069 
that situation but by trying to avoid
that<00:01:29.579> range<00:01:29.850> attack<00:01:30.240> by<00:01:30.450> lifting<00:01:30.689> off<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
that range attack by lifting off the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.020 
that range attack by lifting off the
tank<00:01:31.470> before<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.009> range<00:01:32.189> attack<00:01:32.520> actually

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
tank before the range attack actually

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.149 
tank before the range attack actually
hits<00:01:33.500> alright<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.590> all<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.860> need<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
hits alright so all you need to

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.590 
hits alright so all you need to
accomplish<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.970> course<00:01:36.150> your<00:01:36.329> tank

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
accomplish this is of course your tank

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.120 
accomplish this is of course your tank
on<00:01:36.780> siege<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.500> medivac<00:01:37.860> you're<00:01:38.040> gonna

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
on siege and a medivac you're gonna

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.010 
on siege and a medivac you're gonna
obviously<00:01:38.310> start<00:01:39.119> things<00:01:39.299> off<00:01:39.450> with<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> tank

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
obviously start things off with the tank

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.140 
obviously start things off with the tank
in<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> medevac<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.009> trick<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.549> what

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
in the medevac and the trick is what

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.210 
in the medevac and the trick is what
we're<00:01:42.299> going<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.570> doing<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:43.200> dropping<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
we're going to be doing is dropping the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.649 
we're going to be doing is dropping the
tank<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.759> then<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.030> lifting<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.540> off

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
tank and then just lifting it off

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.289 
tank and then just lifting it off
instantly<00:01:46.590> drop<00:01:46.860> lift<00:01:47.130> off<00:01:47.399> drop<00:01:47.759> lift<00:01:48.060> off

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
instantly drop lift off drop lift off

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.850 
instantly drop lift off drop lift off
and<00:01:48.540> you're<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:48.990> gonna<00:01:49.079> want<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.680> this

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
and you're just gonna want to do this

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.469 
and you're just gonna want to do this
and<00:01:50.189> we're<00:01:50.280> gonna<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.579> actually<00:01:50.880> doing<00:01:51.210> this

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and we're gonna be actually doing this

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.590 
and we're gonna be actually doing this
in<00:01:51.689> order<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.380> completely<00:01:52.890> avoid<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:54.149> ranged

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
in order to completely avoid the ranged

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.420 
in order to completely avoid the ranged
damage<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.380> terms<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.799> how<00:01:55.920> I'm<00:01:56.070> doing<00:01:56.340> this

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
damage in terms of how I'm doing this

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.149 
damage in terms of how I'm doing this
basically<00:01:57.049> selecting<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> medivac<00:01:58.530> hitting

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
basically selecting the medivac hitting

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.060 
basically selecting the medivac hitting
D<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.820> access<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.600> drop<00:02:00.930> command<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.590> then

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
D to access the drop command and then

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.399 
D to access the drop command and then
clicking<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.360> medevac<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.170> drops

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
clicking on the medevac and that drops

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.660 
clicking on the medevac and that drops
to<00:02:04.590> instantly<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.250> then<00:02:05.340> I'm<00:02:05.460> just

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
to instantly and then I'm just

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.960 
to instantly and then I'm just
right-clicking<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.450> tank<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.439> D

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
right-clicking on the tank so it's D

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.919 
right-clicking on the tank so it's D
left-click<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.000> then<00:02:09.360> right-click<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
left-click and then right-click on the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.839 
left-click and then right-click on the
tank<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:11.009> progressively

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
tank and it's just that progressively

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.300 
tank and it's just that progressively
over<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.569> over<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
over and over and

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.979 
over and over and
again<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.030> let's<00:02:14.450> see<00:02:14.599> how<00:02:14.720> that's<00:02:14.900> gonna

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
again and let's see how that's gonna

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.110 
again and let's see how that's gonna
work<00:02:15.110> with<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.860> roaches<00:02:16.099> actually<00:02:16.760> in<00:02:16.849> play

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
work with the roaches actually in play

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.790 
work with the roaches actually in play
all<00:02:17.810> right<00:02:17.959> so<00:02:18.050> we're<00:02:18.140> gonna<00:02:18.200> again<00:02:18.560> look<00:02:18.709> at

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
all right so we're gonna again look at

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.470 
all right so we're gonna again look at
that<00:02:18.920> same<00:02:19.160> situation<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:19.910> this<00:02:20.090> time<00:02:20.300> with

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
that same situation but this time with

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.240 
that same situation but this time with
the<00:02:20.510> dropship<00:02:21.140> micro<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.709> again<00:02:21.890> remember

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
the dropship micro and again remember

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.550 
the dropship micro and again remember
I'm<00:02:22.340> I'm<00:02:22.550> clicking<00:02:22.880> D<00:02:23.330> for<00:02:23.660> drop<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.170> then

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
I'm I'm clicking D for drop and then

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.410 
I'm I'm clicking D for drop and then
left<00:02:25.040> clicking<00:02:25.489> on<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.700> medevac<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.300> then

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
left clicking on the medevac and then

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.910 
left clicking on the medevac and then
just<00:02:26.599> right-clicking<00:02:27.020> on<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.440> siege<00:02:27.650> tank

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
just right-clicking on the siege tank

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.620 
just right-clicking on the siege tank
once<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.280> drops<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.790> idea<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.209> I'm

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
once it drops and the idea is that I'm

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.390 
once it drops and the idea is that I'm
going<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.870> use<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.290> instant<00:02:30.769> attack<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:31.340> try

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
going to use that instant attack and try

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.610 
going to use that instant attack and try
to<00:02:31.519> bypass<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.300> range<00:02:32.569> animation<00:02:33.290> attack

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
to bypass the range animation attack

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:41.420 
to bypass the range animation attack
from<00:02:34.130> these<00:02:34.340> roaches

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.300 

so<00:02:42.000> as<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.209> can<00:02:42.329> see<00:02:42.390> here<00:02:42.989> I'm<00:02:43.590> avoiding

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
so as you can see here I'm avoiding

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.550 
so as you can see here I'm avoiding
nearly<00:02:44.909> all<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.420> attack<00:02:45.720> damage<00:02:46.170> it's<00:02:46.379> not

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
nearly all of the attack damage it's not

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.289 
nearly all of the attack damage it's not
you<00:02:47.010> know<00:02:47.129> it's<00:02:47.280> not<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.459> hundred<00:02:47.760> percent<00:02:47.879> you

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
you know it's not a hundred percent you

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.970 
you know it's not a hundred percent you
you<00:02:48.629> do<00:02:48.810> get<00:02:49.019> hit<00:02:49.200> if<00:02:49.379> you're<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:49.829> little

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
you do get hit if you're just a little

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.309 
you do get hit if you're just a little
bit<00:02:50.250> slow<00:02:50.549> or<00:02:50.790> depending<00:02:51.599> on<00:02:51.720> basically<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
bit slow or depending on basically the

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.589 
bit slow or depending on basically the
range<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.099> unit<00:02:53.370> from<00:02:53.579> you<00:02:53.790> but<00:02:54.269> this<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.569> a

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
range of the unit from you but this is a

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.750 
range of the unit from you but this is a
much<00:02:55.049> much<00:02:55.319> different<00:02:55.739> situation<00:02:55.860> from<00:02:56.579> that

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
much much different situation from that

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.089 
much much different situation from that
of<00:02:56.909> which<00:02:57.060> we<00:02:57.209> initially<00:02:58.049> looked<00:02:58.260> at<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.739> that

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
of which we initially looked at and that

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.619 
of which we initially looked at and that
initial<00:02:59.519> situation<00:02:59.730> of<00:03:00.090> course<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.420> siege

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
initial situation of course the siege

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.390 
initial situation of course the siege
tank<00:03:00.900> got<00:03:01.019> completely<00:03:01.470> rolled<00:03:01.799> by<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.069> three

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
tank got completely rolled by the three

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.550 
tank got completely rolled by the three
roaches<00:03:02.849> but<00:03:03.269> as<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.510> can<00:03:03.599> see<00:03:03.659> here<00:03:04.109> three

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
roaches but as you can see here three

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.740 
roaches but as you can see here three
roaches<00:03:04.920> dead<00:03:05.159> siege<00:03:05.700> tank<00:03:06.000> nice<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.480> alive

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
roaches dead siege tank nice and alive

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.140 
roaches dead siege tank nice and alive
and<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:07.140> can<00:03:07.170> do<00:03:07.439> this<00:03:07.620> type<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.250> harass<00:03:08.640> in<00:03:08.939> in

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
and you can do this type of harass in in

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.940 
and you can do this type of harass in in
any<00:03:09.329> situation<00:03:09.989> against<00:03:10.319> anything<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.829> has

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
any situation against anything that has

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.160 
any situation against anything that has
a<00:03:10.980> ranged<00:03:11.489> attack<00:03:11.640> with<00:03:12.450> something<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:13.019> has

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
a ranged attack with something that has

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.470 
a ranged attack with something that has
a<00:03:13.500> range<00:03:13.950> projectile<00:03:14.790> attack<00:03:15.060> versus

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
a range projectile attack versus

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.210 
a range projectile attack versus
something<00:03:15.659> that<00:03:15.870> has<00:03:15.959> an<00:03:16.109> instant<00:03:16.500> attack<00:03:16.739> so

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
something that has an instant attack so

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.920 
something that has an instant attack so
as<00:03:17.340> example<00:03:17.819> you<00:03:18.209> can<00:03:18.359> do<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.629> with<00:03:18.780> an

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
as example you can do it with an

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.470 
as example you can do it with an
immortal<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.859> mortal<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:20.849> a<00:03:20.909> war<00:03:21.060> prism<00:03:21.389> as

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
immortal and a mortal in a war prism as

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.640 
immortal and a mortal in a war prism as
well<00:03:21.629> so<00:03:21.840> let's<00:03:21.989> just<00:03:22.109> take<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.260> look<00:03:22.440> at<00:03:22.530> that

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
well so let's just take a look at that

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.530 
well so let's just take a look at that
very<00:03:22.859> quickly<00:03:23.099> alright<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.120> we're<00:03:24.209> gonna<00:03:24.269> see

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
very quickly alright so we're gonna see

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.670 
very quickly alright so we're gonna see

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
so that the immortal prema to bypass is

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.690 
so that the immortal prema to bypass is
almost<00:03:27.659> all<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.260> damage<00:03:28.769> by<00:03:29.430> just

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
almost all of the damage by just

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.699 
almost all of the damage by just
dropping<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.540> picking<00:03:30.870> up<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.200> dropping<00:03:31.349> and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
picking up as quickly as possible and

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.379 
picking up as quickly as possible and
you<00:03:34.739> know<00:03:34.859> you<00:03:34.920> can<00:03:35.280> avoid<00:03:35.609> pretty<00:03:36.000> much<00:03:36.150> all

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389

of<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.720> hits<00:03:36.989> as<00:03:37.290> long<00:03:37.799> as<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.069> are<00:03:38.159> quick

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
of the hits as long as you are quick

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.759 
of the hits as long as you are quick
enough<00:03:38.700> because<00:03:39.150> again<00:03:39.480> remember<00:03:40.200> what<00:03:40.379> we<00:03:40.560> do

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
enough because again remember what we do

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:41.839 
enough because again remember what we do
what<00:03:40.950> we<00:03:41.069> are<00:03:41.099> doing<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.579> we're<00:03:41.700> just

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
what we are doing is we're just

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.849

bypassing<00:03:42.510> that<00:03:42.540> attack<00:03:42.959> animation<00:03:43.650> and

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
bypassing that attack animation and

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.559 
bypassing that attack animation and
lifting<00:03:44.549> off<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.879> immortal<00:03:45.239> before<00:03:45.510> it

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
lifting off the immortal before it

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:46.759 
lifting off the immortal before it
actually<00:03:45.900> connects<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.440> as<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.620> can<00:03:46.709> see

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769
