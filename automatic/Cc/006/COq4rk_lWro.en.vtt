Galaxy s3 so basically guys we wanted to
explain<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> philosophy<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.289> drop<00:00:22.529> test

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
explain the philosophy of this drop test

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.439 
explain the philosophy of this drop test
so<00:00:23.279> what<00:00:23.430> we're<00:00:23.580> trying<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.880> do<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.330> bring

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
so what we're trying to do here is bring

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.390 
so what we're trying to do here is bring
you<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.900> most<00:00:25.050> realistic<00:00:25.590> possible<00:00:26.220> drop

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
you the most realistic possible drop

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.339 
you the most realistic possible drop
test<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.330> involves<00:00:27.930> three<00:00:28.320> different

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
test so that involves three different

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.189 
test so that involves three different
drops<00:00:29.220> first<00:00:30.000> we're<00:00:30.539> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.720> drop<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.080> out

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
drops first we're going to drop it out

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.020 
drops first we're going to drop it out
of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> pocket<00:00:31.619> as<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.099> pull<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.550> device<00:00:32.790> out

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
of the pocket as we pull the device out

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.790 
of the pocket as we pull the device out
which<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.600> most<00:00:33.719> typical<00:00:34.110> use<00:00:34.559> case

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
which is the most typical use case

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.350 
which is the most typical use case
scenario<00:00:35.219> when<00:00:35.610> people<00:00:35.850> actually<00:00:36.030> drop<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
scenario when people actually drop the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.479 
scenario when people actually drop the
device<00:00:36.690> from<00:00:37.260> there<00:00:37.559> we're<00:00:38.010> going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> drop<00:00:38.340> it

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
device from there we're going to drop it

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.790 
device from there we're going to drop it
from<00:00:38.610> about<00:00:38.760> four<00:00:39.149> feet<00:00:39.390> high<00:00:39.600> when<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.320> person

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
from about four feet high when a person

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.229 
from about four feet high when a person
raises<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> side<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.790> their<00:00:41.879> head<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
raises it up to the side of their head a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.760 
raises it up to the side of their head a
lot<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.719> people<00:00:42.930> also<00:00:43.020> tend<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.379> drop<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.680> from

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
lot of people also tend to drop it from

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.920 
lot of people also tend to drop it from
there<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.070> well<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.399> lastly<00:00:45.059> we're<00:00:45.510> gonna<00:00:45.600> let

there as well and lastly we're gonna let

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.139 
there as well and lastly we're gonna let
it<00:00:45.960> slip<00:00:46.260> out<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> hand<00:00:46.800> at<00:00:47.070> five<00:00:47.640> foot<00:00:47.879> six

goodness first part of the drop test

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.940 
goodness first part of the drop test
right<00:01:06.689> from<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.900> pocket

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.320 

let's<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.369> see<00:01:14.549> how<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.880> fared<00:01:15.119> from<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
let's just see how it fared from the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.420 
let's just see how it fared from the
reverse<00:01:15.570> initial<00:01:15.990> drop<00:01:16.140> test<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:17.040> right<00:01:17.250> so

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
reverse initial drop test all right so

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.859 
reverse initial drop test all right so
no<00:01:17.580> shattering<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.240> display<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> really

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
no shattering on the display a really

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.710 
no shattering on the display a really
good<00:01:19.020> sign<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:20.270> looks<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
good sign but looks like we have a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.120 
good sign but looks like we have a
little<00:01:22.049> bit<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.229> scratching<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> side

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
little bit of scratching to the side

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.859 
little bit of scratching to the side
here<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.119> does<00:01:24.270> seem<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.689> fared

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
here but it does seem to have fared

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.499 
here but it does seem to have fared
quite<00:01:25.110> well<00:01:25.460> other<00:01:26.460> than<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.850> very<00:01:26.880> minimal

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
quite well other than that very minimal

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.910 
quite well other than that very minimal
damage<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:27.960> things<00:01:28.140> considering<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.830> was

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
damage all things considering but it was

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.700 
damage all things considering but it was
from<00:01:29.100> only<00:01:29.280> two<00:01:29.520> feet<00:01:30.090> six<00:01:30.509> inches<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.110> let's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
from only two feet six inches so let's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.990 
from only two feet six inches so let's
see<00:01:31.860> how<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.009> last<00:01:32.250> three<00:01:32.520> doesn't<00:01:32.850> now<00:01:32.970> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
see how the last three doesn't now a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.899 
see how the last three doesn't now a
I've<00:01:33.750> owned<00:01:34.020> five<00:01:34.259> drop<00:01:34.770> tests<00:01:35.039> here<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:35.880> are

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
I've owned five drop tests here we are

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.399 
I've owned five drop tests here we are
guys<00:01:36.149> let's<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.659> with<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> s3<00:01:36.960> from<00:01:37.320> the

let's<00:03:41.489> see<00:03:41.610> how<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.850> goes

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.600 

you<00:03:50.319> know<00:03:50.440> I've<00:03:50.860> really<00:03:51.130> got<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.280> hand<00:03:51.490> it's

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
you know I've really got a hand it's

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.890 
you know I've really got a hand it's
Apple<00:03:52.080> device<00:03:53.080> itself<00:03:53.470> is<00:03:53.530> still<00:03:53.770> functioning

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
Apple device itself is still functioning

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.270 
Apple device itself is still functioning
let's<00:03:55.900> see<00:03:56.050> where<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.290> moment<00:03:56.590> of<00:03:56.650> point<00:03:57.190> of

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
let's see where the moment of point of

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.809 
let's see where the moment of point of
impact<00:03:57.580> was

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.720 

all<00:04:01.150> right<00:04:01.360> if<00:04:01.870> they're<00:04:02.110> so<00:04:02.319> yeah

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
all right if they're so yeah

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.910 
all right if they're so yeah
it's<00:04:04.330> a<00:04:04.420> really<00:04:04.660> unclad<00:04:04.989> device<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.500> just<00:04:05.830> to

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
it's a really unclad device I just to

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.140 
it's a really unclad device I just to
save<00:04:06.069> a<00:04:06.129> little<00:04:06.220> bit<00:04:06.340> of<00:04:06.430> damage<00:04:06.730> on<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:06.940> side

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
save a little bit of damage on the side

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.850 
save a little bit of damage on the side
we<00:04:07.690> had<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.930> first<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.410> second<00:04:08.680> point<00:04:08.739> of

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
we had the first the second point of

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.559 
we had the first the second point of
impact<00:04:09.129> was<00:04:09.340> here<00:04:09.580> and<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.150> first<00:04:10.330> point<00:04:10.540> of

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
impact was here and the first point of

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.990 
impact was here and the first point of
impact<00:04:10.900> was<00:04:11.080> uh<00:04:11.129> actually<00:04:12.129> excuse<00:04:12.459> me<00:04:12.610> this

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
impact was uh actually excuse me this

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.250 
impact was uh actually excuse me this
appears<00:04:13.269> to<00:04:13.330> be<00:04:13.480> actually<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.019> point<00:04:14.200> of

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
appears to be actually the point of

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.050 
appears to be actually the point of
impact<00:04:14.379> and<00:04:14.980> whereas<00:04:15.519> you<00:04:15.700> know<00:04:15.730> from<00:04:15.970> the

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
impact and whereas you know from the

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.690 
impact and whereas you know from the
galaxy<00:04:16.419> s3<00:04:16.690> is<00:04:17.139> smashed<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:18.160> iPhone<00:04:18.489> 5

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
galaxy s3 is smashed the iPhone 5

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.000 
galaxy s3 is smashed the iPhone 5
appears<00:04:19.120> to<00:04:19.870> sustain<00:04:20.229> relatively<00:04:20.859> minimal

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
appears to sustain relatively minimal

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.920 
appears to sustain relatively minimal
damage<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.970> LCD<00:04:22.360> itself<00:04:22.479> is<00:04:22.780> still

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
damage the LCD itself is still

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.629 
damage the LCD itself is still
completely<00:04:23.260> functioning<00:04:23.830> it's<00:04:24.280> just<00:04:24.460> minor

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
completely functioning it's just minor

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.640 
completely functioning it's just minor
aesthetic<00:04:25.030> damage<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.020> bezel<00:04:26.320> itself

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
aesthetic damage to the bezel itself

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.800 
aesthetic damage to the bezel itself
which<00:04:27.130> is<00:04:27.250> made<00:04:27.400> of<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.580> hard<00:04:28.030> composite<00:04:28.600> metal

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
which is made of a hard composite metal

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.300 
which is made of a hard composite metal
so<00:04:29.740> yeah<00:04:30.580> iPhone<00:04:31.000> 5<00:04:31.150> felt<00:04:31.450> very<00:04:31.750> very<00:04:31.990> well

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
so yeah iPhone 5 felt very very well

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.750 
so yeah iPhone 5 felt very very well
alright<00:04:33.310> guys

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
alright guys

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.120 
alright guys
Samsung<00:04:34.210> Galaxy<00:04:34.330> s3<00:04:34.720> time<00:04:35.080> again<00:04:35.620> we're<00:04:36.040> gonna

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
Samsung Galaxy s3 time again we're gonna

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.710 
Samsung Galaxy s3 time again we're gonna
drop<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:36.550> from<00:04:36.669> the<00:04:36.850> height<00:04:36.970> of<00:04:37.090> my<00:04:37.180> ear<00:04:37.389> to

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
drop it from the height of my ear to

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.020 
drop it from the height of my ear to
retrain<00:04:38.650> realistic<00:04:39.160> drop<00:04:39.370> test<00:04:39.610> scenario

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
retrain realistic drop test scenario

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.810 
retrain realistic drop test scenario
I'll<00:04:40.270> be<00:04:40.780> five<00:04:40.990> foot<00:04:41.200> six<00:04:41.410> of<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.740> year<00:04:41.950> and

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
I'll be five foot six of the year and

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:50.430 
I'll be five foot six of the year and
let's<00:04:43.000> just<00:04:43.180> see<00:04:43.300> how<00:04:43.450> it<00:04:43.479> fares

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.710 

so<00:04:50.560> as<00:04:50.620> we<00:04:50.740> can<00:04:50.830> see<00:04:50.890> yeah<00:04:51.760> just<00:04:52.360> from<00:04:52.420> the<00:04:52.570> side

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
so as we can see yeah just from the side

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.260 
so as we can see yeah just from the side
here<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.110> did<00:04:53.290> crack<00:04:53.560> a<00:04:53.590> little<00:04:53.740> bit<00:04:53.950> more<00:04:54.270> it

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
here it did crack a little bit more it

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.190 
here it did crack a little bit more it
appears<00:04:55.360> as<00:04:55.690> though

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
appears as though

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.690 
appears as though
yeah<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.620> impact<00:04:56.920> was<00:04:57.040> here<00:04:57.250> on<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.490> side

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
yeah the impact was here on the side

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.460 
yeah the impact was here on the side
which<00:04:58.360> cause<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.720> glass<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:59.110> fracture<00:04:59.440> a

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
which cause the glass to fracture a

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.170 
which cause the glass to fracture a
little<00:04:59.650> bit<00:04:59.740> more<00:04:59.950> but<00:05:00.370> it<00:05:00.460> just<00:05:00.580> compounded

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
little bit more but it just compounded

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.850 
little bit more but it just compounded
the<00:05:01.210> fractures<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.020> point<00:05:02.200> where<00:05:02.440> they

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
the fractures to the point where they

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.950 
the fractures to the point where they
extend<00:05:03.460> all<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:03.670> way<00:05:04.060> down<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.660> device

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
extend all the way down the device

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.340 
extend all the way down the device
itself<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.640> rear<00:05:06.850> yeah<00:05:07.330> obviously<00:05:07.810> not

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
itself to the rear yeah obviously not

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.290 
itself to the rear yeah obviously not
very<00:05:08.380> much<00:05:08.650> damage<00:05:08.980> it's<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.580> case<00:05:09.790> really<00:05:10.150> no

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
very much damage it's the case really no

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.880 
very much damage it's the case really no
one<00:05:10.420> cares<00:05:10.630> about<00:05:10.750> it's<00:05:11.050> just<00:05:11.230> cheap<00:05:11.500> plastic

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
one cares about it's just cheap plastic

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.700 
one cares about it's just cheap plastic
really<00:05:12.130> anyway<00:05:12.660> but<00:05:13.660> yeah<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:14.350> screen<00:05:14.560> itself

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
really anyway but yeah the screen itself

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.990 
really anyway but yeah the screen itself
is<00:05:14.890> still<00:05:15.040> functioning<00:05:15.490> so<00:05:15.610> that's<00:05:15.760> a<00:05:15.820> really

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
is still functioning so that's a really

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.340 
is still functioning so that's a really
good<00:05:16.090> sign<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.450> internals<00:05:16.840> are<00:05:16.900> obviously

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
good sign the internals are obviously

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.670 
good sign the internals are obviously
okay<00:05:17.940> but<00:05:18.940> it<00:05:19.600> just<00:05:19.750> compounded<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.350> impact

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
okay but it just compounded the impact

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.320 
okay but it just compounded the impact
and<00:05:21.160> just<00:05:21.370> made<00:05:21.520> all<00:05:21.640> the<00:05:21.760> cracks<00:05:21.970> just<00:05:22.150> go

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
and just made all the cracks just go

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.060 
and just made all the cracks just go
down<00:05:22.480> a<00:05:22.510> little<00:05:22.750> farther<00:05:22.990> down<00:05:23.200> the<00:05:23.560> length<00:05:23.890> of

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
down a little farther down the length of

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.550 
down a little farther down the length of
the<00:05:24.160> display<00:05:24.550> so<00:05:25.480> Samsung<00:05:26.260> as<00:05:26.380> three

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
the display so Samsung as three

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.560 
the display so Samsung as three
unfortunately<00:05:27.070> is<00:05:27.460> in<00:05:27.670> pretty<00:05:28.360> tough<00:05:28.510> shape

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
unfortunately is in pretty tough shape

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.190 
unfortunately is in pretty tough shape
right<00:05:28.930> now<00:05:28.960> relative<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.680> iPhone<00:05:29.980> 5<00:05:30.220> I<00:05:31.200> am

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
right now relative to the iPhone 5 I am

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.840 
right now relative to the iPhone 5 I am
the<00:05:32.380> iPhone<00:05:32.770> 5<00:05:33.010> held<00:05:33.250> up<00:05:33.370> well<00:05:33.520> during<00:05:33.700> the

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
the iPhone 5 held up well during the

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.150
