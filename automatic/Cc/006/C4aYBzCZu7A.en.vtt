00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
get a look at what everyone's saying is

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.330 
get a look at what everyone's saying is
going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> starting<00:00:49.170> pistol<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.739> this

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
going to be the starting pistol on this

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.100 
going to be the starting pistol on this
map<00:00:50.579> since<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.000> shown<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.270> both<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.750> map<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
map since is shown on both this map and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.689 
map since is shown on both this map and
shadows<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.530> evil<00:00:52.620> however<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.579> not

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
shadows of evil however it's not

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.430 
shadows of evil however it's not
confirmed<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.600> starting<00:00:54.930> pistol<00:00:55.320> but

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
confirmed to be the starting pistol but

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.740 
confirmed to be the starting pistol but
it's<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.739> possibility<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.750> personally

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it's just a possibility I personally

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.939 
it's just a possibility I personally
don't<00:00:57.870> think<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
don't think it is going to be the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.290 
don't think it is going to be the
starting<00:00:59.280> pistol<00:00:59.609> because<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.910> looks<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.180> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
starting pistol because it looks like a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.549 
starting pistol because it looks like a
be<00:01:00.510> 23<00:01:00.719> AR<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.570> most<00:01:03.750> likely<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.170> burst

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
be 23 AR so it's most likely a burst

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.260 
be 23 AR so it's most likely a burst
pistol<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> doubt<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.909> would<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
pistol and a doubt that would be the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.760 
pistol and a doubt that would be the
starting<00:01:06.570> pistol<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:06.960> who<00:01:07.110> knows<00:01:07.290> they<00:01:07.560> may

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
starting pistol but who knows they may

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.950 
starting pistol but who knows they may
end<00:01:08.040> up<00:01:08.189> having<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> sound<00:01:09.600> pistol

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
end up having this as the sound pistol

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.539 
end up having this as the sound pistol
and<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> other<00:01:10.560> big<00:01:10.830> thing<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.220> note<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.430> that

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
and the other big thing to note is that

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.179 
and the other big thing to note is that
it<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.939> actually<00:01:12.119> snowing<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.170> map<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.040> it

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
it is actually snowing on this map so it

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.469 
it is actually snowing on this map so it
seems<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.640> we're<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.119> getting<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
seems like we're going to be getting a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.570 
seems like we're going to be getting a
very<00:01:15.810> very<00:01:16.170> different<00:01:16.409> out<00:01:16.740> take<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.340> der

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
very very different out take on der

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.310 
very very different out take on der
riese<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.420> can't<00:01:18.600> wait<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.840> durries

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
riese and I just can't wait for durries

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.380 
riese and I just can't wait for durries
if<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.619> snowing<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.250> think<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.090> going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.240> be

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
if it's snowing I think it's going to be

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.880 
if it's snowing I think it's going to be
very<00:01:21.420> very<00:01:21.840> different<00:01:22.470> i<00:01:22.530> think<00:01:22.740> there's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
very very different i think there's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.830 
very very different i think there's
going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.189> lot<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.520> changes<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.119> durries

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
going to be a lot of changes to durries

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.320 
going to be a lot of changes to durries
and<00:01:25.170> visual<00:01:26.100> changes<00:01:26.700> not<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.060> in

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and visual changes not just in

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.300 
and visual changes not just in
graphically<00:01:28.020> butter<00:01:28.290> changes<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> map

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
graphically butter changes to the map

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.740 
graphically butter changes to the map
and<00:01:29.490> i<00:01:29.520> think<00:01:29.700> there's<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.030> going<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.360> so

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and i think there's just going to be so

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.170 
and i think there's just going to be so
so<00:01:30.960> much<00:01:31.170> added<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.950> giants<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.820> wasn't

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
so much added to the giants that wasn't

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.940 
so much added to the giants that wasn't
impaired<00:01:33.570> wasn't<00:01:33.960> previously<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
impaired wasn't previously in the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.219 
impaired wasn't previously in the
original<00:01:35.159> der<00:01:35.610> riese<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.570> can't<00:01:36.720> wait<00:01:37.020> to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
original der riese I just can't wait to

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.410 
original der riese I just can't wait to
