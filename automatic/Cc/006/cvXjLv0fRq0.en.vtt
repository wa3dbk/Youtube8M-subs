00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
okay this next segment we're going to

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.230 
okay this next segment we're going to
talk<00:00:03.389> about<00:00:03.419> in<00:00:03.899> wall<00:00:04.380> inside<00:00:05.130> wall<00:00:05.460> now<00:00:05.970> for

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
talk about in wall inside wall now for

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.579 
talk about in wall inside wall now for
our<00:00:06.270> mock-up<00:00:06.600> we're<00:00:07.020> going<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.230> do<00:00:07.319> both<00:00:07.529> of

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
our mock-up we're going to do both of

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.190 
our mock-up we're going to do both of
these<00:00:07.890> because<00:00:08.790> at<00:00:09.120> our<00:00:09.179> corner<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.990> side

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
these because at our corner of the side

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.379 
these because at our corner of the side
wall<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.530> enroller<00:00:11.099> are<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.580> meet<00:00:11.759> now

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
wall and enroller are going to meet now

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.589 
wall and enroller are going to meet now
in<00:00:12.719> wall<00:00:13.200> panels<00:00:13.920> end<00:00:14.130> into<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> wall<00:00:15.210> this

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
in wall panels end into a wall this

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.439 
in wall panels end into a wall this
would<00:00:15.780> be<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.020> end<00:00:16.139> bowl<00:00:16.350> side<00:00:16.949> wall<00:00:17.449> panels

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
would be the end bowl side wall panels

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.660 
would be the end bowl side wall panels
on<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.900> side<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.470> wall<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:20.310> would<00:00:20.550> be

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
on the side of the wall this would be

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.970 
on the side of the wall this would be
side<00:00:20.910> wall<00:00:21.240> okay<00:00:22.140> you'll<00:00:22.350> see<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:22.949> have

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
side wall okay you'll see that we have

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.050 
side wall okay you'll see that we have
Zee<00:00:23.580> closures<00:00:24.650> at<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.830> end<00:00:26.010> wall<00:00:26.340> now<00:00:26.849> what

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
Zee closures at the end wall now what

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.019 
Zee closures at the end wall now what
this<00:00:27.240> does<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:28.010> it<00:00:29.010> will<00:00:29.220> make<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.730> weather

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
this does it it will make this weather

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.420 
this does it it will make this weather
tight<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> wind<00:00:31.050> cannot<00:00:31.650> push<00:00:31.920> weather<00:00:32.189> up

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
tight so the wind cannot push weather up

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.240 
tight so the wind cannot push weather up
in<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.390> butyl<00:00:33.870> sealant<00:00:34.350> tape<00:00:34.530> under<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
in we have butyl sealant tape under the

we have butyl sealant tape on top of the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.990 
we have butyl sealant tape on top of the
Z<00:00:38.910> closure<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.020> sides<00:00:40.610> you've<00:00:41.610> got<00:00:41.850> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
Z closure now the sides you've got to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.119 
Z closure now the sides you've got to
use<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> gun<00:00:42.510> grade<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:43.079> have<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> urethane<00:00:43.649> one

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.690 
part urethane sealant that from the back
side<00:00:46.860> you'll<00:00:47.820> call<00:00:48.469> the<00:00:49.469> Z<00:00:49.739> closures<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
side you'll call the Z closures on the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.270 
side you'll call the Z closures on the
sides<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.840> make<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> side<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.680> weather<00:00:52.920> can't

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
sides to make the side so weather can't

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.700 
sides to make the side so weather can't
get<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> sides<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> Z<00:00:54.539> closure<00:00:54.840> now

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
get up in the sides of the Z closure now

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770 
get up in the sides of the Z closure now
when<00:00:56.070> you're<00:00:56.190> anchoring<00:00:56.760> these<00:00:56.969> Z<00:00:57.210> closures

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
when you're anchoring these Z closures

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.260 
when you're anchoring these Z closures
you'll<00:00:58.530> typically<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.070> three<00:00:59.609> screws<00:00:59.969> one

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you'll typically have three screws one

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.240 
you'll typically have three screws one
on<00:01:00.420> either<00:01:00.539> end<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> center<00:01:01.620> now

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
on either end and one in the center now

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.280 
on either end and one in the center now
we<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.910> smaller<00:01:03.329> piece<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:03.960> because

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
we have this smaller piece here because

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.710 
we have this smaller piece here because
we're<00:01:04.530> extending<00:01:04.920> our<00:01:05.220> end<00:01:05.489> wall<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.090> go<00:01:06.240> under

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
we're extending our end wall to go under

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.200 
we're extending our end wall to go under
the<00:01:06.840> sidewall<00:01:07.409> now<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.040> did<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.549> screw<00:01:09.180> this

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the sidewall now we did not screw this

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.270 
the sidewall now we did not screw this
piece<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.900> Z<00:01:10.020> closure<00:01:10.380> down<00:01:10.740> because<00:01:11.100> it's

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
piece of Z closure down because it's

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.580 
piece of Z closure down because it's
sitting<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.090> panel<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.659> again<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.439> do

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
sitting on the panel and again you do

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.950 
sitting on the panel and again you do
not<00:01:13.619> want<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.130> fix<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.670> panels<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.540> okay<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
not want to fix the panels it's okay to

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.440 
not want to fix the panels it's okay to
fix<00:01:16.259> them<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.920> top<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.909> they<00:01:18.030> need<00:01:18.420> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
fix them here is the top so they need to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.749 
fix them here is the top so they need to
be<00:01:18.570> fixed<00:01:18.869> up<00:01:19.080> at<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.320> high<00:01:19.470> side<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.670> do

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
be fixed up at the high side this you do

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.280 
be fixed up at the high side this you do
not<00:01:20.909> want<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.240> fix<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.630> here<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.049> going<00:01:22.200> to

try to move and you're going to have

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.219 
try to move and you're going to have
some<00:01:23.549> buckling<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.060> bending<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.840> what<00:01:25.080> we've

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
some buckling and bending so what we've

done we have our hold down cleat that

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.550 
done we have our hold down cleat that
we've<00:01:28.530> extended<00:01:29.009> down<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.909> top<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.320> Z

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
we've extended down on top of the Z

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.740 
we've extended down on top of the Z
closure<00:01:31.890> with<00:01:32.310> sealant<00:01:32.759> now<00:01:33.240> we've<00:01:33.479> got<00:01:33.720> a

the<00:01:45.960> top<00:01:46.310> will<00:01:47.310> hold<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.729> little<00:01:47.970> small

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
the top will hold this little small

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480 
the top will hold this little small
piece<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.409> remember<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.070> when<00:01:50.340> we

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
piece in now you remember that when we

piece in now you remember that when we
put<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.299> first<00:01:51.960> panel<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.380> had<00:01:52.530> for

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
put this is the first panel we had for

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.010 
put this is the first panel we had for
the<00:01:52.829> valley<00:01:53.040> now<00:01:53.790> remember<00:01:54.540> when<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.689> bent

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the valley now remember when we bent

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.990 
the valley now remember when we bent
this<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.500> that's<00:01:55.950> why<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.369> had<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.759> piece

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
this up that's why we had that piece

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.330 
this up that's why we had that piece
bent<00:01:57.299> up<00:01:57.570> was<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.710> cleat<00:01:59.070> has

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
bent up was so that this cleat has

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.399 
bent up was so that this cleat has
something<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.820> grab<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> hold<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.570> now<00:02:01.140> one

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
something to grab a hold of now one

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.080 
something to grab a hold of now one
thing<00:02:01.590> else<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.950> keep<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.219> mind<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.729> need<00:02:02.880> your

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
thing else to keep in mind you need your

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.520 
thing else to keep in mind you need your
inch<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.479> an<00:02:03.540> eighth<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.719> an<00:02:04.170> inch<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.500> a

quarter so that you can fit this in here

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.190 
quarter so that you can fit this in here
very<00:02:07.110> similar<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.710> when<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.950> did<00:02:08.099> your<00:02:08.220> gable

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
very similar to when you did your gable

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.680 
very similar to when you did your gable
okay<00:02:10.200> now<00:02:10.500> I've<00:02:10.649> got<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.890> piece<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.430> end<00:02:12.390> wall

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
okay now I've got a piece of end wall

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.520 
okay now I've got a piece of end wall
this<00:02:13.200> is

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
this is

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.520 
this is
and<00:02:13.650> while<00:02:13.890> wew<00:02:14.790> one<00:02:15.180> notice<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.810> has<00:02:15.959> an<00:02:16.140> open

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
and while wew one notice it has an open

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.340 
and while wew one notice it has an open
hem<00:02:16.709> on<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.980> bottom<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:18.030> hem<00:02:18.360> hooks<00:02:19.140> over

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
hem on the bottom this hem hooks over

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.090 
hem on the bottom this hem hooks over
the<00:02:19.830> Z<00:02:20.010> closure<00:02:20.900> just<00:02:21.900> like<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.380> now<00:02:22.620> another

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
the Z closure just like this now another

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.280 
the Z closure just like this now another
thing<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.430> want<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.760> remember<00:02:23.910> anytime<00:02:24.870> you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
thing you want to remember anytime you

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.130 
thing you want to remember anytime you
have<00:02:25.470> trim<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:26.130> top<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.730> each<00:02:26.880> other<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.450> as

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
have trim on top of each other just as

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.290 
have trim on top of each other just as
we<00:02:28.290> did<00:02:28.500> with<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.709> valley<00:02:29.069> think<00:02:29.880> about<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
we did with the valley think about the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.650 
we did with the valley think about the
flow<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.569> water<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.360> sidewall<00:02:35.660> you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
flow of water this is the sidewall you

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.640 
flow of water this is the sidewall you
want<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.080> Z<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.620> end<00:02:38.040> wall<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.520> be<00:02:38.640> under<00:02:39.650> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
want the Z the end wall to be under the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.020 
want the Z the end wall to be under the
water<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.069> coming<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.580> way

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
water is coming this way

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.930 
water is coming this way
if<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.600> have<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:43.080> on<00:02:43.350> top<00:02:43.590> can<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.550> see<00:02:44.790> how

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
if you have this on top can you see how

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.970 
if you have this on top can you see how
the<00:02:45.000> water<00:02:45.330> can<00:02:45.600> float<00:02:45.840> under<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.530> piece<00:02:46.800> of

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
the water can float under this piece of

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.130 
the water can float under this piece of
trim<00:02:47.250> always<00:02:48.180> want<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.510> think<00:02:48.720> about<00:02:48.959> how

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
trim always want to think about how

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.870 
trim always want to think about how
you're<00:02:49.380> layering<00:02:49.620> things<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.519> flow<00:02:50.850> of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
you're layering things so the flow of

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.380 
you're layering things so the flow of
water<00:02:51.360> doesn't<00:02:51.780> get<00:02:52.050> under<00:02:52.500> anything<00:02:53.360> okay

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
water doesn't get under anything okay

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.570 
water doesn't get under anything okay
Steve's<00:02:55.140> going<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.440> take<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.860> we're<00:02:56.459> going

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
Steve's going to take that we're going

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.949 
Steve's going to take that we're going
to<00:02:56.640> start<00:02:56.850> with<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.090> end<00:02:57.209> wall<00:02:57.420> trim<00:02:57.660> since

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
to start with the end wall trim since

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.210 
to start with the end wall trim since
that's<00:02:58.110> going<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.350> be<00:02:58.440> on<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.680> bottom

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
that's going to be on the bottom

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.210 
that's going to be on the bottom
now<00:02:59.580> again<00:02:59.819> you've<00:03:00.030> got<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.390> hem<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:01.130> want<00:03:02.130> to

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220

now again you've got the hem you want to
hook<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.580> hem<00:03:03.019> over<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.170> closure<00:03:06.260> just<00:03:07.260> like

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
hook that hem over the closure just like

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.160 
hook that hem over the closure just like
that<00:03:07.830> now<00:03:08.519> we've<00:03:08.760> got<00:03:08.970> our<00:03:09.120> side<00:03:09.390> wall<00:03:09.690> now

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
that now we've got our side wall now

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.509 
that now we've got our side wall now
what<00:03:10.380> we've<00:03:10.560> done<00:03:10.590> what<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.220> would<00:03:11.400> recommend

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
doing is cut you a little 12 inch piece

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.850 
doing is cut you a little 12 inch piece
and<00:03:14.580> figure<00:03:15.360> out<00:03:15.420> how<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.840> want<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.350> bend<00:03:16.620> and

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
and figure out how you want to bend and

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.680 
and figure out how you want to bend and
do<00:03:16.980> some<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.459> each<00:03:17.820> instance<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.570> going

do some of this each instance is going
to<00:03:18.900> be<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.019> little<00:03:19.290> different<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:19.860> you<00:03:19.920> got<00:03:20.130> to

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
to be a little different so you got to

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.220 
to be a little different so you got to
put<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.400> little<00:03:20.519> thought<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.450> best<00:03:21.720> way<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.959> do

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
put a little thought the best way to do

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.949 
put a little thought the best way to do
it<00:03:22.380> is<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.950> just<00:03:23.130> trial<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.579> error<00:03:23.730> now<00:03:24.420> also

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
it is to just trial and error now also

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.620 
it is to just trial and error now also
we<00:03:25.530> have<00:03:25.739> some<00:03:26.400> bends<00:03:26.730> on<00:03:26.880> here<00:03:27.180> what<00:03:27.329> we<00:03:27.450> like
