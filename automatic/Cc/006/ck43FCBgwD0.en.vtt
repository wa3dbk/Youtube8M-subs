another benchmark video have you guys
caught<00:00:05.009> us<00:00:05.130> last<00:00:05.339> week<00:00:05.549> you'll<00:00:05.819> remember<00:00:05.970> we

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
caught us last week you'll remember we

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.730 
caught us last week you'll remember we
did<00:00:06.330> Assassin's<00:00:06.930> Creed<00:00:07.170> unity<00:00:07.200> whose

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
did Assassin's Creed unity whose

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.950 
did Assassin's Creed unity whose
performance<00:00:08.280> was<00:00:08.460> not<00:00:08.910> exactly<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.510> best<00:00:09.690> in

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
performance was not exactly the best in

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.290 
performance was not exactly the best in
fact<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.380> was<00:00:10.590> absolutely<00:00:11.130> abysmal<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.059> today

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
fact it was absolutely abysmal and today

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.820 
fact it was absolutely abysmal and today
we're<00:00:12.780> looking<00:00:12.900> at<00:00:13.139> another<00:00:13.259> game<00:00:13.620> from

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
we're looking at another game from

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.460 
we're looking at another game from
Ubisoft<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.549> time<00:00:14.790> it's<00:00:15.030> Far<00:00:15.330> Cry<00:00:15.599> 4<00:00:16.080> now

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
Ubisoft this time it's Far Cry 4 now

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.870 
Ubisoft this time it's Far Cry 4 now
just<00:00:16.980> like<00:00:17.100> with<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.310> other<00:00:17.460> video<00:00:17.609> we

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
just like with that other video we

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.670 
just like with that other video we
tested<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> game<00:00:18.330> using<00:00:18.779> four<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.170> its<00:00:19.260> preset

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
tested the game using four of its preset

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.740 
tested the game using four of its preset
options<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.189> ran<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:20.580> low<00:00:20.850> medium<00:00:21.119> high<00:00:21.720> and

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
options we ran it on low medium high and

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.779 
options we ran it on low medium high and
ultra<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.800> we're<00:00:23.100> using<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.369> large<00:00:23.519> test

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
ultra and we're using a large test

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.070 
ultra and we're using a large test
system<00:00:24.119> whose<00:00:24.269> specs<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.689> see<00:00:24.930> right

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
system whose specs you can see right

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.009 
system whose specs you can see right
here<00:00:25.140> which<00:00:25.529> include<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.130> GTX<00:00:26.760> 780<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.300> an<00:00:27.599> i7

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
here which include a GTX 780 and an i7

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.740 
here which include a GTX 780 and an i7
4770k<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:29.640> being<00:00:29.880> said<00:00:30.090> let's<00:00:30.510> hit<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
4770k that being said let's hit the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:01:52.170 
4770k that being said let's hit the
benchmarks<00:00:31.199> off

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.180 

so<00:01:52.810> there<00:01:53.080> you<00:01:53.260> have<00:01:53.290> that<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.800> game<00:01:53.980> being

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
so there you have that the game being

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.890 
so there you have that the game being
run<00:01:54.340> on<00:01:54.490> four<00:01:54.820> different<00:01:55.060> settings<00:01:55.450> now<00:01:55.720> as

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
run on four different settings now as

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.080 
run on four different settings now as
you<00:01:56.080> can<00:01:56.170> see<00:01:56.230> not<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.070> best<00:01:57.310> optimization

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
you can see not the best optimization

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.150 
you can see not the best optimization
definitely<00:01:58.540> not<00:01:58.690> as<00:01:58.870> horrible<00:01:59.260> as<00:01:59.650> Assassin's

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
definitely not as horrible as Assassin's

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.830 
definitely not as horrible as Assassin's
Creed<00:02:00.370> unity<00:02:00.580> book<00:02:01.210> could<00:02:01.360> still<00:02:01.570> use<00:02:01.810> some

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
Creed unity book could still use some

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.810 
Creed unity book could still use some
work<00:02:02.050> we<00:02:02.380> were<00:02:02.470> barely<00:02:02.950> hitting<00:02:03.160> 60<00:02:03.580> frames

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
work we were barely hitting 60 frames

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.610 
work we were barely hitting 60 frames
per<00:02:03.880> second<00:02:04.270> when<00:02:04.390> running<00:02:04.570> on<00:02:04.690> ultra<00:02:05.050> during

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
per second when running on ultra during

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.050 
per second when running on ultra during
combat<00:02:06.070> now<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.280> frame<00:02:06.490> rate<00:02:06.700> will<00:02:06.880> be<00:02:06.910> a

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
combat now the frame rate will be a

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.120 
combat now the frame rate will be a
little<00:02:07.300> higher<00:02:07.570> during<00:02:08.020> non-combat<00:02:08.679> segments

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
little higher during non-combat segments

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.710 
little higher during non-combat segments
we're<00:02:09.310> just<00:02:09.429> walking<00:02:09.820> around<00:02:09.910> exploring<00:02:10.600> the

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
we're just walking around exploring the

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.390 
we're just walking around exploring the
world<00:02:10.929> so<00:02:11.410> it's<00:02:11.530> not<00:02:11.680> always<00:02:11.860> gonna<00:02:12.040> be<00:02:12.130> that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
world so it's not always gonna be that

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.640 
world so it's not always gonna be that
low<00:02:12.730> but<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.420> high<00:02:13.570> combat<00:02:13.840> parts<00:02:14.200> are<00:02:14.410> when

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
low but the high combat parts are when

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.050 
low but the high combat parts are when
you're<00:02:14.740> gonna<00:02:14.860> see<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.160> framerate<00:02:15.430> drop<00:02:15.820> so

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
you're gonna see that framerate drop so

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.400 
you're gonna see that framerate drop so
that's<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.600> kind<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.840> performance<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.290> can

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
that's the kind of performance you can

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.230 
that's the kind of performance you can
expect<00:02:17.470> during<00:02:18.310> those<00:02:18.400> really<00:02:18.700> exciting

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
expect during those really exciting

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.330 
expect during those really exciting
moments<00:02:19.750> now<00:02:20.290> as<00:02:20.470> for<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.740> game<00:02:20.890> itself<00:02:20.920> so

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
moments now as for the game itself so

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.640 
moments now as for the game itself so
far<00:02:21.760> it's<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.210> lot<00:02:22.480> like<00:02:22.720> far<00:02:23.020> cry<00:02:23.230> 3<00:02:23.470> but

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
far it's a lot like far cry 3 but

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.990 
far it's a lot like far cry 3 but
definitely<00:02:24.040> with<00:02:24.220> some<00:02:24.400> improvements<00:02:24.880> and

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
definitely with some improvements and
