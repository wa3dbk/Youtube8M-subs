very<00:04:34.250> good<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:35.090> I<00:04:35.270> think<00:04:35.479> the<00:04:35.569> funders<00:04:35.840> they

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.779 
very good and I think the funders they
know<00:04:36.349> they<00:04:36.590> have<00:04:36.800> actually<00:04:37.280> developed<00:04:37.430> some

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
and I wouldn't be surprised if he went

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.820 
and I wouldn't be surprised if he went
on<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.020> got<00:04:42.050> moved<00:04:42.410> at<00:04:42.590> a<00:04:42.620> higher<00:04:42.800> level

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.630
