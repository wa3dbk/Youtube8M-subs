00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.000 
dirt road and now we're gonna see here
in<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> second<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.260> players<00:01:13.530> are<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
in a second the players are going to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.499 
in a second the players are going to
start<00:01:14.220> spawning<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.850> opposite<00:01:15.330> lane

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
start spawning on the opposite lane

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.300 
start spawning on the opposite lane
where<00:01:15.840> phase<00:01:16.080> was<00:01:16.380> spawning<00:01:16.710> they're<00:01:17.159> going

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
where phase was spawning they're going

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.560 
where phase was spawning they're going
to<00:01:17.400> rotate<00:01:17.580> through<00:01:17.850> middle<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.270> get<00:01:18.390> through

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
to rotate through middle and get through

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.420 
to rotate through middle and get through
blue<00:01:18.780> room<00:01:19.049> or<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.590> you've<00:01:19.680> grown<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.920> 3-story

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
blue room or that you've grown a 3-story

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.340 
blue room or that you've grown a 3-story
on<00:01:20.580> s3<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.330> trying<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> control<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.080> next

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
on s3 and trying to control this next

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.200 
on s3 and trying to control this next
hard<00:01:22.560> point<00:01:22.770> as<00:01:23.430> space<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.820> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> need

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
hard point as space is going to need

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.570 
hard point as space is going to need
every<00:01:24.479> single<00:01:24.780> second<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.710> hill<00:01:25.979> now

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
every single second on this hill now

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.950 
every single second on this hill now
this<00:01:27.000> problem<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.600> hill<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.869> that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
this problem with this hill is that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.149 
this problem with this hill is that
there<00:01:28.080> are<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.350> many<00:01:28.439> different<00:01:28.740> entry<00:01:28.920> points

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
there are so many different entry points

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.109 
there are so many different entry points
there<00:01:29.280> are<00:01:29.340> at<00:01:29.400> least<00:01:29.430> four<00:01:29.759> different<00:01:29.939> ways

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
there are at least four different ways

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.429 
there are at least four different ways
to<00:01:30.299> get<00:01:30.390> into<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.720> far<00:01:30.900> point<00:01:31.110> even<00:01:31.290> more

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
to get into this far point even more

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.649 
to get into this far point even more
angles<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.009> throw<00:01:32.189> grenades<00:01:32.310> into<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.329> so

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
angles to throw grenades into it and so

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.060 
angles to throw grenades into it and so
that<00:01:33.840> means<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.229> outside<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> hill<00:01:34.979> is

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
that means that outside of the hill is

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.710 
that means that outside of the hill is
going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.430> need<00:01:35.579> need<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.000> be<00:01:36.090> some<00:01:36.299> superb

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
going to be need need to be some superb

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.240 
going to be need need to be some superb
sling<00:01:37.049> through<00:01:37.500> some<00:01:37.650> amazing<00:01:38.070> power

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250

piece coming out of slasher however that

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.270 
piece coming out of slasher however that
the<00:01:48.960> team<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.140> still<00:01:49.320> spawning<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.040> there

the team is still spawning in and there
are<00:01:50.310> still<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.640> many<00:01:50.670> different<00:01:51.030> angles<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.299> can

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
are still so many different angles I can

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.060 
are still so many different angles I can
come<00:01:51.570> from<00:01:51.720> slasher<00:01:52.380> might<00:01:52.590> not<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.860> able<00:01:53.009> to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
come from slasher might not be able to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
golf to reload in a situation like that

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.920 
golf to reload in a situation like that
it<00:01:56.969> might<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.210> been<00:01:57.299> more<00:01:57.390> beneficial<00:01:57.780> for

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it might have been more beneficial for

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.959 
it might have been more beneficial for
them<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.170> all<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.469> ASM<00:01:58.890> ones<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
them to all have ASM ones but in the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.370 
them to all have ASM ones but in the
time<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> time<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.170> really

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
time and the time like this is really

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.359 
time and the time like this is really
not<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.530> whole<00:02:01.680> lot<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.860> time<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.189> switch

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
not a whole lot of time to switch

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.740 
not a whole lot of time to switch
classes<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.939> make<00:02:03.060> split<00:02:03.329> decisions<00:02:03.659> like

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
classes and make split decisions like

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.300 
classes and make split decisions like
that<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.170> players<00:02:04.409> are<00:02:04.860> still<00:02:05.100> holding

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
that but the players are still holding

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.109 
that but the players are still holding
it<00:02:05.399> down<00:02:05.549> however

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
it down however

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.089 
it down however
aware<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.960> going<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> come<00:02:07.500> through<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.920> take

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
aware is going to come through and take

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.499 
aware is going to come through and take
this<00:02:08.250> for<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.550> hard<00:02:08.789> point<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.090> teach<00:02:09.300> comes

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
this for this hard point as teach comes

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.150 
this for this hard point as teach comes
in<00:02:09.599> with<00:02:09.720> some<00:02:09.840> nice<00:02:09.989> kills<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.560> great

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
in with some nice kills and great

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.680 
in with some nice kills and great
competition<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.239> heart

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
competition in the heart

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.330 
competition in the heart
had<00:02:13.350> faceplate<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> little<00:02:14.130> bit<00:02:14.220> more

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
had faceplate a little bit more

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.500 
had faceplate a little bit more
aggressively<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:14.880> blocked<00:02:15.150> those<00:02:15.270> water

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
aggressively and blocked those water

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.700 
aggressively and blocked those water
corresponds<00:02:16.020> they<00:02:16.200> probably<00:02:16.440> would<00:02:16.680> have

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
corresponds they probably would have

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.290 
corresponds they probably would have
come<00:02:16.890> out<00:02:17.040> on<00:02:17.160> top<00:02:17.310> however<00:02:17.580> aware<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.150> gonna

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
come out on top however aware is gonna

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.930 
come out on top however aware is gonna
take<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.660> map
