choose any random tool and any random

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.359 
choose any random tool and any random
tear<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.470> could<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.649> anywhere<00:01:53.070> from<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
tear so it could be anywhere from a

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.420 
tear so it could be anywhere from a
stone<00:01:54.060> from<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.540> stone<00:01:54.810> shovel<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> diamond

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.539 
stone from a stone shovel to a diamond
sword<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.170> if<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.530> tier<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.280> tool<00:01:59.520> will

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
sword and if the tier and the tool will

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.969 
sword and if the tier and the tool will
decide<00:02:00.270> how<00:02:00.540> much<00:02:00.719> damage<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.380> how<00:02:01.560> much<00:02:01.710> HP

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
decide how much damage and how much HP

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.190 
decide how much damage and how much HP
it<00:02:02.460> will<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.479> once<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.810> kill<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.170> you

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
it will have but once you kill it you

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.980 
it will have but once you kill it you
will<00:02:04.619> actually<00:02:04.860> receive<00:02:05.520> whatever<00:02:06.210> item<00:02:06.840> that

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
item and that item will determine what

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.020 
item and that item will determine what
color<00:04:43.840> it<00:04:44.140> is<00:04:44.170> and<00:04:44.500> what<00:04:44.710> its<00:04:44.860> drop<00:04:45.100> will<00:04:45.280> be<00:04:45.310> so

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
color it is and what its drop will be so

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.000 
color it is and what its drop will be so
since<00:04:46.270> this<00:04:46.420> one<00:04:46.660> is<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:46.900> snowball<00:04:47.650> it<00:04:47.860> will

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
since this one is a snowball it will

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.090 
since this one is a snowball it will
drop<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.430> snowball<00:04:48.910> and<00:04:49.060> it<00:04:49.750> is<00:04:50.020> white<00:04:50.440> so<00:04:50.860> it

drop a snowball and it is white so it

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.280 
drop a snowball and it is white so it
takes<00:04:51.310> basically<00:04:51.610> on<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.420> color<00:04:52.630> of<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:52.990> item
