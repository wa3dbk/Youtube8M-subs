00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.709
 Hello folks on the thunderous success of biology I've heard of 

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:09.160
 For you the subject is current polemic of biology 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.490
 what is it about stem cells what are stem cells are cells 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.300
 undifferentiated 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.190
 with a high proliferative rate and one of the main characteristics of the season 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.730
 think they have the ability to 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.630
 cells and tissues of the human body 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.580
 then it is to cure some diseases like diabetes evil parkinson 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.800
 stem cells are present in the early 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.269
 fetal develop 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:34.870
 as that was not enough 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.640
 the wing are also present in the body of the individual 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.450
 how planned the nod in the skin in the intestine 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.489
 how are stem cells 2 billion natal 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.730
 in assisted reproduction clinics the female gamete the ovule will be 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.130
 then followed by the male sperm goal and will be 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.060
 formed the first cell of a new server known as xe voto 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.230
 the Czech fall / marketing torelli and in the divisions 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.399
 methodical division and wages 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.190
 until it reached a stage of development known as ball 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.090
 after rebellion it looks like a blackberry 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.940
 at that time the cells that differentiate wine are called 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.830
 stem cells 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.960
 they are the sizeable and impotent trumps because they can form 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.600
 any tissue cell of the subject's body 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.280
 after this stage of tassel the embryo reaches the state known as 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.670
 blastocyst at that time the embryo is formed by day 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.780
 two regions 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.450
 but important the layer of cells that surrounds it involves a structure called 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.479
 which will give birth to the fetal membranes and this layer of 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.170
 internal cells is known as cybele the classic that will give rise to 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.630
 an embryo proper at that time is that the scientists then go 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.250
 removing these cells is impossible to carry 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.480
 is my lab put a petri dish 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.869
 as a means of trentino 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.850
 and these are starting to proliferate 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.850
 this action but later 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.030
 with specific substances they can be differentiated which is greater 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.409
 muscle seals 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.569
 soon the whites or neurons 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.319
 that is 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.239
 they can differentiate themselves in different tissues so they can cure diseases 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.600
 a problem he faces from this type of technique 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.899
 is here 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:23.259
 here but it is a stage of embryonic development so we have death 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:24.030
 of the embryo 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.550
 in addition to what recommences the embryo it is then resulting from a fertilization 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.830
 in vitro 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.319
 to cells present 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.920
 not always they are genetically different from the sold cell that goes 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.379
 receive them so they will certainly be rejected there is another technique of 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.379
 obtaining 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.349
 which consists of the transfer on the board 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.680
 in this method 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.640
 the researchers predict a new suitor by the trainer ie the 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.639
 core of the new one is removed 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.639
 they will remove the cells from the body of the individual who 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.519
 wish 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.719
 submitting this technique with one showed a little 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.290
 and transfers the somatic cell nucleus to a new 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:08.259
 from 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:11.459
 specific substances and specific factors 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.459
 Then the pressure starts to divide and it becomes the first 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.880
 stage of development in which she lived or is to do today 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.470
 the embryo is similar a delay after I was embryo take to the stage of 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.060
 blastocyst and at that time these cells in which the inner layer of this 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.950
 masses and a bible the classic 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.540
 are withdrawn 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.209
 and taken to the laboratory with specific substances they are 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.770
 will proliferate and then they can differentiate and form different types of 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.509
 we descended from the indebtedness 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:44.509
 in this technique as the somatic cell 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.859
 it has been withdrawn from the individual, then there is no question of 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:49.670
 rejection 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.870
 but there is still the question of the death of the embryo because I like it this way 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.200
 represents a phase 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.850
 of the embryonic development of dc in developing dvd
