to whatever firmware you're on right now
is<00:01:08.000> in<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.119> case<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.510> four<00:01:09.689> point<00:01:09.900> oh<00:01:10.020> but

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
is in my case it's four point oh but

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.770 
is in my case it's four point oh but
there<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.100> catch<00:01:11.460> now<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.659> do

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
there is one catch now you have to do

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.690 
there is one catch now you have to do
this<00:01:12.900> very<00:01:13.260> very<00:01:13.470> quickly<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:14.070> all<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.520> takes

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
this very very quickly as all it takes

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.520 
this very very quickly as all it takes
is<00:01:14.850> Apple<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.330> stop<00:01:15.600> signing<00:01:15.930> four<00:01:16.229> point<00:01:16.439> oh

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
is Apple to stop signing four point oh

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.840 
is Apple to stop signing four point oh
and<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.830> will<00:01:17.009> probably<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.490> doing<00:01:17.610> that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and I will probably be doing that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.880 
and I will probably be doing that
anytime<00:01:18.180> now<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.900> then<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.740> then<00:01:19.770> you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
anytime now and then you and then you

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.800 
anytime now and then you and then you
will<00:01:20.369> not<00:01:20.460> be<00:01:20.610> able<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:21.000> your<00:01:21.180> SHSH<00:01:21.600> blobs

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
