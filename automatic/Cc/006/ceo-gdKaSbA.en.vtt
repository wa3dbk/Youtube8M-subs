give<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.860> us<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.460> that's<00:02:51.150> that's<00:02:51.390> really

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
give it to us so that's that's really

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.970 
give it to us so that's that's really
great<00:02:51.900> because<00:02:52.170> they<00:02:52.380> are<00:02:52.530> they<00:02:52.680> are<00:02:52.800> actually

of<00:03:10.170> technical<00:03:10.500> stuff<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.130> i<00:03:11.400> I'm<00:03:11.940> i<00:03:12.330> believe<00:03:13.080> the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
of technical stuff I i I'm i believe the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.070 
of technical stuff I i I'm i believe the
game<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.770> ready<00:03:14.010> because<00:03:14.280> they<00:03:14.580> had<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.850> ready

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
media press release so I believe the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.860 
media press release so I believe the
game<00:03:23.340> itself<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.910> ready<00:03:24.090> for<00:03:24.390> beta<00:03:24.510> but<00:03:24.810> i

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
game itself is ready for beta but i

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.690 
game itself is ready for beta but i
don't<00:03:24.930> think<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.530> infrastructure<00:03:26.280> in<00:03:26.670> terms

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
don't think the infrastructure in terms

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.400 
don't think the infrastructure in terms
of<00:03:27.060> servers<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.630> all<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.870> technical<00:03:28.260> stuff

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
of servers and all that technical stuff

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.960 
of servers and all that technical stuff
is<00:03:28.800> ready<00:03:29.160> so<00:03:29.520> that's<00:03:29.730> just<00:03:29.790> my<00:03:30.000> opinion<00:03:30.470> but

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
is ready so that's just my opinion but

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.630 
is ready so that's just my opinion but
beyond<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.090> there<00:03:33.450> is<00:03:33.600> one<00:03:33.780> more<00:03:33.959> thing<00:03:34.020> uh

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.340 
beyond that there is one more thing uh
