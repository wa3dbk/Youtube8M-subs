is the speeder board this was originally

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.060 
is the speeder board this was originally
included<00:01:40.659> with<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.960> Quinlan<00:01:41.409> vos<00:01:41.440> figure

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
included with the Quinlan vos figure

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.830 
included with the Quinlan vos figure
that's<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.580> reason<00:01:42.850> why<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.090> has<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.420> lights

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
that's the reason why it has the lights

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.330 
that's the reason why it has the lights
every<00:01:44.110> clip<00:01:44.320> up<00:01:44.590> here<00:01:44.770> on<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:44.920> top<00:01:45.130> but

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
every clip up here on the top but

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.310 
every clip up here on the top but
basically<00:01:45.970> all<00:01:46.090> this<00:01:46.360> is<00:01:46.510> is<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.960> made<00:01:47.290> up

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
basically all this is is a made up

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.200 
basically all this is is a made up
accessory<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.190> doesn't<00:01:48.520> actually<00:01:48.670> appear<00:01:49.090> in

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
accessory it doesn't actually appear in

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.000 
accessory it doesn't actually appear in
the<00:01:49.299> Clone<00:01:49.450> Wars<00:01:49.479> series<00:01:49.690> at<00:01:50.020> all<00:01:50.170> it's<00:01:50.830> just

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
you have an extra or something like that

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.960

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
but that is the speeder board right

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:16.380 
but that is the speeder board right
there

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
there

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.060 
there
also<00:02:17.390> there's<00:02:17.600> this<00:02:17.750> other<00:02:17.960> accessory<00:02:18.500> when<00:02:19.010> I

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
also there's this other accessory when I

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.860 
also there's this other accessory when I
open<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.490> figure<00:02:19.760> up<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.150> this<00:02:20.240> fell<00:02:20.480> out<00:02:20.630> I

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
open the figure up and this fell out I

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.560 
open the figure up and this fell out I
had<00:02:21.080> absolutely<00:02:21.620> no<00:02:22.010> clue<00:02:22.190> what<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.550> was<00:02:22.760> when

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
had absolutely no clue what it was when

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.610 
had absolutely no clue what it was when
you<00:02:23.660> look<00:02:23.840> at<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.020> figure<00:02:24.290> through<00:02:24.530> the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
you look at the figure through the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.230 
you look at the figure through the
packaging<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.040> actually<00:02:25.430> can't<00:02:25.640> see<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:25.970> so

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
packaging you actually can't see this so

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.700 
packaging you actually can't see this so
it's<00:02:26.480> quite<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.750> surprise<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.170> me<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.650> I

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
it's quite a surprise to me and I

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.260 
it's quite a surprise to me and I
couldn't<00:02:27.950> really<00:02:28.160> figure<00:02:28.610> out<00:02:28.820> what<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.120> was

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
couldn't really figure out what it was

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.150 
couldn't really figure out what it was
so<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:29.960> had<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.140> go<00:02:30.230> look<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:30.530> up<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.890> actually

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
so I had to go look it up and actually

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.730 
so I had to go look it up and actually
what<00:02:31.490> this<00:02:31.640> is<00:02:31.820> is<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.090> gun<00:02:32.600> rack<00:02:32.780> which<00:02:33.500> was

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
what this is is a gun rack which was

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.250 
what this is is a gun rack which was
released<00:02:34.130> back<00:02:34.340> in<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.730> believe<00:02:34.930> 1999<00:02:35.930> during

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
released back in I believe 1999 during

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.160 
released back in I believe 1999 during
the<00:02:36.500> power<00:02:36.800> of<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.010> force<00:02:37.280> line<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:39.080> was

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
the power of the force line and it was

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.140 
the power of the force line and it was
packed<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.590> with<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.860> stormtrooper<00:02:40.459> multipack

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
packed in with a stormtrooper multipack

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.310 
packed in with a stormtrooper multipack
which<00:02:41.390> had<00:02:41.570> a<00:02:41.600> bunch<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:42.080> different

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
which had a bunch of different

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.800 
which had a bunch of different
accessories<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:43.190> this<00:02:43.340> was<00:02:43.580> one<00:02:43.820> of<00:02:43.850> them<00:02:44.060> so

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
accessories and this was one of them so

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.600 
accessories and this was one of them so
basically<00:02:45.170> all<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:45.590> is<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.040> little<00:02:46.340> stand

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
basically all it is is a little stand

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.240 
basically all it is is a little stand
for<00:02:46.850> extra<00:02:47.330> rifles<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.410> surprisingly<00:02:49.070> it

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
for extra rifles and surprisingly it

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.650 
for extra rifles and surprisingly it
actually<00:02:49.580> works<00:02:49.760> pretty<00:02:50.000> well<00:02:50.150> for<00:02:50.570> the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
actually works pretty well for the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.630 
actually works pretty well for the
modern<00:02:51.080> Clone<00:02:51.290> Wars<00:02:51.320> line<00:02:51.709> especially<00:02:52.100> with

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
modern Clone Wars line especially with

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.360 
modern Clone Wars line especially with
these<00:02:52.790> DC<00:02:53.390> 15<00:02:53.780> blaster<00:02:54.200> rifles<00:02:54.500> right<00:02:54.680> here<00:02:54.860> so

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
these DC 15 blaster rifles right here so

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.550 
these DC 15 blaster rifles right here so
you<00:02:55.430> do<00:02:55.700> get<00:02:55.850> an<00:02:55.970> extra<00:02:56.120> DC<00:02:56.720> 15<00:02:57.080> right<00:02:57.320> here<00:02:57.350> as

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
you do get an extra DC 15 right here as

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.470 
you do get an extra DC 15 right here as
you<00:02:57.590> can<00:02:57.739> see<00:02:57.860> nothing<00:02:58.730> really<00:02:58.760> too<00:02:59.060> special

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
you can see nothing really too special

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.720 
you can see nothing really too special
it's<00:02:59.690> just<00:02:59.780> molded<00:03:00.200> in<00:03:00.320> a<00:03:00.470> grey<00:03:01.010> plastic<00:03:01.310> and

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
it's just molded in a grey plastic and

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.310 
it's just molded in a grey plastic and
it<00:03:01.850> does<00:03:02.000> have<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.270> extended<00:03:02.720> stalk<00:03:03.020> and

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
it does have the extended stalk and

on<00:04:39.229> the<00:04:39.379> back<00:04:39.710> little<00:04:40.099> bar<00:04:40.400> of<00:04:40.729> the<00:04:40.970> helmet

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
on the back little bar of the helmet

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.270 
on the back little bar of the helmet
there<00:04:41.509> and<00:04:41.840> it's<00:04:42.319> just<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.620> lot<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:42.830> cool<00:04:43.039> little

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
there and it's just a lot of cool little

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.219 
there and it's just a lot of cool little
decals<00:04:43.789> painted<00:04:44.270> onto<00:04:44.509> the<00:04:44.629> helmet<00:04:44.780> itself

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
decals painted onto the helmet itself

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.649 
decals painted onto the helmet itself
and<00:04:45.409> it<00:04:45.470> makes<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:45.800> look<00:04:45.830> really<00:04:46.370> unique<00:04:46.669> but

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:47.659 
and it makes it look really unique but

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.180 
and it makes it look really unique but
pretty<00:04:47.990> much<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.379> rest<00:04:48.560> of<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.710> figure<00:04:48.860> is

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
pretty much the rest of the figure is

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.920 
pretty much the rest of the figure is
exactly<00:04:49.729> the<00:04:49.940> same<00:04:50.090> as<00:04:50.300> all<00:04:50.449> the<00:04:50.569> other<00:04:50.720> are

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
exactly the same as all the other are

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.960 
exactly the same as all the other are
troopers<00:04:51.289> same<00:04:52.009> articulation<00:04:52.310> same

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
troopers same articulation same

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.969 
troopers same articulation same
detailing<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:53.990> same<00:04:54.199> paint<00:04:54.470> everything

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
detailing the same paint everything

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.189 
detailing the same paint everything
that's<00:04:55.879> pretty<00:04:56.060> much<00:04:56.180> it<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.539> it<00:04:56.659> so<00:04:56.900> the

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
that's pretty much it to it so the

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.869 
that's pretty much it to it so the
articulation<00:04:57.830> for<00:04:57.949> this<00:04:58.099> figure<00:04:58.280> is<00:04:58.520> a<00:04:58.639> ball

00:04:58.869 --> 00:04:58.879 
articulation for this figure is a ball

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.480 
articulation for this figure is a ball
2010<00:04:59.389> ball<00:04:59.960> hand<00:05:00.199> shoulders<00:05:00.590> ball<00:05:00.919> and<00:05:01.129> elbows

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
2010 ball hand shoulders ball and elbows

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.480 
2010 ball hand shoulders ball and elbows
Ballinger<00:05:02.210> it's<00:05:02.389> ball<00:05:02.870> jointed<00:05:03.229> waist<00:05:03.530> his

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
Ballinger it's ball jointed waist his

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.700 
Ballinger it's ball jointed waist his
weights<00:05:05.030> are<00:05:05.300> also<00:05:05.449> on<00:05:05.840> a<00:05:05.870> ball<00:05:06.169> hinge<00:05:06.440> joint

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
weights are also on a ball hinge joint

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.890 
weights are also on a ball hinge joint
which<00:05:06.919> adds<00:05:07.340> a<00:05:07.669> lot<00:05:07.909> of<00:05:08.030> flexibility<00:05:08.599> to<00:05:08.690> the

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
which adds a lot of flexibility to the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.260 
which adds a lot of flexibility to the
bigger<00:05:09.110> so<00:05:09.680> you<00:05:09.710> can<00:05:09.830> easily<00:05:10.039> get<00:05:10.370> him<00:05:10.490> to<00:05:10.610> set

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
bigger so you can easily get him to set

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.510 
bigger so you can easily get him to set
on<00:05:11.389> a<00:05:11.419> har<00:05:11.990> tee<00:05:12.259> or<00:05:12.530> on<00:05:12.770> a<00:05:12.800> speeder<00:05:13.159> bike<00:05:13.370> or

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
on a har tee or on a speeder bike or

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.580 
on a har tee or on a speeder bike or
something<00:05:13.819> like<00:05:13.940> that<00:05:14.080> but<00:05:15.080> he<00:05:15.229> does<00:05:15.409> have

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
something like that but he does have

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.860 
something like that but he does have
balconies<00:05:15.889> and<00:05:16.639> he<00:05:16.940> does<00:05:17.120> have<00:05:17.360> ball<00:05:17.599> hinge

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
balconies and he does have ball hinge

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.649 
balconies and he does have ball hinge
ankles<00:05:18.289> so<00:05:18.919> this<00:05:19.129> is<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.340> super<00:05:19.759> articulated

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
ankles so this is a super articulated

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.809 
ankles so this is a super articulated
clone<00:05:20.840> trooper<00:05:21.169> so<00:05:21.800> pretty<00:05:22.099> cool<00:05:22.250> our<00:05:22.460> trooper

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:22.819 
clone trooper so pretty cool our trooper

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:24.369 
clone trooper so pretty cool our trooper
actually<00:05:23.180> I<00:05:23.210> really<00:05:23.539> like<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.810> design<00:05:24.110> on<00:05:24.139> the

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:24.379 
actually I really like the design on the

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:26.140 
actually I really like the design on the
helmet<00:05:24.680> and<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:25.039> marine<00:05:25.430> stripes<00:05:25.699> going<00:05:26.000> down

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
helmet and the marine stripes going down

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.490 
helmet and the marine stripes going down
and<00:05:26.330> the<00:05:26.389> arms<00:05:26.629> really<00:05:26.870> blend<00:05:27.169> in<00:05:27.319> well

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
and the arms really blend in well

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.990 
and the arms really blend in well
actually<00:05:27.740> even<00:05:28.310> though<00:05:28.520> that<00:05:28.729> it<00:05:28.849> is

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
actually even though that it is

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.409 
actually even though that it is
inaccurate<00:05:29.419> but<00:05:29.810> you<00:05:30.710> do<00:05:30.889> get<00:05:31.099> a<00:05:31.310> DC<00:05:31.669> 15<00:05:32.150> well

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
inaccurate but you do get a DC 15 well

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.809 
inaccurate but you do get a DC 15 well
actually<00:05:32.539> two<00:05:32.930> DC<00:05:33.349> 15<00:05:33.710> rifles<00:05:34.130> the<00:05:34.430> gun<00:05:34.639> rack

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
actually two DC 15 rifles the gun rack

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.670 
actually two DC 15 rifles the gun rack
which<00:05:35.060> I<00:05:35.240> was<00:05:35.360> quite<00:05:35.630> surprised<00:05:36.080> about<00:05:36.259> an

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
which I was quite surprised about an

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.860 
which I was quite surprised about an
extra<00:05:37.370> speeder<00:05:37.729> board<00:05:37.969> right<00:05:38.120> there<00:05:38.300> as<00:05:38.569> well

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
extra speeder board right there as well

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.010 
extra speeder board right there as well
as<00:05:38.990> the<00:05:39.139> cores<00:05:39.590> pack<00:05:39.830> ins<00:05:40.039> so<00:05:40.810> anyways<00:05:41.810> that's

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
as the cores pack ins so anyways that's

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.269 
as the cores pack ins so anyways that's
pretty<00:05:42.229> much<00:05:42.349> it<00:05:42.529> for<00:05:42.650> the<00:05:42.770> Camino<00:05:43.130> arc

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:43.279 
pretty much it for the Camino arc

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:44.680 
pretty much it for the Camino arc
trooper<00:05:43.639> figure<00:05:43.880> I<00:05:44.150> would<00:05:44.330> definitely

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
trooper figure I would definitely

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.149 
trooper figure I would definitely
recommend<00:05:44.840> you<00:05:45.169> pick<00:05:45.289> this<00:05:45.409> up<00:05:45.590> you<00:05:45.650> get<00:05:45.889> a<00:05:45.919> lot

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
recommend you pick this up you get a lot

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.890 
recommend you pick this up you get a lot
of<00:05:46.250> cool<00:05:46.370> accessories<00:05:46.880> with<00:05:47.060> them<00:05:47.240> and<00:05:47.479> the

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
of cool accessories with them and the

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.570 
of cool accessories with them and the
figure<00:05:48.139> is<00:05:48.169> actually<00:05:48.440> pretty<00:05:48.770> unique<00:05:49.130> so<00:05:49.370> it's

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
figure is actually pretty unique so it's

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.339 
figure is actually pretty unique so it's
not<00:05:49.759> like<00:05:50.300> all<00:05:50.539> the<00:05:50.690> other<00:05:50.810> troopers<00:05:51.319> that
