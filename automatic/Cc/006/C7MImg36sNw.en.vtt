00:00:07.543 --> 00:00:09.795
The main problem in here is the windows.

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:11.464
They are rotten, so it is always cold :(

00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:14.627
Fireplace is very bad

00:00:14.627 --> 00:00:19.965
When we light it up, everything cracked

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:25.723
Gratings are also broken...

00:00:26.724 --> 00:00:28.059
We have a gas cylinder..

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:29.727
But no gas...

00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:32.726
We are paying the debts right now. We have a lot of them

00:00:34.228 --> 00:00:36.271
We are sleeping right here

00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:39.858
The bed legs are made of wood logs...

00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:45.989
It would be really nice if someone could get me some gravel...

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.658
At least one truck would be good.

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:49.257
(The reporter) You mentioned that you would also need some wood?

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:50.299
Well...

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:54.679
I have some wood, but there's nobody that would chop them for me.

00:00:56.013 --> 00:00:58.057
The roof is full of holes..

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:01.143
If it's a springtime, the water will go through the 
 holes into the room and will make a...

00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:04.689
Swamp

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:08.401
It's like a bathroom over here

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:09.569
There is a boiler...

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.640
But it doesn't have an engine

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.268
(The reporter) Those chickens are looking really good right there

00:01:14.268 --> 00:01:15.769
There were 9 of them.

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:19.356
All died...

00:01:19.356 --> 00:01:23.902
We find some carrots there and here. We wash and 
 pale them and then we make some soup...

00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:27.281
All food that we have...

00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:29.575
Pretty much nothing...

00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:33.412
(The reporter) How much money do you have left for next few days?

00:01:33.412 --> 00:01:37.457
Not even a penny...

00:01:39.543 --> 00:01:47.110
We are planning to go begging money with my wife tomorrow..

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:53.490
If we leave this house alone with no protection, we easily might get robbed.

00:01:53.487 --> 00:01:55.070
I have this guy for protection.

00:01:55.068 --> 00:01:56.820
(Security guy) I'm always on duty!

00:02:03.078 --> 00:02:06.540
Main actor...

00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:10.790
Camera and editing by... (myself)

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:15.800
Thanks for watching
