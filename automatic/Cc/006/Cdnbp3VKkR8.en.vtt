00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.570
 how to think in these 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.760

 The time in the park is similar to us too 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.090
 only with the difference that one

 rather data volume the British back it was meant for me 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.910
 mobile phone 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.670

 To test this data mobile phone can interpret this information 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.890

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.820
 for example 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.949
 in the US 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.499
 at all a clique 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:06.689
 it would be exactly this address 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.689

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:28.499
 where I love to bring this information though 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.009
 can i do the appropriate 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:34.129
 but Georg makes relevant information available to consumers 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:37.760
 the use cases are the Berlin far way 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.840
 I do not think so yet 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.309
 everything unimportant 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:43.539
 surely the consumers

 Felix Biermann 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.759
 Experimentation and to find out 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:51.679
 but we also have in them typical for newspapers and we have them 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:53.600

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.440
 on the one hand there is such a thing to produce and to cover a boom with us 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.540
 At the raffle you could get a small one 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.939

 Generate percent via an SMS 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.590
 the same future this tool dengue fever so we should have the 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.949
 Altitude was rarely such a great goal 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.809

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.169
 he was becoming a mass medium becoming a mass phenomenon 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.099

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:02.990
 new technologies to do that as well 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.990
 Example, for example, ranked third 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.639

 There is more for that 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:35.349
