00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:06.973
Yasuhiro Kido

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:11.661
-- Looking back at the fight?

00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:22.068
The punches really did some damage.

00:00:22.068 --> 00:00:27.636
My head hurt, but I thought if I was aggressive I could still win.

00:00:27.636 --> 00:00:30.259
-- Your impression of Ryuji?

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:43.982
I thought if I put the pressure on in the third, round I could win, but it didn't happen.

00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:52.395
-- Because of the low-blow, did you lose focus at all?

00:00:52.395 --> 00:01:02.493
It wasn't a good feeling, but I got over it.

00:01:02.493 --> 00:01:09.533
Then I really tried to put the pressure on.

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:16.277
-- Masato said that you are too nice and you should have put even more pressure on.

00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:22.198
I didn't feel guilty or anything. I'm not that nice.

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:31.990
-- Did you agree with the decision?

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.901
I thought it would be a draw.

00:01:36.901 --> 00:02:06.917
We were even in the second and I thought I did well in the third. I thought, "what?"

00:02:06.917 --> 00:02:09.580
-- Has it sunk in that you've lost?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.796
Yes. Sorry, but I'm not a good loser.

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:26.232
-- Would you like to fight Ryuji again?

00:02:26.232 --> 00:02:33.880
I would. The damage I did to him affected him in the semi-final and he lost.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:50.311
It feels strange. I don't know how to handle the feeling that I lost.

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:58.454
-- This is the second year you've lost in the first round.

00:02:58.454 --> 00:03:07.002
I wasn't in good condition last year.

00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:12.785
I realized that Ryuji is really strong. I was hoping for an extra round.

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:37.995
Hmmm. I wonder what happened.
