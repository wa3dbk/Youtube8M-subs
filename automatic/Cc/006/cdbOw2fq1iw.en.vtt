 hi people thanks for turning on 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.540
 one plus one against samsung galaxy note 4 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.730
 The city on the two special 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.160
 backside we have this i say here 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.170
 time light paper paper at one 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.210
 platform very getting used to 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.039
 the imitation leather that has 4 touch everywhere 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.590
 we know in a similar form already from 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.119
 North three have a dual led in one 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.830
 Platform lettering and of course 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.660
 some mark and note 4 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.090
 a big protruding camera 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.730
 including a hair trade scanner to the pulse 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.110
 measure and a photo led underneath the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.700
 samsung lettering and unfortunately one 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.399
 speakers why on the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.410
 Backside landrats of secondary microphone 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.480
 and 3.5 mm jack 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.250
 With this we continue with the note 4 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.950
 is a bit pure you are 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.140
 already to microphone and infrared vices 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.149
 on the right side we find each one 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.309
 the 1 power button and down two mono 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.449
 Speaker microphone and micro usb 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.000
 connection 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.090
 because aspen a microphone and the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.530
 micro-usb connection at note 4 on the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.300
 left side there are still each 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.129
 the volume rocker and the one pass 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.740
 still want the bay here then comes 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.659
 of course, the micro SIM card purely good 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.250
 what else is there to see here 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.200
 small size comparison on the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.250
 back both really take each other 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.500
 not much 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.090
 So again looked like from above 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.670
 the shapes are and then we look at something 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.590
 is the front so there was one pass was the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.680
 earpiece for example, of course, a 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.119
 front camera and also there are still 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.579
 not and proximity sensor one 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.619
 Notification led at samsung 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.720
 galaxy note 4 notification led 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.970
 sensors earpiece and of course 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.360
 samsung lettering as well as one 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.310
 front camera good we look again 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.200
 The bottom of the buttons is either 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.369
 us with buttons or electronic at 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.079
 We can choose montafon ourselves and 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.670
 if we change over to note 4 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.770
 a physical home button and two 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.810
 namely, all electronic buttons 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.640
 Active applications and that has become one 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.040
 little something the eu did in ancient times 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.930
 was overhauled anyway and then 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.420
 but below is the left 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.430
 back button and that's it 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.009
 that was my short comparison 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.009
 thank you for your time is good
