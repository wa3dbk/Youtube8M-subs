00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 online ticket store with you again 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.390
 we will introduce you to amino acids from 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.210
 dymatize nutrition 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.380
 so the video review is dedicated to such 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.450
 jar weight which is 300 grams 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.760
 at the same time as the manufacturer claims 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.760
 we have 60 servings in a container 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.140
 one serving is 5 grown 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.580
 or one scoop which 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.710
 supplied here in this 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.970
 jar 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.449
 This means that the composition includes such 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.860
 essential amino acids like valine 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:38.190
 leucine and isoleucine means their total 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.280
 total weight per serving is 5 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.239
 thousand 50 milligrams therefore it is called 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.250
 here it is the amino acid to be so here 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.870
 way 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.340
 mean recommendations for use 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.129
 which the manufacturer claims 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.600
 need to take one serving 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.059
 recommend three times a day to take 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.770
 we recommend to proceed from your 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.109
 needs can take on one 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.420
 portions per day and increase the number 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.659
 up to 6 servings a day depending on 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.979
 what your goals and what your 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.380
 muscle mass 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.080
 does it mean if you are on drying 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.030
 can safely increase to 6 receptions per 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.240
 day if you are on a mass set 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.000
 period can from 1 to 3 admissions per day 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.360
 limit means produced on 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.030
 united states of america mean in 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.439
 the internet is popular 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.119
 There are big unpacking if you want 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.670
 try to take such a jar you 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.799
 be satisfied well and briefly introduce 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.140
 you in a little background why you need 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.689
 amino acid fighter these amino acids 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.140
 your body is not produced but 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.650
 sky your body 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.770
 what is needed firstly they mean 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.260
 for muscle regeneration after intensive 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.360
 training or after training means 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.020
 they prevent muscle destruction 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.869
 means after the training process on 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.210
 night is taken to 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.820
 stop also muscle destruction 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.619
 mean and during training and their also 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.030
 can be taken during exercise 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.130
 You can mix them with some water and 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.920
 take it is necessary in order to 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.410
 slightly increase power performance and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.660
 reduce the burden on all organs and 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.430
 systems of our body especially this 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.860
 will be relevant in heavy training 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.340
 processes if you make big how would 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.550
 weights 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.040
 let's say bench press or deadlift or 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.540
 some other exercise if 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.440
 undergo and heavy load 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.830
 loads yourself 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.750
 it means they will also help you for 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.400
 personal feelings means start 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.470
 probably only work after a month 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.739
 reception why because the body 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.510
 saturated with amino acids and they like 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.820
 begin to show themselves a little 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.829
 noticeable result there is some kind of 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.660
 muscle mass recruit super effect 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.500
 you will not notice it does not need screams 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.680
 fool yourself 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.320
 but you will feel no more lightness when 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.920
 doing heavy exercises 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.540
 means drying is not particularly relevant 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.640
 why because the body needs 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.640
 these amino acids and muscles will 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.890
 suffer great destruction because 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.209
 that you reduce carbohydrates but how would 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.900
 some amino acids 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:17.590
 make up for their deficiency in the body 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.069
 and will let your body destroy its 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.620
 these acid muscles I would recommend 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.000
 all people without exception who 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.019
 disassemble a little in sports nutrition 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.819
 and go to the results slowly but 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.590
 surely mean and go to 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.359
 online shop on the biscuits we will find 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.370
 large selection of sports nutrition and 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:40.950
 specifically here these be amino acids you 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.950
 You can also get there thanks
