00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
Samsung or I don't really remember where

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.129 
Samsung or I don't really remember where
up<00:00:56.089> or<00:00:56.269> this<00:00:56.449> might<00:00:57.049> be<00:00:57.940> generally<00:00:58.940> -<00:00:59.209> and<00:00:59.629> of

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:00.139 
up or this might be generally - and of

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:02.649 
up or this might be generally - and of
course<00:01:00.280> power<00:01:01.280> cord<00:01:01.639> because<00:01:01.969> I'm<00:01:02.209> a<00:01:02.299> excelent

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
course power cord because I'm a excelent

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.800 
course power cord because I'm a excelent
needs<00:01:02.869> power<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:04.190> work<00:01:05.150> poorly

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
needs power to work poorly

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.200 
needs power to work poorly
so<00:01:06.670> let's<00:01:07.670> try<00:01:07.940> it<00:01:07.970> out<00:01:08.240> I<00:01:09.580> have<00:01:10.580> it<00:01:10.670> Syria<00:01:10.910> I

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
so let's try it out I have it Syria I

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.130 
so let's try it out I have it Syria I
have<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.850> HDMI<00:01:13.850> cable<00:01:14.090> plugged<00:01:14.780> into<00:01:14.960> the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
have the HDMI cable plugged into the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.250 
have the HDMI cable plugged into the
adapter<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:15.800> so<00:01:16.430> is<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.670> power<00:01:16.850> cord<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:17.480> of

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
adapter and so is the power cord and of

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:30.050 
adapter and so is the power cord and of
my<00:01:19.870> display<00:01:20.870> ready<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:21.620> let's<00:01:21.920> try

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.370 

if<00:01:30.600> anything<00:01:31.110> happens<00:01:32.600> well<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:34.080> seems

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
if anything happens well it seems

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.749 
if anything happens well it seems
nothing<00:01:34.770> happens<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:36.740> this<00:01:37.740> adapter<00:01:38.310> makes<00:01:38.610> it

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
nothing happens so this adapter makes it

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.530 
nothing happens so this adapter makes it
are<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.479> expensive<00:01:41.090> extension<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.360> your

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
are really expensive extension for your

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.430 
are really expensive extension for your
power<00:01:43.380> cable<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:45.050> sorry

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.240 

so<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.979> problem<00:01:50.790> was<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.240> display<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.649> had

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
so the problem was in the display I had

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.899 
so the problem was in the display I had
to<00:01:53.369> switch<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.940> HDMI<00:01:54.720> input<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.520> started

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
to switch the HDMI input so it started

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.899 
to switch the HDMI input so it started
working<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.920> looks<00:01:58.920> really<00:01:59.369> nice

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
working on it looks really nice

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.850 
working on it looks really nice
I'm<00:02:00.390> sitting<00:02:00.810> near<00:02:00.990> very<00:02:01.170> close<00:02:01.440> to<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
I'm sitting near very close to the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.900 
I'm sitting near very close to the
display<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:03.179> it<00:02:03.330> looks<00:02:03.630> very<00:02:04.110> very<00:02:04.350> nice<00:02:07.910> it

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
display and it looks very very nice it

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.370 
display and it looks very very nice it

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
works like a dream

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.650 
works like a dream
ok<00:02:10.860> let's<00:02:11.100> try<00:02:11.250> some<00:02:11.580> videos<00:02:14.000> I'm<00:02:15.000> looking<00:02:15.420> for

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
ok let's try some videos I'm looking for

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.210 
ok let's try some videos I'm looking for
YouTube<00:02:16.170> here<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.170> say<00:02:19.350> as<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.069> said

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
YouTube here and I have to say as I said

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.610 
YouTube here and I have to say as I said
before<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:21.060> know<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.420> lost<00:02:21.630> all<00:02:21.989> connections

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
before you know you lost all connections

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.880 
before you know you lost all connections
when<00:02:22.890> you're<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.430> were<00:02:23.550> doing<00:02:23.850> this<00:02:24.030> with<00:02:24.330> our

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
when you're you were doing this with our

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.750 
when you're you were doing this with our
colossus<00:02:25.890> -<00:02:26.190> but<00:02:27.920> here<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:32.160> works<00:02:32.400> like<00:02:32.730> a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
colossus - but here it works like a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.060 
colossus - but here it works like a
train

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
train

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.509 
train
so<00:02:35.070> let's<00:02:35.250> try<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.820> video<00:02:36.000> I'm<00:02:36.720> sorry<00:02:36.780> my

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
so let's try a video I'm sorry my

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.580 
so let's try a video I'm sorry my
network<00:02:38.519> here<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.880> what<00:02:39.600> clean<00:02:39.870> see<00:02:42.590> this

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
network here is what clean see this

00:02:43.590 --> 00:03:00.199 
network here is what clean see this
would<00:02:43.829> even<00:02:43.920> use<00:02:44.190> really<00:02:58.609> but<00:02:59.609> the<00:02:59.760> problem

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
would even use really but the problem

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.349 
would even use really but the problem
here<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.650> cable<00:03:02.459> is<00:03:02.790> very<00:03:03.030> flimsy

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
here is that this cable is very flimsy

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.610 
here is that this cable is very flimsy
so<00:03:04.290> if<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.560> does<00:03:04.799> it<00:03:05.480> flicker<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.720> maybe<00:03:07.350> stop

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
so if it does it flicker and maybe stop

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.280 
so if it does it flicker and maybe stop
working<00:03:08.070> so<00:03:08.720> for<00:03:09.720> playing<00:03:09.989> games

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
working so for playing games

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.940 
working so for playing games
the<00:03:13.290> display<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.130> no-go<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:15.750> really<00:03:16.079> you

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
the display is a no-go and really you

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.650 
the display is a no-go and really you
really<00:03:16.980> need<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.850> -<00:03:18.000> controller<00:03:18.420> or

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
really need you to - controller or

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.940 
really need you to - controller or
something<00:03:19.079> like<00:03:19.230> that

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
something like that

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.930 
something like that
anyway<00:03:21.730> look<00:03:22.480> for<00:03:23.200> videos<00:03:24.270> is<00:03:25.270> really<00:03:25.630> great
