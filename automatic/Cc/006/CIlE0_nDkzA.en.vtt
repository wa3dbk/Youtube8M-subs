enough time to survey the field and find

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:26.430 
enough time to survey the field and find
the<00:01:16.050> open<00:01:16.350> guy

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:35.959 

they<00:01:27.040> line<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.580> ball<00:01:27.790> up<00:01:28.030> at<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:29.020> 39

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:41.039 

they<00:01:36.969> go<00:01:37.179> with<00:01:37.329> the<00:01:37.450> run<00:01:39.450> he's<00:01:40.450> dropped<00:01:40.840> for

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
they go with the run he's dropped for

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.889 
they go with the run he's dropped for
loss<00:01:41.289> yeah<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.310> we<00:01:42.429> know<00:01:42.640> defensive<00:01:43.390> ends<00:01:43.600> are

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
loss yeah and we know defensive ends are

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.200 
loss yeah and we know defensive ends are
probably<00:01:44.409> some<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:44.829> the<00:01:44.920> most<00:01:45.009> athletic<00:01:45.939> guys

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
probably some of the most athletic guys

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.090 
probably some of the most athletic guys
in<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.689> league<00:01:46.869> and<00:01:47.140> typically<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:47.859> think

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
in the league and typically you think

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.349 
in the league and typically you think
about<00:01:48.250> them<00:01:48.609> getting<00:01:48.789> out<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.240> the

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
about them getting out to the

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.660 
about them getting out to the
quarterback<00:01:49.719> but<00:01:50.409> that<00:01:50.740> time<00:01:51.039> he<00:01:51.219> uses

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
quarterback but that time he uses

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.609 
quarterback but that time he uses
athleticism<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.600> make<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.840> big<00:01:53.110> stop<00:01:53.350> in<00:01:53.380> the

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
athleticism to make a big stop in the

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.030 
athleticism to make a big stop in the
run

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:11.130 

so<00:02:00.730> they'll<00:02:00.970> face<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.390> second<00:02:01.780> intent

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.840 

passes<00:02:11.980> short<00:02:12.220> right<00:02:12.430> side<00:02:14.130> little<00:02:15.130> was<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
passes short right side little was the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:29.050 
passes short right side little was the
intended<00:02:16.150> receiver<00:02:16.569> on<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.930> play

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.890 

third<00:02:29.720> down<00:02:30.020> now<00:02:30.080> 10<00:02:30.800> yards<00:02:31.280> for<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.520> first

goes<00:02:38.900> through<00:02:39.170> his<00:02:39.260> progression<00:02:39.920> throws<00:02:40.670> it

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
goes through his progression throws it

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.580 
goes through his progression throws it

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.910 

the<00:02:45.160> ball<00:02:45.430> is<00:02:45.459> tipped<00:02:45.910> away<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.530> pass<00:02:47.739> was

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920

the<00:02:50.290> end<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.620> game<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:51.069> go<00:02:51.310> back<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.610> you

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
the end of the game you go back and you

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.240

down and you have a pretty good

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.960 
down and you have a pretty good
indication<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.950> how<00:02:57.069> that<00:02:57.280> game<00:02:57.519> came<00:02:57.790> out

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970
