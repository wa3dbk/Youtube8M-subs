00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 very good and welcome to another tutorial 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.730
 of excel in this case we are going to use the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.410
 function rounds parc that as you saw 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.330
 in previous tutorials we did 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.790
 about the round and odd function is very 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.100
 similar only that instead round up 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.170
 the next number even more 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.310
 my closest pair is to round towards 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.609
 up to place so good I have 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.260
 the previous one and I'm just going to add 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.800
 here to the right 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.800
 the death 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.330
 ar 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.660
 of agreement works exactly the same is 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.100
 tell 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.140
 the positive numbers 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.379
 always round up is 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.220
 to say this 9 with 2 is not going to round it 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.890
 to the 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.230
 to the nearest good if in this case if 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.770
 is the closest because they are going to be 10 the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.900
 result but in the case of 8 with 6 not 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.930
 is going to leave it in 8 that is to say it is going to leave it 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.660
 in 10 we will also see it in this case 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.579
 to 2 and what he does in this case 10 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.370
 and here 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.980
 round 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.220
 although the nearest closest number 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.350
 par is 8 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.200
 and round bread never round towards 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.420
 towards the minor if the number is positive 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.090
 in this case it is positive so also 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.750
 the answer is going to be 10 and in this case 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.140
 act in the opposite way 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.800
 being a negative number rounds to 1 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.800
 minor always 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.870
 to 4 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.979
 -6 and 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.479
 that is going to be minus 6 too 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.450
 good as you see the easy short tutorial 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.640
 and good if you liked to make a like 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.710
 do not forget to subscribe to the channel and 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.110
 you can find me at josema tube with 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.460
 josema I had on twitter and on facebook so 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.330
 that nothing we see in the next 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.330
 tutorials see you later
