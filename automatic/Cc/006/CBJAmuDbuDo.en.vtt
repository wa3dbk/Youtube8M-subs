in fits in there snugly as well as I
said<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.560> five<00:02:04.890> slots<00:02:05.250> there<00:02:05.550> but<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.910> looks

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
said this five slots there but it looks

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
said this five slots there but it looks
like<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:06.810> quite<00:02:07.290> stretchy<00:02:07.830> so<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:09.509> know<00:02:09.660> if

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
like it's quite stretchy so you know if

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.640 
like it's quite stretchy so you know if
you<00:02:10.290> find<00:02:10.830> yourself<00:02:11.250> with<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:12.720> limited<00:02:13.560> amount

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
you find yourself with a limited amount

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.150 
you find yourself with a limited amount
of<00:02:13.950> cash<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.630> wanted<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.750> get<00:02:15.960> ten<00:02:16.500> games<00:02:16.800> so

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
of cash and wanted to get ten games so

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.790 
of cash and wanted to get ten games so
you<00:02:17.190> probably<00:02:17.610> could<00:02:17.880> slot<00:02:18.150> them<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.450> there

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
you probably could slot them in there

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.530 
you probably could slot them in there
fairly<00:02:19.800> comfortably<00:02:20.250> actually<00:02:20.670> now<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
fairly comfortably actually now the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.700 
fairly comfortably actually now the
final<00:02:22.110> piece<00:02:22.290> here<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.190> mesh<00:02:23.580> section<00:02:23.910> I

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
final piece here is this mesh section I

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.430 
final piece here is this mesh section I
was<00:02:25.710> hoping<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.490> be<00:02:26.760> able<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.120> stash<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.690> the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
was hoping to be able to stash in the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.460 
was hoping to be able to stash in the
power<00:02:28.980> unit<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:30.360> charging<00:02:30.780> unit<00:02:31.200> for<00:02:31.380> this

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
power unit and a charging unit for this

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.980 
power unit and a charging unit for this
but<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:32.670> doesn't<00:02:32.820> allow<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.390> possible<00:02:33.900> if

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
but it doesn't allow this it possible if

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.490 
but it doesn't allow this it possible if
you<00:02:34.140> can<00:02:34.410> if<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:34.920> can<00:02:34.980> see<00:02:35.250> there<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:36.500> think

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
you can if you can see there I think

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.630 
you can if you can see there I think
there's<00:02:37.620> any<00:02:37.770> way<00:02:37.980> you're<00:02:38.220> gonna<00:02:38.310> get<00:02:38.520> the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
there's any way you're gonna get the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.620 
there's any way you're gonna get the
plug<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:40.620> transformer<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.790> cable<00:02:42.240> in

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
plug the transformer and the cable in

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.270 
plug the transformer and the cable in
which<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.470> shame<00:02:45.050> probably<00:02:46.050> however<00:02:46.410> slot<00:02:47.040> in

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
which is shame probably however slot in

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.410 
which is shame probably however slot in
the<00:02:47.670> USB<00:02:48.209> charging<00:02:48.989> unit<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.970> mean<00:02:51.090> that's

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
the USB charging unit so I mean that's

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.210 
the USB charging unit so I mean that's
gonna<00:02:51.600> be<00:02:51.690> handy<00:02:52.080> if<00:02:52.200> you're<00:02:52.470> out<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.160> about
