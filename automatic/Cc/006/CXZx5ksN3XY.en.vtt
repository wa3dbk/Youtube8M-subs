00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
we haven't played with yet and so it

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.069 
we haven't played with yet and so it
kind<00:01:18.729> of<00:01:18.759> just<00:01:18.909> took<00:01:19.060> I<00:01:19.119> think<00:01:19.509> I<00:01:19.570> have<00:01:19.750> to<00:01:19.930> get

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
kind of just took I think I have to get

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.840 
kind of just took I think I have to get
used<00:01:20.259> to<00:01:20.350> each<00:01:20.470> other<00:01:20.650> and<00:01:20.860> back<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.340> playing

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
used to each other and back and playing

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.640 
used to each other and back and playing
and<00:01:22.119> more<00:01:22.540> smooth<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.049> so<00:01:23.229> I<00:01:23.259> think<00:01:23.500> hopefully

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
and more smooth and so I think hopefully

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.170 
and more smooth and so I think hopefully
we<00:01:23.979> can<00:01:24.130> do<00:01:24.250> that<00:01:24.400> from<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.640> get-go<00:01:24.790> this<00:01:25.030> time

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
we can do that from the get-go this time

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.770 
we can do that from the get-go this time
we<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:27.310> of<00:01:27.369> sat<00:01:27.579> in<00:01:27.759> a<00:01:27.850> little<00:01:28.090> bit<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.509> and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
we kind of sat in a little bit and and

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.139 
we kind of sat in a little bit and and
kind<00:01:29.409> of<00:01:29.470> let<00:01:29.619> them<00:01:29.860> run<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.250> show<00:01:30.430> and<00:01:30.729> that's

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
kind of let them run the show and that's

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.340 
kind of let them run the show and that's
not<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.540> way<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.750> we're<00:01:31.899> going<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.079> win<00:01:32.170> and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
not the way that we're going to win and

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.539 
not the way that we're going to win and
that's<00:01:32.439> not<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:32.770> way<00:01:32.860> that<00:01:32.979> we<00:01:33.130> like<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.430> play

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
that's not the way that we like to play

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.730 
that's not the way that we like to play
and<00:01:33.880> we<00:01:34.000> knew<00:01:34.149> that<00:01:34.180> so<00:01:34.630> we<00:01:35.170> change<00:01:35.470> it<00:01:35.619> in<00:01:35.710> the

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
and we knew that so we change it in the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.380 
and we knew that so we change it in the
second<00:01:36.009> half<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.369> came<00:01:36.579> out<00:01:36.610> stronger<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.210> I

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
second half and came out stronger and I

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.530 
second half and came out stronger and I
think<00:01:37.659> that<00:01:37.840> we<00:01:37.960> looked<00:01:38.850> much<00:01:39.850> more<00:01:39.909> like<00:01:40.270> the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
think that we looked much more like the

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.690 
think that we looked much more like the
team<00:01:40.720> that<00:01:40.869> we<00:01:40.960> can<00:01:41.170> be<00:01:41.380> well<00:01:41.979> we<00:01:42.250> picked<00:01:42.460> up<00:01:42.579> a

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
team that we can be well we picked up a

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.340 
team that we can be well we picked up a
couple<00:01:42.820> of<00:01:43.000> their<00:01:43.119> tendencies<00:01:43.600> on<00:01:43.780> dead<00:01:44.140> ball

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
couple of their tendencies on dead ball

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.929 
couple of their tendencies on dead ball
situations<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:45.159> free<00:01:45.369> kicks<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:45.820> things

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
situations and free kicks and things

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.060 
situations and free kicks and things
like<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.149> and<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:47.170> we'll<00:01:47.380> we've<00:01:47.740> kind<00:01:48.040> of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
like that and so we'll we've kind of

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.770 
like that and so we'll we've kind of
tweaked<00:01:48.549> hours<00:01:48.729> a<00:01:48.880> little<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.240> address<00:01:49.360> that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
tweaked hours a little to address that

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.350 
tweaked hours a little to address that
should<00:01:50.290> be<00:01:50.439> an<00:01:50.590> interesting<00:01:51.180> tactical<00:01:52.180> game

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
should be an interesting tactical game

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.359 
should be an interesting tactical game
out<00:01:52.540> there<00:01:52.570> for<00:01:52.810> both<00:01:52.930> teams<00:01:53.140> f<00:01:53.649> ck<00:01:53.710> c<00:01:54.040> is<00:01:54.250> one

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
out there for both teams f ck c is one

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.920 
out there for both teams f ck c is one
of<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.520> best<00:01:54.640> teams<00:01:54.850> in<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.119> league<00:01:55.210> so<00:01:55.540> we

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
of the best teams in the league so we

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.270 
of the best teams in the league so we
know<00:01:56.200> that<00:01:56.229> they're<00:01:56.649> going<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.829> keep<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.130> ball

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
know that they're going to keep the ball

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.060 
know that they're going to keep the ball
they<00:01:57.460> love<00:01:57.700> keeping<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.270> ball<00:01:58.420> they<00:01:58.719> love

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
they love keeping the ball they love

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.289 
they love keeping the ball they love
building<00:02:00.070> out<00:02:00.369> of<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.520> back<00:02:00.700> they<00:02:01.000> love

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
building out of the back they love

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.270 
building out of the back they love
getting<00:02:01.689> a<00:02:01.990> rot<00:02:02.170> in<00:02:02.320> those<00:02:02.500> little<00:02:02.649> spaces<00:02:02.950> in

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
getting a rot in those little spaces in

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.889 
getting a rot in those little spaces in
behind<00:02:03.579> and<00:02:03.820> so<00:02:04.210> they're<00:02:04.360> going<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.539> be<00:02:04.630> really

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
behind and so they're going to be really

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.160 
behind and so they're going to be really
potent<00:02:05.289> but<00:02:05.829> we<00:02:06.070> also<00:02:06.369> know<00:02:06.640> that

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
potent but we also know that

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.600 
potent but we also know that
we<00:02:08.170> can<00:02:08.350> be<00:02:08.440> potent<00:02:08.770> as<00:02:08.860> well<00:02:09.040> so<00:02:09.280> we're<00:02:09.520> gonna

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
we can be potent as well so we're gonna

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.070 
we can be potent as well so we're gonna
have<00:02:09.820> to<00:02:10.000> play<00:02:10.180> to<00:02:10.210> our<00:02:10.300> strengths<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:10.900> try
