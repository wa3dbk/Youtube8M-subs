00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
 Hello, the third video from the blog will be 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:11.450
 about the seat how to do it 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:18.920
 relief and that applied in this work 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:23.250
 So I took this rectangle 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.500
 kozhzama and rectangle of any fabric 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:31.610
 just so she stretches out 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:35.250
 and together their shells 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.680
 lines that go through 8 cm from me 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.800
 you can do well through any other 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.980
 number of centimeters it does not matter here 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.850
 then I took here such records 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.190
 This can be found on any car market 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.270
 This insulation for car hoods 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.050
 who sculpts under the hood so he 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.510
 to warm the engine to keep warm so I 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.180
 they just got me between 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.189
 lines space and I go there 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.150
 just here are these strips of insulation 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.659
 on painted so to speak on substituted 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:21.509
 here well it turns out it seems as relief 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:24.470
 siduh and here we will continue to settle 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.150
 video when everything is good 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.090
 line u will not go in a circle and already both 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.909
 I sew strictly with foam rubber and here 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.310
 here is the basis for this 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.790
 I made the base mount 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.000
 that is, it is necessary that these bolts 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.820
 out of the base but so that nothing 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 was i made such wall mirrors and not 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.490
 when I returned these bolts on the nut 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.210
 well, and that's how they are behind the center 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.550
 here are some more screws and so 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.190
 it turned out that I just have here 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.870
 protrude here such here bolts and anything they 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:11.280
 does not interfere directly flat on the frame 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:13.860
 here in the base for mounting done 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.530
 such here are the holes for screws 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.450
 metal 10 millimeters in screws 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.550
 long 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.770
 so here they nasverlil and then 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.209
 screws to who taught screws keeps 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:31.310
 very well nothing interferes here 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:35.580
 actually everything will be continued 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.410
 your south to the end siduhu show what 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.860
 happened 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.350
