00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.030

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.670
 talk about selecting I want to house the 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.070
 selection is about this contest that 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.289
 has same name since 35 girls are 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.059
 chosen to compete in the 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.440
 these 35 girls compete for the heart 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.180
 of the maximum principle for any of the 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.070
 that was born in being chosen for the 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.390
 selection is one of the greatest honors 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.570
 and one of the biggest things that you can 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.450
 pass except for america singer the 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.470
 protagonist to be selected to america 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.320
 he has to give up his secret love 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.360
 aspen who is a boy in a category 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.190
 socially lower than she in part the 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.570
 selection does not just involve competing with 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.010
 other four girls to see who 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.410
 ends up being the future wife of 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.570
 prince but it also involves 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.550
 live in a palace eat like it will be like 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.430
 someone of royalty dress as such 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.040
 full of zany stresses that costumes 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.840
 and great jewels america thought that 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.430
 It really is the worst that could happen 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.470
 that he was not going to have any class 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.270
 feelings for maximum not even 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.120
 I think he likes it but little by little 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.290
 discover that they were not like this about this 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.969
 book had read many reviews 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.820
 varied since it was fantastic until 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.570
 that more or less and until it was very bad 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.430
 so 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.020
 I did not know what to expect this is class 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.090
 book that depends on the person who 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.740
 read because many people that I know that you 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.180
 you can love at the time of you from 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.680
 many people who are going to hate him and 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.950
 there are many people who are going to give 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.650
 same 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.110
 I'm like between that I do not care 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.490
 and I liked it but honestly I did not 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.619
 loved the problem that I had 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.509
 mainly with this book was the 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.130
 beginning and ending I took longer 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.990
 reading the first 50 pages that the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.690
 rest of the book honestly I think it's 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.640
 because of aspe the boy in that 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.120
 America was in love at the beginning of 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.820
 the novel 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.730
 I find the character more annoying than 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.460
 I had to read it seems so I do not know and jay 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.500
 false I think not 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.450
 it was not for nothing and the first 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.910
 fifty sixty pages as they were 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.950
 treated of the relationship of america already 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.980
 until the first one that was very for the voice 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.110
 in tension for that very realistic and 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.240
 it's really annoying and I do not think 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.520
 it is the most is more false more overacting 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.290
 that this one really did not feel real 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.900
 it is not understood because they liked 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.399
 there is simply a romance that 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.899
 They said it was put there but I did not 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.730
 I felt it and I really was already 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.620
 ready to send the book is 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.700
 during those 50 pages 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.290
 then the plot takes a turn that all the 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.730
 world knew what was going to happen so 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.440
 less list the synopsis I liked to 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.690
 From there, the medium was what most 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.840
 he liked what a lot is what he did not like 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.459
 but 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.709
 a pretty full book of the country that 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.569
 pass that part that well the pages will 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.400
 the characters went by themselves 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.900
 They seemed very cool even though 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.700
 america sir is not skips my business 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.250
 because well moments that I really do not 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.690
 fell well I think it's very realistic and in 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.230
 many parts had very good dialogues 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.989
 and I think it's a character that is 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.090
 nice without scratching in perfection 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.250
 quite human to produce them way 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.349
 main faction is like the 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.590
 representation of a prince disney and 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.390
 it seemed very sweet and sweet and not what 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.640
 I say because there is if the boy with that 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.739
 I think it's going to stay and the ip and oy 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.250
 such is any really liked the 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.560
 character as such is very very cool 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.459
 the idea of ​​the most original principle that 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.620
 there are but I have not read many books of a 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.989
 prince of this nature then I 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.980
 it seemed very tender this an element of 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.860
 friendship and a little bit of attention in a 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.940
 little bit of tension in the middle 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.060
 honestly I'm not a big fan of 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.430
 Aspen seems to me the character most at 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.350
 girls in the competition in the selection 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.120
 many times it was like watching 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.980
 and I do not mean that as a compliment 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.400
 always came up with that cliché phrase 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.320
 that comes out in all the realities and that I 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.690
 comes here to compete not to make friends or 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.850
 be the most reality where that has been done 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.230
 you do not need to put a book that you want 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.630
 everyone knows that it is not realistic and 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.110
 nobody is going to be my I did not like it I loved it 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.180
 no but I think it's an idea that had 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.380
 much more potential and was not tapped 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.060
 the way it could have been 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.580
 seized the first one that seemed very 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.550
 of baylor but there is another way that would be that 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.860
 to which you the series after this one 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.490
 it's better in my opinion it was coordinated 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.490
 because of bayer
