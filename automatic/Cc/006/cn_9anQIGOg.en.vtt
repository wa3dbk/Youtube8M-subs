X<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:41.100> not<00:01:41.460> another<00:01:41.730> film<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.330> I<00:01:42.540> think

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
X was not another film and I think

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.560 
X was not another film and I think
people<00:01:43.050> don't<00:01:43.290> count<00:01:43.680> tv2<00:01:44.340> again<00:01:44.730> and<00:01:45.330> yeah

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
people don't count tv2 again and yeah

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.990 
people don't count tv2 again and yeah
it's<00:01:46.170> annoying<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.530> info<00:01:46.890> well<00:01:47.850> they

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
it's annoying that info well they

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.610 
it's annoying that info well they
probably<00:01:48.150> did<00:01:48.480> but<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.690> don't<00:01:49.260> think<00:01:49.380> there<00:01:49.590> can

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
probably did but I don't think there can

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.530 
probably did but I don't think there can
be<00:01:49.800> because<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.190> think<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.550> TV<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.210> really

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
be because I think that TV is really

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.680 
be because I think that TV is really
directed<00:01:51.960> medium<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.470> film<00:01:52.830> is<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.850> yeah<00:01:54.030> we

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
directed medium like film is and yeah we

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.000
