one in the middle four five on that one
just<00:03:04.240> the<00:03:05.240> same<00:03:05.480> little<00:03:05.810> size<00:03:06.050> it's<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.560> little

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
just the same little size it's a little

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.760 
just the same little size it's a little
bitty<00:03:07.450> like<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.750> not<00:03:09.080> even<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:09.560> much

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
bitty like that not even that much

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.370 
bitty like that not even that much
because<00:03:10.220> that's<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.550> lot<00:03:10.870> when<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:11.990> when<00:03:12.290> it

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
because that's a lot when it when it

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.810 
because that's a lot when it when it
gets<00:03:12.470> hot<00:03:12.740> and<00:03:12.920> when<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.160> warms<00:03:13.310> up<00:03:13.550> in<00:03:13.730> your

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
gets hot and when it warms up in your

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:21.190 
gets hot and when it warms up in your
mouth<00:03:15.580> now<00:03:16.580> I<00:03:16.610> do<00:03:16.760> use<00:03:19.540> these<00:03:20.540> these<00:03:20.930> little

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
mouth now I do use these these little

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.810 
mouth now I do use these these little
way<00:03:21.290> for<00:03:21.530> Z's<00:03:24.130> that's<00:03:25.130> for<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.370> bottom<00:03:25.640> plate

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
way for Z's that's for the bottom plate

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.210 
way for Z's that's for the bottom plate
because<00:03:26.180> these<00:03:27.110> get<00:03:27.350> very<00:03:27.560> uncomfortable

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
because these get very uncomfortable

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.670 
because these get very uncomfortable
even<00:03:28.850> if<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.269> just<00:03:29.450> use<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.750> liquid<00:03:29.989> adhesive

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
even if you just use a liquid adhesive

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.350 
even if you just use a liquid adhesive
or<00:03:30.890> whatever<00:03:31.220> they<00:03:31.670> tell<00:03:31.910> you<00:03:32.000> not<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.150> use<00:03:32.330> a

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.970 
or whatever they tell you not to use a
powder<00:03:32.660> because<00:03:32.930> after<00:03:33.380> you<00:03:33.470> use<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:33.769> when<00:03:33.860> it

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
powder because after you use it when it

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.699 
powder because after you use it when it
softens<00:03:34.400> your<00:03:34.489> gums<00:03:34.670> up<00:03:34.910> so<00:03:35.090> much<00:03:35.239> you're<00:03:35.420> not

for this I use these and I've already
cut<00:03:43.250> this<00:03:43.430> one<00:03:43.670> down<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:43.850> little<00:03:44.150> bit<00:03:44.300> to

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
cut this one down a little bit to

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.479 
cut this one down a little bit to
