00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.519
 on our track of the seen of 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.410
 all 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:17.599
 even bicycle cars nothing but that 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.599
 which we will see now is an absolute novelty 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.440
 this time we have fun 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.810
 here on our track the legends le 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.820
 mini modrone small scale version 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.880
 of famous American users 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.120
 a fashion that is involving 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.120
 fans 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.890
 the idea of hot roads was born in 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.600
 after the war when there was great in the USA 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.260
 old scrap availability a little 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.120
 price 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.010
 who knew how to work with mechanics the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.379
 welder replace the engine with a 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.030
 strong or an eight-cylinder chevrolet e 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.729
 then he went to run on the track not on 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.950
 salt lakes 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.780
 in the case of the legends the flashes and he 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.360
 smog the American docs were 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.759
 replaced by motorcycle engines 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.070
 yamaha of 1.3 liters of displacement e 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.289
 about 140 horsepower with 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.520
 fiberglass body and chassis 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:26.229
 pisano tubular less than 500 kg which gives 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.520
 these little monsters report weight 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.860
 power of a ferrari 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.720
 in short, pure fun but also fun 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.000
 excellent means to get closer to driving 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.300
 let's see what sport I can learn 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.300
 today 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.430
 traction is rear and change of 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.200
 motorcycle type at 5 strong then ad 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.630
 sequential drive that makes i 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.579
 extremely fast gearshifts 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.409
 the steering and without servant and much of yesterday 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.840
 only half a turn from one extreme to the other 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.700
 and we must resign ourselves to having some 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.039
 of reactions if you drive passing on 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.569
 disc brake tasks in front of drum 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.120
 behind with 13-inch wheels 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.560
 complete the technical sheet 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.690
 in the passenger compartment the preparations are 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.360
 those of a race car seat 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.620
 anatomical 5-point roll bar belt 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.750
 integral fire system has one 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.400
 exceptional road holding I am 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.290
 sure that at this time track 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.959
 a long time 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.299
 for those who did not know the record for i 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.969
 road models is from the adventador with 1 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.799
 13 87 reach the limit tends to 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.629
 oversteer at the slightest hint of a club 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.459
 but once you find the point of 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.080
 They ride and balance limburg 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.640
 fast 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.740
 It is obvious that for the horses they have a 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.930
 provision is a bit awkward 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.900
 above all have short marches for 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.640
 the fastest part of our party 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.739
 but when he entered the part of 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.739
 more stressful handling the minimum 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.660
 final 1 21 and 9 is the first time here 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.860
 from such a medium that I am sure 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.860
 that you can fire me 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.260
 but where you go to practice with a car 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.970
 of course on the track since not 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.560
 they can circulate in the street 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.140
 in Italy you go to the motocross circuit of 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.940
 castelletto di branduzzo near pavia e 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.220
 also the official importers le 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.320
 legends are built in america with 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.360
 a gradual approach anyone able to 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.470
 drive them and have good fun without 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.890
 spend a folly 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.370
 the rental of 5 g linguist series costs 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.370
 50 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.019
 but if you want one all for you with 24 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.019
 thousand euros can be done 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.569
 made on the basis of the abarth 500 e 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.519
 regularly approved and therefore can 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.430
 circulate on the road like a normal one 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.469
 car but normal the fifth if 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.000
 this is the name of this little beast not 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:57.489
 it has really but nothing 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.319
 when I won the four hours it was a 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.239
 complete route even with high ones 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.299
 speed then 10 kilometers in all 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.159
 but what was formidable was that 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.739
 to exit the cul from the van from the 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:12.930
 parabolic elevated in full 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.930
 fifth over maybe 200 per hour
