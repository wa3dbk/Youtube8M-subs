Corridor bus so you may refer to it as
the<00:00:32.259> connective<00:00:32.619> corridor<00:00:32.860> or<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.370> bus<00:00:33.579> or

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
the shuttle the connective corridor also

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.479 
the shuttle the connective corridor also
is<00:00:36.400> a<00:00:36.430> route<00:00:36.880> from<00:00:37.720> Syracuse<00:00:38.440> University<00:00:38.489> into

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
is a route from Syracuse University into

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.450 
is a route from Syracuse University into
downtown<00:00:40.000> Syracuse<00:00:41.160> specifically<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.280> near

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
downtown Syracuse specifically the near

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.750 
downtown Syracuse specifically the near
West<00:00:42.640> Side<00:00:43.000> the<00:00:43.360> idea<00:00:44.140> behind<00:00:44.290> it<00:00:44.800> was<00:00:44.980> to<00:00:45.610> make

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
West Side the idea behind it was to make

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.959 
West Side the idea behind it was to make
a<00:00:46.030> clear<00:00:46.899> and<00:00:47.170> easy<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:48.010> free<00:00:48.579> connection

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
a clear and easy and free connection

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.830 
a clear and easy and free connection
between<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:50.199> hill<00:00:50.469> and<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:52.180> cultural<00:00:52.690> and

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
between the hill and the cultural and

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.779 
between the hill and the cultural and
artistic<00:00:53.079> resources<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:54.129> the<00:00:54.250> shopping<00:00:54.489> in

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
artistic resources and the shopping in

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:55.770 
artistic resources and the shopping in
downtown<00:00:55.179> Syracuse

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
downtown Syracuse

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.110 
downtown Syracuse
I<00:00:56.039> think<00:00:57.039> the<00:00:57.100> connector<00:00:57.399> corridor<00:00:57.789> is<00:00:57.879> great

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
I think the connector corridor is great

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.520 
I think the connector corridor is great
for<00:00:58.949> especially<00:00:59.949> freshmen<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.989> like<00:01:02.199> a<00:01:02.230> free

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
for especially freshmen it's like a free

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.950 
for especially freshmen it's like a free
ride<00:01:02.710> downtown<00:01:03.370> like<00:01:03.789> it's<00:01:04.000> not<00:01:04.150> a<00:01:04.360> walking

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
ride downtown like it's not a walking

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.600 
ride downtown like it's not a walking
distance<00:01:05.080> so<00:01:05.530> if<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:06.190> have<00:01:06.280> a<00:01:06.340> group<00:01:06.520> of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
distance so if you have a group of

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.890 
distance so if you have a group of
friends<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:06.910> can<00:01:07.090> just<00:01:07.240> take<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.540> coordinate

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
friends you can just take the coordinate

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.250 
friends you can just take the coordinate
to<00:01:08.020> forward<00:01:08.320> or<00:01:08.910> downtown<00:01:09.910> and<00:01:10.180> have<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.450> meal

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
to forward or downtown and have a meal

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.610 
to forward or downtown and have a meal
watch<00:01:11.680> show<00:01:12.010> go<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:12.730> the<00:01:12.910> movies<00:01:13.240> or<00:01:13.450> just<00:01:13.690> have

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
watch show go to the movies or just have

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.270 
watch show go to the movies or just have
a<00:01:14.650> good<00:01:14.830> night

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
a good night

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.520 
a good night
I<00:01:15.310> think<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.330> connective<00:01:16.810> corridor<00:01:17.050> program

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
I think the connective corridor program

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.410 
I think the connective corridor program
is<00:01:17.950> really<00:01:18.159> good<00:01:18.430> especially<00:01:18.790> for<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.180> freshman

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
is really good especially for a freshman

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.180 
is really good especially for a freshman
because<00:01:19.870> you<00:01:20.020> probably<00:01:20.410> won't<00:01:20.680> have<00:01:20.830> your<00:01:20.950> car

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
because you probably won't have your car

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.250 
because you probably won't have your car
up<00:01:21.340> here<00:01:21.370> so<00:01:22.060> it's<00:01:22.180> convenient<00:01:22.660> to<00:01:22.870> just<00:01:22.900> take

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
up here so it's convenient to just take

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.470 
up here so it's convenient to just take
it<00:01:23.410> from<00:01:23.530> campus<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:25.060> Syracuse<00:01:25.450> University

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
it from campus the Syracuse University

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.730 
it from campus the Syracuse University
led<00:01:26.230> by<00:01:26.380> Nancy<00:01:26.860> cans<00:01:27.100> have<00:01:27.310> felt<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.730> need<00:01:27.970> to

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
led by Nancy cans have felt the need to

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.290 
led by Nancy cans have felt the need to
make<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.950> connections<00:01:30.430> between<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:31.000> hill

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
make the connections between the hill

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.000 
make the connections between the hill
and<00:01:31.540> downtown<00:01:31.900> Syracuse<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.500> lot<00:01:32.680> stronger

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
and downtown Syracuse a lot stronger

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.430 
and downtown Syracuse a lot stronger
than<00:01:33.190> they<00:01:33.430> had<00:01:33.700> been<00:01:33.940> so<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.630> was<00:01:34.780> to<00:01:34.990> make<00:01:35.200> a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
than they had been so it was to make a

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.640 
than they had been so it was to make a
clear<00:01:36.370> visible<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:37.450> again<00:01:37.900> free<00:01:38.290> link

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
clear visible and again free link

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.450 
clear visible and again free link
between<00:01:39.630> downtown<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.710> University<00:01:42.280> and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
between downtown and the University and

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.640 
between downtown and the University and
to<00:01:42.790> cut<00:01:43.000> what's<00:01:43.240> sometimes<00:01:43.600> called<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.230> town

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
to cut what's sometimes called the town
