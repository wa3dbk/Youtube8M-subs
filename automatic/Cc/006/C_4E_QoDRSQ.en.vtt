movement<00:00:12.509> synchronize<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.469> breath<00:00:13.730> today

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
movement synchronize to the breath today

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.810 
movement synchronize to the breath today
we'll<00:00:15.240> try<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.599> stay<00:00:16.170> physically<00:00:17.070> still<00:00:17.490> and

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
we'll try to stay physically still and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.720 
we'll try to stay physically still and
we'll<00:00:18.359> just<00:00:18.660> explore<00:00:19.320> internal<00:00:20.039> movement<00:00:20.550> of

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
we'll just explore internal movement of

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.800 
we'll just explore internal movement of
the<00:00:21.000> breathing<00:00:22.310> if<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.519> just<00:00:23.760> had<00:00:24.000> one<00:00:24.300> thing<00:00:24.660> to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
the breathing if I just had one thing to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.300 
the breathing if I just had one thing to
teach<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.260> would<00:00:25.470> be<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.830> abdominal

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
teach you it would be this abdominal

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.179 
teach you it would be this abdominal
breath<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.810> quite<00:00:28.170> simple<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:29.070> just

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
breath it's quite simple it's just

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.089 
breath it's quite simple it's just
breathing<00:00:29.820> with<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> belly<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:31.380> sometimes

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
breathing with the belly but sometimes

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.420 
breathing with the belly but sometimes
we<00:00:33.030> forget<00:00:33.270> how<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.870> do<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.320> due<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> stress

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
we forget how to do it due to the stress

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.310 
we forget how to do it due to the stress
and<00:00:36.200> to<00:00:37.200> lots<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.860> contraction<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.700> our<00:00:38.820> life

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
and to lots of contraction in our life

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.590 
and to lots of contraction in our life
it's<00:00:40.320> easier<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.160> be<00:00:41.309> done<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.940> line<00:00:42.360> down

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
it's easier to be done in line down

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.959 
it's easier to be done in line down
position<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.680> if<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.129> could<00:00:44.309> lie<00:00:44.579> down

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
position so if you could lie down

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
ribcage is expanding on exhalation it's

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.130 
ribcage is expanding on exhalation it's
contracting<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.270> move<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.840> heavy

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
contracting you have to move the heavy

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.760 
contracting you have to move the heavy
ribs<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:35.010> will<00:02:35.850> take<00:02:36.270> more<00:02:36.600> energy<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.410> will

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
ribs it will take more energy and will

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.760 
ribs it will take more energy and will
bring<00:02:38.010> your<00:02:38.190> less<00:02:38.550> oxygen<00:02:39.200> if<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.440> please

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
bring your less oxygen if you please

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.910 
bring your less oxygen if you please
with<00:02:41.370> your<00:02:41.730> belly<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.660> breath<00:02:42.959> gets<00:02:43.410> slower

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
with your belly the breath gets slower

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.780 
with your belly the breath gets slower
and<00:02:44.490> deeper<00:02:45.920> therefore<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.040> use<00:02:47.070> less<00:02:47.610> energy

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
and deeper therefore you use less energy

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.560 
and deeper therefore you use less energy
and<00:02:48.510> get<00:02:48.930> more<00:02:49.230> oxygen<00:02:49.440> but<00:02:50.130> it's<00:02:50.940> not<00:02:51.270> only

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
and get more oxygen but it's not only

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.490 
and get more oxygen but it's not only
this<00:02:51.959> reason<00:02:52.470> when<00:02:53.310> we<00:02:53.490> inhale<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.660> diaphragm

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
this reason when we inhale the diaphragm

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.830 
this reason when we inhale the diaphragm
is<00:02:55.860> moving<00:02:56.640> down<00:02:56.850> that's<00:02:57.090> why<00:02:57.240> your<00:02:57.450> bed<00:02:57.630> is

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
is moving down that's why your bed is

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.520 
is moving down that's why your bed is
bulging<00:02:58.110> out<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:59.090> this<00:03:00.090> movement<00:03:00.530> massaging

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
bulging out and this movement massaging

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.770 
bulging out and this movement massaging
all<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.890> internal<00:03:02.430> organs<00:03:03.030> they<00:03:03.300> leave<00:03:03.540> at

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
all the internal organs they leave at

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.449 
all the internal organs they leave at
the<00:03:03.870> pancreas<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.560> stomach<00:03:04.980> even<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.310> upper

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
the pancreas the stomach even the upper

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.500 
the pancreas the stomach even the upper
intestine<00:03:06.180> when<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.320> exhale<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.850> diaphragm

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
intestine when you exhale the diaphragm

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.220 
intestine when you exhale the diaphragm
is<00:03:09.660> moving<00:03:10.200> up<00:03:10.410> suck<00:03:11.010> in<00:03:11.160> your<00:03:11.190> belly<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.850> and

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
is moving up suck in your belly in and

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.210 
is moving up suck in your belly in and
that<00:03:13.230> will<00:03:13.410> massage<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.540> heart<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:16.220> the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
that will massage the heart and the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.580 
that will massage the heart and the
solar<00:03:17.459> plexus<00:03:17.670> very<00:03:18.390> important<00:03:18.780> nerve<00:03:18.989> center

therefore<00:03:20.519> with<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:20.910> abdominal<00:03:21.720> breaths<00:03:22.050> we

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
therefore with this abdominal breaths we

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.259 
therefore with this abdominal breaths we
are<00:03:22.410> constantly<00:03:22.860> massaging<00:03:23.790> all<00:03:24.030> the

are constantly massaging all the
internal<00:03:24.780> organs<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.620> also<00:03:26.130> turning<00:03:26.550> our

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
internal organs and also turning our

internal organs and also turning our
abdominal<00:03:27.450> muscles<00:03:28.580> you<00:03:29.580> can<00:03:29.790> do<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:30.180> type

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
abdominal muscles you can do this type

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.100 
abdominal muscles you can do this type
of<00:03:30.510> breathing<00:03:31.370> anywhere<00:03:32.370> anytime<00:03:32.870> lying<00:03:33.870> down

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
of breathing anywhere anytime lying down

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.190 
of breathing anywhere anytime lying down
could<00:03:34.500> be<00:03:34.620> easier<00:03:35.160> but<00:03:36.120> eventually<00:03:36.750> if<00:03:37.080> you
