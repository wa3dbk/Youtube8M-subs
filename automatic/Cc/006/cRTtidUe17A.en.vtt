getting<00:02:19.349> into<00:02:19.730> till<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.849> found<00:02:21.030> until<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.480> got<00:02:21.660> it

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
getting into till I found until I got it

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.720 
getting into till I found until I got it
apart<00:02:22.049> because<00:02:22.200> I'd<00:02:22.440> never<00:02:22.739> had<00:02:23.400> one<00:02:23.579> of<00:02:23.610> these

apart because I'd never had one of these

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.050 
apart because I'd never had one of these
apart<00:02:24.060> I'm<00:02:24.209> not<00:02:24.420> familiar<00:02:24.750> with<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.110> CVT<00:02:25.470> type

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
apart I'm not familiar with the CVT type

you<00:02:27.060> know<00:02:27.180> transmissions<00:02:27.989> or<00:02:28.170> drives<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.769> guess

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
you know transmissions or drives I guess

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.789 
you know transmissions or drives I guess
you<00:02:29.040> could<00:02:29.160> call<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.560> thought<00:02:31.650> I'd

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
you could call it and I just thought I'd

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.080 
you could call it and I just thought I'd
go<00:02:31.980> ahead<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.220> make<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.489> so<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.790> can<00:02:32.940> see

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
go ahead and make this so you can see

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.580 
go ahead and make this so you can see
that<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.390> pretty<00:02:33.690> simple<00:02:34.019> if<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.319> can<00:02:34.440> get

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
that it is pretty simple if you can get

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.110 
that it is pretty simple if you can get
so<00:02:34.769> far<00:02:34.950> as<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.190> change<00:02:35.220> your<00:02:35.579> belt<00:02:35.760> then<00:02:35.970> you

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
so far as to change your belt then you

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.930 
so far as to change your belt then you
can<00:02:36.299> change<00:02:36.540> your<00:02:36.660> clutch
