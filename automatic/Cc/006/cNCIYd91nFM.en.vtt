00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:09.420
 Hello everyone, so are you on the channel? 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:14.130
 Today I will continue the topic of self-made 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:18.300
 85 clamps like finish on the second 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.529
 parts we have new ideas here so here I am 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.359
 I want to share with you wanted 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.099
 to make 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:30.119
 fast-clamping such portable 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.329
 clamp based on the one i 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.399
 showed the second part everyone liked 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.680
 wooden version 8 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:45.120
 I decided to develop this topic here besides 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.640
 I have appeared here additionally 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.390
 interesting item 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.329
 such a clamping plate plate 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.079
 spring 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:02.559
 and they not only did not give advised one 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:06.380
 my subscriber is his nickname here is his piece 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:09.880
 I apologize if I incorrectly called here 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.880
 in general, he gave one idea 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.530
 conclude that this is the bar 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:19.220
 is a mediator that is how would 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:26.810
 gasket while clamping parts now I 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:33.280
 I'll show you how it looks to start 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.280
 stud m 16 strong enough 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.870
 this foot is fixed motionless on the world 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:46.790
 then we have to share 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.790
 part detail 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.440
 here is but an option such sold stores 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:03.530
 it is made of plastic and metal 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.740
 rather expensive these things though they 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.670
 of course very interesting good 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.400
 options to make such a budget 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.250
 which everyone can do action 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.610
 that you need to choose tight and beech wood 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.610
 ash oak here is here from as if made 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:33.790
 now show the device of this simple 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:37.630
 adaptation means it is clear to us 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:49.150
 this is our main moving element 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:49.150
 here eccentric wines you take off the plate 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:08.950
 bolted plate bottom here i am 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.700
 stuck plastic so smooth glossy 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:16.600
 to reduce friction 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.600
 means our eccentric 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.580
 that's all all the devices 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:40.630
 once again show the principle of operation take 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.630
 We put the parts on the lower bar 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.630
 skipping 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.739
 is hold and 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.050
 in principle, yes 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:18.770
 wooden construction is not even 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:23.220
 long here it is clear that the higher 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:25.980
 we pin our hairpin stronger 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.360
 how to pray and hold down one Korba 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.360
 film as if it were a detail 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.360
 letting go 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:47.240
 also this clamp can be put on 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.240
 table on the platform to clamp 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.780
 generally work on wood 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.259
 tools are very nice hands 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.259
 Keep 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:19.150
 one pleasure because it is 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.610
 wood for quality for strength not 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:26.190
 inferior to plastic 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:31.290
 even if something broke you suddenly there 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.290
 burst something to replace no problem 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:44.669
 this is all the service scars 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.169
 see you all 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.740
 watch my rollers be 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.740
 interesting
