 that we mentioned before at the beginning 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.869
 of the news that paco de lucia shot down

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.410
 international critic

 some list cross hotels languages â€‹â€‹united 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.180
 by the ruler of his guitar with his 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.489
 prodigious fusion or flamenco technique with 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.140
 jazz was the first to dare to 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.630
 do it and that's how it got to the top though 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.430
 also angered some purists for

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.649
 missing what I do not know that's what a 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.570
 I leave that dream researcher 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.100
 tireless throughout his career I look for 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.100
 new formulas as a hand the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.090
 tradition and another in innovation 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.689
 working its sounds with those of the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.490
 chick piano keys korea or 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.649
 filling the fez nights with the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.630
 strum of his guitar a guitar that 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.630
 It was his best travel companion 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.789
 s strum now also in asia paco 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.219

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.659
 Japan and there their influence is immense 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.430
 made he is one of those responsible for 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.659
 the growing passion that 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.659

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.380
 chubut passion for flamenco him 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.570
 led first to play the guitar 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.679
 Spanish as he had seen Paco do 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.239
 of Lucia and six years ago to dance them 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.160
 technique does not seem very difficult to me 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.950
 complicated is to put feeling and 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.569
 passion is one of almost 100 students of 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.550
 the main academy of Beijing that today 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.350
 premieres new arrival teacher 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.300
 Spain' 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.980
 Chinese curiosity for flamenco 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.120
 is increasing and during the class several 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.260
 curious people come to read and approve 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.690
 I started to get interested after seeing a 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.400
 I found the show very sexy 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.310
 He calls the faces a lot 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.770
 we put the arms expression 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.540
 in motion the force of flamenco in 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.090
 Asia, big tours are frequent 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.850
 Spanish companies in March starts the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.040
 from eva yerbabuena flamenco is one of 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.930
 the great ambassadors of Spain in 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.810
 asia especially in japan where there is more 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.120
 of 500 dance academies and 60,000 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.320
 students enrolled many more than 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.300
 in all Spain' 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.090
 the liking of slanted eyes that art 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.780
 de paco de lucia helped and will continue 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.780
 helping to grow 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.840
 and the world of flamenco feels 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.400
 orphan without the genius of the guitar what 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.410
 he said not of his friends and colleagues that 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.560
 They also highlighted its simplicity and 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.560
 humanity 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:30.110
 and the best guitar in the history of 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:32.060
 world of flamenco is the best 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.790
 I believe that 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.800
 is opaque for flamenco there is no one 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.800
 on an international level 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.959
 nobody had any doubt 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.770
 of what was paid and what of what has 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.270
 left 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.270
 and has left a school 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.489
 He was a person full of illusion 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.590
 and above all down a lot the music I 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.590
 I loved music and life 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.989
 on twitter his niece malÃº reminded him 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.209
 from a broken heart for alejandro 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.370
 sanz a goodbye that crunches the soul for 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.709
 I take an absence to remember 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.449
 always social networks could put 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.449
 today voice to the complain of his guitar 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:37.410
 for us and it will always be our 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.410
 there has never been and there will be no one like him 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.260
 ah
