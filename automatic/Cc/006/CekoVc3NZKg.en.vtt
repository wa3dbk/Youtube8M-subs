00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
I go back to elevation view let's say

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.160 
I go back to elevation view let's say
for<00:02:25.590> example<00:02:25.620> oh<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.550> forgot<00:02:27.240> that<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.569> needed<00:02:27.810> a

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
for example oh I forgot that I needed a

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.230 
for example oh I forgot that I needed a
drawer<00:02:28.709> stack<00:02:29.010> sitting<00:02:29.520> next<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.850> this<00:02:30.000> base

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
drawer stack sitting next to this base

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.680 
drawer stack sitting next to this base
cabinet<00:02:31.010> now<00:02:32.010> normally<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.090> had<00:02:33.270> sent<00:02:33.540> this

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
cabinet now normally if I had sent this

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.050 
cabinet now normally if I had sent this
to<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.990> drawing<00:02:34.380> page

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
to the drawing page

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.390 
to the drawing page
I<00:02:35.120> would<00:02:35.540> have<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.870> send<00:02:36.170> another<00:02:36.650> image<00:02:37.160> out

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
I would have to send another image out

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.550 
I would have to send another image out
there<00:02:37.670> since<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.239> have<00:02:38.450> changed<00:02:39.020> what's<00:02:39.230> on<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
there since I have changed what's on the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.070 
there since I have changed what's on the
screen<00:02:39.890> but<00:02:40.580> since<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:41.030> used<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.420> live<00:02:41.750> drawing

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
screen but since I used to live drawing

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.830 
screen but since I used to live drawing
I<00:02:42.380> don't<00:02:42.920> have<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.220> do<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.550> and<00:02:44.000> if<00:02:44.510> we<00:02:44.690> go

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
I don't have to do that and if we go

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.780 
I don't have to do that and if we go
back<00:02:44.870> up<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.500> drawing<00:02:45.860> page<00:02:46.069> you<00:02:46.340> see<00:02:46.610> that

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
back up to the drawing page you see that

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.370 
back up to the drawing page you see that
this<00:02:46.970> scene<00:02:47.300> updated<00:02:48.080> itself<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:49.370> include<00:02:50.380> the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
this scene updated itself to include the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.070 
this scene updated itself to include the
drawer<00:02:51.739> stack<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.360> I'll<00:02:53.360> just<00:02:53.569> do<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.900> one

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
drawer stack and I'll just do that one

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.530 
drawer stack and I'll just do that one
more<00:02:54.290> time<00:02:54.349> and<00:02:55.280> I'm<00:02:55.550> just<00:02:55.940> simply<00:02:56.150> going<00:02:56.420> to

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
more time and I'm just simply going to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.860 
more time and I'm just simply going to
stretch<00:02:56.959> this<00:02:57.200> cabinet<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:59.269> then<00:02:59.450> go<00:02:59.569> back<00:02:59.750> to

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
stretch this cabinet and then go back to

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.600 
stretch this cabinet and then go back to
the<00:02:59.989> drawing<00:03:00.319> page<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.860> as<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.099> can<00:03:01.250> see<00:03:01.459> it

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
the drawing page and as you can see it

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.229 
the drawing page and as you can see it
picked<00:03:01.819> it<00:03:01.970> up<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:02.870> that's<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.500> good<00:03:03.680> way<00:03:03.920> of<00:03:04.239> not

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
picked it up so that's a good way of not

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.320 
picked it up so that's a good way of not
having<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.840> update<00:03:06.830> your<00:03:07.280> drawing<00:03:07.670> pages<00:03:08.090> each

having to update your drawing pages each

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.110 
having to update your drawing pages each
time<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.900> make<00:03:09.049> changes<00:03:09.560> now<00:03:10.220> once<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.090> are

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
time you make changes now once you are

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.930 
time you make changes now once you are

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
it a static image that way no one can

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.410 
it a static image that way no one can
come<00:03:20.599> along<00:03:20.900> behind<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.010> make<00:03:22.880> changes

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
when you once you get it ready make it

when you once you get it ready make it
static<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:28.970> I'm<00:03:29.510> just<00:03:29.690> going<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:30.790> prove<00:03:31.790> this

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
static and I'm just going to prove this

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.809 
static and I'm just going to prove this
let's<00:03:32.390> say<00:03:32.569> let<00:03:32.810> me<00:03:32.840> delete<00:03:33.769> this<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.519> show

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
let's say let me delete this and show

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.339 
let's say let me delete this and show
you<00:03:34.880> that<00:03:35.060> it's<00:03:35.239> still<00:03:35.480> picking<00:03:35.870> things<00:03:36.049> up

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
you that it's still picking things up

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.920 
you that it's still picking things up
okay<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.340> now<00:03:37.940> let's<00:03:38.209> make<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.450> static

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
okay and now let's make it static

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.880 
okay and now let's make it static
converting<00:03:39.769> static<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:41.170> now<00:03:42.170> if<00:03:42.320> I<00:03:42.470> go<00:03:42.650> back

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
converting static and now if I go back

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.789 
converting static and now if I go back
and<00:03:43.160> add<00:03:44.709> this<00:03:45.709> drawer<00:03:46.070> stack<00:03:46.400> over<00:03:46.850> here<00:03:47.799> and
