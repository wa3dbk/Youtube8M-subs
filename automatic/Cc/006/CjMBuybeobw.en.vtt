00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.430
 hello to all and mouchan we find ourselves 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.770
 for this little focus video 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.599
 regards the game zombieland so 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.070
 you saw that we were very active on 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.150
 this game we tried to do a lot of 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.290
 tutorial to help players to 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.090
 apprehend juice that is a little bit 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.480
 may be difficult at first 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.110
 so we did a lot of videos on 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.469
 unfortunately we had small 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.079
 problems since jig so the creator 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.030
 of the game was a long way behind 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.679
 updates there is even a moment where he 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.749
 there was a radio silence of almost 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:47.199
 three months they the game was removed from 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:48.850
 steam he came back he swam enough 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.800
 consequent we will say that this rule 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.230
 the uci is not the game and has it again 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.170
 a radio silence while he had planned 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.850
 three huge swimming in December and 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.409
 unfortunately there is a bad 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.989
 new is that a priori the game is 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.639
 completely dead 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.650
 the only solution will be their purchase 

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:07.120
 so in this video I will try to 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.620
 make short tonight not much to 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.620
 to say but I will show you actually 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.420
 which leads me to tell you that and you 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.070
 see that other developers 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.800
 are trying to do other 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.420
 thing but I think that anyway 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.670
 that's saying that the game is 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.500
 dead for a long time 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.700
 even if he were redeemed he would have to 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.200
 wait at least a year for it to happen 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.070
 put back in place so it's still 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.110
 not a good news 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.470
 after that to say that there will be more 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.520
 wrong is not the case since we know 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.310
 although last time steve has 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.350
 removed the game from the stim store djiguÃ© 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.830
 income took out his hat and pulled out 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.480
 a maj 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.310
 so that's possible it's them 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.110
 do since for now the game is 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.940
 currently still on sale that you 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.200
 can still buy it what I do not 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.330
 do not advise of course if you 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.280
 have not yet but here I go 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.320
 tell you a little bit and then show you this 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.580
 that I found as information and 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.240
 then feel free to comment 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.500
 so do not pour out any vote n 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.330
 is for nothing we are not a developer 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.860
 of the game but here you do not hesitate to 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.210
 participate in reading what you think 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.460
 so how did the story begin for 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.530
 those who do not know which is geeky 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.929
 a developer has developed stomp 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.120
 england 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.739
 so the license belongs to him and everything 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.959
 simply we had problems since 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.129
 from the beginning there was very little magic 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.439
 he said he had problems at 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.680
 graphical engine level so towards 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.540
 june july we got a new and 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.230
 it's only in September when he 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.629
 sent a message 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.250
 once this team had withdrawn the game 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.650
 of the cim store with the many 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.609
 complaints that there was he came back and he 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.349
 said that in fact it was simply 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.760
 that he is working on the 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.590
 graphical engine except that there is no 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.629
 had communication from him it's up to 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.010
 say that neither a tweet nor a message about 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.540
 steam nothing at all nor on the forum 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.200
 official besides which was enough 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.730
 hassle 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.769
 so he came back in September in 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.989
 announcing some matches before december 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.730
 and in December three huge mage who 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.720
 will revolutionize the game with the new 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.900
 graphic engine etc 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.939
 so until then that left was back a 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.620
 little bit a little bit better there was 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.409
 do a maj with a little bit of 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.930
 renewal only arrived December nothing 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.560
 from all radio silence same thing and there 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.819
 the 16th on January 16th forgiveness a withdrawal 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.190
 began a turnaround 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.980
 vlad so a member 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.090
 of the development team that did 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.770
 this message that I put you on time 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.170
 current on the screen where they explain 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.960
 some things that worrying or even 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.520
 they announce outright his departure then 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.560
 on the official forum we can find 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.600
 so a vlad message from the 16th 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.010
 january where he explains that he's sorry 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.650
 but that he will have to temporarily 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.500
 stopped his work on this tone pine heaths 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.080
 so he feels that it makes several 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.640
 month that he received the last message from 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.320
 gilles so the developer as I 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.510
 wanted to say and he sent several 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.910
 messages to try to contact and 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.530
 who simply did not receive any 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.500
 reply 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.590
 he does not know if he has a serious reason 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.530
 so to ignore it a priori he says that 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.830
 my one way to not answer like 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.110
 it's hard to excuse sacred but says 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.600
 that the main problem is that he 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.200
 had spent the money priori 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.300
 a designer and that suddenly he spent 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.620
 this money from his own pocket and that he 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.030
 still waiting for gilles laurent 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.050
 purse so we're still in a 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.670
 pretty serious thing 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.910
 that is not only giga 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.730
 priori to how to say that politely we 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.620
 have us as a player but also 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.290
 had his team since he did 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.600
 spend money on its developers 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.010
 and then did not refund them so 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.740
 here he says if the silence continues 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.169
 there will have to be his participation in 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.630
 project and who serves what it depends 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.580
 precisely by selling the models he 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.380
 could do for the development of the 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.169
 host opinion so he is also 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.400
 behind that another vlad reaction 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:50.910
 that can be found on the steam hub 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.910
 where he says he's going on another 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.830
 project that will be called lille where he goes 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.690
 himself I do not know after with 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.400
 maybe two members of his pinion of 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.680
 leave for a new project from a corner 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.860
 of your projects in alpha test 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.570
 in my opinion it feels not good finally not 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.010
 in the sense that newspapers in question 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.120
 the honesty of de vlad 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.400
 but when we come from a team 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.010
 similar 1 and will be very very difficult 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.120
 for him to stand out and redo 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.639
 the same blow to existing customers 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.710
 because nothing of the slightest opinion 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.180
 very very well I think he 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.699
 will have a lot of trouble especially with the 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.939
 forest with I cross deeper I do not know 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.069
 what 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:27.080
 a game that copied a little bit of 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:31.520
 forest there are also many others 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.169
 serious halfaya he has h1n1 we like or not 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.599
 name it so that's it really 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.789
 difficult I think for him to do 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.189
 something for now if you 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.270
 click on the links the sites will be 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:43.639
 still under construction 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.680
 so here I think it's going to be very 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.499
 complicated for him to do anything 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.539
 thing we'll see but in any case me 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:52.400
 I will not be on this project I wanted 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.900
 right now yeah I 'm a player 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.120
 games on flights for example I like 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.439
 a lot of videos and here I am 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.000
 meaning not to go back on a 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:00.889
 other alphare we will continue with this 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.199
 strong is of course because the 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:04.849
 developers are still there all the 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.289
 months to make their match even if we 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.509
 can say that they do not advance much 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.939
 at least they advance we have news 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:12.349
 we have communication and it allows 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:15.050
 to be sure about what they will do 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:16.969
 So here I listen I hope you 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.620
 are not too disappointed because 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:19.699
 knew anyway I told you in 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.949
 the videos that had to be careful 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:24.529
 especially for alpha anyway if 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.759
 there are new images we will do them if 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:28.400
 there are new news I will put them in 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:29.839
 annotations on the video and if you 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.759
 before you go do not hesitate to them 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:33.620
 simply comment on 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.599
 share your opinion and I'll go back 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.699
 you on the next videos of our 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.770
 chain do not hesitate to visit it and 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:44.990
 and then commented halak and to share 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:47.419
 go fucking ciao but how am I 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.889
 gay actually I think you have to 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.889
 kill me for in my pocket 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:57.339
 yes go out your choices
