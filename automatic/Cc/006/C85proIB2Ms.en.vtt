terrain deserts mountains in the frigid

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.250 
terrain deserts mountains in the frigid
cold<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> blistering<00:00:35.910> heat<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.930> car

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
cold to the blistering heat this car

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.979 
cold to the blistering heat this car
even<00:00:37.500> went<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.280> Baja<00:00:38.610> 1000<00:00:39.300> off-road<00:00:39.780> race

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
even went in the Baja 1000 off-road race

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.810 
even went in the Baja 1000 off-road race
and<00:00:40.290> didn't<00:00:40.590> even<00:00:40.710> get<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.010> much<00:00:41.190> as<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.430> flat

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
and didn't even get so much as a flat

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.560 
and didn't even get so much as a flat
tire<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.170> incredibly<00:00:43.860> sturdy<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.670> we

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
tire so it is incredibly sturdy and we

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.029 
tire so it is incredibly sturdy and we
are<00:00:45.719> gonna<00:00:45.870> go<00:00:46.020> take<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.230> out<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.469> our<00:00:46.680> very<00:00:46.950> own

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
are gonna go take it out on our very own

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:57.230 
are gonna go take it out on our very own
rugged<00:00:47.670> terrain<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.270> see<00:00:48.539> how<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.899> handles

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.810 

so<00:00:58.240> this<00:00:58.390> is<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.630> six-speed<00:00:59.260> Automatic<00:00:59.860> and<00:01:00.100> it

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
so this is a six-speed Automatic and it

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.479 
so this is a six-speed Automatic and it
comes<00:01:01.120> with<00:01:01.300> a<00:01:01.870> stop-start<00:01:02.140> technology<00:01:02.489> so

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
comes with a stop-start technology so

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.400 
comes with a stop-start technology so
that<00:01:03.520> it<00:01:04.030> reduces<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.780> amount<00:01:04.900> of<00:01:05.019> time<00:01:05.140> that

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
that it reduces the amount of time that

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.230 
that it reduces the amount of time that
the<00:01:05.500> engine<00:01:05.800> spends<00:01:06.190> idling<00:01:06.580> which<00:01:06.850> is<00:01:07.000> great

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
the engine spends idling which is great

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.460 
the engine spends idling which is great
because<00:01:07.570> it<00:01:07.750> will<00:01:07.840> keep<00:01:07.960> you<00:01:08.110> from<00:01:08.290> wasting

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
because it will keep you from wasting

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.550 
because it will keep you from wasting
gas<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:09.940> actually<00:01:10.390> gets<00:01:10.690> pretty<00:01:10.990> decent

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
gas and this actually gets pretty decent

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.770 
gas and this actually gets pretty decent
mpg<00:01:12.160> for<00:01:12.490> a<00:01:12.520> truck<00:01:12.940> thanks<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.600> the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
mpg for a truck thanks to the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.050 
mpg for a truck thanks to the
lightweight<00:01:13.960> aluminum<00:01:14.650> alloy<00:01:14.950> panels<00:01:15.490> so

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
lightweight aluminum alloy panels so

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.840 
lightweight aluminum alloy panels so
it's<00:01:16.540> 18<00:01:17.170> in<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.530> city<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:17.979> 23<00:01:18.610> on<00:01:18.820> the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
it's 18 in the city and 23 on the

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.730 
it's 18 in the city and 23 on the
highway<00:01:19.210> so<00:01:19.810> what<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.050> also<00:01:20.200> love<00:01:20.380> about<00:01:20.440> this

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
highway so what I also love about this

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.700 
highway so what I also love about this
car<00:01:21.010> is<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.780> 360-degree<00:01:22.780> camera<00:01:23.260> view<00:01:23.440> that

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
car is the 360-degree camera view that

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.219 
car is the 360-degree camera view that
uses<00:01:24.100> exterior<00:01:24.729> cameras<00:01:25.180> in<00:01:25.390> order<00:01:25.720> to<00:01:25.869> create

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
uses exterior cameras in order to create

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.260 
uses exterior cameras in order to create
a<00:01:26.290> bird's-eye<00:01:26.800> view<00:01:26.830> of<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.280> truck<00:01:27.910> so<00:01:28.180> it

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
a bird's-eye view of the truck so it

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.359 
a bird's-eye view of the truck so it
really<00:01:28.450> helps<00:01:28.720> you<00:01:28.869> park<00:01:29.259> and<00:01:29.470> maneuver<00:01:29.890> when

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
really helps you park and maneuver when

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.770 
really helps you park and maneuver when
you're<00:01:30.520> getting<00:01:30.610> in<00:01:30.940> and<00:01:31.090> out<00:01:31.149> of<00:01:31.210> tight<00:01:31.570> spots

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
you're getting in and out of tight spots

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.310 
you're getting in and out of tight spots
or<00:01:32.259> for<00:01:32.649> narrow<00:01:32.890> roads<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.580> trails<00:01:34.200> also<00:01:35.200> as

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
or for narrow roads and trails also as

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.359 
or for narrow roads and trails also as
you're<00:01:35.440> backing<00:01:35.740> up<00:01:35.830> you<00:01:35.979> can<00:01:36.130> see<00:01:36.250> the

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
you're backing up you can see the

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.300 
you're backing up you can see the
dynamic<00:01:36.940> lines<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.930> curve<00:01:38.410> as<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.740> steering

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
dynamic lines that curve as the steering

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.130 
dynamic lines that curve as the steering
wheel<00:01:39.460> moves<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:40.060> this<00:01:40.450> again<00:01:40.690> is<00:01:40.750> really

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
wheel moves and this again is really

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.660 
wheel moves and this again is really
useful<00:01:41.560> if<00:01:41.770> you're<00:01:41.920> going<00:01:42.009> to<00:01:42.100> be<00:01:42.190> parallel

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
useful if you're going to be parallel

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.450 
useful if you're going to be parallel
parking<00:01:43.060> or<00:01:43.300> probably<00:01:44.080> more<00:01:44.289> likely<00:01:44.530> trying

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
parking or probably more likely trying

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:59.210 
parking or probably more likely trying
to<00:01:45.520> line<00:01:45.670> up<00:01:45.700> with<00:01:45.850> a<00:01:46.180> trailer

benefit<00:03:07.100> of<00:03:07.160> aluminum<00:03:07.850> is<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.300> it's<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.690> lot

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
benefit of aluminum is that it's a lot

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.229 
benefit of aluminum is that it's a lot
more<00:03:09.050> lightweight<00:03:09.410> so<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:10.340> vehicle<00:03:10.580> is<00:03:11.030> now

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
more lightweight so this vehicle is now

alright first we're just gonna load up
the<00:03:19.220> truck<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.520> think<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:19.940> can<00:03:20.120> get<00:03:20.900> this

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.240 

so<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.430> was<00:03:28.580> for<00:03:28.850> 2015<00:03:29.630> f-150<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.830> we<00:03:30.980> again

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
so that was for 2015 f-150 and we again

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.360 
so that was for 2015 f-150 and we again
had<00:03:31.460> the<00:03:31.610> 4x4<00:03:32.240> super<00:03:32.630> cool<00:03:32.810> area<00:03:33.170> and<00:03:33.440> it's<00:03:34.160> an
