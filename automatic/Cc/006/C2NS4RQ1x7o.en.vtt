00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.450 

while<00:00:01.170> I<00:00:01.199> has<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.800> ranch<00:00:02.610> limit<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.210> 100<00:00:03.929> meters

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 
while I has a ranch limit of 100 meters

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.980 
while I has a ranch limit of 100 meters
this<00:00:05.460> is<00:00:05.640> not<00:00:05.819> as<00:00:06.000> efficient<00:00:06.509> when<00:00:06.629> we<00:00:06.899> are

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
this is not as efficient when we are

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.320 
this is not as efficient when we are
talking<00:00:07.170> about<00:00:07.440> with<00:00:08.250> our<00:00:08.400> high<00:00:08.700> speed<00:00:08.760> zones

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
talking about with our high speed zones

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.839 
talking about with our high speed zones
right<00:00:09.750> so<00:00:10.260> what<00:00:10.559> we're<00:00:10.800> doing<00:00:10.830> here<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.610> we're

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
right so what we're doing here is we're

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.450 
right so what we're doing here is we're
having<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.719> diversion<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.259> Hannah<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:14.130> can

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
having the diversion and Hannah that can

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.060 
having the diversion and Hannah that can
extend<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.269> distance<00:00:15.529> significantly

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
extend the distance significantly

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.550 
extend the distance significantly
so<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.550> key<00:00:17.730> thing<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.150> our<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:19.080> our<00:00:19.199> bad

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
so the key thing in our in our bad

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.920 
so the key thing in our in our bad
customers<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:21.060> rationale<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.600> Hannah

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
customers in the rationale and Hannah

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.349 
customers in the rationale and Hannah
and<00:00:22.050> also<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.680> head<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.010> control<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:24.119> to

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
and also the head in control and this to

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.689 
and also the head in control and this to
work<00:00:24.570> together<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.800> able<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.039> extend<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
work together to be able to extend the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.900 
work together to be able to extend the
distance<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.359> up<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.750> five<00:00:28.050> kilometers<00:00:28.910> so

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
distance to up to five kilometers so

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.299 
distance to up to five kilometers so
this<00:00:30.150> will<00:00:30.359> be<00:00:30.539> very<00:00:30.720> useful<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.619> Quentin's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
this will be very useful in Quentin's

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.819 
this will be very useful in Quentin's
disaster<00:00:33.180> scenarios<00:00:33.719> when<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> South<00:00:34.590> Tower

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
disaster scenarios when the South Tower

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.770 
disaster scenarios when the South Tower
is<00:00:35.040> done<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.670> there<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:35.940> no<00:00:36.149> communication

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
is done so there is no communication

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.590 
is done so there is no communication
infrastructure<00:00:37.460> however<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.879> know<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.300> order

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
infrastructure however you know in order

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.410

to<00:00:39.840> enable<00:00:40.530> animation<00:00:41.149> dissemination<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
to enable animation dissemination the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.170 
to enable animation dissemination the
coordination<00:00:43.200> among<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> rescue<00:00:44.460> teams<00:00:44.760> and

coordination among the rescue teams and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.299 
coordination among the rescue teams and
the<00:00:45.329> control<00:00:45.690> centers<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the control centers we have to have a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.729 
the control centers we have to have a
structure<00:00:47.930> available<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.079> make<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> this

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
structure available to make all of this

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
structure available to make all of this
happen<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:50.940> we're<00:00:51.449> trying<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
happen and this is what we're trying to

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.290 
happen and this is what we're trying to
provide<00:00:52.410> when<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.070> use<00:00:53.250> directional<00:00:53.640> antennas

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
provide when we use directional antennas

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.389 
provide when we use directional antennas
there's<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.870> key<00:00:55.050> challenge<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.250> key

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
there's the key challenge the key

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.549 
there's the key challenge the key
challenge<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.090> when<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> direction<00:00:58.410> are

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
challenge is that when the direction are

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.150 
challenge is that when the direction are
not<00:00:58.800> aligned<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.760> communication<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.390> loud<00:01:01.160> so

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
not aligned the communication is loud so

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.240 
not aligned the communication is loud so
when<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.520> drones<00:01:02.789> are<00:01:03.059> moving<00:01:03.840> or<00:01:04.159> there's<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
when the drones are moving or there's a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.310 
when the drones are moving or there's a
big<00:01:05.460> wind<00:01:05.760> or<00:01:05.970> things<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
big wind or things like that the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.100 
big wind or things like that the
communication<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.220> easily<00:01:08.670> disrupted<00:01:09.119> so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
communication can be easily disrupted so

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.810 
communication can be easily disrupted so
what<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> rationale

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
what we have here is that the rationale

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.120 
what we have here is that the rationale
control<00:01:12.330> Pelican<00:01:13.110> self-aligned<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
control Pelican self-aligned the

the next generation aviation we cannot

the next generation aviation we cannot
rely<00:01:42.070> all<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.429> communications<00:01:43.090> through<00:01:43.420> the
