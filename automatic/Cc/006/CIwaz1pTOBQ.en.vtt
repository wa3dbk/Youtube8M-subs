00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.619 
able to really get a nice feel on it you
don't<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.910> worry<00:02:12.090> about<00:02:12.209> over

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
don't have to worry about over

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.630 
don't have to worry about over
tightening<00:02:13.050> it

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
tightening it

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.840 
tightening it
now<00:02:14.060> if<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.270> use<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.630> as<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.870> right<00:02:15.050> angle<00:02:15.850> it

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
now if you use it as the right angle it

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.780 
now if you use it as the right angle it
seems<00:02:17.180> like<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.540> get<00:02:17.890> an<00:02:18.890> even<00:02:19.400> better<00:02:21.790> turn

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
seems like you get an even better turn

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.850 
seems like you get an even better turn
on<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.240> what<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:23.870> really<00:02:24.230> would<00:02:24.320> like<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.650> see

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
on it what I really would like to see

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.200 
on it what I really would like to see
with<00:02:25.070> this<00:02:25.250> is<00:02:25.490> a<00:02:26.270> ratcheting<00:02:27.020> style<00:02:27.290> system

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
with this is a ratcheting style system

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.250 
with this is a ratcheting style system
you<00:02:29.210> know<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:31.010> would<00:02:31.100> be<00:02:31.130> really<00:02:31.190> sweet<00:02:32.260> so

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
you know that would be really sweet so

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.580 
you know that would be really sweet so
it<00:02:33.380> does<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.680> job<00:02:33.890> tightens<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:34.760> up<00:02:35.590> doesn't

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
it does the job tightens it up doesn't

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.930 
it does the job tightens it up doesn't
feel<00:02:36.740> like<00:02:36.860> it's<00:02:37.010> going<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.250> strip<00:02:37.520> out<00:02:37.700> or

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
feel like it's going to strip out or

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.980 
feel like it's going to strip out or
anything<00:02:38.150> like<00:02:38.420> that

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
anything like that

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.430 
anything like that
and<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.950> do<00:02:40.010> like<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.970> feature<00:02:41.240> of<00:02:41.390> using<00:02:41.959> the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.390 
and I do like the feature of using the
right<00:02:42.620> angle<00:02:42.980> on<00:02:43.100> it

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
right angle on it

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.890 
right angle on it
these<00:02:44.270> are<00:02:44.420> anywhere<00:02:44.750> from<00:02:45.020> 15<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:45.920> 20<00:02:46.070> bucks

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
ten bucks you could find let's say 10 to

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.630 
ten bucks you could find let's say 10 to
20<00:02:49.610> bucks<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:52.430> one's<00:02:52.640> loose<00:02:52.880> right<00:02:53.239> there

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
20 bucks that one's loose right there

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.949 
20 bucks that one's loose right there
you<00:02:55.640> just<00:02:55.820> push<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.090> down<00:02:56.390> in<00:02:56.570> there<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:56.810> it's

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
you just push it down in there and it's

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.400 
you just push it down in there and it's
fine<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.440> then<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.489> one<00:02:58.730> here<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.239> believe<00:03:00.200> is

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
fine and then this one here I believe is

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.590 
fine and then this one here I believe is
the<00:03:00.560> t8<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.930> would<00:03:03.350> be<00:03:03.920> your<00:03:04.190> pivot<00:03:04.700> on<00:03:04.880> most

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
the t8 that would be your pivot on most

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.490 
the t8 that would be your pivot on most
of<00:03:05.810> your<00:03:06.700> spider<00:03:07.700> cows<00:03:08.030> or<00:03:08.450> any<00:03:08.840> other<00:03:09.200> nice

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
of your spider cows or any other nice

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.880 
of your spider cows or any other nice
with<00:03:09.800> that<00:03:10.010> so<00:03:10.910> I'm<00:03:10.970> gonna<00:03:11.090> give<00:03:11.239> that<00:03:11.270> a<00:03:11.450> shot

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
with that so I'm gonna give that a shot

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.880 
with that so I'm gonna give that a shot
see<00:03:12.890> how<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.250> work<00:03:14.560> now<00:03:15.560> it's<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:15.770> little

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
see how that work now it's a little

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.220 
see how that work now it's a little
wider<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.850> then<00:03:17.030> say<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.390> car<00:03:17.600> saw<00:03:17.810> one<00:03:18.049> that<00:03:18.170> I

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
wider so then say the car saw one that I

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.320 
wider so then say the car saw one that I
got<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.650> feels<00:03:21.920> somewhat<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.670> little<00:03:22.970> more

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
got so it feels somewhat a little more

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.199 
got so it feels somewhat a little more
awkward<00:03:24.340> but<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.430> definitely<00:03:25.610> does<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.060> job

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
awkward but it definitely does the job

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.170 
awkward but it definitely does the job
though<00:03:26.860> and<00:03:27.860> with<00:03:27.980> having<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.400> bottle<00:03:28.580> opener

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
though and with having a bottle opener

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.850 
though and with having a bottle opener
on<00:03:29.209> it<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.769> light<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.940> get<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.680> few<00:03:33.680> more

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
on it and the light you get a few more

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.970 
on it and the light you get a few more
features<00:03:34.310> than<00:03:34.340> just<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.290> regular<00:03:36.290> Kershaw

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
features than just the regular Kershaw

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.180

on<00:03:37.360> but<00:03:38.360> this<00:03:38.480> one<00:03:38.660> is<00:03:38.780> good<00:03:38.959> also<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:40.130> just

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.539 
on but this one is good also it just
doesn't<00:03:40.790> have<00:03:41.470> all<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.830> extra<00:03:43.040> bells<00:03:43.370> and

doesn't have all the extra bells and
whistles<00:03:43.940> that<00:03:44.209> this<00:03:44.360> one<00:03:44.570> has<00:03:44.920> so<00:03:45.920> I<00:03:45.950> like<00:03:46.190> it
