00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
like a carpet on a mascara wand but if I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.770 
like a carpet on a mascara wand but if I
just<00:00:31.980> kind<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.219> run<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.700> on<00:00:33.059> my<00:00:33.360> hand<00:00:33.570> there

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
just kind of run that on my hand there

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.120 
just kind of run that on my hand there
as<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.110> guys<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.590> see<00:00:34.649> like<00:00:34.980> there's

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
as you guys can see like there's

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.310 
as you guys can see like there's
actually<00:00:35.700> little<00:00:36.030> tiny<00:00:36.329> particles<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.110> come

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
actually little tiny particles that come

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.500 
actually little tiny particles that come
off<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.950> wand<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.879> actually<00:00:39.300> what

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
off of the wand so that is actually what

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.660 
off of the wand so that is actually what
adheres<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> your<00:00:40.590> lashes<00:00:40.770> okay<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.640> first

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
adheres to your lashes okay so the first

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.729 
adheres to your lashes okay so the first
step<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.660> apply<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> thin<00:00:43.500> coat<00:00:43.530> of

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
step is just to apply a thin coat of

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.889 
step is just to apply a thin coat of
your<00:00:44.250> own<00:00:44.430> mascara<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> I'm<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:45.870> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
your own mascara and I'm just going to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.660 
your own mascara and I'm just going to
be<00:00:46.020> using<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.469> voluminous<00:00:46.739> million<00:00:47.430> lashes

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
be using the voluminous million lashes

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.990 
be using the voluminous million lashes
excess<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> second<00:00:49.739> step<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.579> apply<00:00:50.760> an

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
excess so the second step is to apply an

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.319 
excess so the second step is to apply an
even<00:00:51.270> coat<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.920> transplanting<00:00:52.920> gel<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.940> lashes

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
even coat of transplanting gel on lashes

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.510 
even coat of transplanting gel on lashes
so<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.079> definitely<00:00:55.530> something<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.250> is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
so this is definitely something that is

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.970 
so this is definitely something that is
completely<00:00:56.850> different<00:00:57.570> than<00:00:57.870> anything<00:00:58.800> that

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
completely different than anything that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.069 
completely different than anything that
I<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.100> ever<00:00:59.370> done<00:00:59.579> before<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.359> gel<00:01:00.629> just

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
I have ever done before and the gel just

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.149 
I have ever done before and the gel just
looks<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.739> your<00:01:02.280> kind<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.760> standard<00:01:03.270> mascara

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
looks like your kind of standard mascara

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.390 
looks like your kind of standard mascara
and<00:01:05.990> then<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> instructions<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.979> says<00:01:08.010> to

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and then on the instructions it says to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.710 
and then on the instructions it says to
immediately<00:01:09.150> put<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:11.270> natural<00:01:12.270> fibers

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
immediately put on the natural fibers

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.219 
immediately put on the natural fibers
before<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.260> has<00:01:13.409> time<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.830> drive

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.750 

okay<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:18.290> now<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:18.770> have<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.100> fibers<00:01:19.460> on<00:01:19.640> my

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760

recommend<00:01:44.810> doing<00:01:45.380> this<00:01:45.530> before<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.490> put<00:01:46.670> on

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
recommend doing this before you put on

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.490 
recommend doing this before you put on
your<00:01:46.909> other<00:01:47.060> makeup<00:01:47.570> so<00:01:47.930> i'm<00:01:48.140> just<00:01:48.170> going<00:01:48.440> to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
your other makeup so i'm just going to

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.680 
your other makeup so i'm just going to
do<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:49.039> zoom<00:01:49.460> in<00:01:49.700> so<00:01:49.910> you<00:01:49.940> guys<00:01:50.149> can<00:01:50.390> see<00:01:50.450> the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
do a zoom in so you guys can see the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.300 
do a zoom in so you guys can see the
final<00:01:50.930> product<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:51.560> this<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:51.860> what<00:01:51.979> my<00:01:52.070> lashes

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
final product so this is what my lashes

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.279 
final product so this is what my lashes
look<00:01:52.670> like<00:01:52.880> close<00:01:53.180> up<00:01:53.390> definitely<00:01:54.080> think<00:01:54.229> that

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
look like close up definitely think that

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.410 
look like close up definitely think that
there<00:01:54.530> is<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:55.070> pretty<00:01:55.520> large<00:01:55.820> difference

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
there is a pretty large difference

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.389 
there is a pretty large difference
especially<00:01:56.690> how<00:01:57.140> I'm<00:01:57.289> not<00:01:57.500> wearing<00:01:57.860> any

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
especially how I'm not wearing any

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.249 
especially how I'm not wearing any
eyeliner<00:01:58.880> at<00:01:59.090> all<00:01:59.240> but<00:01:59.539> on<00:01:59.660> the<00:01:59.750> card<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.110> says

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
eyeliner at all but on the card it says

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.990 
eyeliner at all but on the card it says
that<00:02:00.410> you<00:02:00.440> can<00:02:00.619> do<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.860> in<00:02:00.950> multiple<00:02:01.100> times<00:02:01.670> so

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
that you can do it in multiple times so

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.190 
that you can do it in multiple times so
I<00:02:02.030> think<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.420> I'm<00:02:02.509> just<00:02:02.720> going<00:02:02.869> to<00:02:02.899> try<00:02:02.990> and

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
I think that I'm just going to try and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.910 
I think that I'm just going to try and
repeat<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.649> process

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.470 

okay<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.430> what<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.670> looks<00:02:11.820> like<00:02:12.030> close

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
okay so this is what it looks like close

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.560 
okay so this is what it looks like close
up<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:13.370> two<00:02:14.370> rounds<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.120> whole<00:02:15.300> entire

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
up on two rounds of the whole entire

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.420 
up on two rounds of the whole entire
process<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.410> overall<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.860> think<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.370> is

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
process so overall I think that this is

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.550 
process so overall I think that this is
definitely<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> game-changer<00:02:18.600> in<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.320> makeup

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
definitely a game-changer in the makeup

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.980 
definitely a game-changer in the makeup
world<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.070> mean<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.400> have<00:02:20.640> never<00:02:20.970> tried<00:02:21.330> anything

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
world I mean I have never tried anything

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.050 
world I mean I have never tried anything
like<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.190> i'm<00:02:23.220> pretty<00:02:23.610> sure<00:02:23.850> on<00:02:23.940> a

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
like this so i'm pretty sure on a

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.810 
like this so i'm pretty sure on a
website<00:02:24.240> i<00:02:24.510> think<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:24.930> like<00:02:25.400> 1754<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.550> kid

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
website i think it's like 1754 the kid

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.720 
website i think it's like 1754 the kid
so<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.630> comes<00:02:28.080> with<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.350> gel<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.130> then<00:02:29.400> also

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
so it comes with the gel and then also

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.620 
so it comes with the gel and then also
the<00:02:30.360> fibers<00:02:30.960> case<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.710> very<00:02:32.220> very<00:02:32.850> luxurious

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
the fibers case is very very luxurious

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.110 
the fibers case is very very luxurious
it<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.020> very<00:02:34.440> durable<00:02:34.770> so<00:02:35.460> I'm<00:02:35.610> just<00:02:35.850> really

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
it is very durable so I'm just really

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.550 
it is very durable so I'm just really
looking<00:02:36.150> forward<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.780> trying<00:02:36.960> this<00:02:37.170> product

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
looking forward to trying this product

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.620 
looking forward to trying this product
when<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.710> don't<00:02:38.010> have<00:02:38.220> any<00:02:38.490> face<00:02:38.970> makeup<00:02:39.300> on

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
when I don't have any face makeup on

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.540 
when I don't have any face makeup on
just<00:02:39.990> cuz<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.800> black<00:02:41.100> stuff<00:02:41.370> is

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
just cuz like the black stuff is

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.570 
just cuz like the black stuff is
seriously<00:02:42.030> or<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.440> gotta<00:02:43.740> go<00:02:43.980> take<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.220> off

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
seriously or so I gotta go take that off

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.820 
seriously or so I gotta go take that off
personally<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.780> don't<00:02:45.930> think<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.650> looks

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
personally I don't think that it looks

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.590 
personally I don't think that it looks
like<00:02:47.010> I'm<00:02:47.250> wearing<00:02:47.490> false<00:02:47.820> lashes<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.300> think

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
like I'm wearing false lashes I think

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.570 
like I'm wearing false lashes I think
that<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:48.990> gives<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.530> different<00:02:50.100> kind<00:02:50.459> of

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
that just gives a different kind of

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.390 
that just gives a different kind of
effect<00:02:50.940> like<00:02:51.600> my<00:02:51.959> lashes<00:02:52.230> are<00:02:52.680> definitely

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
effect like my lashes are definitely

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.130 
effect like my lashes are definitely
more<00:02:53.580> full<00:02:53.880> but<00:02:54.270> unique<00:02:54.570> products<00:02:55.020> are

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
more full but unique products are

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.710 
more full but unique products are
