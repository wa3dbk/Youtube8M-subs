00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.579
 The following techniques are used for groin strains or strains of the adductor muscles. 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.649
 Itâ€™s actually a muscle strain on the inside of the thigh. 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.009
 0:00:19.009,0:00:22.590 This trick we have to make the muscles have some stretch 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.099
 We let the legs stretch to the side 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.220
 At least this location 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.349
 Stretch but stay comfortable 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.310
 I will let you tear off a bandage. 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:41.310
 Make a fixed point at the end 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.210
 We put the fixed point on the medial tendon as high as possible. 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.629
 well 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.629
 The legs still have to stretch, we uncover the back paper 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.540
 Now we actually can tear the bandage if you want. 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.540
 0:01:08.040,0:01:10.140 We bypassed the pain point bandage and no tension 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.140
 0:01:17.360,0:01:21.390 Ok, do the same thing on the other piece. 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.439
 A single piece is enough 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.910
 If you don't want it, we can try another piece. 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.910
 Again, we have to make a fixed point 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.290
 This time we put a fixed point on the skin. 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.690
 Just on the back of the thigh 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.710
 As close as possible to the tendon or pain point 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.680
 Uncover the back paper 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.460
 Over the pain point 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.960
 Now we tear open a piece 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.260
 Itâ€™s good to continue to tear this piece apart. 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.770
 0:01:59.770,0:02:04.729 We pull the skin to the fixed point and you apply a moderate tension on the bandage. 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.979
 Continue and then paste 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.389
 Do the same thing on other bandages 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.239
 0:02:13.239,0:02:17.139 One or two inches of tension-free bandage at the end 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.579
 You can use this technique to combine ice and slow stretch 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:21.090
 0:02:21.090,0:02:22.969 to treat inguinal strain
