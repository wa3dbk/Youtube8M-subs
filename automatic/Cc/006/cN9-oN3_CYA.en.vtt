applies<00:01:03.960> dry<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.860> then<00:01:05.519> I'll<00:01:05.729> also<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.330> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
applies dry and then I'll also do a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.200 
applies dry and then I'll also do a
swatch<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.170> wet<00:01:07.500> with<00:01:08.280> some<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.700> fix<00:01:08.909> plus

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
so I just tapped a little bit of it out

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.429 
so I just tapped a little bit of it out
on<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.240> back<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.420> my<00:01:12.600> hand<00:01:12.930> from<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
on the back of my hand from the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.249 
on the back of my hand from the
container<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.380> how<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.590> appears

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
container and so that is how it appears

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.039 
container and so that is how it appears
with<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.500> light<00:01:20.130> shining<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049

with shining on there so you can see the
shimmer<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.659> person<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.799> very<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
end of the day so not sure if there's

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.999 
end of the day so not sure if there's
another<00:01:57.630> base<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.079> would<00:01:58.170> work<00:01:58.290> well<00:01:58.770> with

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
another base that would work well with

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.370 
another base that would work well with
these<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.520> that<00:02:00.329> base<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.869> used<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.229> mean

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
these but that base that I used I mean

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.050 
these but that base that I used I mean
normally<00:02:01.590> you

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
normally you

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.569 
normally you
have<00:02:02.360> no<00:02:02.630> problems<00:02:03.049> whatsoever<00:02:03.250> so<00:02:04.250> I'm<00:02:04.490> just

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
have no problems whatsoever so I'm just

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.080 
have no problems whatsoever so I'm just
going<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.790> take<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.060> little<00:02:05.450> bit<00:02:05.689> of<00:02:05.750> this<00:02:06.020> and

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
going to take a little bit of this and

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.749 
going to take a little bit of this and
cap<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.119> off<00:02:08.360> into<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.780> lid<00:02:08.989> here<00:02:09.459> I'll<00:02:10.459> get<00:02:10.610> it

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
cap it off into the lid here I'll get it

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.080 
cap it off into the lid here I'll get it
on<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.120> rush<00:02:12.250> I'll<00:02:13.250> get<00:02:13.370> quite<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.640> bit<00:02:13.700> of

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
on the rush I'll get quite a bit of

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.460 
on the rush I'll get quite a bit of
product<00:02:14.390> on<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.630> brush<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:14.989> you<00:02:15.080> can<00:02:15.230> see<00:02:15.440> I

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
product on the brush so you can see I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.500 
product on the brush so you can see I
mean<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:15.770> got<00:02:15.950> quite<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.190> bit<00:02:16.370> there<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:17.209> then

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
mean I got quite a bit there and then

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.500 
mean I got quite a bit there and then
I'm<00:02:17.599> just<00:02:17.630> going<00:02:18.020> to<00:02:19.000> spray<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.120> with<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.300> little

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
I'm just going to spray it with a little

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.170 
I'm just going to spray it with a little
bit<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.750> fix+<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.620> then<00:02:22.370> i'll<00:02:22.519> apply<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:22.940> right

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
bit of fix+ and then i'll apply it right

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.640 
bit of fix+ and then i'll apply it right
below

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.610 

so<00:02:31.650> there<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.400> dry<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.270> there<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.290> wet

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
so there it is dry and there it is wet

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.770 
so there it is dry and there it is wet
so<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:36.510> can<00:02:36.690> see<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.260> almost<00:02:38.360> applies<00:02:39.360> better

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
so you can see it almost applies better

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.620 
so you can see it almost applies better
dry<00:02:40.320> it's<00:02:40.980> more<00:02:41.220> concentrated<00:02:42.090> looking<00:02:42.420> and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
dry it's more concentrated looking and

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.970 
dry it's more concentrated looking and
normally<00:02:42.990> that's<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.350> case<00:02:43.470> when<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.770> bomb

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
normally that's the case when you bomb

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.620 
normally that's the case when you bomb
wet<00:02:44.190> but<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:44.430> almost<00:02:44.670> like<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.030> disappears

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
wet but it's almost like it disappears

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.800 
wet but it's almost like it disappears
when<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.760> apply<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.820> one<00:02:48.150> wet<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.540> doesn't

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
when you apply this one wet it doesn't

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.550 
when you apply this one wet it doesn't
give<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:48.990> really<00:02:49.290> good<00:02:49.320> foiled<00:02:49.950> look<00:02:51.560> alright

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
give a really good foiled look alright

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.280 
give a really good foiled look alright
so<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.490> next<00:02:53.520> color<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:54.600> picked<00:02:54.990> up<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.470> in

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
so the next color that I picked up is in

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.590 
so the next color that I picked up is in
number<00:02:58.670> 40<00:02:59.670> which<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.180> improper<00:03:01.050> cover<00:03:02.600> it's

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
number 40 which is improper cover it's

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.910 
number 40 which is improper cover it's
probably<00:03:04.170> not<00:03:04.470> going<00:03:04.740> to<00:03:04.830> focus<00:03:06.680> of<00:03:07.680> course

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
probably not going to focus of course

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.490 
probably not going to focus of course
not<00:03:08.100> but<00:03:08.670> anyway<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.239> just<00:03:09.330> like<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.840> bronzy

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
not but anyway it's just like a bronzy

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.199 
not but anyway it's just like a bronzy
brown<00:03:10.530> with<00:03:11.250> some<00:03:11.459> gold<00:03:11.610> shimmers<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:14.209> so

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
brown with some gold shimmers to it so

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.940 
brown with some gold shimmers to it so
I'll<00:03:15.420> do<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.720> same<00:03:15.930> thing<00:03:16.200> I'll<00:03:16.500> apply<00:03:16.860> a

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
I'll do the same thing I'll apply a

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.130 
I'll do the same thing I'll apply a
little<00:03:17.220> bit<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:17.670> just<00:03:17.720> directly<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.810> my

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
little bit of it just directly to my

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.190 
little bit of it just directly to my
hand<00:03:23.180> there's<00:03:24.180> just<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.480> few<00:03:24.510> specks<00:03:24.959> of<00:03:25.080> it

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
hand there's just a few specks of it

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.750 
hand there's just a few specks of it
because<00:03:25.380> obviously<00:03:25.530> these<00:03:25.980> things<00:03:26.280> little

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
because obviously these things little

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.540 
because obviously these things little
goes<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.000> long<00:03:27.150> way<00:03:27.860> with<00:03:28.860> any<00:03:29.190> pigment

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
goes a long way with any pigment

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.140 
goes a long way with any pigment
normally<00:03:30.920> so<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:33.769> kind<00:03:34.769> of<00:03:34.860> sheer<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.880> does

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
normally so it is kind of sheer it does

light it almost has like an iridescent

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.449 
light it almost has like an iridescent
you<00:03:55.170> can<00:03:55.320> see<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> little<00:03:55.739> bit<00:03:55.920> of<00:03:55.980> green<00:03:56.430> a

little bit of red shimmers so there's

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.370 
little bit of red shimmers so there's
that<00:04:01.140> one<00:04:01.350> dry<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.070> then<00:04:02.790> I'm<00:04:02.970> going<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.540> just

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
that one dry and then I'm going to just

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.870 
that one dry and then I'm going to just
tap<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.860> little<00:04:05.400> bitty<00:04:05.580> bit<00:04:06.650> into<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:08.340> jar<00:04:08.610> here

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
tap a little bitty bit into the jar here

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.420 
tap a little bitty bit into the jar here
if<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.090> can<00:04:09.239> see<00:04:09.269> that<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:09.959> then<00:04:10.920> I'm<00:04:11.190> going

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
if you can see that and then I'm going

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.520 
if you can see that and then I'm going
to<00:04:11.640> get<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:12.090> back<00:04:12.360> side<00:04:12.690> of<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.989> same<00:04:13.230> brush

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
to get the back side of the same brush

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.990
