00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
flashlight and then as you can see we

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.460 
flashlight and then as you can see we
have<00:05:07.820> no<00:05:08.240> flashlight<00:05:08.780> if<00:05:08.870> I<00:05:08.960> could<00:05:09.080> pull<00:05:09.320> up<00:05:09.410> in

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
have no flashlight if I could pull up in

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.960 
have no flashlight if I could pull up in
the<00:05:09.500> right<00:05:09.650> side<00:05:09.860> there<00:05:10.220> we<00:05:10.310> go<00:05:10.430> we<00:05:10.610> have<00:05:10.760> no

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
the right side there we go we have no

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.060 
the right side there we go we have no
flashlight<00:05:11.540> here<00:05:11.780> so<00:05:11.990> that<00:05:12.560> is<00:05:12.770> another

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
flashlight here so that is another

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.760 
flashlight here so that is another
option<00:05:13.520> to<00:05:13.820> customize<00:05:14.030> the<00:05:14.600> side<00:05:14.930> views<00:05:15.470> and

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
option to customize the side views and

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.450 
option to customize the side views and
then<00:05:16.280> we<00:05:16.400> also<00:05:16.550> have<00:05:16.820> date<00:05:17.330> header<00:05:17.780> actions

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
then we also have date header actions

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.860 
then we also have date header actions
underneath<00:05:19.460> that<00:05:19.760> so<00:05:20.090> this<00:05:20.300> is<00:05:20.539> a<00:05:20.570> whole<00:05:20.840> other

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
underneath that so this is a whole other

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.540
