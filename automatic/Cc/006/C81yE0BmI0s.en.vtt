00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
off because it creates an inconsistency

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
caused when another reason let's go back

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.789 
caused when another reason let's go back
I'm<00:01:57.119> gonna<00:01:57.600> piggyback<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.290> little<00:01:58.619> bit
