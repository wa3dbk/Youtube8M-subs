 on the side guys here fir tree in 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.210
 New Year's Eve stands in front of the door 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.179
 that's over and I'm in 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.330
 hamburg and with at the start red block 1 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.720
 be 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.339
 I am glad to welcome you 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.529
 have to welcome you hearts 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:29.150
 Customers have been our hometown and 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.320
 exactly 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.800
 Nonetheless, want to go to one again 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.590
 topic is a tiresome topic like 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.210
 Looks like with alcohol and a lot of food 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.190
 I believe one or the other and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.750
 mischa also posted it to him 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.960
 is not so good he has one or 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.910
 two kilos are too much on the ribs 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.130
 That's fine with you 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.870
 nourished or we have each other as us 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.460
 just experience the between the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.520
 Of course, holidays pay attention to the holidays 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.870
 theory that it is important what between 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.200
 between new year and christmas is 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.180
 not between christmas and think 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.630
 because you 're going to review it again 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.920
 was there was what one knows why there are so 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.299
 Willing moments where you really get his 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.729
 loved ones around and in one 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.079
 longer period and you should 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.060
 You can do it anyway 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.049
 reasonably close one but one 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.909
 should definitely be the time 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.390
 Treat yourself to the full enjoyment of us 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.999
 both are just more or balcony 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.649
 that does not mean we eat what we eat 

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:27.569
 between the fingers that is 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.759
 still 80 to 90 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.480
 percent with me quite clean anyway 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.950
 high culkin calorie needs and 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.870
 calorie share but nonetheless 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.820
 of course, the wampe must not arise 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.670
 ie the sixpack approach has to be there 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.220
 So who am I giving you in any case 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.620
 So you have quite a few tips 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.240
 how can you possibly over now 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.760
 so save the holidays as possible 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.710
 You should also say so parents ey 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.360
 I do not mind cookies the biscuits 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.570
 which was left over from christmas 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.570
 are 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.190
 then I could be there now 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.040
 skilfully transfer on our channel 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.010
 because we have christmas cookies so 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.990
 Say protein speculators and cookies 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.090
 We have so-called coaching trade 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.250
 and there to match what's going on meanwhile 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.020
 yes in the past but is there 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.540
 We offered because our followers 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.180
 after that have written the possibility 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.520
 ok to do healthy biscuits there 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.560
 you have adopted as recipes or 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.020
 what actually gets the accusation 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.240
 quite interested exactly what weekly 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.190
 At the start is healthy food 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.930
 for a varied but not 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.610
 always here rice and turkey with us it is 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.960
 do not just eat that 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.420
 has to work but it also has to 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.100
 Taste okay is natural 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.940
 Interesting 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.830
 Anyway, now that we have now 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.620
 Of course, eating alcohol is natural as well 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.200
 always such a theme says you toast 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.090
 Definitely, so I'm the one 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.500
 So man with me is more like me 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.330
 abstain from alcohol 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.959
 but it is also to look at 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.700
 and as an officer, it also belongs to it 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.200
 to kick off yes then sometimes 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.110
 Drinking a drink does not mean it now 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.260
 that if I drink a piece of that 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.730
 all of my all my stuff completely 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.830
 but be thrown over the pile 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.750
 it's really just a toast 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.330
 I also drink afterwards nothing but 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.610
 So how are you doing for this day? 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.350
 Today is also a special day 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.770
 once a year should be in any case 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.060
 or I want to praise him for the first time he is 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.810
 if tomorrow he survived one addresses 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.280
 to midnight is a yes alcohol-free force 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.040
 An alcohol for me last year 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.939
 im i have 2012 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.739
 I look back on last year 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.849
 I drank five six times alcohol 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.019
 have noticed everytime I am alcohol 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.540
 have drunk 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.379
 can click here accordingly 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.480
 so I eventually a bet 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.879
 I finished that from 0 o'clock for 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.750
 2013 did not drink alcohol 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.930
 persevered 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.879
 birthday no alcohol several strong 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.950
 no alcohol 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.900
 especially when we make a quiet 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.099
 or what to eat if I am 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.680
 I have to say a glass now and then 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.420
 red wine yes a glass of red wine is less 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.150
 traffic you can really say that 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.680
 this alcohol content of 0.2 red wine 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.859
 even shit on the contrary 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.590
 Physicians already have healthy health in mind 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.939
 scientifically proven 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.470
 it is always the quantity that makes you 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.299
 If I have a glass of red wine there 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.459
 I have not even tasted it 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.650
 that is why the highest respect was the 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.840
 definition definitely and I know how 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.660
 difficult that is 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.949
 Well, that 's a very cool one 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.380
 I find macula attitude 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.960
 the issue was resolved relatively quickly 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.000
 at least we can give you tips 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.120

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.880

 the sport in the long term neat 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.509
 Really wanted to do that 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.820
 as disciplined as possible 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.690

 that we are here today 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.110
 just a little bit concerned because so 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.420
 squeezed and I think guys 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.130
 easy it is also still 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.990

 Just make something it is definitely

 A few tables with the water 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.490
 abut 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.410
 I do not have to be a beer , but instead 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.720
 rather than getting through facebook or youtube 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.160
 in the halo so nice thing that announce 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.410

 Imagine this we see we are doing well
