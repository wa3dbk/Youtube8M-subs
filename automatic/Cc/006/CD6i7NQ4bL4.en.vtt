right<00:02:03.530> who<00:02:04.530> thinks<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> beast<00:02:05.280> 8/8

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
right who thinks have a beast 8/8

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.870 
right who thinks have a beast 8/8
leading<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.149> team

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
leading the team

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.139 
leading the team
around<00:02:07.510> Italy<00:02:08.020> yeah<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.440> think<00:02:09.069> some<00:02:09.220> abuse<00:02:09.490> to

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
around Italy yeah I think some abuse to

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.090 
around Italy yeah I think some abuse to
be<00:02:10.600> honest<00:02:10.869> some<00:02:11.170> of<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.350> best<00:02:11.950> athletes

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
be honest some of the best athletes

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.610 
be honest some of the best athletes
would<00:02:12.520> be<00:02:12.640> in<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.819> backs<00:02:13.060> but<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.390> think<00:02:13.660> that

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
would be in the backs but I think that

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.949 
would be in the backs but I think that
the<00:02:15.250> ones<00:02:15.459> who<00:02:15.580> think<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.180> bit<00:02:16.330> athletes

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
the ones who think that the bit athletes

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.390 
the ones who think that the bit athletes
will<00:02:17.110> probably<00:02:17.380> be<00:02:17.470> in<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.620> front<00:02:17.800> row

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
will probably be in the front row

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.890 
will probably be in the front row
guys<00:02:19.270> like<00:02:19.510> Christina<00:02:20.020> did<00:02:20.860> Robertson<00:02:21.459> and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
guys like Christina did Robertson and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.290 
guys like Christina did Robertson and
those<00:02:22.900> kind<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.230> people<00:02:23.380> they<00:02:23.709> often<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:25.180> know

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
those kind of people they often you know

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.910 
those kind of people they often you know
they<00:02:25.480> say<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.080> they<00:02:26.350> know<00:02:26.560> how<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.709> do

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
they say that they know how to do

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.229 
they say that they know how to do
everything

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
everything

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.370 
everything
they're<00:02:28.630> probably<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.930> ones<00:02:28.989> that<00:02:29.319> would

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
they're probably the ones that would

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.690 
they're probably the ones that would
tell<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.650> they're<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.340> best
