00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
there's a lot of background noise and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.830 
there's a lot of background noise and
try<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.399> make<00:01:59.610> yourself<00:01:59.729> as<00:02:00.119> audible<00:02:00.659> as

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
try to make yourself as audible as

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.420 
try to make yourself as audible as
possible<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.590> if<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.950> are<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.219> an<00:02:02.310> environment

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
possible so if you are in an environment

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.980 
possible so if you are in an environment
where<00:02:02.909> there's<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.119> lot<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.299> background<00:02:03.780> noise

where there's a lot of background noise

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.080 
where there's a lot of background noise
then<00:02:04.530> try<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> move<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> place<00:02:05.490> that's<00:02:05.969> a

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
then try to move to a place that's a

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.760 
then try to move to a place that's a
little<00:02:06.210> bit<00:02:06.329> more<00:02:06.450> quieter<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.140> also

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
little bit more quieter and also

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.919 
little bit more quieter and also
definitely<00:02:08.129> avoid<00:02:08.700> places<00:02:09.390> where<00:02:09.660> there's<00:02:09.810> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
definitely avoid places where there's a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.080 
definitely avoid places where there's a
lot<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.140> background<00:02:10.349> music<00:02:11.009> now<00:02:11.520> not<00:02:11.790> only

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
lot of background music now not only

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.460 
lot of background music now not only
will<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.300> distract<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.989> audience

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
will that distract the audience

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.410 
will that distract the audience
what<00:02:13.890> you're<00:02:14.040> saying<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.880> also<00:02:15.060> cause

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
what you're saying but it also cause

what you're saying but it also cause
some<00:02:15.780> copyright<00:02:16.140> issues<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.980> upload<00:02:17.370> the

some copyright issues if you upload the

some copyright issues if you upload the
video<00:02:17.730> onto<00:02:18.240> YouTube<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.170> got<00:02:19.350> a

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
video onto YouTube and it's got a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.200 
video onto YouTube and it's got a
popular<00:02:20.010> track<00:02:20.370> playing<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.820> background

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
popular track playing in the background

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.450 
popular track playing in the background
then<00:02:21.630> Content<00:02:22.110> ID<00:02:22.290> will<00:02:22.800> not<00:02:23.130> let<00:02:23.310> you

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
then Content ID will not let you

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.370 
then Content ID will not let you
monetize<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.390> video<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.080> there's<00:02:25.230> also

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
monetize the video and there's also

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.200 
monetize the video and there's also
possibility<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.400> YouTube<00:02:26.790> will<00:02:26.910> remove

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
possibility that YouTube will remove

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.300 
possibility that YouTube will remove
that<00:02:27.510> video<00:02:27.810> altogether<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.710> it's<00:02:28.920> definitely

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
that video altogether so it's definitely

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.740 
that video altogether so it's definitely
not<00:02:29.490> worth<00:02:29.760> taking<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.150> risk<00:02:30.300> now

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
not worth taking that risk now

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.600 
not worth taking that risk now
continuing<00:02:31.320> on<00:02:31.470> from<00:02:31.980> distracting

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
continuing on from distracting

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.000 
continuing on from distracting
background<00:02:33.060> noises<00:02:33.240> my<00:02:33.930> tip<00:02:34.230> number<00:02:34.500> three<00:02:34.860> is

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
background noises my tip number three is

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.490 
background noises my tip number three is
avoid<00:02:35.790> distracting<00:02:36.570> backgrounds<00:02:37.110> visually

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
avoid distracting backgrounds visually

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.870 
avoid distracting backgrounds visually
when<00:02:37.830> you're<00:02:37.950> filming<00:02:38.100> something<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.700> want

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
when you're filming something you want

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.130 
when you're filming something you want
your<00:02:39.000> audience<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.330> be<00:02:39.450> concentrating<00:02:40.110> on

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
your audience to be concentrating on

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.500 
your audience to be concentrating on
your<00:02:40.470> subject<00:02:41.010> not<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.760> background<00:02:42.060> if

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
your subject not the background if

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.030 
your subject not the background if
there's<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.750> lot<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.990> activity<00:02:43.470> going<00:02:43.680> on<00:02:43.830> in

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
there's a lot of activity going on in

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.590 
there's a lot of activity going on in
the<00:02:44.190> background<00:02:44.370> then<00:02:45.030> that's<00:02:45.180> going<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.360> take

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
the background then that's going to take

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.150 
the background then that's going to take
the<00:02:45.870> audience's<00:02:46.440> attention<00:02:46.470> away<00:02:47.010> from

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
the audience's attention away from

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.670 
the audience's attention away from
yourself<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.850> onto<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.750> background<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.500> try

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
yourself and onto the background so try

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.410 
yourself and onto the background so try
filming<00:02:49.920> somewhere<00:02:50.430> where<00:02:50.790> there's<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.090> not<00:02:51.390> a

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
filming somewhere where there's a not a

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.640 
filming somewhere where there's a not a
huge<00:02:51.750> deal<00:02:51.930> going<00:02:52.560> on<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.220> background

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
huge deal going on in the background

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.250 
huge deal going on in the background
what<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:56.400> my<00:02:56.790> first<00:02:57.120> three<00:02:57.330> tips<00:02:57.570> are<00:02:57.900> slightly

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
what so my first three tips are slightly

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.140 
what so my first three tips are slightly
dependent<00:02:58.770> on<00:02:58.920> how<00:02:59.400> much<00:02:59.610> control<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.000> have

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
dependent on how much control you have

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.180 
dependent on how much control you have
over<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.840> situation<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.650> if<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:01.920> can<00:03:02.070> move

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
over the situation and if you can move

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.470 
over the situation and if you can move
out<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.580> about<00:03:02.730> but<00:03:03.150> there's<00:03:03.270> going<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.420> be

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
out and about but there's going to be

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.270 
out and about but there's going to be
plenty<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.750> situations<00:03:03.960> where<00:03:04.890> you're<00:03:05.130> going

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
plenty of situations where you're going

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.740 
plenty of situations where you're going
to<00:03:05.340> simply<00:03:05.730> have<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.150> get<00:03:06.330> out<00:03:06.450> your<00:03:06.570> camera

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
to simply have to get out your camera

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.170 
to simply have to get out your camera
and<00:03:07.080> affirm<00:03:07.740> what's<00:03:07.980> there<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.610> hopefully<00:03:09.000> my

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
and affirm what's there so hopefully my

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.270 
and affirm what's there so hopefully my
top<00:03:09.540> two<00:03:09.780> tips<00:03:10.080> can<00:03:10.500> apply<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.860> pretty<00:03:11.160> much

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
top two tips can apply to pretty much

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.190 
top two tips can apply to pretty much
every<00:03:11.610> situation<00:03:12.120> out<00:03:12.240> there<00:03:12.270> tip<00:03:12.690> number<00:03:12.900> two

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
stable there's nothing more annoying

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.490 
stable there's nothing more annoying
than<00:03:17.580> some<00:03:17.970> very<00:03:18.239> shaky<00:03:18.690> footage<00:03:19.050> which

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
than some very shaky footage which

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.199 
than some very shaky footage which
really<00:03:19.800> puts<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.190> off<00:03:20.220> watching<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.940> video

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
really puts you off watching the video

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.180 
really puts you off watching the video
and<00:03:21.540> can<00:03:21.690> sometimes<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.290> make<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.770> audience

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
and can sometimes that make the audience

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.220 
and can sometimes that make the audience
just<00:03:23.550> switch<00:03:23.700> off<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.150> go<00:03:24.330> elsewhere<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:25.080> if

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
just switch off and go elsewhere so if

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.020 
just switch off and go elsewhere so if
you<00:03:25.350> have<00:03:25.560> stabilization<00:03:26.430> on<00:03:26.580> your<00:03:26.790> phone

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
you have stabilization on your phone

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.820 
you have stabilization on your phone
then<00:03:27.450> make<00:03:27.660> sure<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.870> is<00:03:28.110> switched<00:03:28.380> on<00:03:28.590> and

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
then make sure that is switched on and

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.430 
then make sure that is switched on and
the<00:03:29.550> best<00:03:29.820> way<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.030> avoid<00:03:30.420> shake<00:03:30.750> on<00:03:30.930> your

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
the best way to avoid shake on your

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.020 
the best way to avoid shake on your
smartphone<00:03:31.860> camera<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.400> instead<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:32.940> just

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
smartphone camera is instead of just

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.729 
smartphone camera is instead of just
using<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.540> one<00:03:33.780> hander<00:03:34.170> which<00:03:34.350> can<00:03:34.560> be<00:03:34.709> a

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
using the one hander which can be a

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.160 
using the one hander which can be a
little<00:03:35.070> bit<00:03:35.160> loose<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:36.270> use<00:03:36.450> both<00:03:36.810> hands

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
little bit loose is to use both hands

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.960 
little bit loose is to use both hands
and<00:03:37.320> hold<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.920> camera<00:03:38.280> as<00:03:38.459> steady<00:03:38.670> as

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
and hold the camera as steady as

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.120 
and hold the camera as steady as
possible<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:39.720> will<00:03:39.930> usually<00:03:40.140> avoid<00:03:40.770> your

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
possible so that will usually avoid your

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.190 
possible so that will usually avoid your
smartphone<00:03:41.910> from<00:03:42.120> tilting<00:03:42.360> side-to-side<00:03:42.810> and

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
smartphone from tilting side-to-side and

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.440 
smartphone from tilting side-to-side and
it<00:03:43.650> gives<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:43.980> some<00:03:44.250> nice<00:03:44.519> stable<00:03:45.150> footage

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
it gives you some nice stable footage

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.680 
it gives you some nice stable footage
and<00:03:45.660> my<00:03:46.230> number<00:03:46.830> one<00:03:47.040> tip<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.610> always<00:03:48.420> always

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
and my number one tip is always always

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.520 
and my number one tip is always always
always<00:03:49.200> always<00:03:49.620> always<00:03:50.510> film<00:03:51.510> in<00:03:51.780> landscape

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
always always always film in landscape

mode<00:03:52.560> now<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.040> can't<00:03:53.340> stress<00:03:53.670> this<00:03:53.820> enough<00:03:53.880> and

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
mode now I can't stress this enough and

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.600 
mode now I can't stress this enough and
the<00:03:54.720> amount<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:54.930> times<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.470> see<00:03:55.709> people<00:03:55.739> filming

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
the amount of times I see people filming

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.820 
the amount of times I see people filming
like<00:03:56.820> this<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.300> portrait<00:03:57.720> mode<00:03:57.750> really<00:03:58.650> really

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
like this in portrait mode really really

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.979 
like this in portrait mode really really
annoys<00:03:59.040> me<00:03:59.070> why<00:03:59.610> not<00:03:59.850> well<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.600> main<00:04:00.959> reason

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
annoys me why not well the main reason

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.160 
annoys me why not well the main reason
for<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.590> is<00:04:01.800> screens<00:04:02.489> such<00:04:02.850> as<00:04:03.090> here<00:04:03.510> roll<00:04:04.050> is

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
for this is screens such as here roll is

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.990 
for this is screens such as here roll is
in<00:04:04.350> white<00:04:04.560> screen<00:04:04.890> usually<00:04:05.100> sixteen<00:04:05.700> by<00:04:05.970> nine

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
in white screen usually sixteen by nine

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.330 
in white screen usually sixteen by nine
so<00:04:06.750> they<00:04:06.989> are<00:04:07.050> in<00:04:07.170> landscape<00:04:07.620> mode<00:04:07.650> rather

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
so they are in landscape mode rather

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.770 
so they are in landscape mode rather
than<00:04:08.519> portrait<00:04:08.970> mode<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.480> I'm<00:04:09.570> sure

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
than portrait mode and I'm sure

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.360 
than portrait mode and I'm sure
everyone's<00:04:10.260> seen<00:04:10.530> videos<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.190> are<00:04:11.310> on

everyone's seen videos that are on

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.970 
everyone's seen videos that are on
YouTube<00:04:11.400> with<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.180> big<00:04:12.540> black<00:04:12.900> boxes<00:04:13.440> on<00:04:13.620> either

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
side yes like this which is very very

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.320 
side yes like this which is very very
annoying<00:04:16.739> because<00:04:17.040> it<00:04:17.340> limits<00:04:17.580> what<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:18.150> can

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
annoying because it limits what you can

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.570 
annoying because it limits what you can
view<00:04:18.660> on<00:04:18.870> screen<00:04:19.230> so<00:04:19.440> if<00:04:19.620> your<00:04:19.799> video<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.130> going

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
view on screen so if your video is going

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.880

to be going online onto YouTube Facebook

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.100 
to be going online onto YouTube Facebook
they<00:04:23.550> will<00:04:23.729> most<00:04:23.880> likely<00:04:24.030> be<00:04:24.510> viewed<00:04:24.870> in

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
they will most likely be viewed in

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.050 
they will most likely be viewed in
widescreen<00:04:25.620> now<00:04:26.190> why<00:04:26.400> is<00:04:26.460> this

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
widescreen now why is this

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.420 
widescreen now why is this
a simple<00:04:27.690> explanation<00:04:28.200> is<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.919> fact<00:04:29.190> that

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
a simple explanation is the fact that

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.490 
a simple explanation is the fact that
you've<00:04:29.610> got<00:04:29.639> eyes<00:04:30.090> on<00:04:30.389> either<00:04:30.660> side<00:04:31.020> left<00:04:31.260> and

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
you've got eyes on either side left and

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.409 
you've got eyes on either side left and
right<00:04:31.710> you've<00:04:31.950> not<00:04:32.160> got<00:04:32.190> them<00:04:32.550> on<00:04:32.730> top<00:04:33.210> and

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
right you've not got them on top and

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.450 
right you've not got them on top and
below<00:04:33.540> a<00:04:33.930> simple<00:04:34.380> test<00:04:34.620> that<00:04:34.710> you<00:04:34.860> can<00:04:34.889> also<00:04:35.160> do

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
below a simple test that you can also do

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.460 
below a simple test that you can also do
is<00:04:35.669> it<00:04:36.030> look<00:04:36.210> straight<00:04:36.480> ahead<00:04:36.600> get<00:04:37.050> your<00:04:37.169> hands

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
is it look straight ahead get your hands

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.830 
is it look straight ahead get your hands
and<00:04:37.590> move<00:04:38.100> them<00:04:38.430> above<00:04:39.000> under<00:04:39.210> below<00:04:39.630> and

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
and move them above under below and

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.060 
and move them above under below and
you'll<00:04:39.930> notice<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.230> you'll<00:04:40.470> stop<00:04:40.740> seeing

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
you'll notice that you'll stop seeing

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.340 
you'll notice that you'll stop seeing
your<00:04:41.220> hands<00:04:41.490> roughly<00:04:41.970> about<00:04:42.090> here<00:04:42.600> but<00:04:43.110> if<00:04:43.230> you

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
your hands roughly about here but if you

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.480 
your hands roughly about here but if you
do<00:04:43.440> them<00:04:43.590> left<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:43.950> right<00:04:44.100> you're<00:04:44.280> gonna<00:04:44.400> be

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
do them left to right you're gonna be

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.490 
do them left to right you're gonna be
able<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.669> see<00:04:44.910> your<00:04:45.330> hands<00:04:45.570> from<00:04:45.960> a<00:04:46.230> great

able to see your hands from a great

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.409 
able to see your hands from a great
distance<00:04:46.980> and<00:04:47.130> this<00:04:47.400> is<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.669> main<00:04:47.880> reason<00:04:48.240> why

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
distance and this is the main reason why

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.230 
distance and this is the main reason why
videos<00:04:49.110> are<00:04:49.380> in<00:04:49.770> widescreen<00:04:50.280> everywhere<00:04:50.970> and
