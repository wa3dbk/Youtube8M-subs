00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.190 
be true it's not totally confirmed but
I'm<00:01:57.149> assuming<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.540> would<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.930> win<00:01:58.079> every

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
I'm assuming you would have to win every

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.060 
I'm assuming you would have to win every
single<00:01:58.350> match<00:01:59.659> obviously<00:02:00.659> based<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.680> historic

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
single match obviously based on historic

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.190 
single match obviously based on historic
match<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.640> not<00:02:02.939> mandatory<00:02:03.540> different

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
match is not mandatory different

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.929 
match is not mandatory different
cutscenes<00:02:04.649> depending<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.340> how<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.549> win<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
cutscenes depending on how you win the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.940 
cutscenes depending on how you win the
match<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.689> do<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.930> properly<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.740> get

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
match so if you do it properly you get

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.350 
match so if you do it properly you get
probably<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> realistic<00:02:08.910> cut<00:02:09.090> scenes

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
probably the realistic cut scenes

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.990 
probably the realistic cut scenes

on<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.200> announce<00:03:25.380> table<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:26.430> roll<00:03:27.060> them<00:03:27.209> onto

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
on the announce table you roll them onto

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.479 
on the announce table you roll them onto
the<00:03:27.540> table<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.930> then<00:03:28.110> you<00:03:28.290> perform<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.890> you're

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
the table and then you perform it you're

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.620 
the table and then you perform it you're
finished<00:03:29.880> shell<00:03:30.030> while<00:03:30.180> you're<00:03:30.360> climbing

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
finished shell while you're climbing

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.720 
finished shell while you're climbing
your<00:03:31.470> kind<00:03:31.739> will<00:03:31.829> now<00:03:32.010> say<00:03:32.220> but<00:03:32.340> then<00:03:32.459> do<00:03:32.610> you

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
your kind will now say but then do you

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.580 
your kind will now say but then do you
finish<00:03:32.850> her<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.150> makes<00:03:33.299> more<00:03:33.480> sense<00:03:33.540> i<00:03:34.140> think

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
finish her that makes more sense i think

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.960 
finish her that makes more sense i think
it's<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.220> your<00:03:35.340> finish<00:03:35.549> it<00:03:35.670> because<00:03:35.730> they

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
it's just your finish it because they

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.720 
it's just your finish it because they
showed<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.239> codebreaker<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.400> wasn't<00:03:38.700> a

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
showed the codebreaker and it wasn't a

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.000 
showed the codebreaker and it wasn't a
fluid<00:03:39.360> fluid<00:03:39.600> animation<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:40.590> it's<00:03:40.799> kind<00:03:40.980> of

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
fluid fluid animation so it's kind of

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.340 
fluid fluid animation so it's kind of
like<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.160> pause<00:03:41.519> so<00:03:42.329> it's<00:03:42.540> obviously<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.079> can't

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
like a pause so it's obviously you can't

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.800 
like a pause so it's obviously you can't
just<00:03:43.560> do<00:03:44.070> around<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.549> move<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:44.790> another<00:03:45.690> one

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
just do around the move and another one

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.979 
just do around the move and another one
this<00:03:45.930> your<00:03:46.110> John's<00:03:47.570> Chris<00:03:48.570> Jericho<00:03:48.870> do

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
this your John's Chris Jericho do

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.650 
this your John's Chris Jericho do
codebreaker<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:50.269> walk<00:03:51.269> through<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.510> rock

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
codebreaker and walk through the rock

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.970 
codebreaker and walk through the rock
bottom<00:03:51.870> in<00:03:52.140> through<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.410> announce<00:03:52.530> table<00:03:52.920> on

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
bottom in through the announce table on

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.280 
bottom in through the announce table on
Austin<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.180> think<00:03:54.299> it's<00:03:54.510> set<00:03:54.750> just<00:03:55.049> two

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
Austin so I think it's set just two

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.420 
Austin so I think it's set just two
finishes<00:03:55.590> which<00:03:55.860> is<00:03:56.010> kind<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.310> disappointing

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
finishes which is kind of disappointing

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.460 
finishes which is kind of disappointing
because<00:03:56.940> we<00:03:57.180> kind<00:03:57.360> of<00:03:57.480> want<00:03:57.660> just<00:03:57.870> go<00:03:58.110> on<00:03:58.350> the

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
because we kind of want just go on the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.229 
because we kind of want just go on the
announcers<00:03:58.920> table<00:03:59.070> that<00:03:59.760> may<00:03:59.910> still<00:04:00.150> be

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
announcers table that may still be

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.990 
announcers table that may still be
possible<00:04:00.420> but<00:04:00.840> in<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.079> footage<00:04:01.230> we've<00:04:01.440> seen

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
possible but in the footage we've seen

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.039 
possible but in the footage we've seen
right<00:04:03.000> now<00:04:03.209> no<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:05.630> there's<00:04:06.630> a<00:04:06.690> refined

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
right now no and there's a refined

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.800 
right now no and there's a refined
grapple<00:04:07.440> system<00:04:08.000> adding<00:04:09.000> pink<00:04:09.299> humble<00:04:09.660> and

I'll<00:04:09.989> explain<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:10.590> more<00:04:10.769> in<00:04:10.859> a<00:04:10.920> different

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
I'll explain that more in a different

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.009 
I'll explain that more in a different
video<00:04:11.280> because<00:04:11.609> that's<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.850> big<00:04:12.209> thing<00:04:12.239> hit

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
video because that's a big thing hit

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
maybe DLC them because it takes a

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.170 
maybe DLC them because it takes a
