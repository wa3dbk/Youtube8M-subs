chapter<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.250> do<00:02:59.430> have<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.730> say<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.090> game<00:03:00.270> gets

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
chapter I do have to say the game gets

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.150 
chapter I do have to say the game gets
very<00:03:00.750> hard<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.470> even<00:03:01.710> though<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.950> gameplay

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
very hard so even though the gameplay

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.980 
very hard so even though the gameplay
looks<00:03:02.520> like<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.760> young<00:03:03.000> kid<00:03:03.270> could<00:03:03.450> enjoy<00:03:03.750> it

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
looks like a young kid could enjoy it

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.450 
looks like a young kid could enjoy it
they<00:03:04.230> might<00:03:04.410> become<00:03:04.530> really<00:03:04.920> frustrated

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
they might become really frustrated

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.550 
they might become really frustrated
really<00:03:05.580> fast<00:03:05.970> due<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.420> its<00:03:06.690> difficulty<00:03:07.260> level

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
really fast due to its difficulty level

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.830 
really fast due to its difficulty level
the<00:03:07.980> magic<00:03:08.340> obelisk<00:03:08.910> is<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.210> fun<00:03:09.540> little<00:03:09.690> game

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
the magic obelisk is a fun little game

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.720 
the magic obelisk is a fun little game
however<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.740> feature<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.220> found<00:03:11.490> most

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
however the feature that I found most

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.790 
however the feature that I found most
appealing<00:03:12.180> about<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.660> title<00:03:13.020> is<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.440> price

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
appealing about the title is the price

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.640 
appealing about the title is the price
it's<00:03:14.370> only<00:03:14.640> 500<00:03:15.030> wheat<00:03:15.480> points<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.500> an

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
it's only 500 wheat points that is an

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.680 
it's only 500 wheat points that is an
insane<00:03:17.070> bargain<00:03:17.670> for<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.910> gameplay<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.330> get

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
insane bargain for the gameplay you get

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.480 
insane bargain for the gameplay you get
normally<00:03:19.320> titles<00:03:19.650> like<00:03:19.740> this<00:03:19.950> go<00:03:20.190> for<00:03:20.220> at

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
normally titles like this go for at

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.670 
normally titles like this go for at
least<00:03:20.610> 1,000<00:03:21.360> weak<00:03:21.480> points<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:22.140> at<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.380> great

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
least 1,000 weak points so at that great

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.800 
least 1,000 weak points so at that great
price<00:03:23.010> how<00:03:23.310> can<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.640> possibly<00:03:23.880> say<00:03:24.300> it's<00:03:24.660> not

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
price how can I possibly say it's not

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.720 
price how can I possibly say it's not
worth<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.050> buy<00:03:25.350> even<00:03:26.010> with<00:03:26.310> its<00:03:26.490> camera

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
worth the buy even with its camera

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.940 
worth the buy even with its camera
issues<00:03:27.210> and<00:03:27.390> somewhat<00:03:27.930> frustrating<00:03:28.530> controls

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
issues and somewhat frustrating controls

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.040 
issues and somewhat frustrating controls
its<00:03:29.400> price<00:03:29.700> point<00:03:30.030> makes<00:03:30.150> up<00:03:30.390> for<00:03:30.600> all<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.900> that

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
its price point makes up for all of that

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.880 
its price point makes up for all of that
so<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.410> think<00:03:31.560> it's<00:03:31.860> completely<00:03:32.370> worth<00:03:32.550> it<00:03:32.670> bye
