00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.510
 Hello, you are welcome 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.690
 when a recipe who today I have you 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.400
 My recipe for clinic we patties 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.280
 need four team so that is 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.240
 washed and then done totally wise 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.820
 then we need a circus 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.000
 make a big onion small 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.980
 cut a cup of mail and a 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.650
 Teaspoon of baking powder I have here in 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:34.090
 then you need the flour made with pure 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:37.060
 we spices salt pepper peppermint and 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.410
 paper can be too cute 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.410
 with getting just wrote 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:50.650
 then we need to take from the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.640
 waste water, otherwise it will 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.640
 too fluid 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.480
 In addition, we still need fresh 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.400
 Herbs have bunch dill and half bunch 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.180
 parsley smooth parsley small 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.120
 sliced 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:29.260
 now all the ingredients are being used 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:29.260
 mixed together and an egg 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.230
 as you see this is now down to 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.240
 has become more fluid and the whole is 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.479
 then so connected 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.530
 so now we want her zucchini 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.380
 fried 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.020
 I have plenty of oil in my flag 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:10.410
 given that they are always so about one 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.410
 spoon and press that you liked 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:30.610
 in between you have to me because 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:34.530
 always mix again and from 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.530
 placing both sides well 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.130
 so that the superfluous fat is sucked off 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.440
 I'll have it on my cellar 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.440
 put kitchen paper in place 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.940
 my recommendation is the zucchini 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.440
 to serve patties with twenties and 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.030
 pita bread in addition I hope it has 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.560
 you enjoyed watching and 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.050
 I wish you a lot of fun trying it out 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.050
 and say it until the next video
