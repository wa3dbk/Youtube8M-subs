six zero zero eight three
it's<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.830> city<00:00:14.099> set<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:14.849> just<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.150> gigantic

snow plow truck and so that inspired me

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.609 
snow plow truck and so that inspired me
to<00:00:18.510> make<00:00:18.600> my<00:00:18.779> own<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:20.090> I<00:00:21.090> guess<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:21.990> didn't<00:00:22.380> want

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
seats to get that curve and so yeah I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.209

is a kind of much older SUV and I
actually<00:01:00.719> kind<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.199> combine<00:01:01.620> elements<00:01:01.890> of

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
actually kind of combine elements of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.520 
actually kind of combine elements of
vehicles<00:01:04.110> from<00:01:04.530> all<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.430> way<00:01:05.489> back<00:01:05.519> from<00:01:05.909> like

vehicles from all the way back from like

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.730 
vehicles from all the way back from like
30s<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.710> 40s<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.420> as<00:01:09.420> well<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:09.930> things<00:01:10.320> from

more<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> 80's<00:01:12.210> 90's<00:01:12.390> period<00:01:13.020> what<00:01:13.590> I

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
more of like the 80's 90's period what I

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.230 
more of like the 80's 90's period what I
mean<00:01:13.799> by<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.400> if<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.640> look<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> hood

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
mean by that is if you look at the hood

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.350 
mean by that is if you look at the hood
you<00:01:16.140> kind<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.470> get<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.820> angled<00:01:17.820> shape<00:01:18.090> that

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
you kind of get that angled shape that

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.830 
you kind of get that angled shape that
was<00:01:18.509> more<00:01:18.750> common<00:01:19.110> actually<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.680> sedans<00:01:20.220> from

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
was more common actually on sedans from

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.050 
was more common actually on sedans from
the<00:01:22.130> earlier<00:01:23.130> period<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.140> but<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:26.060> placed

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the earlier period and but this placed

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.530 
the earlier period and but this placed
on<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> back<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:28.080> kind<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.590> gray<00:01:29.490> area<00:01:29.909> is

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
on the back this kind of gray area is

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.920 
on the back this kind of gray area is
kind<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.350> more<00:01:31.530> common<00:01:31.950> thing<00:01:32.189> from

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
kind of a more common thing from

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.230 
kind of a more common thing from
slightly<00:01:33.930> more<00:01:34.229> recent<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.640> my<00:01:35.790> recent<00:01:36.000> I

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
slightly more recent in my recent I

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.179 
slightly more recent in my recent I
still<00:01:36.450> mean<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> long<00:01:36.869> time<00:01:37.110> ago<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.530> thirty

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
still mean a long time ago like thirty

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.789 
still mean a long time ago like thirty
years<00:01:38.490> ago<00:01:39.079> you<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.229> would<00:01:40.409> kind<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.650> get

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
years ago you know you would kind of get

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.440 
years ago you know you would kind of get
stuff<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.250> where<00:01:41.670> maybe<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.240> had<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
stuff like this where maybe you had a

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.230 
stuff like this where maybe you had a
pickup<00:01:42.780> truck<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.470> would<00:01:44.240> instead

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
pickup truck and then you would instead

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.840 
pickup truck and then you would instead
convert<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:45.990> cover<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.740> like<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
convert it and cover it up like this and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.010 
convert it and cover it up like this and
that's<00:01:48.119> why<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.360> part<00:01:48.750> would<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:48.899> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
that's why this part would be a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.260 
that's why this part would be a
different<00:01:49.409> color<00:01:49.740> from<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.670> normal<00:01:50.970> body<00:01:51.119> of

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
different color from the normal body of

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.749 
different color from the normal body of
the<00:01:51.360> truck<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.990> also<00:01:52.770> brown<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.340> not<00:01:53.369> really<00:01:53.729> a

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
the truck and also brown is not really a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.030 
the truck and also brown is not really a
color<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.240> they<00:01:54.390> use<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:55.049> things<00:01:55.500> nowadays

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
color that they use on things nowadays

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.880 
color that they use on things nowadays
and<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.030> used<00:01:57.299> brown<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.869> kind<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.200> emphasize

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
and so I used brown to kind of emphasize

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.410 
and so I used brown to kind of emphasize
the<00:01:59.729> old<00:01:59.969> mess<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:03.000> as<00:02:03.180> for

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the old mess of it and then as for

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.880 
the old mess of it and then as for
individual<00:02:04.110> details<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:06.590> engine<00:02:07.590> area

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
individual details in the engine area

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.859 
individual details in the engine area
here<00:02:08.160> I'll<00:02:08.369> actually<00:02:08.640> go<00:02:09.479> ahead<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.780> just

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
here I'll actually go ahead and just

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.100 
here I'll actually go ahead and just
remove<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.470> plow<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:12.120> can<00:02:12.300> easily<00:02:12.690> just

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
remove the plow so this can easily just

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.580 
remove the plow so this can easily just
pass<00:02:13.290> off

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
pass off

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.740 
pass off
a<00:02:13.620> truck<00:02:13.950> without<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.550> plow<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.390> just<00:02:15.629> put

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
a truck without the plow you just put

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.750 
a truck without the plow you just put
the<00:02:15.840> plow<00:02:16.019> there<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.010> could<00:02:17.340> actually<00:02:17.489> just

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
the plow there so I could actually just

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.050 
the plow there so I could actually just
have<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.209> my<00:02:18.330> city<00:02:18.599> by<00:02:19.140> itself<00:02:19.879> and<00:02:20.879> it'll

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
have this in my city by itself and it'll

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.190 
have this in my city by itself and it'll
look<00:02:21.239> just<00:02:21.510> fine<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:22.220> just<00:02:23.220> got<00:02:24.060> some<00:02:24.360> round

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
look just fine to just got some round

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.160 
look just fine to just got some round
lights<00:02:25.879> some<00:02:26.879> kind<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.360> yellow<00:02:27.599> indicators

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
lights some kind of yellow indicators

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.890 
lights some kind of yellow indicators
down<00:02:28.349> there<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.680> very<00:02:28.709> simple<00:02:29.370> grille<00:02:29.900> I

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
down there and a very simple grille I

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.130 
down there and a very simple grille I
wanted<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.590> make<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:31.920> look<00:02:32.519> old<00:02:32.819> so<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.989> know<00:02:34.019> I

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
wanted to make it look old so you know I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.839 
wanted to make it look old so you know I
use<00:02:34.319> those<00:02:34.500> rounded<00:02:34.950> lights<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:36.140> then<00:02:37.849> that

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
use those rounded lights and then that

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.729 
use those rounded lights and then that
can<00:02:39.180> kind<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.450> pass<00:02:39.599> off<00:02:39.870> as<00:02:40.019> engine<00:02:40.410> detail

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
can kind of pass off as engine detail

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.250 
can kind of pass off as engine detail
but<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:40.980> was<00:02:41.160> actually<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:42.049> kind<00:02:43.049> of

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
but that was actually a kind of

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.830 
but that was actually a kind of
necessary<00:02:44.040> design<00:02:44.670> feature<00:02:45.000> because<00:02:45.480> if<00:02:45.690> I

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
necessary design feature because if I

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.710 
necessary design feature because if I
hadn't<00:02:46.310> done<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.459> little<00:02:47.819> thing<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.540> there

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
hadn't done this little thing in there

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.190 
hadn't done this little thing in there
with<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:50.220> cheese<00:02:50.549> slope<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.959> half

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
with the that cheese slope and the half

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.190 
with the that cheese slope and the half
length<00:02:52.530> pin<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:54.060> wouldn't<00:02:54.630> have<00:02:54.780> been<00:02:54.900> able<00:02:55.019> to

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
length pin I wouldn't have been able to

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.440 
length pin I wouldn't have been able to
use<00:02:55.410> these<00:02:55.620> headlamp<00:02:56.069> pieces<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:57.030> mount<00:02:57.209> those

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
use these headlamp pieces to mount those

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.220 
use these headlamp pieces to mount those
lights<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:59.120> I'm<00:03:00.120> glad<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.390> they<00:03:00.599> was<00:03:00.930> able<00:03:01.200> to

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
lights so I'm glad that they was able to

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.410 
lights so I'm glad that they was able to
work<00:03:01.440> out<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.579> looks<00:03:02.760> pretty<00:03:02.970> cool<00:03:03.180> now

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
work out and it looks pretty cool now

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.670 
work out and it looks pretty cool now
too<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:05.250> then<00:03:06.000> you've<00:03:06.209> just<00:03:06.239> got<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.989> cab

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
too and then you've just got the cab

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.890 
too and then you've just got the cab
section<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:08.940> really<00:03:09.209> can't<00:03:09.450> fit<00:03:09.720> any

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
section and you really can't fit any

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.170 
section and you really can't fit any
minifigs<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.650> there<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:11.069> kind<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.579> realized

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
minifigs in there I kind of realized

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.580 
minifigs in there I kind of realized
that<00:03:12.299> it<00:03:12.420> would<00:03:12.510> be<00:03:12.569> very<00:03:12.599> tough<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.319> begin

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
that it would be very tough to begin

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.319 
that it would be very tough to begin
with<00:03:13.739> with<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.400> way<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.519> was<00:03:14.790> gonna<00:03:14.910> go<00:03:15.120> about

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
with with the way I was gonna go about

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.020 
with with the way I was gonna go about
designing<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.709> exterior<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.000> I

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
designing the exterior of this so I

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.879 
designing the exterior of this so I
decided<00:03:18.389> to<00:03:18.540> just<00:03:18.750> kind<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.410> throw<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.769> the

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
decided to just kind of throw in the

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.370 
decided to just kind of throw in the
towel<00:03:20.100> for<00:03:20.639> trying<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:21.480> get<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.660> minifig<00:03:22.079> to<00:03:22.200> fit

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
towel for trying to get a minifig to fit

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.080 
towel for trying to get a minifig to fit
and<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.950> completely<00:03:23.370> focused<00:03:23.819> on<00:03:23.970> getting

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
and I just completely focused on getting

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.330 
and I just completely focused on getting
the<00:03:24.299> truck<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.810> look<00:03:24.959> really<00:03:25.230> good

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
the truck to look really good

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.949 
the truck to look really good
I<00:03:26.400> also<00:03:26.819> didn't<00:03:27.180> really<00:03:27.389> make<00:03:27.510> an<00:03:27.660> interior

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
I also didn't really make an interior

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.680 
I also didn't really make an interior
even<00:03:28.859> though<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:28.980> usually<00:03:29.549> at<00:03:30.090> least<00:03:30.239> put<00:03:30.660> a

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
even though I usually at least put a

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.569 
even though I usually at least put a
steering<00:03:31.049> wheel<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.380> but<00:03:31.739> I<00:03:31.769> didn't<00:03:32.370> bother

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
steering wheel in but I didn't bother

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.530 
steering wheel in but I didn't bother
because<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:34.760> really<00:03:35.760> just<00:03:35.910> didn't<00:03:36.150> care<00:03:36.329> with

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
because I really just didn't care with

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.440 
because I really just didn't care with
this<00:03:36.750> mock<00:03:37.459> you<00:03:38.459> know<00:03:38.579> so<00:03:38.760> see<00:03:38.819> I<00:03:38.940> got<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.180> bit<00:03:39.359> of

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
this mock you know so see I got a bit of

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.520 
this mock you know so see I got a bit of
door<00:03:39.840> handle<00:03:40.290> detail<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:43.230> can<00:03:43.349> see<00:03:43.500> I

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
door handle detail and you can see I

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.589 
door handle detail and you can see I
actually<00:03:43.769> got<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.430> little<00:03:44.669> a<00:03:44.849> little<00:03:45.120> bit<00:03:45.389> of

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
actually got the little a little bit of

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.879 
actually got the little a little bit of
a<00:03:46.069> bar<00:03:47.069> piece<00:03:47.489> sticking<00:03:47.849> out<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.329> that

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
a bar piece sticking out of that

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.879 
a bar piece sticking out of that
modified<00:03:49.889> brick<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.669> I<00:03:51.590> wanted<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.769> do

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
modified brick and I wanted to do

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.289 
modified brick and I wanted to do
something<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.310> little<00:03:53.340> bit<00:03:53.549> more<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:54.120> get<00:03:54.239> a

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
something a little bit more to get a

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.629 
something a little bit more to get a
better<00:03:54.480> door<00:03:54.930> handle<00:03:55.440> look<00:03:55.680> but<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.519> was

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
better door handle look but that was

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:57.890 
better door handle look but that was
kind<00:03:56.880> of<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.000> best<00:03:57.120> thing<00:03:57.269> I<00:03:57.599> could<00:03:57.780> achieve

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
kind of the best thing I could achieve

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.659 
kind of the best thing I could achieve
other<00:03:58.590> than<00:03:58.739> just<00:03:58.919> putting<00:03:59.069> a<00:03:59.190> stud<00:03:59.459> but<00:03:59.609> I

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
other than just putting a stud but I

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.720 
other than just putting a stud but I
didn't<00:03:59.910> want<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.120> just<00:04:00.299> put<00:04:00.359> a<00:04:00.510> stud<00:04:01.489> and<00:04:02.489> then

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
didn't want to just put a stud and then

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.640 
didn't want to just put a stud and then
you've<00:04:02.849> just<00:04:03.060> got<00:04:03.239> some<00:04:03.720> simple<00:04:04.079> windows<00:04:04.410> back

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
you've just got some simple windows back

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.309 
you've just got some simple windows back
here<00:04:05.000> those<00:04:06.000> are<00:04:06.120> in<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.269> different<00:04:06.450> color<00:04:06.870> and

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
here those are in a different color and

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.659 
here those are in a different color and
I<00:04:07.410> actually<00:04:07.590> think<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.130> looks<00:04:08.310> pretty<00:04:08.400> good

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
I actually think it looks pretty good

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.960 
I actually think it looks pretty good
with<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.329> tan<00:04:09.660> frame<00:04:10.049> even<00:04:10.620> though<00:04:10.919> that's<00:04:11.819> a

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
with that tan frame even though that's a

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.280 
with that tan frame even though that's a
different<00:04:12.239> color<00:04:12.329> I<00:04:12.480> feel<00:04:12.569> like<00:04:12.900> if<00:04:13.049> we<00:04:13.109> was

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
different color I feel like if we was

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.569 
different color I feel like if we was
light<00:04:13.440> bluish<00:04:13.620> gray<00:04:13.859> like<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.160> rest<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.519> would

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
light bluish gray like the rest it would

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.319 
light bluish gray like the rest it would
just<00:04:14.790> look<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:15.209> little<00:04:15.660> bit<00:04:15.780> boring<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.289> then

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
just look a little bit boring and then

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.659 
just look a little bit boring and then
you<00:04:18.329> know<00:04:18.419> just<00:04:18.889> to<00:04:19.889> get<00:04:20.039> that<00:04:20.220> kind<00:04:20.280> of<00:04:20.489> old

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
you know just to get that kind of old

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.180 
you know just to get that kind of old
look<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:21.060> use<00:04:21.209> these<00:04:21.389> sloped<00:04:21.900> bricks<00:04:22.770> over

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
look I use these sloped bricks over

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.580 
look I use these sloped bricks over
there

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
there

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.400 
there
is<00:04:23.740> one<00:04:23.980> by<00:04:24.160> two<00:04:24.190> by<00:04:24.580> two<00:04:24.639> slopes<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.630> just<00:04:26.320> a

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
is one by two by two slopes and just a

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.879 
is one by two by two slopes and just a
couple<00:04:26.530> trans<00:04:26.949> clear<00:04:27.280> bricks<00:04:28.470> just<00:04:29.470> grabbed<00:04:29.710> a

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
couple trans clear bricks just grabbed a

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.129 
couple trans clear bricks just grabbed a
license<00:04:30.520> plate<00:04:30.610> peace<00:04:31.060> out<00:04:31.360> remember<00:04:31.870> what

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
license plate peace out remember what

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.770 
license plate peace out remember what
set<00:04:32.500> that<00:04:32.710> came<00:04:32.860> from<00:04:33.010> probably<00:04:33.600> seven<00:04:34.600> nine

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
set that came from probably seven nine

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.040 
set that came from probably seven nine
three<00:04:34.810> seven<00:04:35.350> is<00:04:36.250> my<00:04:36.460> guess<00:04:36.760> of<00:04:37.060> what<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.840> set

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
three seven is my guess of what that set

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.330 
three seven is my guess of what that set
number<00:04:38.320> is<00:04:38.440> where<00:04:38.650> that<00:04:38.740> came<00:04:38.919> from

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
number is where that came from

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.960 
number is where that came from
just<00:04:40.300> some<00:04:40.680> simulated<00:04:41.680> exhaust<00:04:42.190> pipes<00:04:42.610> over

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
just some simulated exhaust pipes over

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.050 
just some simulated exhaust pipes over
there<00:04:43.270> and<00:04:43.740> some<00:04:44.740> really<00:04:44.949> puny<00:04:45.490> brake<00:04:45.760> lights

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
there and some really puny brake lights

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.310 
there and some really puny brake lights
those<00:04:46.660> are<00:04:46.780> kind<00:04:46.960> of<00:04:47.050> pathetic<00:04:47.470> but<00:04:48.370> um<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:49.320> I

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
those are kind of pathetic but um I I

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.990 
those are kind of pathetic but um I I
just<00:04:50.530> want<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:51.010> have<00:04:51.130> some<00:04:51.310> brake<00:04:51.490> lights<00:04:51.729> and

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
just want to have some brake lights and

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.480 
just want to have some brake lights and
I<00:04:52.060> didn't<00:04:52.300> have<00:04:52.419> a<00:04:52.449> better<00:04:52.720> way<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:52.930> do<00:04:53.169> it<00:04:53.490> so

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
I didn't have a better way to do it so

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.850 
I didn't have a better way to do it so
yeah<00:04:54.970> that's<00:04:55.360> pretty<00:04:55.630> much<00:04:55.900> it<00:04:56.110> for<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.590> truck

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
yeah that's pretty much it for the truck

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.150 
yeah that's pretty much it for the truck
and<00:04:57.040> then<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.990> plow<00:04:58.990> is<00:04:59.020> pretty<00:04:59.410> simple<00:04:59.770> the

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
and then the plow is pretty simple the

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.490 
and then the plow is pretty simple the
only<00:05:00.310> thing<00:05:00.729> is<00:05:00.910> I<00:05:01.840> did<00:05:02.229> want<00:05:02.410> to<00:05:02.440> include

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
only thing is I did want to include

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.070 
only thing is I did want to include
these<00:05:02.830> little<00:05:03.130> antennae<00:05:03.610> that<00:05:03.880> a<00:05:04.570> lot<00:05:04.960> of

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
these little antennae that a lot of

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.530 
these little antennae that a lot of
plows<00:05:05.290> now<00:05:05.530> have<00:05:06.210> except<00:05:07.210> they're<00:05:07.300> kind<00:05:07.479> of

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
plows now have except they're kind of

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.360 
plows now have except they're kind of
brighter<00:05:07.840> antenna<00:05:08.320> than<00:05:08.560> these<00:05:08.710> but<00:05:09.040> I<00:05:09.100> did

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
brighter antenna than these but I did

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.640 
brighter antenna than these but I did
want<00:05:09.550> to<00:05:09.610> include<00:05:09.790> antenna<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.990> best<00:05:11.169> way<00:05:11.290> I

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
want to include antenna the best way I

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.879 
want to include antenna the best way I
had<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.250> do<00:05:12.430> that<00:05:12.700> was<00:05:13.419> um<00:05:13.720> I<00:05:13.960> was<00:05:14.770> actually

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
had to do that was um I was actually

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.770 
had to do that was um I was actually
gonna<00:05:15.130> take<00:05:15.550> a<00:05:15.580> different<00:05:15.970> approach<00:05:16.120> that

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
gonna take a different approach that

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.940 
gonna take a different approach that
could<00:05:17.639> kind<00:05:18.639> of<00:05:18.789> use<00:05:19.630> a<00:05:19.660> modified<00:05:20.289> bar<00:05:20.620> piece

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
could kind of use a modified bar piece

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.740 
could kind of use a modified bar piece
that<00:05:21.580> could<00:05:21.729> actually<00:05:21.880> hold<00:05:22.150> a<00:05:22.360> stud<00:05:22.570> and<00:05:22.660> I

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
that could actually hold a stud and I

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.170 
that could actually hold a stud and I
was<00:05:22.840> gonna<00:05:22.930> put<00:05:23.020> a<00:05:23.199> colored<00:05:23.530> stud<00:05:23.949> but<00:05:24.880> I<00:05:25.030> only

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
was gonna put a colored stud but I only

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.730 
was gonna put a colored stud but I only
had<00:05:25.419> one<00:05:25.630> of<00:05:25.660> those<00:05:25.870> pieces<00:05:26.139> so<00:05:26.380> I<00:05:26.410> had<00:05:26.500> to<00:05:26.590> take

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
had one of those pieces so I had to take

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.379 
had one of those pieces so I had to take
an<00:05:26.860> alternative<00:05:27.400> approach<00:05:27.520> so<00:05:27.910> I<00:05:27.940> used<00:05:28.210> these

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
an alternative approach so I used these

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.779 
an alternative approach so I used these
uh<00:05:28.979> minifig<00:05:30.330> what<00:05:31.330> are<00:05:31.450> those<00:05:31.539> called

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
uh minifig what are those called

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.210 
uh minifig what are those called
hand<00:05:33.789> radios<00:05:34.240> I<00:05:34.450> guess<00:05:34.800> walkie<00:05:35.800> talkies

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
hand radios I guess walkie talkies

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.100 
hand radios I guess walkie talkies
that's<00:05:36.400> what<00:05:36.520> they're<00:05:36.669> called<00:05:36.880> I<00:05:37.090> decided<00:05:38.020> to

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
that's what they're called I decided to

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.629 
that's what they're called I decided to
use<00:05:38.229> some<00:05:38.350> of<00:05:38.410> those<00:05:38.500> minifig<00:05:38.889> walkie-talkies

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
use some of those minifig walkie-talkies

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.700 
use some of those minifig walkie-talkies
now<00:05:40.150> unfortunately<00:05:40.450> there<00:05:41.020> are<00:05:41.110> not<00:05:41.320> made<00:05:41.680> in

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
now unfortunately there are not made in

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.469 
now unfortunately there are not made in
reverses<00:05:42.370> of<00:05:42.400> each<00:05:42.580> other<00:05:42.789> the<00:05:43.060> handle<00:05:43.419> is

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
reverses of each other the handle is

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.120 
reverses of each other the handle is
always<00:05:43.780> gonna<00:05:43.870> be<00:05:44.050> facing<00:05:44.260> to<00:05:44.560> the<00:05:44.590> left<00:05:44.860> from

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
always gonna be facing to the left from

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.360 
always gonna be facing to the left from
this<00:05:45.729> view<00:05:46.150> so<00:05:46.770> unfortunately<00:05:47.770> you<00:05:47.860> do<00:05:48.130> get

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
this view so unfortunately you do get

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.070 
this view so unfortunately you do get
the<00:05:48.550> handle<00:05:48.970> of<00:05:49.060> one<00:05:49.210> of<00:05:49.300> them<00:05:49.419> sticking<00:05:49.810> out

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
the handle of one of them sticking out

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.339 
the handle of one of them sticking out
over<00:05:50.110> here<00:05:50.620> but<00:05:51.610> I<00:05:52.389> really<00:05:52.660> wanted<00:05:53.110> to<00:05:53.169> have

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
over here but I really wanted to have

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.320 
over here but I really wanted to have
that<00:05:53.380> design<00:05:53.889> feature<00:05:54.160> in<00:05:54.550> there<00:05:54.880> that<00:05:55.150> little

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
that design feature in there that little

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.860 
that design feature in there that little
antenna<00:05:55.740> so<00:05:56.740> I<00:05:57.099> guess<00:05:57.700> it<00:05:57.789> was<00:05:57.880> worth<00:05:58.030> it<00:05:58.300> it's

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
antenna so I guess it was worth it it's

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.610 
antenna so I guess it was worth it it's
okay<00:05:59.139> I<00:05:59.320> don't<00:06:00.130> mind<00:06:00.370> at<00:06:00.550> all<00:06:00.700> and

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
okay I don't mind at all and

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.500 
okay I don't mind at all and
unfortunately<00:06:02.620> the<00:06:03.010> flaut<00:06:03.220> the<00:06:03.910> plow<00:06:04.180> is<00:06:04.210> a

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
unfortunately the flaut the plow is a

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.730 
unfortunately the flaut the plow is a
little<00:06:04.780> bit<00:06:04.870> fragile<00:06:05.490> but<00:06:06.900> you<00:06:07.900> know<00:06:07.990> as<00:06:08.289> I've

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
little bit fragile but you know as I've

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.260 
little bit fragile but you know as I've
said<00:06:08.889> many<00:06:08.950> times<00:06:09.190> before<00:06:09.610> I<00:06:09.849> don't<00:06:10.150> really

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
said many times before I don't really

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.300 
said many times before I don't really
play<00:06:10.539> with<00:06:10.720> this<00:06:10.900> stuff<00:06:11.050> so<00:06:11.889> it<00:06:12.099> doesn't

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
play with this stuff so it doesn't

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.080 
play with this stuff so it doesn't
really<00:06:12.370> matter<00:06:12.610> to<00:06:12.820> me<00:06:12.849> if<00:06:13.389> it's<00:06:14.039> particularly

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
really matter to me if it's particularly

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.089 
really matter to me if it's particularly
unstable<00:06:16.289> you<00:06:17.289> know<00:06:17.349> as<00:06:17.530> long<00:06:17.710> as<00:06:17.860> it<00:06:17.950> doesn't

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.099 
unstable you know as long as it doesn't

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:20.279 
unstable you know as long as it doesn't
just<00:06:18.340> fall<00:06:18.610> apart<00:06:18.789> when<00:06:19.150> you<00:06:19.180> touch<00:06:19.450> it<00:06:19.479> really

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
just fall apart when you touch it really

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:23.610 
just fall apart when you touch it really
doesn't<00:06:20.590> matter<00:06:20.710> so<00:06:21.150> um<00:06:22.150> yeah<00:06:22.570> that's<00:06:23.139> pretty
