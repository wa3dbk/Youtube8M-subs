00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:12.599
 so hello first that an ass at the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:17.609
 first tutorials this time for the open 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.850
 source program guide and defense 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.439
 knows the likely know that you there 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.810
 can sharpen very comfortable 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.619
 because there is such a kind 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.910
 threshold or one 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.300
 masking and there you can see the areas 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.670
 should not be resharpened 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.960
 virtually with a threshold 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.210
 down rules so that really only 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.940
 in the end perhaps knew what to do 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.690
 you really want to help lead 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.910
 is not so good 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.570
 But I have found a way says 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.390
 is a bit emulate and he 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.610
 I show you now so that we only 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.520
 time to sharpen that this little green 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:07.770
 triangle is briefly last transfiguration 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.930
 yes of course a hooligan donna summer times 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.200
 so he was at three to four 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.110
 on my 60d is to fc st 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.210
 if that's enough three to four 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.979
 steps then we have that area of 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.390
 pretty good in there then in the picture 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.830
 Let's take a look at this area 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.450
 here is such a sign high voltage 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.520
 caution danger of life photographed in 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.229
 King Wusterhausen that with me around the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.479
 corner of schnuckeliger place in brandenburg 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.520
 fact is to do now that is normal 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.860
 and sharpen masks 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.560
 we have here so in the mount is called 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.020
 strength we have the radius and we 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.970
 have the default value of the amount of trash 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.399
 is world famous 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.229
 Now, of course, the question is how can 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.820
 I'm doing that now that I'm seeing 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.090
 which area really sharpened 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.649
 become 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.450
 there is a pretty cool 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.939
 functions called blending mode 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.119
 down here the sites can be normal 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.590
 you say something like that 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.030
 blending methods from photoshop the man 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.539
 so knows or went out 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.250
 i take difference here in this case 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.980
 and you can see that already we have 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.900
 such a 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.030
 So the whole picture inverts you 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.760
 only sees black white areas 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.299
 and the white areas that is pretty 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.340
 Super 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:27.489
 they are here in this case now at 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.049
 yes, at the edges, so to speak, we 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.580
 Now if I want to create now 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.150
 So the radio is here for the first time 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.500
 somehow go up on let's say so 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.629
 21 then we already see that pretty much 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.500
 many knew when I am now 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:43.810
 with the trash gets up and quasi 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.709
 me, so to speak, the masking we yes 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.709
 do not have son in light 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:54.190
 worked out then I will come 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.930
 quite times as a value-I well 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.989
 find 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.579
 then we move here with the regulator from 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.739
 mount the strength of the sharpening 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.629
 continue up and then we can the 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.079
 of course blending back to normal 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.579
 and then you can see already 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:14.079
 by the sign if I now the 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:16.299
 sharpen and turn off resp 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.470
 from and to you can already see the right 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:24.099
 a lot of joking is also behind here 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:26.099
 because of this outdoor air conditioner 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.290
 or whatever that is supposed to be 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:32.040
 I know from say you can see that 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.359
 here are these grids from the fan 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.079
 pretty and sharpen by the 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:40.480
 edges here from the brick on the side 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.540
 at the station in neat 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.400
 work out okay that was my first 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.099
 first goalkeeper liked you 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:55.269
 If so, then I'll be happy otherwise 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:57.750
 do not make time in this sense and until 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.750
 next time
