00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
thing that keeps it from tangling the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.120 
thing that keeps it from tangling the
only<00:01:21.780> downside<00:01:22.229> about<00:01:22.259> having<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> cable<00:01:22.890> like

different<00:03:41.940> but<00:03:42.060> shouldn't<00:03:42.840> be<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.890> much<00:03:43.980> of

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
different but shouldn't be that much of

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
variation as I said the range is pretty

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.310 
variation as I said the range is pretty
good<00:03:47.250> sound<00:03:47.730> is<00:03:47.940> pretty<00:03:48.239> good<00:03:48.390> especially<00:03:48.959> for
