 m 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.500
 I did not like it, I'm a recent law and be 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.299
 Welcome to this example completely 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.700
 live the one that promised them yes esteemed 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.829
 directive is completely live the 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.890
 Sir, implodes that it is obviously so 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:27.430
 812 is let risk is present 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.430
 d 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.720
 and so let's see how this list of 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.309
 games just judged one I think the 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.280
 previous of this one and then it was 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.860
 but it was a king of you and so good of 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.710
 last video of halo 4 of the team 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.110
 sliders I really like your contributions 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.239
 his comments in conclusion the majority 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.710
 said that because the community is not 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.629
 itself the view of the game was not so 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.660
 badly done but there were many 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.329
 castles that are not put to change and 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.140
 all this and right now I just wonder if 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:05.610
 this taste to my person I like more 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.610
 great as obviously the valhalla 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.610
 knights 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:19.780
 the list does not but on big maps and I 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.690
 it's always the epe and all that but yes yes 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.640
 the truth is very good list that is the 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.649
 game itself is not so bad but more 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.860
 well it was me that many come to the 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.860
 conclusion 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.040
 if you want to fly or not 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.770
 affectionate 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:45.130
 how do you see this last three sale 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.130
 cups of life around you from the ball 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:04.860
 and is that for example I saw some 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:06.479
 Perez comments are small maps 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.780
 it's very easy to say if for example in 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.780
 this map 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.370
 and yes yes yes yes annoying if it 's big 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.250
 main because that's how it is like I saw it 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.440
 many agreed in the comments 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.510
 he liked his opinion a lot because they take it 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.209
 seriously very very well I liked it 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.810
 quite the opinions that they leave there in 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.810
 the comments 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:52.140
 many say that the community by 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:55.099
 example has played one but I played 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.099
 a lot this 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.590
 so I got used to it more or less 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.590
 all right 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.129
 nothing 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.200
 but my dad 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.880
 Y 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.700
 I'm waiting for the claws 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.050
 the extremes right now 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.890
 so we are loading 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:52.000
 and all is well of the mockery 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:58.140
 come here come 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.990
 there comes the victory reaching where 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.220
 come on 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.890
 for me it is under this record 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.100
 they will reach listens to listen now 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.900
 mild 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.970
 our globe ball register yes 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:19.049
 it's good that maybe the 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.019
 game when tracy 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:26.330
 but if you play like that alone 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.330
 he is not too addicted 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.130

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:48.759
 good if that considered and you do not get bored 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:55.160

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:57.710

 the big water invests 60 in the 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.800
 forgiven to leave us without anyone in top 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.870
