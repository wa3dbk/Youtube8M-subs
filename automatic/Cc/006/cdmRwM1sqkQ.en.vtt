so<00:00:15.629> episode<00:00:16.169> 1<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.619> about<00:00:16.860> hard<00:00:17.099> drives<00:00:17.550> do<00:00:17.970> you

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
so episode 1 is about hard drives do you

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.580 
so episode 1 is about hard drives do you
have<00:00:18.210> millions<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.720> hard<00:00:18.960> drives<00:00:19.140> floating<00:00:19.470> on

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
have millions of hard drives floating on

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.749 
have millions of hard drives floating on
your<00:00:19.710> house<00:00:19.830> all<00:00:20.099> with<00:00:20.220> different<00:00:20.250> bits<00:00:20.669> of

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
your house all with different bits of

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.400 
your house all with different bits of
data<00:00:20.849> on<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.450> that<00:00:22.050> you're<00:00:22.169> constantly

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
data on and that you're constantly

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.380 
data on and that you're constantly
swapping<00:00:22.890> between<00:00:23.220> computers<00:00:23.760> your<00:00:23.910> laptops

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
swapping between computers your laptops

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.540 
swapping between computers your laptops
and<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.750> need<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.080> really<00:00:25.439> quickly<00:00:25.769> transfer

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
and you need to really quickly transfer

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.490 
and you need to really quickly transfer
large<00:00:26.789> amount<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.210> files<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.720> different<00:00:28.349> hard

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
large amount of files to different hard

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.230 
large amount of files to different hard
drives<00:00:28.590> now<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.949> do<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.670> start<00:00:29.939> my<00:00:30.029> hard

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
drives now I do this and I start my hard

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.429 
drives now I do this and I start my hard
drives<00:00:30.390> around<00:00:30.570> all<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> time<00:00:30.840> because<00:00:31.259> I

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
drives around all the time because I

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.500 
drives around all the time because I
have<00:00:31.590> some<00:00:32.160> hydro-zone<00:00:32.519> main<00:00:32.850> computer<00:00:33.390> that

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
have some hydro-zone main computer that

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.759 
have some hydro-zone main computer that
I'd<00:00:33.600> take<00:00:33.780> them<00:00:33.870> out<00:00:34.019> of<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.230> computer<00:00:34.530> which

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:34.769 
I'd take them out of a computer which

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.229 
I'd take them out of a computer which
involves<00:00:35.190> me<00:00:35.280> opening<00:00:35.580> the<00:00:35.640> case<00:00:35.820> up<00:00:36.059> and

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
involves me opening the case up and

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.759 
involves me opening the case up and
grabbing<00:00:36.390> them<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.720> and<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> put<00:00:37.650> them

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
grabbing them out and I have to put them

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:39.259 
grabbing them out and I have to put them
on<00:00:37.800> other<00:00:37.949> computers<00:00:38.220> to<00:00:38.550> transfer<00:00:38.910> data<00:00:39.089> over

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
on other computers to transfer data over

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.259 
on other computers to transfer data over
because<00:00:39.659> it's<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:39.930> jumbled<00:00:40.320> up<00:00:40.409> and<00:00:40.640> I<00:00:41.640> need<00:00:42.239> a

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
because it's so jumbled up and I need a

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:43.520 
because it's so jumbled up and I need a
solution<00:00:42.659> that's<00:00:42.930> going<00:00:43.080> to<00:00:43.170> mean<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.470> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
solution that's going to mean that I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.049 
solution that's going to mean that I
don't<00:00:43.589> have<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.979> climb<00:00:44.250> into<00:00:44.460> my<00:00:44.640> case<00:00:44.850> every

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
don't have to climb into my case every

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.210 
don't have to climb into my case every
time<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.659> insert<00:00:45.960> hard<00:00:46.320> drive<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:47.159> I

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
time to just insert hard drive in if I

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.280 
time to just insert hard drive in if I
want<00:00:47.339> to<00:00:47.400> transfer<00:00:47.519> data<00:00:47.879> over<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.449> so<00:00:49.110> here

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
want to transfer data over and so here

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.349 
want to transfer data over and so here
comes<00:00:49.470> a<00:00:49.589> solution<00:00:49.979> ready<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:51.269> coming<00:00:51.570> ah

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359

plug<00:01:11.320> any<00:01:11.619> old<00:01:11.860> hard<00:01:12.070> drive<00:01:12.280> that<00:01:12.310> you<00:01:12.460> have

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
plug any old hard drive that you have

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.039 
plug any old hard drive that you have
lying<00:01:12.820> about<00:01:13.000> like<00:01:13.240> this<00:01:13.450> without<00:01:13.840> an

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
lying about like this without an

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.800 
lying about like this without an
enclosure<00:01:14.350> into<00:01:15.159> your<00:01:15.310> computers<00:01:15.820> via<00:01:16.090> USB<00:01:16.360> 3

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
enclosure into your computers via USB 3

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.389 
enclosure into your computers via USB 3
so<00:01:17.049> the<00:01:17.170> advantage<00:01:17.560> of<00:01:17.619> USB<00:01:17.830> 3<00:01:18.159> is<00:01:18.220> it's<00:01:18.310> going

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
so the advantage of USB 3 is it's going

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.670 
so the advantage of USB 3 is it's going
to<00:01:18.460> be<00:01:18.580> super<00:01:18.880> fast<00:01:19.240> a<00:01:19.479> lot<00:01:19.689> faster<00:01:20.049> than<00:01:20.170> USB<00:01:20.380> 2

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
to be super fast a lot faster than USB 2

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.370 
to be super fast a lot faster than USB 2
or<00:01:20.799> USB<00:01:21.100> 1<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.420> we're<00:01:22.539> going<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.720> see<00:01:22.929> what<00:01:23.200> you

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
or USB 1 so we're going to see what you

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.919 
or USB 1 so we're going to see what you
get<00:01:23.560> in<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.890> StarTek<00:01:24.850> USB<00:01:25.240> 3<00:01:25.479> 2<00:01:25.600> SATA<00:01:25.780> adapter

there is also an included driver CD but

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.009 
there is also an included driver CD but
this<00:02:12.190> isn't<00:02:12.340> necessary<00:02:12.790> as<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:13.480> unit<00:02:13.870> is

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
this isn't necessary as this unit is

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.500 
this isn't necessary as this unit is
plug<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.319> play<00:02:14.700> okay<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:15.910> here's<00:02:16.239> how<00:02:16.330> you're

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
plug and play okay so here's how you're

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.850 
plug and play okay so here's how you're
going<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.690> connect<00:02:16.959> your<00:02:17.080> hard<00:02:17.290> drive<00:02:17.560> using

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
going to connect your hard drive using

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.009 
going to connect your hard drive using
the<00:02:18.190> star<00:02:18.700> tech<00:02:18.910> adapter<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.599> first<00:02:19.810> we're

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
the star tech adapter so first we're

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.390 
the star tech adapter so first we're
going<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.230> take<00:02:20.379> the<00:02:20.530> power<00:02:20.680> supply<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.280> you

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
going to take the power supply that you

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.430 
going to take the power supply that you
get<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.819> will<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.390> power<00:02:22.569> plug<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.110> can<00:02:23.260> power

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
get I will the power plug you can power

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.110 
get I will the power plug you can power
plug<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.830> plug<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.190> into<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.610> power<00:02:24.849> brick

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
plug and plug this into the power brick

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.570 
plug and plug this into the power brick
like<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:25.830> then<00:02:26.830> you're<00:02:27.069> going<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.280> take<00:02:27.430> the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
like so then you're going to take the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.130 
like so then you're going to take the
other<00:02:27.610> end<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.909> the<00:02:28.000> power<00:02:28.150> brick<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.629> this<00:02:28.989> is

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
other end of the power brick and this is

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.660 
other end of the power brick and this is
going<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.319> go<00:02:29.530> into<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.950> starting<00:02:30.310> adapter

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
going to go into the starting adapter

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.490 
going to go into the starting adapter
itself<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.269> then<00:02:31.840> there's<00:02:32.050> only<00:02:32.080> one<00:02:32.349> way<00:02:32.440> you

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
itself and then there's only one way you

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.020 
itself and then there's only one way you
can<00:02:32.620> fit<00:02:32.830> up<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.129> that<00:02:33.250> goes<00:02:33.459> in<00:02:33.489> no<00:02:33.730> problem

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
can fit up so that goes in no problem

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.170 
can fit up so that goes in no problem
like<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.980> then<00:02:35.980> after<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.400> we're<00:02:37.000> going<00:02:37.120> to

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
like so then after that we're going to

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.089 
like so then after that we're going to
insert<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.930> hard<00:02:38.349> drive<00:02:38.560> now<00:02:38.739> this<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.069> a

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
insert the hard drive now this is a

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.229 
insert the hard drive now this is a
satyr<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.610> up<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:39.790> you're<00:02:39.879> going<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.060> want<00:02:40.180> to

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
satyr it up so you're going to want to

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.790 
satyr it up so you're going to want to
plug<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.510> into<00:02:40.629> the<00:02:40.780> SATA<00:02:41.019> side<00:02:41.319> of<00:02:41.440> your<00:02:41.560> hard

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
plug it into the SATA side of your hard

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.890 
plug it into the SATA side of your hard
drive<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.280> goes<00:02:42.489> in<00:02:42.700> really<00:02:42.970> simply<00:02:43.480> like

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
drive and it goes in really simply like

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.740 
drive and it goes in really simply like
so<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:45.370> adapter<00:02:45.730> does<00:02:45.879> cover<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.450> power

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
so this adapter does cover the power

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.479 
so this adapter does cover the power
ports<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:47.530> also<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.800> SATA<00:02:48.010> connections

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
ports and also the SATA connections

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.420 
ports and also the SATA connections
there<00:02:48.900> then<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.050> final<00:02:50.379> step<00:02:50.590> is<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.890> take<00:02:51.310> the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
there then the final step is to take the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.640 
there then the final step is to take the
fat<00:02:51.640> end<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:52.000> your<00:02:52.090> included<00:02:52.510> USB<00:02:52.840> 3<00:02:53.080> cable<00:02:53.110> and

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
fat end of your included USB 3 cable and

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.170 
fat end of your included USB 3 cable and
plug<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:54.010> into<00:02:54.129> the<00:02:54.220> blue<00:02:54.459> port<00:02:54.760> on<00:02:54.849> the<00:02:54.940> side

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
plug it into the blue port on the side

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.270 
plug it into the blue port on the side
of<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.569> StarTAC<00:02:55.959> adapter<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:58.440> then<00:02:59.440> this<00:03:00.099> can

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
of the StarTAC adapter and then this can

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.100 
of the StarTAC adapter and then this can
go<00:03:00.370> into<00:03:00.489> USB<00:03:00.760> 3<00:03:01.000> so<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.420> inner<00:03:01.569> all<00:03:01.690> connected

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
go into USB 3 so the inner all connected

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.110 
go into USB 3 so the inner all connected
once<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:02.379> is<00:03:02.500> plugged<00:03:02.650> into<00:03:02.830> your<00:03:02.890> computer

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
once this is plugged into your computer

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.490 
once this is plugged into your computer
then<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.330> want<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.660> make<00:03:04.750> sure<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.990> powers<00:03:05.290> on

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
then you want to make sure the powers on

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.170 
then you want to make sure the powers on
and<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:06.040> also<00:03:06.190> want<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.430> press<00:03:06.670> this<00:03:06.880> power

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
and you also want to press this power
