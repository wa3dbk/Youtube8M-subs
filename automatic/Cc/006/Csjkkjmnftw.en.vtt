best<00:01:39.259> known<00:01:40.259> designer<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:41.039> the<00:01:41.130> world<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.780> so

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
best known designer in the world and so

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.149 
best known designer in the world and so
I<00:01:43.170> tried<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.189> copy<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.319> learn<00:01:46.560> from<00:01:46.920> what

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
I tried to copy and to learn from what

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.039 
I tried to copy and to learn from what
they<00:01:47.189> taught<00:01:47.640> me<00:01:47.670> many<00:01:48.240> years<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.840> working

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
they taught me many years of working

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.840 
they taught me many years of working
together<00:01:49.319> so<00:01:49.679> I<00:01:49.740> think<00:01:49.859> these<00:01:50.219> hours<00:01:50.460> are<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
together so I think these hours are the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.819 
together so I think these hours are the
level<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.149> sophistication<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.350> rarely

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
level of sophistication that is rarely

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.980 
level of sophistication that is rarely
