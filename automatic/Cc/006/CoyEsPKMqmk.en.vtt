 today's battle we will be watching from 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.140
 towers of soviet tank a-43 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.329
 This tank is interesting primarily because 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.870
 the commander’s tower ranks 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.059

 this person now we see both on the field 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.909
 a rather strange situation occurs 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.030
 or our tank brakes failed 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.790
 either the mechvod refused hearing and he did not 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.200
 hears the orders of the commander and lucky 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.470
 a gift to the enemy their pathetic x 730 in 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.439
 intimate area of ​​the lesion lit up 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.829
 at-8 and our kvass a-43 is trying to attack 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.170
 shortness of breath in the forehead but kills the earth but even 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.570
 if the projectile flew in the forehead of the enemy 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.579
 pt nothing good anyway 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.490
 it happened because we all know that 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.759
 attack British pt in the forehead is like 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.310
 Petrosyan concert tickets are expensive and not 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.220
 funny now as we see on the field 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.979
 something incredible is happening and until now 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.480
 unheard of green team players 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.540
 start helping 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.020
 each other and jointly disassemble 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.270
 at-8 his next victim a-43 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.060
 chooses kvass but thanks to the first 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.960
 shot, we learn that our gunner 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.090
 and stitches wild hangover 2 and 3 shots with 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.120
 hard in half but still arrive in 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.610
 kvass carcass and then our hero resolves 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.200
 allies finish off the red tie 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.170
 and now we are becoming 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.500
 witnessing how from the battlefield trying 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.110
 make feet su-5 but deserters friends 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.860
 need to be punished harshly whatever 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.520
 What team are they playing for? 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.130
 in sight a-43 appears m44 and he 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.910
 puts enemy arta in front of heavy 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.910
 by choice 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.710
 plug in the eye or new in the know 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.890
 enemy art to order 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.050
 resists as the allies begin to take 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.180
 base our hero joins 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.030
 holiday capture base as suddenly in 100 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.280
 meters out of the fog of war emerges apt-1s 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.470
 red cord explains green chinese 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.420
 that taking someone else’s is bad even if 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.880
 Chinese base from so many 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.190
 information is just torn bottom 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.410
 and the allied cruiser decides to render on 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.620
 class psychological pressure and 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.260
 spit it with mine bombs kvass this joke 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.020
 apparently not appreciated after his shot 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.959
 the mark of the British goes out on the minimap 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.970
 A-43 comes from the flank and I hope to call 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.980
 avalanche shoots mountainside 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.450
 but whether this year snow fell 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.820
 not enough 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.250
 game mechanics do not provide 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.470
 but the convergence of avalanches bury kvass under 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.900
 a thick layer of snow failed 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.450
 suddenly from the coast comes big and 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.760
 heavy suitcase which is half full 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.830
 xn our tank and makes him 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.650
 throw away the harp for a while 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.739
 it is at this moment that malice eclipses 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.500
 mind commander a-43 spit on 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.780
 kvass our hero a rapid zigzag on 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.440
 mad speed of 50 kilometers per hour 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.570
 begins to disassemble the Su-122 and because you need 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.200
 just nothing else to do a couple of shots 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.460
 but the dark side of the power took possession of r2 d2 and 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.610
 he decides not 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.310
 After all, Arta is a ram in billiards and films 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.070
