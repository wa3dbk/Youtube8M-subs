00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.180
 and today we are going to do some 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.110
 decorations with onion we are going to 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.040
 turn these feitas jewels into some 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.040
 pretty sweet 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.330
 let's clean our onion 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.679
 removing the most degraded layers and 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.109
 dirty layers 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.840
 let's do a zig zag in the part 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.269
 central of our onion this is going to be 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.940
 so we take half and nail 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:43.190
 our knife trying to measure that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.190
 between half of our pots 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.970
 that have more or less always the same 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.430
 distance so it looks as even 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.440
 and pretty possible as you will see it is quite 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.440
 simple is a simple zig zag 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.050
 it suits us to combine with 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.820
 some red green yellow color 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.170
 depending on what it is that we are 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.850
 where our plate in the final part 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.510
 we will try to count and now what 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.090
 We will simply open our 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.400
 Onion with care not to break 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.020
 we made our cuts well is going to 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.869
 open without any problem and that 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.810
 we will have a simple and very easy way 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.310
 of making a flower or a decoration with 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.950
 our onion now let's improve it 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.960
 we are going to give a crystalline effect what 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.950
 what we will do is how this side is 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.030
 open and if we do not open it let's take out 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.050
 our segments that we have done pushing 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.570
 gently 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.590
 the center of our onion so that 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.790
 it comes off taking off our layers of 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.520
 onion 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.340
 and we will be leaving these layers 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.610
 loose and that what we will do with all 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.800
 little by little we carefully take off 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.550
 so we're not going to break them 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.170
 we will try not to mess up much 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.509
 you will say what is the joke of this 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.120
 let's see 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.150
 now we are accommodating them again in 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.220
 its place but interspersing the peaks not 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.519
 we will leave them settled as in a 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.740
 start we put our first layer and in 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.570
 the following are given 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.570
 the peaks aside 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.240
 with three or four that we put is already 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.760
 well and it is much more colorful this 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.970
 effect with a purple onion here what 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.490
 we can put some center or continue 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.770
 with the rest of our onions them 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.930
 I will leave the two examples as you will see 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.210
 a center with a carrot can do 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.350
 just a little ball 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.420
 and see what a nice mouse effect but for 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.630
 this case I will continue to put my 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.630
 acts 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:06.260
 and now they look like we have our 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.970
 onion flower 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.970
 there is a nice chrysanthemum 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.890
 Now let's do something differently 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.230
 let's start cutting in ways to 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.390
 students 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.670
 but we only have to do it in 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.670
 the first layer of the onion 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.970
 it has to be very superficial of this 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.489
 cut and now we will see how we will go 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.680
 removing the other layers now with the 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.959
 tip of our knife we are going to 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.420
 cut the first layer of skin 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.180
 our onion and we are going to remove it 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.690
 with care since we removed our 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.390
 first layer we will do the same again 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.519
 doing other rainbow shapes 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.930
 interspersed with those we did first 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.490
 we will do it on the first layer of 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.040
 our onion 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.790
 We cut with our knife and remove 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.620
 again of that layer that we cut and 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.960
 So we will continue until we finish our 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.650
 onion doing it interspersed will look 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.650
 prettier 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.210
 now I'm going to do it faster so that 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.460
 do not lengthen the video this is the first 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.190
 video of decorations with onion in the 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.019
 basic level of beginners follow me 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.760
 what ingredient would you like to have 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.090
 make decorations for the next 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.240
 video tomato onion tomato squash 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.310
 carrot cucumber if our onion 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.180
 It has a rabito such as those of 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.759
 cambrai will be more this part of above 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.600
 I'm going to remove a little 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:42.699
 the top part and let it do and 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.250
 here is this other decoration would be a 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.840
 onion shaped like a pita there and 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.970
 these three serve us very well for 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.220
 decorate some dish some salad 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.750
