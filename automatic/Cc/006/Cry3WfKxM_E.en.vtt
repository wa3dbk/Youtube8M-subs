00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.480
 Welcome to Metabolism TV your source of correct information on the metabolism 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.450
 and health. Corn, how rich is corn! He left the Aztecs, from the area 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.289
 from Mexico of that over there, right? I'm Frank Suarez specialist in obesity and metabolism. 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.500
 I want to talk to you today about how it makes us fatter, which is the substance that most fattens us 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.690
 which is called, in English they call it "High fructose corn syrup" which is the syrup of 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.850
 corn they use to make coca-cola and that nowadays practically all the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.110
 food, at least here in the United States, almost all the food you find in 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.619
 the supermarket contain one way or another, contain the syrup that of corn, for example 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:00.350
 the vegetables buy them and as many times they are not yet mature, they are not 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.460
 Sweet enough and what do you throw? Corn syrup, the same hot-dogs 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.170
 (What's that called in Spanish?) Hot dogs as they say over there, they throw them 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.440
 There is my god who can think of it! So that the meat tastes sweet corn syrup, 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.830
 in Puerto Rico and the United States, they pour corn syrup on everything. These gringos pour syrup 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:33.720
 of corn to everything, what happens? It has already been discovered that nothing, nothing goes up the cholesterol, goes up 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.980
 more triglycerides and faster weight gain than corn syrup, nothing! 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.610
 that corn syrup is used to fatten pigs and chickens, why? 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.430
 Because it's the fastest thing that makes them fat because corn is very high in fructose, 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.310
 corn syrup what is a very concentrated fructose and when it says high fructose, right? 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.619
 That is high fructose because the way it fattens is that it fattens faster than any 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.260
 another sugar and I'll explain why, I'm going to the blackboard for a little while. I'm telling you 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.039
 to Jorge so he knows I'm going to the blackboard because Jorge is complaining to me, Jorge is 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.439
 our creative director, you have not seen it but I'm going to do an episode for 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:16.620
 that you know Jorge, right? It is a character, a character. He's a skinny condemned of those 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.340
 who eats pizza and those things so I have to be watching, but anyway 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.090
 this ... corn syrup is a substance that makes you very fat, nothing gets fatter 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:36.330
 that, look, many people have seen that when they use coca-cola, all these 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.490
 Soda, what they have is liquid sugar and that liquid sugar is in the form of syrup 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.980
 of corn, the food industry, the food industry found that the sweetener more 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.330
 economic there is corn syrup, it is cheaper than sugar because sugar 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.280
 it is taken from the cane or the beet, but it goes through a process that is quite expensive, 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.959
 For example, corn is very easy to pick up, squeeze it and get that corn syrup, 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.750
 No, the reason why that corn syrup is so fattening is because here next 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.920
 right of the body, here is the liver, a common food, a sugar 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.320
 ordinary enters the stomach, right? and the stomach goes through the entire digestive system, 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.400
 where it is extracted and finally reaches the liver but there is something that happens with corn syrup 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.709
 and that is that corn syrup goes almost directly to the liver, in fact when they want 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.130
 increase a weight animal a lot what they give is corn syrup in the case of humans 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.881
 when we use corn syrup that is in the food, which is in the fresh 

00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:51.879
 And then basically what happens is that as soon as it reaches the liver, the syrup 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:04:01.280
 of corn as it is such a concentrated fructose turns into triglycerides, the word 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.670
 triglycerides that we have explained in other episodes but for those who have not 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.599
 seen tri, comes from 3 and glyceride comes from glycerin, glycerin is what contains the 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:17.190
 Fat is a fat molecule that has three legs and is what makes up fat, when 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.310
 you say I have a lot of body fat, what you are saying is that you have a lot 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.409
 triglyceride, all triglycerides are fat. Now when the doctor says he has 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:28.030
 the high triglycerides, what you are saying is that there is a lot of fat floating in 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.850
 his blood, that's what they're telling him, they're even telling him it's more dangerous 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.290
 have high triglycerides that have high cholesterol for the effects of a heart attack, 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.949
 When the corn syrup reaches the liver, it automatically becomes triglycerides 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.600
 and those triglycerides when they accumulate, they become fat so some of the 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.160
 The fastest ways that there is to get fat is to use, what do I know? Soft drinks like coca cola 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:03.690
 or soft drinks containing the famous "High fructose corn syrup" or corn syrup 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.180
 so please when you go to the supermarket please observe the food, if it says sirup 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.410
 of corn consume it very carefully and try to consume much less quantity of it, 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.770
 I do not forbid anything because I do not believe in prohibitions, but if I believe that you should 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.390
 Be aware and you must know what you are giving your children, especially if you have children 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.449
 with obesity problems, you will see that the cookies have "High fructose corn syrup" 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:31.000
 that the bread has "High fructose corn syrup" that the juices that they give to children 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.050
 all are full of "High fructose corn syrup" everything is full of syrup that of 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.090
 corn condemned wherever he is, so you know what? The truth always triumphs.
