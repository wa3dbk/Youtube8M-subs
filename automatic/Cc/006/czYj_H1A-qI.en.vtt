00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hi how are you all good at this 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.660
 I'm going to give you a solution to the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.400
 people who do not start the windows to 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.070
 those who have the black screen and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.889
 labeled these solutions for 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.220
 notebook and I think also for pc to 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.920
 windows xp vista and 7 good without more 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.900
 words let's start I want to tell you that 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.359
 I do not remember well that I was going first and that 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.760
 I was going second but they are going to see images and 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.769
 they will also have the safe solution 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.810
 They must have the notebook turned off or the PC 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.420
 I will say notebook but also 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.340
 I include the pc and they will also be 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.980
 watching this video on another pc or on a 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.290
 cellular but good if they have the notebook 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.420
 off turn on and attention when 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.510
 appears the brand of the product tighten 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.850
 f10 is the windows xp and if you have 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.040
 windows 7 or view press the key that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.340
 appears to them and this will appear 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.590
 this is but do not touch anything come out 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.950
 tighten escape and they will receive an 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.040
 small box consigned tighten itself when 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.980
 come out they will appear this and press on 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.110
 safe mode and start loading something 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.880
 how do they wait until I load them 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.830
 everything and when I finish analyzing and 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.960
 load everything will start window and 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.630
 select the user and they will 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.310
 appear this says that if you want to try 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.380
 what things are wrong but it's not going to 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.270
 serve if they squeeze in if they see the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.850
 desk everything normal but with to the 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.100
 appearance of windows 98 and when the 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.410
 restart it will look black again so 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.330
 squeeze in not like this we recover the 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.670
 windows before and everything back to the 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.470
 normality will appear this here have 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.720
 to select or choose the most 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.110
 recent that you had with the pc 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.420
 when they installed something the same will mark them 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.090
 some dates you select the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.969
 more recent 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.950
 when they finish press next now 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.289
 I do not remember that was when 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.359
 they did that so I leave you more images 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.490
 or less than what will continue but is very 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:59.750
 easy things will appear and tighten 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.750
 next and continue 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.879
 good and when they finish tighten in 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.670
 finish when they finish they will ask 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:19.400
 restart the pc if I'm not wrong and the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.409
 restart when boot up the pc will load 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.420
 and will start windows but they will have the 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.430
 things like the date they put in but 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.159
 that does not matter as long as the pc walks 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.170
 again and good I did this tutorial for 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.239
 the people who pass this there is no 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.250
 many videos that explain this and good 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.500

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.730
