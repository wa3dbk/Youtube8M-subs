00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:22.189
 to make we need 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.220
 it is doses. and also me thickness is 15 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.410
 millimeters template can download in 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.520
 we can download from our group 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.500
 VKontakte and such karambe tag we can 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.199
 make in two ways that is either 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.309
 from three parts we make one whole 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:44.510
 and then do the lining or do with 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:48.040
 one valuable plank but provided that 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.230
 we will then choose to cut 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.440
 grind the blade itself as it were 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.320
 Thinning is not difficult 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.430
 we get to work we cut it first 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.550
 all the jigsaw here cut out our jigsaw 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.670
 billet but we have it in thickness everywhere 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.320
 about the same where the lens i 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.810
 drew a line with a pencil and a pen 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.140
 now you need to refine here to do 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.030
 sand or trim and bring as 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.970
 a thinner blade to simulate 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.259
 the very shape of the knife can do it 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.470
 Of course a knife gently but undercutting 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.200
 to the layers we risk that without certain 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.479
 skills I won't do it so better 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.899
 to take 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:41.810
 nozzle on the Bulgarian here is a plan with 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.689
 large sandpaper and here these places 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.520
 which we need to choose it we 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.450
 pre for example clamp jump 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.329
 somewhere behind the handle of our billet 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.659
 either take a sander in any way 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.659
 will fit 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.879
 please have a solid hook i have 60k 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.410
 sandpaper 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.750
 if from cereals and can be larger take off 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.370
 first there silesia 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.370
 behind . and then you can get closer to the grip 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:22.670
 Here we see that it turns out that I have 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.969
 raised why also do with this 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.019
 parties 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:31.510
 two feathers further 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.659
 but only here are the formats that I had 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.209
 we drill 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:39.139
 and that is, purely for beauty and 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.159
 the hole is then processed and 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:46.400
 emery and then finely on the dacha 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:50.239
 a piece of paper, we will all be a wolf to not 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.329
 help the burr well and the current look 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:57.590
 as you like, that's basically 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:04:00.530
 karambe are you ready for more spectacular 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.799
 kind of can be painted silver night 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.719
 blade and how not any brown 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.750
 Is it a little different paint 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:11.980
 Contrast was paint a pen to him 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.980
 will look like you wo n't
