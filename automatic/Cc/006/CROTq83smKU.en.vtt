Snape actually started as a free-to-play

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.810 
Snape actually started as a free-to-play
player<00:01:34.439> he<00:01:34.680> did<00:01:34.829> not<00:01:34.950> buy<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.280> game<00:01:35.579> when<00:01:35.790> I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
player he did not buy the game when I

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.880 
player he did not buy the game when I
did<00:01:36.210> he<00:01:36.689> actually<00:01:36.869> bought<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.439> when<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.770> was

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.929 
free to play so I guess he did that
because<00:01:40.290> he<00:01:40.590> figured<00:01:40.890> oh<00:01:41.009> well<00:01:41.250> might<00:01:41.790> as<00:01:41.820> well

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
I'll try it what the hell you know but

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.969 
I'll try it what the hell you know but
yeah<00:01:57.509> my<00:01:57.780> brother<00:01:58.049> started<00:01:58.500> off<00:01:58.710> as

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
yeah my brother started off as

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.399 
yeah my brother started off as
free-to-play<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.600> think<00:02:01.020> he's<00:02:01.229> actually

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
free-to-play and I think he's actually

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.950 
free-to-play and I think he's actually
better<00:02:02.159> than<00:02:02.520> me<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.270> play<00:02:03.540> with<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.750> lot<00:02:03.899> of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
better than me and I play with a lot of

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.920 
better than me and I play with a lot of
guys<00:02:04.140> who<00:02:04.409> started<00:02:04.649> off<00:02:04.920> as<00:02:05.270> free-to-play<00:02:06.270> but

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
guys who started off as free-to-play but

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.589 
guys who started off as free-to-play but
they<00:02:07.290> are<00:02:07.500> way<00:02:07.829> better<00:02:08.190> than<00:02:08.369> me<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:09.420> are

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
they are way better than me they are

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.500 
they are way better than me they are
definitely<00:02:10.080> not<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.440> old<00:02:11.370> version<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.239> what

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
definitely not the old version of what

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.309 
definitely not the old version of what
we<00:02:12.750> thought

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
we thought

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.890 
we thought
free-to-play<00:02:14.129> meant<00:02:14.549> now<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.150> look<00:02:15.569> like<00:02:15.599> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
free-to-play meant now I look like the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.339 
free-to-play meant now I look like the
free-to-play<00:02:16.170> guy<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:17.599> tf2<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:18.900> think<00:02:19.260> it's

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
free-to-play guy in tf2 I think it's

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.860 
free-to-play guy in tf2 I think it's
very<00:02:19.500> difficult<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.430> judge<00:02:21.239> how<00:02:21.540> good<00:02:21.840> a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
very difficult to judge how good a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.500 
very difficult to judge how good a
player<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.560> based<00:02:23.310> on<00:02:23.579> if<00:02:23.760> they<00:02:23.909> got<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.299> game

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
player is based on if they got the game

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.160 
player is based on if they got the game
for<00:02:24.780> free<00:02:24.810> or<00:02:25.170> not<00:02:25.519> now<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.579> term<00:02:27.000> hatless<00:02:27.599> may

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
for free or not now the term hatless may

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.250 
for free or not now the term hatless may
also<00:02:28.379> be<00:02:28.709> used<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.450> describe<00:02:30.450> someone<00:02:30.989> who<00:02:31.019> is

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
also be used to describe someone who is

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.369 
also be used to describe someone who is
pretty<00:02:31.560> new<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.159> tf2<00:02:32.730> because<00:02:33.180> Atlas<00:02:34.049> means

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
pretty new to tf2 because Atlas means

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.500 
pretty new to tf2 because Atlas means
that<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.829> are<00:02:35.280> using<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.730> free<00:02:35.940> account<00:02:36.239> you

can't get cosmetic items and therefore

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.990 
can't get cosmetic items and therefore
you<00:02:39.359> must<00:02:39.540> suck<00:02:39.930> right<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:41.489> some<00:02:41.730> people<00:02:41.819> use

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
you must suck right so some people use

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.940 
you must suck right so some people use

the term hatless is kind of a synonym

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.789 
the term hatless is kind of a synonym
for<00:02:44.159> free-to-play<00:02:45.109> but<00:02:46.109> you<00:02:46.290> know<00:02:46.409> what<00:02:46.590> I've

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
look cool I honestly think that the

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.660 
look cool I honestly think that the
default<00:02:57.989> weapons<00:02:58.440> are<00:02:58.620> still<00:02:58.859> pretty<00:02:59.220> good<00:02:59.310> in

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
default weapons are still pretty good in

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.879 
default weapons are still pretty good in
tf2<00:02:59.879> yes<00:03:00.480> there<00:03:00.690> are<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.870> bunch<00:03:01.109> of<00:03:01.319> weapons<00:03:01.500> but

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
tf2 yes there are a bunch of weapons but

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.039 
tf2 yes there are a bunch of weapons but
these<00:03:02.040> special<00:03:02.340> perks<00:03:02.879> these<00:03:03.540> special

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
these special perks these special

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.890 
these special perks these special
gimmicks<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:05.579> lot<00:03:05.909> of<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.180> default<00:03:06.690> ones

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
gimmicks but a lot of the default ones

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.890 
gimmicks but a lot of the default ones
are<00:03:07.310> still<00:03:08.310> very<00:03:08.670> good<00:03:08.849> and<00:03:09.090> very<00:03:09.329> effective

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
are still very good and very effective

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.690 
are still very good and very effective
like<00:03:10.079> this<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.620> stinky<00:03:10.920> bomb<00:03:11.069> launcher<00:03:11.280> and

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
like this the stinky bomb launcher and

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.339 
like this the stinky bomb launcher and
the<00:03:12.000> pipe<00:03:12.209> bomb<00:03:12.420> launcher<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.840> think<00:03:13.079> this<00:03:13.200> is

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
the pipe bomb launcher I think this is

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.430 
the pipe bomb launcher I think this is
one<00:03:13.889> of<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.069> most<00:03:14.220> consistently<00:03:14.940> good

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
one of the most consistently good

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.610 
one of the most consistently good
loadouts

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
loadouts

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.500 
loadouts
for<00:03:16.889> the<00:03:17.010> demo<00:03:17.220> man<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.819> other<00:03:17.940> weapons<00:03:18.359> are

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
for the demo man the other weapons are

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.509 
for the demo man the other weapons are
kind<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:18.810> gimmicky<00:03:19.349> and<00:03:19.379> they<00:03:19.949> may<00:03:20.220> not<00:03:20.340> work

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
kind of gimmicky and they may not work

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.189 
kind of gimmicky and they may not work
all<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.879> time<00:03:20.910> but<00:03:21.359> I<00:03:21.540> really<00:03:21.870> like<00:03:22.049> the

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
all the time but I really like the

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.140 
all the time but I really like the
default<00:03:22.590> stuff<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.069> I<00:03:23.099> thought<00:03:23.280> well<00:03:23.579> if

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
default stuff and I thought well if

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.360 
default stuff and I thought well if
someone<00:03:24.569> stays<00:03:24.810> free-to-play<00:03:25.410> they<00:03:26.190> can

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
someone stays free-to-play they can

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.270 
someone stays free-to-play they can
still<00:03:26.669> get<00:03:26.940> very<00:03:27.000> good<00:03:27.840> at<00:03:28.169> the<00:03:28.590> default<00:03:29.040> stuff

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
still get very good at the default stuff

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.330 
still get very good at the default stuff

there are some really weird stuff in
this<00:04:33.979> game<00:04:34.160> like<00:04:34.340> rocket<00:04:34.789> jumping<00:04:35.120> you<00:04:35.240> don't

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
this game like rocket jumping you don't

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.360 
this game like rocket jumping you don't
have<00:04:35.569> rocket<00:04:35.990> jumping<00:04:36.379> and<00:04:36.530> counter-strike

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
have rocket jumping and counter-strike

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.159 
have rocket jumping and counter-strike
but<00:04:37.970> a<00:04:38.150> lot<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.330> them<00:04:38.509> just<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:38.990> basic

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
but a lot of them just a basic

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.409 
but a lot of them just a basic
first-person<00:04:40.039> mechanics<00:04:40.580> like<00:04:40.849> shooting

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
first-person mechanics like shooting

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.779 
first-person mechanics like shooting
like<00:04:41.629> sniping<00:04:42.229> they<00:04:42.800> kind<00:04:43.009> of<00:04:43.069> carry<00:04:43.370> over

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
like sniping they kind of carry over

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.460 
like sniping they kind of carry over
from<00:04:44.120> these<00:04:44.330> first-person<00:04:44.930> shooters<00:04:45.289> and

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
from these first-person shooters and

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.610 
from these first-person shooters and
other<00:04:45.590> games<00:04:45.919> so<00:04:46.669> I<00:04:46.699> think<00:04:46.940> tf2<00:04:47.900> being<00:04:48.259> free

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
other games so I think tf2 being free

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.640 
other games so I think tf2 being free
allows<00:04:49.190> it<00:04:49.490> to<00:04:49.520> be<00:04:49.909> sort<00:04:50.449> of<00:04:50.509> a<00:04:50.629> free<00:04:50.659> casual

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
allows it to be sort of a free casual

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.089 
allows it to be sort of a free casual
game<00:04:51.949> that<00:04:52.610> people<00:04:52.909> can<00:04:53.060> use<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.479> relax

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
game that people can use to relax

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.010 
game that people can use to relax
sometimes<00:04:55.300> sometimes<00:04:56.300> you<00:04:56.419> can<00:04:56.539> rage<00:04:56.750> at<00:04:56.900> this

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
sometimes sometimes you can rage at this

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.980 
sometimes sometimes you can rage at this
game<00:04:57.199> so<00:04:57.409> much<00:04:58.090> now<00:04:59.090> I<00:04:59.120> don't<00:04:59.360> know<00:04:59.630> how<00:04:59.840> much

lot more than the standard model of

think is a little overpriced especially
the<00:05:23.270> surplus<00:05:23.780> and<00:05:24.409> $2.00<00:05:25.190> for<00:05:25.610> a<00:05:25.639> surplus

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
the surplus and $2.00 for a surplus

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.149 
the surplus and $2.00 for a surplus
ticket<00:05:26.719> there's<00:05:27.349> a<00:05:27.440> little<00:05:27.650> bit<00:05:27.770> much<00:05:27.979> it's

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159 
ticket there's a little bit much it's

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:31.360 
ticket there's a little bit much it's
more<00:05:28.370> than<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.669> actual<00:05:28.819> man<00:05:29.629> up<00:05:29.870> ticket<00:05:30.349> but<00:05:31.340> I

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
more than the actual man up ticket but I

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.040 
more than the actual man up ticket but I
think<00:05:31.610> valve<00:05:31.849> is<00:05:32.000> on<00:05:32.030> a<00:05:32.120> great<00:05:32.449> job<00:05:32.780> in<00:05:33.020> making

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
think valve is on a great job in making

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.559 
think valve is on a great job in making
tf2<00:05:33.979> free-to-play<00:05:34.729> with<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.150> micro

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:35.569 
tf2 free-to-play with the micro

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.839 
tf2 free-to-play with the micro
transactions<00:05:36.289> they<00:05:36.889> sure<00:05:37.069> got<00:05:37.250> a<00:05:37.280> lot<00:05:37.400> of<00:05:37.699> my

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
transactions they sure got a lot of my

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.240 
transactions they sure got a lot of my
money<00:05:38.030> now<00:05:38.930> just<00:05:38.960> because<00:05:39.560> this<00:05:39.710> is<00:05:39.860> going<00:05:40.159> to

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
money now just because this is going to

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.370 
money now just because this is going to
be<00:05:40.400> a<00:05:40.430> free-to-play<00:05:41.270> game<00:05:41.509> probably<00:05:41.780> forever

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
be a free-to-play game probably forever

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.040 
be a free-to-play game probably forever
it<00:05:42.680> doesn't<00:05:43.099> mean<00:05:43.909> it's<00:05:44.090> actually<00:05:44.210> a<00:05:44.449> bad<00:05:44.750> game

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
it doesn't mean it's actually a bad game

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.019 
it doesn't mean it's actually a bad game
I<00:05:45.080> think<00:05:45.229> tf2<00:05:45.830> is<00:05:45.979> one<00:05:46.159> of<00:05:46.279> the<00:05:46.370> best<00:05:46.669> and<00:05:46.969> most

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:47.029 
I think tf2 is one of the best and most

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:50.050 
I think tf2 is one of the best and most
well-made<00:05:47.779> find<00:05:48.500> games<00:05:48.889> out<00:05:49.159> there<00:05:49.190> there's

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
well-made find games out there there's

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.180 
well-made find games out there there's
so<00:05:50.360> much<00:05:50.569> detail<00:05:51.050> that<00:05:51.080> valve<00:05:51.620> has<00:05:51.800> put<00:05:52.009> in<00:05:52.099> so

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
so much detail that valve has put in so

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.490 
so much detail that valve has put in so
much<00:05:52.460> balancing<00:05:53.210> and<00:05:53.449> you<00:05:53.900> know<00:05:53.990> listening<00:05:54.349> to

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
much balancing and you know listening to

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.809 
much balancing and you know listening to
the<00:05:54.590> community<00:05:54.949> and<00:05:55.430> getting<00:05:55.550> the<00:05:55.699> community

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
the community and getting the community

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:59.709 
the community and getting the community
involved<00:05:56.560> that<00:05:57.560> it<00:05:58.190> doesn't<00:05:58.729> feel<00:05:59.029> like<00:05:59.479> a

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 
involved that it doesn't feel like a

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:01.450 
involved that it doesn't feel like a
free-to-play<00:06:00.380> game<00:06:00.650> like<00:06:00.860> I<00:06:00.979> would<00:06:01.130> still

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
free-to-play game like I would still

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.510 
free-to-play game like I would still
actually<00:06:01.699> buy<00:06:02.210> it<00:06:02.270> if<00:06:02.539> I<00:06:02.659> could<00:06:03.310> some<00:06:04.310> of<00:06:04.430> these

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
actually buy it if I could some of these

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.510 
actually buy it if I could some of these
other<00:06:04.729> free-to-play<00:06:05.270> games<00:06:05.539> they<00:06:06.169> feel<00:06:06.770> very

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
other free-to-play games they feel very

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.100 
other free-to-play games they feel very
free<00:06:07.880> to<00:06:07.909> play<00:06:08.210> because<00:06:08.479> it<00:06:08.750> feels<00:06:08.900> like

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
free to play because it feels like

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.409 
free to play because it feels like
they're<00:06:09.259> very<00:06:09.440> cheaply<00:06:09.919> made<00:06:10.279> and<00:06:10.639> it's<00:06:11.270> like

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
they're very cheaply made and it's like

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.269 
they're very cheaply made and it's like
oh<00:06:11.539> well<00:06:11.750> yeah<00:06:11.960> now<00:06:12.229> I<00:06:12.259> understand<00:06:12.889> why<00:06:13.069> it's

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:13.279 
oh well yeah now I understand why it's

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:16.209 
oh well yeah now I understand why it's
free<00:06:13.610> but<00:06:14.060> with<00:06:14.210> tf2<00:06:14.690> it's<00:06:14.870> different<00:06:15.289> it's<00:06:16.039> a

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:16.219 
free but with tf2 it's different it's a

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:17.740 
free but with tf2 it's different it's a
very<00:06:16.550> high<00:06:16.849> I<00:06:17.060> think<00:06:17.210> it's<00:06:17.330> a<00:06:17.360> very<00:06:17.479> high

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
very high I think it's a very high

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.589 
very high I think it's a very high
quality<00:06:17.810> game<00:06:18.529> yet<00:06:19.400> they<00:06:19.819> are<00:06:20.000> taking<00:06:20.449> a<00:06:20.569> risk

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 
quality game yet they are taking a risk

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.779 
quality game yet they are taking a risk
with<00:06:21.080> this<00:06:21.229> free-to-play<00:06:21.770> model<00:06:21.979> and<00:06:22.370> I<00:06:22.460> think

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 
with this free-to-play model and I think

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:25.959 
with this free-to-play model and I think
this<00:06:23.090> risk<00:06:23.419> is<00:06:23.659> paying<00:06:24.529> off<00:06:24.830> I'm<00:06:25.520> not<00:06:25.729> even

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:25.969 
this risk is paying off I'm not even

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.159 
this risk is paying off I'm not even
sure<00:06:26.120> if<00:06:26.240> they<00:06:26.360> considered<00:06:26.779> it<00:06:26.870> a<00:06:26.960> risk

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
sure if they considered it a risk

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:28.990 
sure if they considered it a risk
because<00:06:27.409> maybe<00:06:27.620> they're<00:06:27.889> like<00:06:28.099> yeah<00:06:28.370> this<00:06:28.819> is

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
because maybe they're like yeah this is

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.279 
because maybe they're like yeah this is
going<00:06:29.180> to<00:06:29.270> work<00:06:29.419> this<00:06:29.630> is<00:06:29.779> like<00:06:29.900> the<00:06:30.050> perfect

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
going to work this is like the perfect

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.589 
going to work this is like the perfect
kind<00:06:30.529> of<00:06:30.650> testbed<00:06:31.190> to<00:06:31.759> test<00:06:32.029> this<00:06:32.210> kind<00:06:32.479> of

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
kind of testbed to test this kind of

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.070 
kind of testbed to test this kind of
model<00:06:32.930> on<00:06:33.460> so<00:06:34.460> those<00:06:34.819> are<00:06:34.969> my<00:06:35.089> thoughts<00:06:35.330> on<00:06:35.659> tf2

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
model on so those are my thoughts on tf2

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.170 
model on so those are my thoughts on tf2
and<00:06:36.399> free-to-play<00:06:37.399> it's<00:06:37.610> been<00:06:37.729> out<00:06:37.880> for<00:06:37.909> a
