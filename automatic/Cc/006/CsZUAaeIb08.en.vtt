00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Hi guys here is the shovel and today I'm here 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.109
 to make a video about a super book 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.139
 special the book a super special film 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.389
 there was that last month was the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.830
 the boy in the striped pajamas the boy 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.809
 first I would like to thank you all 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.109
 world that pointed me to this book when 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.859
 he haunted his house the net author 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.119
 online 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.710
 I had asked you to live 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.750
 indications because they had liked 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.430
 of the writing of john boyne I think never 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.230
 had given chance to his books 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.230
 because he spoke of historical periods 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.239
 and I had a certain prejudice with 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.380
 books that dealt with historical facts 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.719
 because I did not like I had some 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.879
 kind of trauma with books about facts 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.789
 and fiction and government do 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.739
 story I let everything not read and people 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.329
 What harm did I do not to have gone this book? 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.890
 before I would like to thank all 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.840
 the world that indicated me and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.879
 help fields that gave me this book 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.770
 meeting of large cradle July is very 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.239
 Thank you very much, you do not know the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.859
 difference that made my life 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.660
 from the moment I read this book 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.309
 start talking about my reading of the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.350
 book and then the add-on speaking a 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.689
 Bit about the movie and what I think 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.090
 the book will be the girl's vision of 9 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.880
 years old called bruno he is a 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.590
 His father is a soldier. 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.710
 his mother is a housewife and his brother 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.240
 older than 12 years and it is his vision 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.600
 we will have a book so 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.659
 that many things are so subtle and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.820
 at the same time they are so innocent in 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.439
 to judge the other things begins with 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.450
 he realizing that he's going to have to change 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.040
 home from them five floors 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.750
 Wonderful, you'll have to leave the house. 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.250
 from him to another place 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.689
 just like that I'll leave mine 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.689
 Friends, I'm leaving my grandparents. 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.250
 I'm going to leave the house that has 11 stairs 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.350
 Wonderful to get down the banister 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.479
 the one that gave it more importance are 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.579
 Little things they have is important. 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.899
 when he was nine years old in the case he 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.280
 starts thinking that I'm just going to have to go 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.380
 to another place and when it arrives and 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.390
 hates new house deli because it has no 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.520
 No one can play his house. 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.860
 horrible compared to the house he had 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.180
 in berlin he goes to his house and stays 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.070
 super upset 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.079
 living with his father to leave and 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.250
 really demands only for the family. 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.200
 that the family does not explain why 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.000
 really he has to be there I do not know 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.060
 which is a very good thing . 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.940
 his father 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.870
 his father is a soldier a commander and 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.849
 he had to move to a 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.770
 specific place is not interesting I 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.180
 Talk about what this place actually 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.980
 You can not talk too much about what ever 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.230
 The book is already small and if it gets 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.760
 much about the book loses its impact 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.470
 he has, then we will realize that 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.480
 he has a pretty innocent vision 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.540
 about everything that is happening he 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.760
 begins to realize to the soldiers that he 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.200
 came that he entered into his house 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.180
 comments that his mother makes 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.610
 comments khawaldeh makes you on the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.810
 his father's work also do not realize 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.750
 the importance it has 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.970
 or if it's bad to be good so far 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.190
 that he discovers a little friend comes from 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.560
 other side of the fence in this new place 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.900
 he that goes he begins the friendship with 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.700
 this person and everything is going 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.849
 that one day he needs to move again 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.400
 and finally everything you need to know 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.790
 is that this book will happen at the time 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.670
 Hitler's Nazi's gonna see this. 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.450
 and so people are very touching to have this 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:17.590
 innocent view of an event 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:21.850
 so so cruel that it was this time in the 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:25.450
 germany and me, finally, when 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.100
 I bet on the internet ball and avoided talking 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.579
 to prepare us to cry and everything 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.280
 more 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.350
 I did not cry like a book, the end is like this 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.180
 pretty damn or what 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.579
 happening but because it is such a vision 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.500
 innocent and there are no things 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.930
 they happen are not quite detailed 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.700
 does not have many details or does not give 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.840
 understand that you expect things to be 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.760
 slight excerpt slight distrust is not 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.260
 as he does not have this notion of things is 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.209
 see people have no idea what 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.100
 it's really happening he does not leave 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.690
 We 're going to the people who just start 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.700
 have perceptions for everything that we have already 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.280
 know about this time of what was this 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.139
 time we start to realize I have 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.060
 the assumptions of starting to have a 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.639
 realize what is happening what 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.500
 happened in time not to be so detailed 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:11.500
 the impact for me was not so great 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.389
 but when I saw the movie everything goes 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.670
 far beyond Bruno's vision, the 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.859
 people have the details of what happened 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.480
 with his mother what's happening 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.130
 around the place that he is 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.170
 People are thinking of his father. 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.450
 What is the vision that his father has then? 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.360
 It's all much richer in details and gives 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.060
 a cause a much greater anguish causes 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.190
 a very large nonconformity than 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.280
 what happened then was the time 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.590
 one end of this book he does not show with 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.830
 Shocking are the things that happen 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.020
 but they show little details that 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.150
 So people are a little misunderstanding. 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.730
 your heart I cried horrors until you can 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.710
 crying reminds me of the end 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:56.330
 book so shocking that it is a 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:59.210
 situation and how the dog with scopus 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.550
 the ironic is the end of this book because 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.230
 Who was doing things and what? 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.690
 happening then you can not explain the 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.120
 end but just talk about it 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.790
 so I know that many of you who are coming 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.800
 accompanied by reading a book and a movie and 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.690
 I was very advised to study and 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.610
 Thank you very much is happening 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.200
 new but if you did not read 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.580
 If you did not watch the movie I 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.410
 I recommend that you read before 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.150
 watch the movie for sure but today I 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.230
 I think the film will have an impact 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:29.540
 much bigger but the book has its 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.940
 your moment so you know you have to 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.500
 go through the book missing after seen 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.970
 in the movie that what happens to have 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.850
 explanations because if not 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.700
 very subtle and a lot you think it is 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.260
 I do not know and if necessary but it's not much 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.330
 reading this book is necessary. 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.720
 Fine, we are not too thin. 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.270
 and three are very large and it is 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.560
 very fast for this book and has a certain 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.450
 its importance so I highly recommend it 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.240
 you this book and do not like 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.130
 today have prejudice by profession of 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.840
 involving historical facts 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.760
 I do not have to have a prejudice because 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.550
 is a book about the popular and popular 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.990
 a long time ago because I thought the 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.340
 The spirit of this book would be very annoying. 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:13.280
 but is not charged the 9 year old boy is 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.780
 11 years who is very hot on the ball 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.670
 write very very well I already had 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.250
 seen this in my house bought at 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.960
 view now and hope for growth in 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.060
 all the other books I want are 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.820
 him as soon as possible then 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.010
 I highly recommend that I have 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.020
 already shown highly recommend that you 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.840
 watch the movie people have changed my 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.210
 head for everything so involving your 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.460

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.420
 What happened and gave me so much more 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:42.850
 want to research what happened and 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.920
 I hope it does not happen too much. 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.600
 thing that many people say that the past 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.150
 It always repeats I hope this is never here. 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.640

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.900
