00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
sometimes within our heritage we wasn't

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.080 
sometimes within our heritage we wasn't
always<00:05:30.880> taught<00:05:31.210> to<00:05:31.570> have<00:05:32.229> hold<00:05:32.650> value<00:05:33.250> and<00:05:33.550> let

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
always taught to have hold value and let

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.570 
always taught to have hold value and let
those<00:05:34.270> assets<00:05:34.870> grow<00:05:35.169> hair<00:05:36.159> and<00:05:36.490> money<00:05:37.060> so<00:05:37.780> like

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
those assets grow hair and money so like

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.520 
those assets grow hair and money so like
it's<00:05:39.580> just<00:05:39.789> such<00:05:39.940> a<00:05:39.970> weird<00:05:40.270> issue<00:05:40.630> and<00:05:41.110> I<00:05:41.470> know

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
it's just such a weird issue and I know

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.310 
it's just such a weird issue and I know
this<00:05:41.770> has<00:05:42.090> probably<00:05:43.090> taken<00:05:43.330> many<00:05:43.659> left<00:05:43.990> turns

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
this has probably taken many left turns

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.469 
this has probably taken many left turns
but<00:05:44.830> again<00:05:45.280> my<00:05:45.460> final<00:05:45.849> answer<00:05:46.150> is<00:05:46.330> it<00:05:46.449> really

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
but again my final answer is it really

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.750 
but again my final answer is it really
depends<00:05:46.930> on<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.050> person<00:05:47.260> I<00:05:47.650> was<00:05:48.310> just<00:05:48.550> trying

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
depends on the person I was just trying

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.339 
depends on the person I was just trying
to<00:05:48.820> come<00:05:48.970> out<00:05:49.090> and<00:05:49.270> say<00:05:49.419> it<00:05:49.449> fast<00:05:49.780> and<00:05:50.020> quick<00:05:50.229> in

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
to come out and say it fast and quick in

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:52.950 
to come out and say it fast and quick in
the<00:05:50.409> beginning<00:05:50.820> like<00:05:51.820> oh<00:05:52.060> you<00:05:52.449> like<00:05:52.599> it<00:05:52.630> yeah

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
the beginning like oh you like it yeah

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.480 
the beginning like oh you like it yeah
this<00:05:53.110> is<00:05:53.260> not<00:05:53.380> my<00:05:53.470> hair<00:05:53.650> I<00:05:53.680> probably<00:05:53.979> different

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
this is not my hair I probably different

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.800 
this is not my hair I probably different

and don't get all solemn and scared

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.879 
and don't get all solemn and scared
because<00:05:58.630> you<00:05:58.900> know<00:05:59.020> what<00:05:59.199> if<00:05:59.320> you<00:05:59.409> can't<00:05:59.680> deal

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
because you know what if you can't deal

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:01.920

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
wigs or whatever the case may be then

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.190 
wigs or whatever the case may be then
you<00:06:11.020> may<00:06:11.230> be<00:06:11.290> you<00:06:12.160> know<00:06:12.310> better<00:06:13.300> to<00:06:13.660> compromise

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
you may be you know better to compromise

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.290 
you may be you know better to compromise
with<00:06:14.500> him<00:06:14.650> you<00:06:15.550> know<00:06:15.670> maybe<00:06:15.940> isn't<00:06:16.090> like<00:06:16.270> a

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
with him you know maybe isn't like a

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.120 
with him you know maybe isn't like a
full<00:06:16.690> way<00:06:17.050> maybe<00:06:17.470> you<00:06:17.620> could<00:06:17.770> just<00:06:17.950> wear

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
full way maybe you could just wear

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.890 
full way maybe you could just wear
weaves<00:06:18.430> or<00:06:18.790> extensions<00:06:19.330> or<00:06:19.510> whatever<00:06:19.750> the

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
weaves or extensions or whatever the

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.090 
weaves or extensions or whatever the
case<00:06:20.050> may<00:06:20.230> be<00:06:20.260> but<00:06:20.590> I<00:06:20.680> really<00:06:20.890> don't<00:06:21.040> think

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100
