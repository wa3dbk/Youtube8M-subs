match<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.670> full<00:00:45.000> FIS

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600

polypropylene EPP piece that's multi
impact<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> idea<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.979> racers

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
impact and the idea is that if racers

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.300 
impact and the idea is that if racers
hitting<00:01:05.939> gates<00:01:06.210> multiple<00:01:07.200> times<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:08.070> will

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
hitting gates multiple times this will

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.100 
hitting gates multiple times this will
still<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.640> able<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.030> rebound<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.689> at<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> end

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
still be able to rebound and at the end

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.630 
still be able to rebound and at the end
of<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.290> season<00:01:10.619> still<00:01:10.890> be<00:01:11.040> able<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.250> offer<00:01:11.430> all

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
of the season still be able to offer all

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.250 
of the season still be able to offer all
the<00:01:11.820> protection<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.510> fall<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:13.020> neat

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the protection and a fall that's neat

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.170 
the protection and a fall that's neat
which<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.710> huge<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:14.159> racers<00:01:14.760> probably

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
which is huge because racers probably

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.020 
which is huge because racers probably
put<00:01:15.390> their<00:01:15.540> helmets<00:01:15.930> through<00:01:16.439> more<00:01:17.030> garbage

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
put their helmets through more garbage

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
put their helmets through more garbage
all<00:01:18.450> season<00:01:18.900> than<00:01:19.049> any<00:01:19.350> other<00:01:19.710> skier<00:01:20.460> out

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
all season than any other skier out

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
all season than any other skier out
there<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.240> gate<00:01:21.479> fashion<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.110> really<00:01:22.560> tough

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
there the gate fashion is really tough

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.070 
there the gate fashion is really tough
on<00:01:22.979> helmets<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.580> that's<00:01:23.759> what<00:01:24.000> FIS<00:01:24.780> was

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
on helmets and that's what FIS was

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.590 
on helmets and that's what FIS was
trying<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.650> prove<00:01:25.830> hit<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:27.030> add<00:01:27.270> that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
trying to prove hit there to add that

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.530 
trying to prove hit there to add that
security<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.530> they<00:01:29.159> say<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:30.420> like

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
security to it they say that it's like

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.840 
security to it they say that it's like
to<00:01:30.840> football<00:01:31.409> NFL<00:01:31.950> football<00:01:32.340> players<00:01:32.579> hitting

this one comes with one this comes with
one<00:02:13.120> right<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:14.040> comp<00:02:15.040> comes<00:02:15.400> with<00:02:15.610> two<00:02:15.819> right

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239

get<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.599> that<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.900> second<00:02:17.140> but<00:02:17.230> yeah<00:02:17.439> it's

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
get to that in a second but yeah it's

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.319 
get to that in a second but yeah it's
great<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.189> leave<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.640> in<00:02:18.730> your<00:02:18.849> bag<00:02:19.030> for<00:02:19.269> a

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
great you leave it in your bag for a

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.210 
great you leave it in your bag for a
while<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.599> it<00:02:19.720> gets<00:02:19.870> pretty<00:02:20.019> stinky<00:02:20.560> sure<00:02:20.980> so

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
while and it gets pretty stinky sure so

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.740 
while and it gets pretty stinky sure so
you<00:02:21.340> can<00:02:21.430> take<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.760> out<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.000> wash<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:22.480> that

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
you can take it out and wash it that

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.869 
you can take it out and wash it that
makes<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.110> lot<00:02:23.260> nicer<00:02:23.530> as<00:02:23.829> well<00:02:24.040> definitely

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
makes it a lot nicer as well definitely

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.610 
makes it a lot nicer as well definitely
so<00:02:25.090> then<00:02:25.269> I<00:02:25.540> guess<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.049> natural<00:02:26.409> transition

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
so then I guess the natural transition

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.309 
so then I guess the natural transition
they're<00:02:27.040> moving<00:02:27.430> up<00:02:27.579> from<00:02:27.760> there<00:02:28.000> into<00:02:28.319> the

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
they're moving up from there into the

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.280 
they're moving up from there into the
orbit<00:02:29.920> cop<00:02:30.269> you're<00:02:31.269> getting<00:02:31.659> some<00:02:32.019> extra

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
orbit cop you're getting some extra

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.720 
orbit cop you're getting some extra
features<00:02:32.440> though<00:02:32.860> well<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.370> big<00:02:33.549> difference

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
features though well the big difference

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.210 
features though well the big difference
is<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.390> comp<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.170> just<00:02:35.530> what<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.769> sounds<00:02:35.799> like

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
is the comp is just what it sounds like

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.940 
is the comp is just what it sounds like
it's<00:02:36.430> it's<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:37.120> helmet<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.319> saw<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.829> the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
it's it's the helmet that you saw in the
