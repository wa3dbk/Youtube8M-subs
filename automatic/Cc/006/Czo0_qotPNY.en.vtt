00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.780 

looks<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.899> everything<00:01:01.379> else<00:01:01.620> may<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.890> losing

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:17.039 

and<00:01:05.790> some<00:01:06.030> fiercest<00:01:06.659> interactions

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.580 

I<00:01:17.729> rock<00:01:18.729> Leone's<00:01:19.090> rotation<00:01:19.750> isn't<00:01:19.929> that<00:01:20.259> good

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
I rock Leone's rotation isn't that good

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:34.350

so<00:01:21.460> probably<00:01:21.939> evil<00:01:22.390> gemios<00:01:22.600> Wilson<00:01:32.189> mmm<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
so probably evil gemios Wilson mmm I

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.569 
so probably evil gemios Wilson mmm I
think<00:01:35.289> maybe<00:01:35.439> with<00:01:35.799> jameos<00:01:36.130> we'll<00:01:36.340> probably

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
think maybe with jameos we'll probably

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:50.300 
think maybe with jameos we'll probably
mos<00:01:37.360> def<00:01:37.390> you<00:01:37.780> can<00:01:37.959> look<00:01:38.170> at<00:01:38.289> it<00:01:38.439> very<00:01:38.590> closely

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.780
