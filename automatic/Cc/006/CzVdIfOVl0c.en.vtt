all<00:00:00.870> right<00:00:01.079> we<00:00:01.319> can<00:00:01.469> see<00:00:01.709> in<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:03.859> tender<00:00:04.859> state

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
all right we can see in a tender state

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.700 
all right we can see in a tender state
of<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.520> engine<00:00:05.879> at<00:00:06.029> idle<00:00:06.740> 31<00:00:07.740> some<00:00:09.410> math<00:00:10.410> nap

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
of the engine at idle 31 some math nap

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.379 
of the engine at idle 31 some math nap
is<00:00:11.010> running<00:00:11.849> an<00:00:11.969> 18<00:00:12.480> load<00:00:13.429> method<00:00:14.429> mass<00:00:15.179> air

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
is running an 18 load method mass air

is running an 18 load method mass air
flows<00:00:15.630> between<00:00:15.839> 2<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.500> 3<00:00:16.920> for<00:00:17.670> like<00:00:17.850> three

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
flows between 2 and 3 for like three

flows between 2 and 3 for like three
grams<00:00:18.949> higher<00:00:19.949> altitudes<00:00:21.500> got<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.740> long<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
grams higher altitudes got so long the

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.050 
grams higher altitudes got so long the
that's<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.720> DC<00:00:25.080> 7<00:00:25.289> which<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.650> not<00:00:26.250> servo<00:00:26.670> sensor

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
that's a DC 7 which is not servo sensor

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.710 
that's a DC 7 which is not servo sensor
throttle<00:00:28.019> falls<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:29.010> an<00:00:29.490> engine<00:00:30.029> speed<00:00:30.150> you

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
throttle falls with an engine speed you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.490 
throttle falls with an engine speed you
can<00:00:30.840> see<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.289> between<00:00:31.439> 8<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.070> about<00:00:32.820> 900<00:00:33.180> M

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
can see it's between 8 to about 900 M

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.990 
can see it's between 8 to about 900 M
now<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.460> we're<00:00:35.580> going<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.730> do<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.980> disconnect

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
now what we're going to do is disconnect

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.630 
now what we're going to do is disconnect
the<00:00:39.000> map<00:00:39.210> quick<00:00:41.690> disconnect<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:43.040> go<00:00:44.040> back<00:00:44.220> over

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the map quick disconnect it go back over

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.700 
the map quick disconnect it go back over
here<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.120> look<00:00:45.510> at<00:00:45.630> the<00:00:45.720> map

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
here and look at the map

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.680 
here and look at the map
see<00:00:48.430> oh<00:00:48.760> yeah<00:00:49.270> like<00:00:49.600> that<00:00:50.370> 100<00:00:51.370> kpa<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.210> still

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
see oh yeah like that 100 kpa and still

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.510 
see oh yeah like that 100 kpa and still
running<00:00:52.960> smooth

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.910 

so<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.840> then<00:00:57.990> we<00:00:58.110> can<00:00:58.260> go<00:00:58.410> over<00:00:58.440> here<00:00:58.740> if

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
so and then we can go over here if

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.440 
so and then we can go over here if
you're<00:00:59.070> not<00:00:59.100> successful<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> still

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.779 

I'm<00:01:08.020> going<00:01:08.259> to<00:01:08.320> do<00:01:08.409> it<00:01:08.500> like<00:01:08.619> that<00:01:09.070> but<00:01:09.280> as<00:01:09.579> you

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
I'm going to do it like that but as you

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.639 
I'm going to do it like that but as you
can<00:01:09.939> see<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:11.100> hideous<00:01:12.100> contraption<00:01:13.090> that<00:01:13.659> it

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
can see the hideous contraption that it

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.770 
can see the hideous contraption that it
is<00:01:14.799> you<00:01:15.670> see<00:01:15.850> the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
is you see the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.620 
is you see the
go<00:01:17.200> down<00:01:17.380> here<00:01:17.710> go<00:01:18.610> fruit<00:01:18.820> here<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.420> map

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
go down here go fruit here the map

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.410 
go down here go fruit here the map
sensors<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.500> there

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.880 

then<00:01:23.780> there's<00:01:23.990> air<00:01:24.229> filter<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.400> from<00:01:25.700> my

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
then there's air filter so from my

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.370 
then there's air filter so from my
dr.<00:01:28.610> that

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
dr. that

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.710 
dr. that
but<00:01:29.799> that's<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.640> whole<00:01:30.790> net<00:01:31.030> is<00:01:31.150> controlling

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
but that's the whole net is controlling

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.420 
but that's the whole net is controlling
and<00:01:32.439> if<00:01:32.770> I<00:01:32.890> plug

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
and if I plug

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.760 
and if I plug
you'll<00:01:34.030> hear<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.390> engine<00:01:34.659> go<00:01:35.259> down<00:01:35.500> because

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
you'll hear the engine go down because

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.620 
you'll hear the engine go down because
of<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:36.070> air<00:01:36.220> leak<00:01:36.369> when<00:01:36.820> I<00:01:36.880> plug<00:01:37.090> this<00:01:37.210> back<00:01:37.450> in

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
of the air leak when I plug this back in

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.109 
of the air leak when I plug this back in
click<00:01:37.840> oh<00:01:38.430> they're<00:01:39.430> not<00:01:39.610> married

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
click oh they're not married

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.670 
click oh they're not married
but<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:40.600> can<00:01:40.720> hear<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.930> air<00:01:41.020> leak<00:01:41.290> out<00:01:41.470> it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
but you can hear the air leak out it

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.649 
but you can hear the air leak out it
when<00:01:41.830> I<00:01:41.860> plugged<00:01:42.399> it<00:01:42.520> in<00:01:42.670> if<00:01:42.909> you<00:01:42.940> have<00:01:43.420> an<00:01:43.540> air

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
when I plugged it in if you have an air

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.010 
when I plugged it in if you have an air
leak<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:44.020> will<00:01:44.049> affected<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:45.640> map<00:01:46.570> fueling<00:01:46.930> a

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
leak it will affected the map fueling a

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.170 
leak it will affected the map fueling a
lot<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:48.250> that's<00:01:48.399> why<00:01:48.610> you<00:01:48.700> don't<00:01:48.880> want<00:01:48.970> air

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
lot so that's why you don't want air

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.249 
lot so that's why you don't want air
leaks<00:01:49.450> but<00:01:49.869> anyways<00:01:50.799> it<00:01:50.979> runs<00:01:51.190> runs<00:01:51.640> well

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
leaks but anyways it runs runs well

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.889 
leaks but anyways it runs runs well
still<00:01:53.259> needs<00:01:53.530> some<00:01:53.710> tuning<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:55.720> looks

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
still needs some tuning and it looks

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.359 
still needs some tuning and it looks
hideous<00:01:56.110> but<00:01:56.729> right<00:01:57.729> now<00:01:57.880> I<00:01:57.909> don't<00:01:58.180> care

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
hideous but right now I don't care

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.029 
hideous but right now I don't care
from<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> next<00:02:00.119> vehicle<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.570> work<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.039> mal

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
from the next vehicle I work on a mal

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.520 
from the next vehicle I work on a mal
look<00:02:02.280> better
