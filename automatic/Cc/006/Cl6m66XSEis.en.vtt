00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.820 
two spoons and a fork hi guys I'm gonna
get<00:00:26.039> sciency<00:00:26.490> okay<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:26.970> first<00:00:27.240> things<00:00:27.480> first

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
get sciency okay so first things first

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.099 
get sciency okay so first things first
I'm<00:00:28.830> going<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.699> touch<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.269> avocado<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:31.080> half

I'm going to touch the avocado in half

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.650 
I'm going to touch the avocado in half
then<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.070> next<00:00:32.340> step<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.820> skip<00:00:33.059> all<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
then the next step is to skip all of the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.100 
then the next step is to skip all of the
avocado<00:00:33.840> out<00:00:34.320> into<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> bowl<00:00:35.570> so<00:00:36.570> I'm<00:00:36.960> just

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
avocado out into the bowl so I'm just

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.380

gonna use it with your spoon and I think
I'll<00:00:39.540> just<00:00:39.660> use<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:39.870> half<00:00:40.320> today<00:00:40.620> that's

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
I'll just use one half today that's

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.389 
I'll just use one half today that's
probably<00:00:41.610> enough<00:00:42.030> my<00:00:42.180> pile<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.629> half<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.399> we'll

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
probably enough my pile of half so we'll

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.740 
probably enough my pile of half so we'll
see<00:00:44.579> if<00:00:44.640> that's<00:00:44.820> enough<00:00:44.910> first

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
see if that's enough first

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.869 
see if that's enough first
once<00:00:46.440> that's<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:47.820> start<00:00:48.239> smashing

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
once that's in and then start smashing

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.369 
once that's in and then start smashing
smashing<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:54.300> really<00:00:54.629> want<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> smash<00:00:55.170> this

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.660 

it's<00:01:03.920> really<00:01:04.160> good<00:01:06.130> if<00:01:07.130> you<00:01:07.250> like<00:01:07.370> apple

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.250 

okay<00:01:20.140> once<00:01:21.140> it's<00:01:21.260> nice<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:21.530> washed<00:01:21.920> up<00:01:23.140> if<00:01:24.140> you

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
okay once it's nice and washed up if you

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.590 
okay once it's nice and washed up if you
go<00:01:24.380> ahead<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:24.590> start<00:01:24.890> at<00:01:24.980> the<00:01:25.010> bottom<00:01:25.190> I<00:01:25.600> can

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
go ahead and start at the bottom I can

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.090 
go ahead and start at the bottom I can
say<00:01:26.960> I'm<00:01:27.140> going<00:01:27.260> to<00:01:27.320> use<00:01:27.380> olive<00:01:27.680> oil<00:01:27.890> and

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
say I'm going to use olive oil and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.690 
say I'm going to use olive oil and
almond<00:01:28.310> oil<00:01:28.640> only<00:01:29.240> because<00:01:30.400> almond<00:01:31.400> oil<00:01:31.580> is

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
almond oil only because almond oil is

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.880 
almond oil only because almond oil is
going<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.150> restore<00:01:32.750> shine<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.530> olive<00:01:33.800> oil

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
going to restore shine and the olive oil

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.590 
going to restore shine and the olive oil
will<00:01:34.100> give<00:01:34.250> it<00:01:34.340> some<00:01:34.460> strength<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.420> it's<00:01:35.510> just

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
will give it some strength so it's just

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.050 
will give it some strength so it's just
kind<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:35.900> like<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:36.050> repairing<00:01:36.560> mask<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:38.000> I'm
