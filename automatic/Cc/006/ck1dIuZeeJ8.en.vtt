00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.080
 I was watching a video of the kernel yesterday

 I'm going to upload that script there 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.760

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.590
 kernel that is remembering the games 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.450
 old people and most people 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.000
 are the chose the graphics look at the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.980
 game in graphics and not in quality in the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.480
 quality of story game and many 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.579
 things is also mentioned out there 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.260
 also music and it's true then 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.170
 I recommend the kernel game there 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.610
 there is the description of the video sorry 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.059
 to check them is worth it 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.100
 know 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.620
 jornet there will be many videos of the kernel 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.780
 even for not the way we talk 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.579
 and we expressed ourselves it's pretty seemed like that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.930
 that if you like my videos 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.840
 obviously you are going to like hers 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.090
 There is also fucking bastard turtle 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.460
 shit 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.950
 but see what agility at least I did not achieve 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.740
 I mean, I was not with my tail but I 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.350
 I will always get my tail off 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.350
 and but well there I lost no matter 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.000
 matter then I was counting from 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.800
 the kernel series there will be in the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.619
 description to be checked there 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.540
 go and leave like and your planet is a 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.520
 I recommend you subscribe channel the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.670
 of the kernel 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.549
 but good friends, let's continue this 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.740
 this video is not going to be a web series or 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.140
 well because the truth is not that I do not 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.299
 like the super nintendo games but 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.369
 that there was already a time in 15 many in 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.780
 I live dreams of super nintendo and then 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.119
 now that we have the opportunity to 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.799
 bring new games because you have to do it 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.689
 just that today I was very 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.899
 easy to record mario the truth is deaf me 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.619
 pretty easy since I even thought 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.000
 do not upload anything today because then 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.229
 I had scheduled live with bridge and 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.470
 marmot but at the time of the hour no 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.530
 could then then my way then let's 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.810
 upload this this piece of video to see 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.690
 what took about ten minutes I'm going to play 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.220
 to see if they like it then it's good that 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.260
 other things that we talk about we are going to 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.360
 talk about things that have happened to 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.069
 throughout the good week then in the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.900
 long throughout the week then we have 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.239
 had that 20,000 subscribers what 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.950
 we managed to achieve 20,000 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.920
 subscribers and something comes from there 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.599
 operation 7 to celebrate it are the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.299
 20,000 subscribers well let's do 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.760
 a little something different in operation 7 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:36.030
 to celebrate it like a bastard day 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.370
 jump and now it turns out that if I jump and 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.349
 nothing else but I take off the fucking 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.700
 tail well here equal I think there is a 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.120
 tail 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.090
 ok here is one there is the bastard no no 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.550
 no no no no no no I did not score 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.550
 it was the bitch no mames 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.670
 but neither but there they are and I think so let's go 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.930
 to do it as you can that makes you 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.930
 they remove the tail for you 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.060
 here we go up and then they 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.990
 I recommend that you grab in this shortcut go 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.260
 to find enough coins around here 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.240
 So then, that's why I'm the truth 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.010
 this game was not the first one I played 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.470
 the first game I played I think that 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.180
 it was the strikeouts with kids I do not know how 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.730
 it's called boxing I think that was the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.830
 first game that I played there the mario the 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.110
 mario 1 and so I was knowing games 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.420
 new memories that at that time I 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:36.150
 I did not play it in my house I did not have it 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:39.360
 I was going with a guy with an uncle and he had 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.540
 the game then well that's how I was 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.760
 I could play those games 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.650
 in which a while ago I remember that 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.180
 it seems then games already existed 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.400
 of neo geo because on the computer 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.109
 was in line ojeo games but it already 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.000
 they were excited about the games 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:58.739
 of nes, well, no, I did not know much about 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.019
 games I was a kid was very 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.760
 boy then there were already the call of 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.939
 neo geo because I 'm not so big either 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.690
 and I remember that I was very excited about 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.060
 time to play 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.680
 this game the first time that what 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.780
 I played it I remember it very well I did not have a 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.090
 cousin this game is not not the same 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.920
 because the other cousin all in my family 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.720
 they had interns nothing else I did not already 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.540
 then we bought one that is what 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:27.540
 I bought my uncle precisely that then 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.540
 because it was very difficult for me to play 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.260
 good and good people will continue them 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.480
 I was saying that this time 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.280
 I bought it we bought it obviously a guy 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.410
 I think it left us much cheaper to 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.880
 what was worth because I've never been a 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.310
 person who has money or something like that 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.410
 always because I always battled him like 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.420
 who says then when my mom 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.280
 He bought the gluten or it did not cost him 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.940
 so much because I buy it used but then 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.070
 it would be the best or enough time there 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.420
 I played he strikeouts that was part of 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.800
 the games I had bought I think 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.530
 that they had bought super nintendo 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.630
 I do not remember what it was that they had 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.530
 bought them they sold us that neither 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.570
 I have and then I could play and it was a 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.390
 vice because I remember that if you moved 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.070
 little bit I have it act and you lost everything 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.570
 what you had done you lost everything and 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.130
 you had to start over because in 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.020
 then there was no saving the 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.390
 departure or anything you did not have to force 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.130
 back starting from the beginning the 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.690
 difference is already super nintendo I think 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.940
 that is already super getting you could already 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.820
 save but in the attempt nes you could not 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.730
 you had to pass everything of milestone had 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.680
 little keys that left you like that with 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.820
 numbers to remember in the part where 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.920
 you had stayed 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.310
 will be the starting mode your placed 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.050
 there for example in the one of bots it left you 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.660
 a code when you beat a certain boxer 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.490
 a code came out and you could play against 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.820
 he already after explaining those 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.820
 numbers 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:55.550
 no shit do not fail 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.860
 well let's skip this mission and 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.810
 here they are already quite apart and she is 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.640
 who like I'm getting bored people 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.130
 let's see, let's go forward 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.930
 the castle I remember many times that I 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.610
 in this castle and could not pass it to 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.290
 monster because I did not know I had it 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.290
 to crush like in mario 1 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.080
 because you had to pass it by 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.790
 I remember going on and crush the 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.460
 first time to get to the castle this 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.170
 I did not find how to kill him anymore 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.800
 after brink over and well it's not what 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.800
 more obvious no 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.380
 but good airline remember but 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:34.150
 any child could decipher that 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:36.130
 simple problem was a very remember 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.530
 I do not remember how the flute is caught 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.750
 the truth and I do not intend to take the shit 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.210
 what's up with me right now I'm 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.120
 playing very badly 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.860
 to see good people I recommend them 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.810
 subscribe to my channel the truth right now 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.430
 I 'm not uploading a game well I'm 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.139
 climbing practically the first thing that 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.020
 it happened to me and it's not because there's 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:57.550
 wanted to organize something well but because 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.860
 Well, I really did not have time, I did not have 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.270
 time to do something right because I had 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.650
 planned to do a live with bridge 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.720
 and marmot but at the time of the hour and not 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.490
 peppers after that was spoiled 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.289
 I think that around here they grab the 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.220
 flute no but let's try here 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:14.490
 Let's see 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:17.070
 I think if it's around here, it's not like that if it looks like 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.650
 what if it's over here 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.780
 it is not not there or if to see what I 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.390
 I see if there is not a door here or if 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.520
 there is a door when sergio that magic 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.430
 you are wey see so i remember so that 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.180
 see that I do remember that but then 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.910
 I went back in girls 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.320
 to see then the last last mission that 

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.669
 I'm going to do now to finish with the 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.639
 video and I hope you liked the 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:41.979
 I really was not going to upload anything and this 

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:43.870
 only one who arrived you want to subscribe 

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:45.520
