00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
SATA adapters IDE cable and then we've

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.550 
SATA adapters IDE cable and then we've
got<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.200> USB<00:01:57.560> IO<00:01:58.370> panel<00:01:59.090> it's<00:01:59.510> a<00:01:59.570> huge<00:01:59.960> accessory

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
got a USB IO panel it's a huge accessory

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.320 
got a USB IO panel it's a huge accessory
package<00:02:00.800> that<00:02:01.160> comes<00:02:01.310> with<00:02:01.520> this<00:02:01.610> board<00:02:01.910> very

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
package that comes with this board very

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.350 
package that comes with this board very
impressive<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.560> here<00:02:03.950> we<00:02:04.160> have<00:02:04.430> it<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.640> GD<00:02:05.150> 80

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
impressive so here we have it the GD 80

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.320 
impressive so here we have it the GD 80
this<00:02:05.930> is<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.380> cream<00:02:06.680> of<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.920> cream<00:02:07.250> for<00:02:07.910> MSI's

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
this is the cream of the cream for MSI's

this is the cream of the cream for MSI's
p55<00:02:08.990> motherboards<00:02:09.740> let's<00:02:09.890> get<00:02:10.039> it<00:02:10.160> out<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.340> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
p55 motherboards let's get it out of the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.960 
p55 motherboards let's get it out of the
box<00:02:10.610> here<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.980> if<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.130> could<00:02:13.310> just<00:02:13.340> figure<00:02:13.730> out

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
box here and if I could just figure out

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.790 
box here and if I could just figure out
how<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.240> do<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:14.930> we'd<00:02:15.110> be<00:02:15.260> moving<00:02:15.620> right

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
how to do that and we'd be moving right

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.360 
how to do that and we'd be moving right
along

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.280 

more<00:02:19.030> trucks<00:02:19.330> going<00:02:19.510> by<00:02:19.690> we<00:02:19.840> really<00:02:20.080> didn't

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
more trucks going by we really didn't

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.900 
more trucks going by we really didn't
choose<00:02:20.440> this<00:02:20.590> location<00:02:20.950> very<00:02:21.340> well<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.730> was

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
choose this location very well that was

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.630 
choose this location very well that was
bad<00:02:22.810> planning<00:02:23.140> but<00:02:23.530> there<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.129> go<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.489> we've

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
bad planning but there you go so we've

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.940 
bad planning but there you go so we've
got<00:02:24.819> OC<00:02:25.269> Genie<00:02:25.510> sticker<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.560> extreme

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
got OC Genie sticker and the extreme

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.770 
got OC Genie sticker and the extreme

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
speed which includes dr. moss and the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.229 
speed which includes dr. moss and the
super<00:02:29.080> pipe<00:02:29.290> super<00:02:30.250> pipe<00:02:30.459> basically<00:02:31.000> means

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
super pipe super pipe basically means

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.839 
super pipe super pipe basically means
that<00:02:31.360> it's<00:02:31.599> got<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:32.099> ridiculously<00:02:33.099> thick<00:02:33.459> heat

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
that it's got a ridiculously thick heat

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.449 
that it's got a ridiculously thick heat
pipe<00:02:34.090> running<00:02:34.540> from<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.019> chipset<00:02:35.440> up<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:36.190> the

pipe running from the chipset up to the
dr.<00:02:36.940> Moss<00:02:37.120> MOSFETs<00:02:37.810> if<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.470> actually<00:02:38.650> look

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
dr. Moss MOSFETs if you actually look

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.009 
dr. Moss MOSFETs if you actually look
from<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.430> angle<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:40.030> can<00:02:40.390> see<00:02:40.420> just<00:02:40.810> how

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
from this angle you can see just how

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.479 
from this angle you can see just how
huge<00:02:41.379> this<00:02:41.650> thing<00:02:41.709> is<00:02:42.040> it's<00:02:42.220> kind<00:02:42.459> of

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
huge this thing is it's kind of

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.520 
huge this thing is it's kind of
ridiculous<00:02:42.879> so<00:02:43.269> then<00:02:43.810> other<00:02:44.049> than<00:02:44.200> that

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
ridiculous so then other than that

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.800 
ridiculous so then other than that
you've<00:02:44.769> got<00:02:44.799> your<00:02:45.250> usual<00:02:45.459> stuff<00:02:45.910> for<00:02:46.239> a<00:02:46.269> p55

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
you've got your usual stuff for a p55

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.990 
you've got your usual stuff for a p55
motherboard<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:48.010> you've<00:02:48.160> got<00:02:48.340> your<00:02:48.459> four<00:02:48.730> dims

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
motherboard so you've got your four dims

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.960 
motherboard so you've got your four dims
your<00:02:49.569> LGA<00:02:49.930> 1156<00:02:50.709> socket<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.400> shouldn't<00:02:51.640> say<00:02:51.730> oh

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
your LGA 1156 socket I shouldn't say oh

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.449 
your LGA 1156 socket I shouldn't say oh
yeah<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.569> should<00:02:52.599> say<00:02:52.930> p55<00:02:53.410> but<00:02:53.799> you<00:02:54.010> can't<00:02:54.250> just

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
yeah I should say p55 but you can't just

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.610 
yeah I should say p55 but you can't just
say<00:02:54.549> Core<00:02:54.760> i5<00:02:54.880> because<00:02:55.420> there<00:02:55.599> is<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:56.049> core<00:02:56.470> i7

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
say Core i5 because there is a core i7

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.100 
say Core i5 because there is a core i7
or<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.400> couple<00:02:57.730> models<00:02:58.000> of<00:02:58.150> core<00:02:58.329> i7s<00:02:58.750> for<00:02:58.989> the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
or a couple models of core i7s for the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.660 
or a couple models of core i7s for the
socket<00:02:59.500> so<00:02:59.650> then<00:03:00.099> we've<00:03:00.220> got<00:03:00.370> our<00:03:00.400> power

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
socket so then we've got our power

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.370 
socket so then we've got our power
connector<00:03:01.209> up<00:03:01.299> here<00:03:01.540> for<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.780> eight<00:03:01.900> pin<00:03:02.170> and

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
connector up here for the eight pin and

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.680 
connector up here for the eight pin and
then<00:03:02.799> way<00:03:03.040> over<00:03:03.069> here<00:03:03.370> for<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.879> 24<00:03:04.360> pin<00:03:04.569> in

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
then way over here for the 24 pin in

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.839 
then way over here for the 24 pin in
their<00:03:04.840> usual<00:03:05.079> locations<00:03:05.890> we've<00:03:06.340> got<00:03:06.579> eight

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
their usual locations we've got eight

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.240 
their usual locations we've got eight
SATA<00:03:07.180> ports<00:03:07.599> we've<00:03:08.110> got<00:03:08.410> our<00:03:08.680> base<00:03:08.950> clock

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
SATA ports we've got our base clock

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.220 
SATA ports we've got our base clock
adjustment<00:03:09.940> buttons<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.450> then<00:03:10.629> a<00:03:10.840> couple

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
adjustment buttons and then a couple

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.170 
adjustment buttons and then a couple
features<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.709> this<00:03:12.010> has<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.280> are<00:03:12.670> unique

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
features that this has that are unique

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.660 
features that this has that are unique
are<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:14.049> the<00:03:14.410> LCD<00:03:14.860> readout<00:03:15.040> here

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
are a the LCD readout here

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.640 
are a the LCD readout here
so<00:03:15.849> that's<00:03:16.030> your<00:03:16.120> postcode<00:03:16.599> and<00:03:16.810> then<00:03:17.349> these

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
so that's your postcode and then these

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.640 
so that's your postcode and then these
are<00:03:17.709> actually<00:03:18.549> touch<00:03:18.849> sensitive<00:03:19.720> power<00:03:20.019> reset

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
are actually touch sensitive power reset

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.990 
are actually touch sensitive power reset
and<00:03:20.920> green<00:03:21.160> power<00:03:21.370> buttons<00:03:21.670> I'm<00:03:21.760> not<00:03:21.879> sure

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
and green power buttons I'm not sure

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.759 
and green power buttons I'm not sure
what<00:03:22.150> green<00:03:22.299> power<00:03:22.510> does<00:03:22.720> yet<00:03:22.930> but<00:03:23.139> we'll<00:03:23.290> get

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
what green power does yet but we'll get

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.559 
what green power does yet but we'll get
into<00:03:23.920> that<00:03:24.040> more<00:03:24.190> later<00:03:24.549> in<00:03:24.790> our<00:03:24.880> overclocking

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
into that more later in our overclocking

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.879 
into that more later in our overclocking
guide<00:03:25.750> actually<00:03:25.989> is<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.530> first<00:03:26.769> time

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889

thing<00:03:36.940> about<00:03:37.120> this<00:03:37.540> board<00:03:37.840> let's<00:03:38.109> talk<00:03:38.319> about

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
thing about this board let's talk about

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.110 
thing about this board let's talk about
the<00:03:38.680> expansion<00:03:39.190> ports<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.579> little<00:03:39.790> bit<00:03:39.940> so

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
the expansion ports a little bit so

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.319 
the expansion ports a little bit so
we've<00:03:40.269> got<00:03:40.450> three<00:03:40.780> PCIe<00:03:41.290> 16x<00:03:41.650> slots<00:03:42.430> but<00:03:43.090> only

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
we've got three PCIe 16x slots but only

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.640 
we've got three PCIe 16x slots but only
two<00:03:43.630> of<00:03:43.660> them<00:03:43.870> are<00:03:43.989> gonna<00:03:44.049> be<00:03:44.170> actually

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
two of them are gonna be actually

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.710 
two of them are gonna be actually
running<00:03:44.859> at<00:03:45.220> 16x<00:03:45.819> one<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.150> them<00:03:46.239> should<00:03:46.540> be<00:03:46.569> a

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
running at 16x one of them should be a

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.289 
running at 16x one of them should be a
4x<00:03:47.169> slot<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.769> then<00:03:48.280> on<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.790> back<00:03:49.000> we've<00:03:49.269> got
