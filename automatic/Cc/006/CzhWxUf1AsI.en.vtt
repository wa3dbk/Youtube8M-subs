00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.210
 a new at the boxi video of felt 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.580
 iphone blog a few hours ago 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.099
 I received a package from cyberport 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.620
 finally it is there on the third of november 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.830
 I have the smart case for the new one 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.840
 ipad ordered in the room and now in short supply 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.010
 a good two weeks it is finally with me 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.740
 Arrived home 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.900
 that's a pretty big carton though 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.670
 I do not think that more than that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.400
 age of the smartcast in it 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.529
 maybe who knows I will now 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.540
 just play something with it 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.550
 equal to the contents of the package come there 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.340
 the packaging is not that spectacular 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.800
 when we finally arrived at the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.649
 inside the box hides under the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.200
 the whole air cushion finally the market 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.660
 case for the new ipad he in the color 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.539
 brown and it was actually nothing 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.949
 further in the big box packaging 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.629
 Technically, this can certainly be done here 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.940
 to optimize a few things 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.800
 but that should not be our problem- 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.230
 and that's why we take care of it now 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.460
 just around there now that videos 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.130
 ipad for the first time away with the box and go 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.020
 let 's go see it 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.820
 himself on the front of the alb with him 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.710
 smart cache lettering and that 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.140
 apple logo under the transparent 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.810
 layer is then already 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.180
 the ipad he is now to the other 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.490
 pages on the back are located 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.890
 still some information to the case has 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.990
 yourself how to put it on what 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.270
 it has cut-outs and also 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.000
 Information about the material 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.579
 Here is the case from a man like 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.979
 made of leather and then natural 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.470
 also pointed out that it is the sleep 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.659
 backup function has me already from 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.270
 know earlier smart case versions 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.729
 next to the model number and the other 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.860
 Small items are available to pack yourself 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.329
 nothing more to say and therefore have 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.880
 we do it fast now 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.100
 I have it all back now 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.619
 something played so that the video is not 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.600
 takes too long if we do the whole thing 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.729
 we have unpacked it again 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.110
 shortly to the side you will again the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.910
 packaging for and 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.039
 there is still one in the smart case 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.990
 small picture on which is presented 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.420
 like the ipad hands smart circle 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.000
 heard and now we all have 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.190
 Packings just put away and 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.130
 We can rely 100% on that 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.320
 new ipad smart circle focused 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.350
 The first impression is very much 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.020
 Being positive feels good and if 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.980
 you look at it all fits it 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.110
 simply it's just all the recesses 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.320
 are where they should be below 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.510
 of course, for the stereo speakers to 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.230
 lightning connection and on the left 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.780
 page of the newsweek and on the back 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.959
 of course the camera voltage and the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.560
 two jumps for the microphones 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.630
 which twice the amount the ipad 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.730
 are more likely to exist and if we look at that 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.120
 we see it all inside 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.060
 flying inside life and of course, too 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.430
 again the lettering ipad smart case 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.930
 something in the inner life too 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.239
 it is noticeable above 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.910
 the invitation to the lte module 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.930
 which in previous versions still 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.330
 not the case 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.330
 we'll just take the ipad now 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.739
 click eat the new case be like 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.660
 you can already see this is one 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.600
 kids game you just lay the ipad 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.440
 over it and click it on all four 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.959
 Just finish a lid over it 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.570
 we can do the sleep function 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.350
 test these flaps again 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.790
 wonderful and yes more you have to, I think 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.160
 not to say that 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.170
 we look at the case now 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.790
 once from all sides and it too 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.519
 the cutouts to the right one 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.620
 put the newsweek is already times 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.070
 the case 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.350
 the jack plug, of course, the 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.410
 Microphones also fit the power button 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.540
 is where it should be the camera looks 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.049
 good by and center in the center 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.410
 broadcast the volume rocker 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.600
 also her fixed position and below the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.720
 Of course, lightning connection also fits 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.489
 as well as the stereo speakers that 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.540
 only negative what me until now 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.170
 is noticed on the 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:23.740
 side these weird hills are themselves 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.170
 It does not have to be better 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.570
 But think what's the point ? 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.760
 we do not hear anything now we are doing now 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.580
 just continue and I will try 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.170
 yes, yes, the power button luckey 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.230
 it's much easier 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.880
 push than with the iphone cases that has 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.330
 I am always very disturbed that is here for 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.130
 Good luck not the volume rocker 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.990
 a bit harder now but me 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.180
 think that's just because that's it 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.310
 alps not right in hand hold yes 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.310
 okay , that's a lot easier now 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.970
 So that fits all now come 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:02.590
 We also still the same for 2.9 million of 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:05.230
 ok so you come then it's a bit 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.340
 Deep inside but that should not be that 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.710
 be big problem 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.350
 and now we come one at first 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.940
 already to the last feature of this circle 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.810
 and that is that set up 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.820
 function 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.860
 here a lot has changed since the 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.010
 first generation apple against yes of 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.080
 Thank God for this square design 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.940
 I would say the square with the four 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.250
 his stand was not really good 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.220
 there and with the new 3 edge design 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.570
 the ipad is just a lot better there 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.610
 and it just gets better 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.260
 use 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.840
 and yes that was it again 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:41.560
 the unboxing and first hands on video 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.540
 from the new ipad case in the color brown 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.370
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.530
