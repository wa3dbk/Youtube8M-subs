00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.830
 well square boys taraf hd and welcome 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.809
 to this less video nothing said this 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.610
 I bring you immediately to the juice of this game 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.889
 play that is nothing but a nucleus has 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.840
 played with an assault rifle 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.800
 really highly recommended to all 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.110
 effects 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.060
 because thanks to its precision it is the 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.550
 ability to be able to take the winnings 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.470
 long distance really reach 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.390
 the goal of the thirty killings without 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.550
 a death becomes very easy 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.349
 so guys I want to know maybe 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.239
 yours also below among the comments if 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.940
 maybe you too have succeeded with 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.010
 this weapon said this list guys 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.620
 immediately that the bonuses if you want 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.809
 try that is a greeting n with 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.699
 silencer the fast charger while 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.499
 the class bonus is i 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.499
 usual that I use almost for all mine 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.179
 classes or jackal ghost and 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:55.659
 kind this time we say that not 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.760
 I used inflexible and precisely because if 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.039
 still maybe someone didn't know the 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.309
 function of this bonus with the 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.050
 rewards of the web type of holy system 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.670
 and it will not be activated precisely because 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.649
 let's say they are a kind of rewards 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.390
 support therefore its function 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.610
 let's say a true activated 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.710
 said this guys is played on 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.390
 location but location has 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.490
 multiple for those unfamiliar with it 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.380
 I immediately explain nor anything other than that kind of 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.390
 mode that is played only at risk yes 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.310
 complains with a group of three so if 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.960
 maybe he managed to organize you with one 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.210
 good team meets two good 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.890
 players who know how to support you 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.109
 it really becomes a very thing 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.420
 facilitating this alone here either 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.009
 we say to give you some considerations 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.899
 regarding this objective or the 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.509
 nuclear in my opinion we say 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.729
 achieve that reward or 30 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.369
 killings without a death is really one 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.990
 stupid thing to reach a fool 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.790
 medal 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.189
 as I define it surely 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.850
 some old fashioned gamer 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.340
 of the type of mv 2 mv 3 certainly though 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.530
 approved the feeling of the past 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.659
 reached 20 25 30 killings to succeed 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.549
 to take a reward that he knows 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.160
 give that we use that stimulus that 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.050
 satisfaction or misunderstand you have 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.800
 reached these many killings almost 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:19.239
 Sweat then reach a reward 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.940
 then we don't say any sense that is 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.760
 does not contribute to the outcome of the 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.920
 match we can consider it almost like 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.870
 so useless though we say it can be 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.970
 also referred to as a personal record 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.560
 so maybe if we want to specify it 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.569
 this was my first nuclear 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.790
 precisely because we are not saying a 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.040
 player who is dedicated to doing things by 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.290
 this kind does not weigh me or in fact 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.030
 a company like that but let's say 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.040
 I'm here to take you in this game 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.650
 plain particular bit 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.510
 so said this guys i wanted to 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.610
 also to talk to you about the map 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.950
 let's say we can do nuclear 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.720
 it also depends very and exclusively 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.180
 in the map 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.970
 in my case standoff a good map 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.070
 we say open and fortunately they are 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.380
 also happened with players who do not 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.820
 They were not so strong as to 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.100
 achieve this reward 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.350
 having said that guys, I apologize if maybe 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.310
 you are seeing knit you are feeling 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.049
 the game audio of this video but for 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.810
 this time it's let's say my pvr 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.310
 failed to record audio but 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.870
 fortunately for the next ones 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.329
 recordings I think they don't have to 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.799
 be problems nothing I apologize if maybe 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.630
 you are seeing this video with 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.769
 the shot a little different but let's say 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.660
 that my cell phone just fell off 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.549
 together with the easel 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.440
 but let's leave this part guys there 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.540
 I want to know your below among the 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.010
 comments on what you think about it 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.320
 about my considerations on 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.970
 nuclear and lula hears us maybe with the 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.590
 next one 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.780
 I recommend you leave the piano here 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.430
 let me also know below if you are 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.530
 You too managed to get a core 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.150
 with this type of weapon well guys a 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.920
 jet greeting was dirty ten students 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.760
