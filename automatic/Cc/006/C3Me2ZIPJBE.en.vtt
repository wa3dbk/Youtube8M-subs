00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.779 
unplug it and plug it back handy at
least<00:06:36.930> two<00:06:37.199> or<00:06:37.349> three<00:06:37.530> times<00:06:37.710> and<00:06:38.130> I<00:06:38.400> noticed

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
least two or three times and I noticed

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:41.510 
least two or three times and I noticed
that<00:06:38.970> that<00:06:39.090> generally<00:06:39.930> made<00:06:40.620> it<00:06:40.740> work<00:06:40.919> here<00:06:41.190> so

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
that that generally made it work here so

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.899 
that that generally made it work here so
we'll<00:06:42.479> see<00:06:42.509> if<00:06:43.080> it<00:06:43.229> gives<00:06:44.069> it<00:06:44.280> to<00:06:44.370> me<00:06:44.490> nope<00:06:44.699> not

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:44.909 
we'll see if it gives it to me nope not

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:48.999 
we'll see if it gives it to me nope not
yet<00:06:45.180> so<00:06:45.360> let's<00:06:45.539> unplug<00:06:45.930> and<00:06:46.560> plug<00:06:46.590> back<00:06:47.550> in<00:06:47.940> and
