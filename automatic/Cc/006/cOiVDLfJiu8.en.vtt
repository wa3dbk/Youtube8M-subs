00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.140
 welcome all reality checks 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.139
 why we love classic tunes from 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.000
 There are a lot of video games 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.009
 great melodies but mostly 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.870
 they are extremely simple and not requiring 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.149
 considerable effort for writing and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.869
 despite this almost every tune 

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:24.149
 causes warm feelings I'm sure it is 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.860
 correct assumption just look 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.450
 on the number of views of some 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.849
 classic tunes on u tuba 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.500
 some people even made a career for themselves 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.400
 just writing a cover on this or that 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.830
 melody people like lindsey stirling 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.290
 create very popular and covers from 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.290
 games such as Zelda and Pokemon and other 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.579
 so before you figure out the reason 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.710
 nostalgia for such melodies we 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.370
 talk to lindsay and hear that in person 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.370
 she thinks about it 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.469
 I think that video games 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.180
 formed a kind of culture 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.640
 peculiar way of life when I listen 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.250
 music from old video games is like 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.619
 brings me back to childhood it causes 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.570
 funny feelings and i think that many 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.200
 people associate themselves with that culture 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.490
 which is very close to them in every sense 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.830
 was really great again 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.630
 plunge into this community already in the image 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.259
 musician because it is a community 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.070
 very friendly great to feel them 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.800
 support 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.229
 even found when i play the melody from 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.020
 Come legend and I can see what delight 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.840
 is the public imagine only 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.179
 huge men give 0 and 5 and climb 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:46.299
 embrace 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:48.369
 it's very cool that it brings people together 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.200
 what does limse say is nothing else 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.000
 how to revive the properties of music 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.890
 childhood memories is 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.810
 supporting factor as they say 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.189
 scientists the key here is emotion 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.729
 emotional surges are closely related to 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:06.009
 evolving memory formation 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.079
 biology says memory tries 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.970
 write down emotions as later 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:13.660
 it may become a matter of life or 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.489
 death is very important to remember the moment when 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.320
 you almost devoured the tiger jumping out 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.980
 bushes after all the next time you can 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.000
 detect the threat in advance 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.700
 hence the conclusion with which the majority 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.540
 agree listening to music closely 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.829
 associated with emotional sensations 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.900
 brain research has clearly shown that 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.090
 music stimulates the whole limbic 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.400
 system functions which are 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.400
 processing emotions and controlling memory 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.040
 so music improves the process 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.560
 shaping memories whether it's just 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.380
 melody or related events or 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.600
 information from very hard to argue 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.730
 to prove this, the article says 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.980
 called memories from the past 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.980
 music autobiographical memory and 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.630
 emotions this work shows the inclination 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.110
 music become attached to positive 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.850
 memories for people who played 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.280
 with classic games when we were kids 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.280
 it was almost always happy moments 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.580
 another important aspect 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.769
 human psychology which can 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.220
 explain love classic melodies 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.720
 are a sense of recognition 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.340
 things with which we have long been familiar 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.290
 we like more 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.300
 this effect is known as effect 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.310
 absolute manifestation if you remember 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.130
 we discussed this in the free episode 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.380
 mrtg in another newer study 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.180
 it's still the same old song 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.800
 firm recognition in determining 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.230
 musical tastes scientists have done 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.060
 the conclusion that they wanted to be pulled 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.010
 to uncharted music 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.989
 feel recognizability yet affects 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.260
 shaping the musical taste of choice 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.420
 genres and station section to the same 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.070
 recognition does not mean complete similarity with 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.820
 original and may be based on 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.650
 partial similarity set 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.600
 classic melodies belong to 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.910
 one same genre using the same 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:12.769
 tricks and even sounds that explains 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:14.930
 the similarity of these works okay on this 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.940
 time to finish and in conclusion i wanted 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.400
 would say that my conclusions are based on 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.620
 how I understand books on the subject and 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.750
 which classic ringtones are bigger 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.669
 just like you write them in 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.070
