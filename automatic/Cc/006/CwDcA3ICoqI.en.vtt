00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
hello I am raging Amish and welcome to

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.349 
hello I am raging Amish and welcome to
the<00:00:04.620> Amish<00:00:04.770> madness<00:00:05.279> with<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.700> maps<00:00:06.060> and

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
the Amish madness with the maps and

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.990 
the Amish madness with the maps and
black<00:00:06.660> ops<00:00:06.899> 2<00:00:07.259> you<00:00:08.189> know<00:00:08.280> looking<00:00:08.580> back<00:00:08.610> on<00:00:08.790> it

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
black ops 2 you know looking back on it

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.180 
black ops 2 you know looking back on it
I<00:00:09.269> think<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.690> really<00:00:10.320> could<00:00:10.590> have<00:00:10.620> called<00:00:10.950> this

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
I think I really could have called this

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.459 
I think I really could have called this
video<00:00:11.519> just<00:00:11.790> called<00:00:12.059> duty<00:00:12.360> maps<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:12.929> general

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
video just called duty maps in general

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.490 
video just called duty maps in general
but<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.580> thought<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.599> was<00:00:15.719> best<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.020> focus<00:00:16.289> just

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
but I thought it was best to focus just

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.820 
but I thought it was best to focus just
on<00:00:16.920> black<00:00:17.279> ops<00:00:17.550> 2<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:19.350> just<00:00:19.560> give<00:00:19.680> some

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
on black ops 2 that to just give some

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.920 
on black ops 2 that to just give some
background<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.430> what<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:20.939> video<00:00:21.210> was<00:00:21.420> why<00:00:21.779> it

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
background to what this video was why it

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.700 
background to what this video was why it
came<00:00:22.109> about<00:00:22.430> I<00:00:23.960> never<00:00:24.960> really<00:00:25.230> played<00:00:25.410> world

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
came about I never really played world

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.920 
came about I never really played world
at<00:00:25.800> war<00:00:26.010> that's<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.060> good<00:00:27.180> place<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.539> start<00:00:27.750> and

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
at war that's a good place to start and

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.630 
at war that's a good place to start and
the<00:00:28.080> reason<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.560> when<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.070> finally<00:00:29.340> did<00:00:29.580> I

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
the reason is when I finally did I

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.330 
the reason is when I finally did I
realized<00:00:30.179> how<00:00:30.449> big<00:00:31.170> some<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.710> those<00:00:31.769> maps<00:00:32.099> when

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
realized how big some of those maps when

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.190 
realized how big some of those maps when
they<00:00:32.399> were<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.730> can't<00:00:33.000> go<00:00:33.510> about<00:00:33.690> 5-10

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
they were just I can't go about 5-10

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.540 
they were just I can't go about 5-10
seconds<00:00:34.649> until<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.980> were<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
seconds until you were really in the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.090 
seconds until you were really in the
action<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:37.079> understand<00:00:37.469> now<00:00:37.620> that's<00:00:37.860> why

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
action and I understand now that's why

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.670 
action and I understand now that's why
the<00:00:38.160> game<00:00:38.460> could<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:38.940> game<00:00:39.750> modes<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.230> war

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the game could have game modes like war

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.889 
the game could have game modes like war
and<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.100> could<00:00:41.219> have<00:00:41.399> tanks<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.329> maps<00:00:42.629> were

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
and it could have tanks the maps were

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.650 
and it could have tanks the maps were
just<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.559> big<00:00:44.100> now<00:00:44.940> there<00:00:45.090> were<00:00:45.180> some<00:00:45.329> small

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
just that big now there were some small

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.529 
just that big now there were some small
ones<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.079> there<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.350> some<00:00:46.500> big<00:00:46.739> ones<00:00:47.010> too

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
ones but there was some big ones too

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.110 
ones but there was some big ones too
modern<00:00:48.539> warfare<00:00:48.719> 2<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> next<00:00:50.550> step<00:00:50.670> in

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
modern warfare 2 was the next step in

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.330 
modern warfare 2 was the next step in
the<00:00:51.239> series<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.230> maps<00:00:52.440> kept<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.039> really

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the series and the maps kept a really

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.510 
the series and the maps kept a really
good<00:00:53.699> mix<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.420> big<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.899> small<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.890> had<00:00:56.070> big

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
good mix of big and small you had big

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.880 
good mix of big and small you had big
huge<00:00:57.120> levels<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:57.660> derail<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> waste<00:00:58.559> lane

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
huge levels like derail and waste lane

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.920 
huge levels like derail and waste lane
you<00:00:59.100> had<00:00:59.219> tiny<00:00:59.520> maps<00:00:59.879> like<00:01:00.059> scrap<00:01:00.420> yard<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
you had tiny maps like scrap yard and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.880 
you had tiny maps like scrap yard and
rust<00:01:01.309> it<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.969> good<00:01:03.270> overall<00:01:03.890> balance

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
rust it was just a good overall balance

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.890 
rust it was just a good overall balance
road<00:01:05.369> at<00:01:05.519> war<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.909> modern<00:01:05.939> warfare<00:01:06.360> 2<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.780> my

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
road at war and modern warfare 2 in my

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.170 
road at war and modern warfare 2 in my
opinion<00:01:07.170> had<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> best<00:01:07.950> mix<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.880> terms<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
opinion had the best mix in terms of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.450 
opinion had the best mix in terms of
size<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.600> maps<00:01:09.869> modern<00:01:10.619> warfare<00:01:10.799> 2<00:01:11.070> maps<00:01:11.250> were

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
size of maps modern warfare 2 maps were

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.880 
size of maps modern warfare 2 maps were
a<00:01:11.490> little<00:01:11.760> bit<00:01:12.210> smaller<00:01:12.600> than<00:01:12.750> world<00:01:13.049> or<00:01:13.500> but

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
a little bit smaller than world or but

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.080 
a little bit smaller than world or but
that's<00:01:14.040> probably<00:01:14.220> because<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.700> know<00:01:14.820> there

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
that's probably because you know there

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.730 
that's probably because you know there
are<00:01:15.119> no<00:01:15.210> tanks<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.900> don't<00:01:16.080> make<00:01:16.320> those<00:01:16.470> big

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
are no tanks so you don't make those big

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.719 
are no tanks so you don't make those big
open<00:01:17.040> lanes<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.580> tanks<00:01:18.409> but<00:01:19.409> yeah<00:01:19.729> moving

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
open lanes for tanks but yeah moving

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.300 
open lanes for tanks but yeah moving
into<00:01:20.880> black<00:01:21.150> ops<00:01:21.450> 1<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:22.170> felt<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.070> map

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
into black ops 1 it felt like the map

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.520 
into black ops 1 it felt like the map
started<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.909> shrink<00:01:24.180> they<00:01:24.540> weren't<00:01:24.750> tiny<00:01:25.229> yet

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
started to shrink they weren't tiny yet

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.039 
started to shrink they weren't tiny yet
but<00:01:25.740> they<00:01:25.920> were<00:01:25.979> generally<00:01:26.850> smaller<00:01:27.540> like

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
but they were generally smaller like

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.719 
but they were generally smaller like
summit<00:01:29.509> nuketown<00:01:30.509> came<00:01:30.990> around<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:32.340> started

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
summit nuketown came around you started

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.760 
summit nuketown came around you started
to<00:01:32.850> see<00:01:33.030> more<00:01:33.270> maps<00:01:33.509> along<00:01:33.900> those<00:01:34.140> lines<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
to see more maps along those lines the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.219 
to see more maps along those lines the
only<00:01:34.979> really<00:01:35.250> big<00:01:35.610> open<00:01:36.030> map<00:01:36.210> was<00:01:36.479> array<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.079> my

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
only really big open map was array in my

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.990 
only really big open map was array in my
opinion<00:01:37.560> there<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.070> mother<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.700> decent

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
opinion there is mother like decent

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.819 
opinion there is mother like decent
mid-sized<00:01:39.600> mats<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.110> that's<00:01:40.259> what<00:01:40.380> also<00:01:40.590> when

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
mid-sized mats but that's what also when

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.620 
mid-sized mats but that's what also when
you<00:01:40.890> started<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> see<00:01:41.340> crap<00:01:41.759> being<00:01:42.060> thrown<00:01:42.450> all

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you started to see crap being thrown all

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.469 
you started to see crap being thrown all
over<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.869> map<00:01:43.310> then<00:01:44.310> modern<00:01:44.640> warfare<00:01:44.820> 3<00:01:44.970> came

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
over the map then modern warfare 3 came

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.740 
over the map then modern warfare 3 came
around<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:47.040> felt<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.490> all<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.850> had<00:01:48.240> was

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
around and it felt like all we had was

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.490 
around and it felt like all we had was
small<00:01:49.110> maps<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:51.170> mean<00:01:52.170> don't<00:01:52.290> get<00:01:52.350> me<00:01:52.409> wrong

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
small maps and I mean don't get me wrong

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.469 
small maps and I mean don't get me wrong
there<00:01:52.860> were<00:01:52.950> some<00:01:53.250> medium<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.939> large<00:01:54.180> but

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
there were some medium and large but

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.389 
there were some medium and large but
that's<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:55.380> when<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.680> started<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.070> get<00:01:56.189> bad

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that's really when it started to get bad

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.780 
that's really when it started to get bad
with<00:01:56.729> cluttered<00:01:57.329> maps<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.990> everywhere

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
with cluttered maps just everywhere

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.590 
with cluttered maps just everywhere
because<00:01:59.790> that's<00:01:59.939> all<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.270> remember<00:02:00.329> in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
because that's all I can remember in

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.539 
because that's all I can remember in
modern<00:02:00.869> warfare<00:02:01.020> 3<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.649> could<00:02:01.829> use<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> sniper

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
modern warfare 3 you could use a sniper

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.730 
modern warfare 3 you could use a sniper
if<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.850> wanted<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.750> could<00:02:04.320> try<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
if you wanted to and you could try and

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.190 
if you wanted to and you could try and
use<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> long-range<00:02:05.430> lmg<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.570> there<00:02:07.110> was

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
use a long-range lmg but there was

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.690 
use a long-range lmg but there was
really<00:02:07.320> no<00:02:07.500> point<00:02:07.770> everything<00:02:08.369> was<00:02:08.489> close

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
really no point everything was close

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.100 
really no point everything was close
quarter<00:02:09.030> but<00:02:09.209> fights<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.080> how<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.319> was

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
quarter but fights it's just how it was

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.950 
quarter but fights it's just how it was
yeah<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:14.000> know<00:02:14.120> me<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.390> this<00:02:14.570> is<00:02:14.630> just<00:02:14.870> one

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
yeah you know me and this is just one

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.410 
yeah you know me and this is just one
man's<00:02:15.320> opinion<00:02:15.440> but<00:02:16.130> uh<00:02:16.190> that's<00:02:16.790> generally

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
man's opinion but uh that's generally

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.150 
man's opinion but uh that's generally
like<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.840> vibe<00:02:18.020> i<00:02:18.230> remember<00:02:18.650> modern<00:02:19.010> warfare

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
like the vibe i remember modern warfare

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.360 
like the vibe i remember modern warfare
3<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.520> was<00:02:19.760> not<00:02:19.940> impressed<00:02:20.090> with<00:02:20.510> all<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.960> much

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
3 I was not impressed with all that much

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.430 
3 I was not impressed with all that much
in<00:02:22.370> terms<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:23.060> maps<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.690> then<00:02:24.110> moving<00:02:24.290> into

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
in terms of maps and then moving into

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.410 
in terms of maps and then moving into
black<00:02:24.680> ops<00:02:24.950> 2<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.280> feels<00:02:25.460> like<00:02:25.610> we<00:02:25.790> finally<00:02:26.030> got

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
black ops 2 it feels like we finally got

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.650 
black ops 2 it feels like we finally got
this<00:02:26.720> mix<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:28.640> small<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.150> medium<00:02:29.540> to

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
this mix of just small and medium to

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.650 
this mix of just small and medium to
large<00:02:29.900> like<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:30.860> only<00:02:31.220> large<00:02:31.580> map<00:02:31.910> anymore<00:02:32.270> is

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
large like the only large map anymore is

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.050 
large like the only large map anymore is
turbine<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:33.800> one<00:02:34.040> has<00:02:34.280> just<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:34.820> many

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
turbine and that one has just so many

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.280 
turbine and that one has just so many
narrow<00:02:36.700> sight<00:02:37.700> lines<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.390> if<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:39.020> really

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
narrow sight lines that if you really

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.900 
narrow sight lines that if you really
want<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.590> do<00:02:39.709> anything<00:02:39.980> long-range<00:02:40.610> there's

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
want to do anything long-range there's

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.430 
want to do anything long-range there's
only<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.120> few<00:02:41.270> spots<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.720> can<00:02:41.750> do<00:02:41.990> it<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.260> rest

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
only a few spots you can do it the rest

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.860 
only a few spots you can do it the rest
of<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:42.680> all<00:02:42.800> close<00:02:43.040> quarter<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:44.240> it's<00:02:44.570> weird

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
of it's all close quarter and it's weird

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.260 
of it's all close quarter and it's weird
because<00:02:45.310> thinking<00:02:46.310> all<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.850> way<00:02:46.910> back<00:02:47.060> to

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
because thinking all the way back to

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.820 
because thinking all the way back to
modern<00:02:47.510> warfare<00:02:47.660> 2<00:02:48.020> I<00:02:48.230> would<00:02:48.500> have<00:02:48.590> never

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
modern warfare 2 I would have never

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.890 
modern warfare 2 I would have never
considered<00:02:49.160> playing<00:02:49.700> with<00:02:49.940> an<00:02:50.030> SMG<00:02:50.330> something

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
considered playing with an SMG something

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.229 
considered playing with an SMG something
like<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.110> p90<00:02:51.709> forget<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:52.280> you're<00:02:53.090> never

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
like the p90 forget it you're never

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.240 
like the p90 forget it you're never
gonna<00:02:53.390> find<00:02:53.480> anybody<00:02:53.840> up<00:02:54.050> close<00:02:54.320> whereas<00:02:55.100> in

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
gonna find anybody up close whereas in

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.430 
gonna find anybody up close whereas in
turbine<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:56.150> can<00:02:56.330> take<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.780> gamble<00:02:57.050> and

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
turbine you can take that gamble and

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.390 
turbine you can take that gamble and
it's<00:02:57.560> actually<00:02:57.830> not<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.950> game<00:02:58.160> well<00:02:58.310> it's

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
it's actually not a game well it's

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.060 
it's actually not a game well it's
actually<00:02:58.489> a<00:02:58.670> very<00:02:58.790> wise<00:02:59.150> decision<00:02:59.750> to<00:03:00.709> bring<00:03:00.920> a

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
actually a very wise decision to bring a

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.620 
actually a very wise decision to bring a
closed<00:03:01.280> core<00:03:01.580> weapon<00:03:01.970> or<00:03:02.090> medium<00:03:02.390> range

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
closed core weapon or medium range

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.290 
closed core weapon or medium range
weapon<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.320> map<00:03:03.680> like<00:03:03.860> turbine<00:03:04.310> because

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
weapon to a map like turbine because

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.670 
weapon to a map like turbine because
you're<00:03:05.420> not<00:03:05.540> going<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.810> have<00:03:05.989> that<00:03:06.020> many<00:03:06.410> long

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
you're not going to have that many long

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.290 
you're not going to have that many long
sight<00:03:07.010> lines<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.459> when<00:03:07.550> you<00:03:07.640> do<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:08.150> don't

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
sight lines and when you do you don't

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.640 
sight lines and when you do you don't
have<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.540> stay<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:08.959> them<00:03:09.140> it's<00:03:09.410> not<00:03:09.560> like

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
have to stay in them it's not like

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.310 
have to stay in them it's not like
you're<00:03:09.830> openly<00:03:10.310> exposed<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.930> yeah<00:03:12.020> that's<00:03:12.140> my

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
you're openly exposed so yeah that's my

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.340 
you're openly exposed so yeah that's my
opinion<00:03:12.620> on<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.920> maps<00:03:13.160> oh<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.940> don't<00:03:14.870> deviate

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
opinion on the maps oh I don't deviate

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.009 
opinion on the maps oh I don't deviate
from<00:03:15.500> what<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.830> said<00:03:16.220> in<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.970> video<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.840> lot

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
from what I said in the video and a lot

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.670 
from what I said in the video and a lot
of<00:03:18.110> people<00:03:18.200> said<00:03:18.500> oh<00:03:18.530> no<00:03:18.769> mw3<00:03:19.250> was<00:03:19.640> worse<00:03:19.850> I<00:03:20.680> can

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
of people said oh no mw3 was worse I can

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.660 
of people said oh no mw3 was worse I can
understand<00:03:22.310> that<00:03:22.700> feeling<00:03:24.280> honestly<00:03:25.280> it's<00:03:25.489> a

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
understand that feeling honestly it's a

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.090 
understand that feeling honestly it's a
big<00:03:26.000> debate<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:26.720> think<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:27.410> was<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.920> fact

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
big debate I think it was that the fact

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.729 
big debate I think it was that the fact
that<00:03:28.190> black<00:03:28.459> ops<00:03:28.730> 2<00:03:29.000> repeated<00:03:29.989> that<00:03:30.170> mistake

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
that black ops 2 repeated that mistake

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.640 
that black ops 2 repeated that mistake
that's<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.760> bigger<00:03:32.180> grievance<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:33.049> have<00:03:33.350> I

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
that's the bigger grievance I have I

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.680 
that's the bigger grievance I have I

didn't really mind at mw3 cuz it was
still<00:03:35.930> relatively<00:03:36.380> new<00:03:36.560> but<00:03:36.739> when<00:03:37.010> they<00:03:37.130> did

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
still relatively new but when they did

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.150 
still relatively new but when they did
it<00:03:37.430> again<00:03:37.630> that<00:03:38.630> just<00:03:38.900> set<00:03:39.080> off<00:03:39.230> all<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.950> made

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.229 
it again that just set off all that made
me<00:03:40.280> mad<00:03:40.489> uh<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:43.100> developers<00:03:43.580> aren't<00:03:43.760> perfect

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
me mad uh the developers aren't perfect

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.789 
me mad uh the developers aren't perfect
and<00:03:44.360> this<00:03:44.510> is<00:03:44.660> one<00:03:44.810> of<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:44.989> examples<00:03:45.230> and

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
and this is one of the examples and

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.020 
and this is one of the examples and
actually<00:03:46.160> you're<00:03:46.340> gonna<00:03:46.430> probably<00:03:46.730> start

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
actually you're gonna probably start

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.430 
actually you're gonna probably start
seeing<00:03:47.299> some<00:03:47.450> videos<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.750> are<00:03:48.140> gonna<00:03:48.290> be<00:03:48.350> a

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
seeing some videos that are gonna be a

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.380 
seeing some videos that are gonna be a
little<00:03:48.560> bit<00:03:48.799> more<00:03:48.920> positive<00:03:49.580> not<00:03:49.850> too<00:03:50.209> many

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
little bit more positive not too many

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.229 
little bit more positive not too many
nightmares<00:03:50.989> of<00:03:51.290> cod<00:03:51.440> still<00:03:51.739> my<00:03:52.060> focus<00:03:53.060> but

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
nightmares of cod still my focus but

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.150 
nightmares of cod still my focus but
I've<00:03:53.360> got<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.570> video<00:03:54.350> or<00:03:54.410> 2<00:03:54.680> i'm<00:03:54.799> thinking<00:03:55.100> of

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
I've got a video or 2 i'm thinking of

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.910 
I've got a video or 2 i'm thinking of
doing<00:03:55.360> with<00:03:56.360> like<00:03:56.540> top<00:03:56.810> five<00:03:56.840> top<00:03:57.290> 10<00:03:57.560> things<00:03:57.739> i

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
doing with like top five top 10 things i

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.259 
doing with like top five top 10 things i
do<00:03:57.980> like<00:03:58.280> or<00:03:58.430> things<00:03:58.580> that<00:03:58.670> they<00:03:58.820> got<00:03:59.000> right

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
do like or things that they got right

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.539 
do like or things that they got right
and<00:03:59.570> the<00:04:00.110> reason<00:04:00.260> is<00:04:00.590> i<00:04:01.070> don't<00:04:01.280> like<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.400> be

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
and the reason is i don't like to be

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.190 
and the reason is i don't like to be
completely<00:04:01.940> negative<00:04:02.239> there's<00:04:02.720> a<00:04:02.810> reason<00:04:03.110> I'm

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
completely negative there's a reason I'm

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.479 
completely negative there's a reason I'm
still<00:04:03.380> playing<00:04:03.620> it's<00:04:03.890> because<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.130> enjoy<00:04:04.220> the

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
still playing it's because I enjoy the

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.820 
still playing it's because I enjoy the
game<00:04:04.670> all<00:04:05.480> right<00:04:05.600> i<00:04:05.630> am<00:04:05.989> almost<00:04:06.200> out<00:04:06.440> of<00:04:06.500> clips

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
game all right i am almost out of clips

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.430 
game all right i am almost out of clips
i<00:04:07.430> think<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:08.030> does<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.360> for<00:04:08.450> this<00:04:08.570> one<00:04:08.750> until

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
i think that does it for this one until

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.199 
i think that does it for this one until
next<00:04:09.530> time<00:04:09.709> this<00:04:09.950> is<00:04:10.010> raging<00:04:10.280> Amish<00:04:10.519> and<00:04:10.820> I<00:04:11.060> am

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
next time this is raging Amish and I am

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.309 
next time this is raging Amish and I am
checking<00:04:11.570> out

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.499
