00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
so nice straight line there this is

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.580 
so nice straight line there this is
where<00:02:52.450> we<00:02:52.540> have<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.780> get<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.990> scissors<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:53.410> so

where we have to get the scissors in so
it's<00:02:53.710> the<00:02:53.860> fiddly<00:02:54.160> bit<00:02:54.340> just<00:02:54.880> fold<00:02:55.240> along<00:02:55.690> the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
it's the fiddly bit just fold along the

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.070 
it's the fiddly bit just fold along the
line<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.560> do<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.040> chop<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.490> stop<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:58.810> gives

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
line and do a chop and stop that gives

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.680 
line and do a chop and stop that gives
us<00:02:59.200> chance<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.680> get<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.340> scissors<00:03:00.550> in<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.480> cut

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.520 
going to have a funny little pair of
lips<00:03:52.030> like<00:03:52.330> that<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:53.880> oh<00:03:54.880> I<00:03:55.720> think<00:03:56.020> that'll<00:03:56.440> be

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
lips like that and oh I think that'll be

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.530 
lips like that and oh I think that'll be
enough<00:03:56.800> you<00:03:57.250> can<00:03:57.520> color<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:57.850> however<00:03:58.209> you

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
enough you can color that however you

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.990 
enough you can color that however you
want<00:03:58.840> at<00:03:59.770> the<00:03:59.860> moment<00:04:00.040> it's<00:04:00.400> square<00:04:00.760> at<00:04:00.910> the

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
want at the moment it's square at the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.699 
want at the moment it's square at the
top<00:04:01.209> so<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.630> doesn't<00:04:01.930> look<00:04:02.020> quite<00:04:02.200> right<00:04:02.320> so

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
top so that doesn't look quite right so

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.040 
top so that doesn't look quite right so
let's<00:04:02.890> just<00:04:03.130> cut<00:04:03.280> off<00:04:03.459> those<00:04:03.930> sticking<00:04:04.930> out

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
let's just cut off those sticking out

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.350 
let's just cut off those sticking out
corners<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.740> at<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.130> bottom<00:04:06.490> cut<00:04:07.030> off<00:04:07.180> that

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
corners and at the bottom cut off that

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.780 
corners and at the bottom cut off that
sticking<00:04:07.720> out<00:04:07.840> corner<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:09.040> next<00:04:09.070> thing<00:04:09.640> is

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
sticking out corner the next thing is

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.190 
sticking out corner the next thing is
we've<00:04:09.970> got<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.240> find<00:04:10.390> a<00:04:10.540> way<00:04:10.660> of<00:04:10.750> fixing<00:04:10.900> it

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
we've got to find a way of fixing it

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.110 
we've got to find a way of fixing it
onto<00:04:11.470> our<00:04:11.590> heads<00:04:11.830> and<00:04:12.400> that's<00:04:12.640> why<00:04:12.880> we've<00:04:13.090> got

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
onto our heads and that's why we've got

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.310 
onto our heads and that's why we've got
this<00:04:13.360> very<00:04:13.750> long<00:04:14.230> strip<00:04:14.650> so<00:04:15.840> put<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:17.020> strip

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
this very long strip so put the strip

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.789 
this very long strip so put the strip
behind<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:19.060> face<00:04:19.270> just<00:04:19.959> about<00:04:20.290> level<00:04:20.650> with

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
behind the face just about level with

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.170 
behind the face just about level with
the<00:04:20.859> eyes<00:04:20.979> and<00:04:22.290> staple<00:04:23.290> it

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
the eyes and staple it

the eyes and staple it

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
then you need perhaps a little bit of

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.400 
then you need perhaps a little bit of
help<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.160> put<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.639> on<00:04:28.820> your<00:04:29.240> face<00:04:29.449> all<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.380> way

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
around and measure where it needs to be

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.520
