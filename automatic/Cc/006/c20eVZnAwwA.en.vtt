believe<00:03:50.030> in<00:03:50.359> here<00:03:50.599> I<00:03:50.900> think<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.769> came<00:03:51.949> with

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
believe in here I think it came with

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.689 
believe in here I think it came with
this<00:03:52.340> one<00:03:52.549> yet<00:03:53.199> so<00:03:56.319> basically<00:03:57.319> here<00:03:58.040> it<00:03:58.129> is<00:03:58.280> uh

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699 
this one yet so basically here it is uh

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.119 
this one yet so basically here it is uh
uh<00:03:58.790> let's<00:03:59.269> just<00:03:59.359> move<00:03:59.750> this<00:04:00.109> guy<00:04:00.620> out<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:00.980> way

uh let's just move this guy out the way

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.729 
uh let's just move this guy out the way

pizza box on the side so you can push it
into<00:04:19.510> here<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.880> this<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.300> it's<00:04:22.479> like<00:04:22.690> you<00:04:22.900> can
