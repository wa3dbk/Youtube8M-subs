00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.249 

hi<00:00:03.480> this<00:00:03.540> is<00:00:03.750> going<00:00:03.900> to<00:00:03.960> be<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.050> demonstration

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
hi this is going to be a demonstration

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.349 
hi this is going to be a demonstration
there<00:00:04.830> no<00:00:04.950> explosion<00:00:05.550> generate<00:00:05.879> diversion

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
there no explosion generate diversion

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.549 
there no explosion generate diversion
three<00:00:06.660> from<00:00:06.899> deep<00:00:07.470> low<00:00:07.649> ideas<00:00:08.750> so<00:00:09.750> it's<00:00:10.259> a<00:00:10.349> tool

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
three from deep low ideas so it's a tool

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.379 
three from deep low ideas so it's a tool
that<00:00:10.740> lets<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.009> generate<00:00:11.210> explosions<00:00:12.210> via

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
that lets you generate explosions via

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.120 
that lets you generate explosions via
games<00:00:12.750> or<00:00:13.049> any<00:00:13.290> other<00:00:13.440> projects<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.860> may<00:00:14.009> be

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
games or any other projects you may be

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.240 
games or any other projects you may be
working<00:00:14.309> on<00:00:14.750> it<00:00:15.750> runs<00:00:15.929> on<00:00:16.020> both<00:00:16.139> Macintosh<00:00:16.830> and

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
working on it runs on both Macintosh and

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.700 
working on it runs on both Macintosh and
Windows<00:00:17.970> I'll<00:00:18.570> go<00:00:18.810> through<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.109> versions<00:00:19.500> and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
Windows I'll go through the versions and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.230 
Windows I'll go through the versions and
variants<00:00:20.100> later<00:00:20.310> but<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.699> works<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:21.029> most

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
variants later but it works on most

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.390 
variants later but it works on most
systems<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:22.230> that's<00:00:23.100> just<00:00:23.220> fari<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.820> appear

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
systems so that's just fari to appear

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
systems so that's just fari to appear
okay<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.640> first<00:00:26.849> thing<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.090> see<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
okay so the first thing you see is the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.700 
okay so the first thing you see is the
main<00:00:27.570> interface<00:00:27.779> where<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.230> configure<00:00:28.619> of

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
main interface where you configure of

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.939 
main interface where you configure of
all<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.980> explosions<00:00:30.619> we'll<00:00:31.619> go<00:00:31.740> through<00:00:31.920> all

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
all the explosions we'll go through all

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.790 
all the explosions we'll go through all
the<00:00:32.099> settings<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:33.080> more<00:00:34.080> detail<00:00:34.470> in<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.680> moment

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the settings in more detail in a moment

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.560 
the settings in more detail in a moment
but<00:00:35.310> I'll<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.490> create<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> quick<00:00:35.940> explosion

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
but I'll just create a quick explosion

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.290 
but I'll just create a quick explosion
here<00:00:36.720> for<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.070> and<00:00:38.070> put<00:00:38.280> some<00:00:38.430> rocks<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.940> there

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
here for you and put some rocks in there

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.710 
here for you and put some rocks in there
we<00:00:39.390> go

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
we go

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.170 
we go
so<00:00:40.140> very<00:00:40.620> quickly<00:00:40.830> create<00:00:41.130> an<00:00:41.340> explosion<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
so very quickly create an explosion and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.430 
so very quickly create an explosion and
alls<00:00:42.360> I'm<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.750> I'm<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.260> grab

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
alls I'm going to do I'm going to grab

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.400 
alls I'm going to do I'm going to grab
these<00:00:43.560> frames<00:00:44.720> since<00:00:45.720> it's<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.050> system

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
these frames since it's a system

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.300 
these frames since it's a system
captures<00:00:46.860> all<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.100> explosion<00:00:48.030> frames<00:00:49.220> any<00:00:50.220> of

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
captures all the explosion frames any of

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.340 
captures all the explosion frames any of
the<00:00:50.400> all<00:00:50.490> are<00:00:50.730> okay<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.930> system<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.260> actually

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
the all are okay the system is actually

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.430 
the all are okay the system is actually
captured<00:00:52.920> 59<00:00:53.400> frames<00:00:53.840> before<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.990> gain<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.410> can

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
captured 59 frames before I gain we can

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.990 
captured 59 frames before I gain we can
see<00:00:55.740> how<00:00:55.800> many<00:00:55.890> frames<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.340> want<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.610> use<00:00:56.760> we

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
see how many frames we want to use we

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.910 
see how many frames we want to use we
say<00:00:57.210> well<00:00:57.420> actually<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:57.900> want<00:00:58.080> 26<00:00:58.650> frames

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
say well actually I just want 26 frames

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.650 
say well actually I just want 26 frames
and<00:00:59.640> what<00:00:59.790> actually<00:01:00.090> happened<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
and what actually happened is the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.130 
and what actually happened is the
explosion<00:01:00.930> generates<00:01:01.410> or<00:01:01.620> pick<00:01:01.830> out<00:01:02.660> 26<00:01:03.660> key

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
explosion generates or pick out 26 key

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.890 
explosion generates or pick out 26 key
frames<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.799> make<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.159> explosion

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
frames that make up this explosion

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.410 
frames that make up this explosion
likewise<00:01:06.900> if<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.140> actually<00:01:07.260> say<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.740> only<00:01:07.830> want

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
likewise if you actually say I only want

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.030 
likewise if you actually say I only want
four<00:01:09.420> frames<00:01:09.690> you<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:10.500> four<00:01:10.740> frames

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
four frames you just get four frames

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.570 
four frames you just get four frames
from<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.880> base<00:01:12.600> explosion<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.170> created<00:01:13.590> so

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
from the base explosion you created so

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
from the base explosion you created so
for<00:01:14.760> my<00:01:14.850> example<00:01:14.880> I'm<00:01:15.360> actually<00:01:15.480> gonna<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.990> say

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
for my example I'm actually gonna do say

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.440 
for my example I'm actually gonna do say
36<00:01:18.600> frames<00:01:19.370> okay<00:01:20.370> so<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.640> see<00:01:20.910> them<00:01:21.090> all<00:01:21.210> here

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
36 frames okay so you see them all here

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.750 
36 frames okay so you see them all here
on<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.110> preview<00:01:22.620> here<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.070> zoom<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
on the preview here we can zoom in and

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.040 
on the preview here we can zoom in and
we<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:23.970> change<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> background<00:01:24.720> color<00:01:24.900> to

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
we can change the background color to

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.210 
we can change the background color to
see<00:01:25.200> what<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.410> actually<00:01:25.680> look<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:25.860> on

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
see what it actually look like on

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.610 
see what it actually look like on
different<00:01:26.340> colored<00:01:26.670> backgrounds<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.930> okay<00:01:28.590> so

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
different colored backgrounds so okay so

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.010 
different colored backgrounds so okay so
this<00:01:29.340> demo<00:01:29.730> I'm<00:01:29.940> just<00:01:30.090> gonna<00:01:30.240> run<00:01:30.750> straight

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
this demo I'm just gonna run straight

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.210 
this demo I'm just gonna run straight
through<00:01:31.080> him<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.530> show<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.830> what<00:01:31.980> we<00:01:32.070> can

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
through him to show you what we can

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.090 
through him to show you what we can
actually<00:01:32.370> do<00:01:32.580> with<00:01:32.610> at<00:01:32.790> all<00:01:33.710> from<00:01:34.710> here<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:34.980> can

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
actually do with at all from here we can

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.330 
actually do with at all from here we can
actually<00:01:35.190> export<00:01:35.730> the<00:01:35.940> animation<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:37.340> when

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
actually export the animation out when

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.340 
actually export the animation out when
obstacle<00:01:38.730> is<00:01:38.970> quickly<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.020> tiniest

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
obstacle is quickly this is tiniest

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.080 
obstacle is quickly this is tiniest
animation<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.830> actually<00:01:40.950> 400<00:01:41.580> by<00:01:41.700> 400<00:01:41.880> pixels

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
animation is actually 400 by 400 pixels

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.070 
animation is actually 400 by 400 pixels
with<00:01:42.870> 36<00:01:43.320> frames<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.430> can<00:01:44.550> scale<00:01:44.820> down

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
with 36 frames and we can scale down

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.149 
with 36 frames and we can scale down
accordingly<00:01:46.080> so<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.500> actually<00:01:46.890> wants<00:01:47.100> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
accordingly so this actually wants to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.610 
accordingly so this actually wants to
50%<00:01:47.670> okay<00:01:48.330> so<00:01:48.390> now<00:01:48.570> they<00:01:48.630> become<00:01:48.870> 200<00:01:49.290> by<00:01:49.380> 200

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
50% okay so now they become 200 by 200

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.160 
50% okay so now they become 200 by 200
each<00:01:50.070> frame<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.870> pick<00:01:52.050> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
each frame and then we can pick the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.860 
each frame and then we can pick the
output<00:01:52.500> format<00:01:52.770> my<00:01:53.640> series<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.000> PNG<00:01:54.270> file<00:01:54.659> was

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
output format my series of PNG file was

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.500 
output format my series of PNG file was
a<00:01:54.900> series<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.200> Tiff's<00:01:55.530> JPEGs<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.580> PNG<00:01:57.090> sprite

tip<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.680> pick<00:02:04.860> for<00:02:04.979> example<00:02:05.370> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
tip so if I pick for example the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.219 
tip so if I pick for example the
chromium<00:02:05.700> project<00:02:05.880> file<00:02:06.330> it'll<00:02:07.049> actually

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
chromium project file it'll actually

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.540 
chromium project file it'll actually
create<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.620> sprite<00:02:07.950> sheet<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.459> me

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
create a sprite sheet for me

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.970 
create a sprite sheet for me
and<00:02:10.030> all<00:02:10.180> the<00:02:10.330> newer<00:02:11.050> files<00:02:11.380> required<00:02:11.830> to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
and all the newer files required to

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.830 
and all the newer files required to
actually<00:02:12.340> build<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.090> animation<00:02:13.210> inside

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
actually build the animation inside

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.100 
actually build the animation inside
Corona<00:02:14.560> here<00:02:15.520> I<00:02:15.550> can<00:02:15.790> just<00:02:15.820> adjust<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.390> size

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
Corona here I can just adjust the size

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.340 
Corona here I can just adjust the size
of<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.440> sprite<00:02:17.920> sheet<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:19.600> again<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.140> best

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
of the sprite sheet so again the best

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.430 
of the sprite sheet so again the best
size<00:02:20.530> here<00:02:20.740> is<00:02:20.860> 1024<00:02:21.240> 2048<00:02:22.240> but<00:02:23.170> again<00:02:23.350> if

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
size here is 1024 2048 but again if

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.930 
size here is 1024 2048 but again if
actually<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.860> made<00:02:24.070> this<00:02:24.190> smaller<00:02:24.520> you'll

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
actually you made this smaller you'll

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.960 
actually you made this smaller you'll
see<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.180> sprite<00:02:25.450> sheet<00:02:25.480> reduces<00:02:26.290> as<00:02:26.440> well<00:02:26.970> by

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
see the sprite sheet reduces as well by

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.520 
see the sprite sheet reduces as well by
doing<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.960> can<00:02:29.110> actually<00:02:29.200> make<00:02:29.440> your

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
doing this you can actually make your

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.500 
doing this you can actually make your
sprites<00:02:29.920> smaller<00:02:30.550> then<00:02:31.210> you<00:02:31.240> can<00:02:31.420> actually

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
sprites smaller then you can actually

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.700 
sprites smaller then you can actually
just<00:02:31.690> set<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.020> scale<00:02:32.640> up<00:02:33.640> in<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:35.260> actual<00:02:35.530> Lua

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
just set the scale up in the actual Lua

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.250 
just set the scale up in the actual Lua
code<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.430> sprite<00:02:36.880> whilst<00:02:37.180> at<00:02:37.330> 50%<00:02:37.690> will<00:02:38.140> be

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
code so the sprite whilst at 50% will be

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.500 
code so the sprite whilst at 50% will be
playback<00:02:38.850> 1.6<00:02:39.850> times<00:02:40.030> greater<00:02:40.570> in<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:42.510> corona

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
playback 1.6 times greater in the corona

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.750 
playback 1.6 times greater in the corona
project<00:02:43.930> ok<00:02:44.830> so<00:02:44.890> just<00:02:45.040> choose<00:02:45.310> where<00:02:45.520> you<00:02:45.580> want

project ok so just choose where you want

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.060 
project ok so just choose where you want
to<00:02:45.910> export<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.660> explosion<00:02:47.350> project<00:02:47.740> out<00:02:47.860> to

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
to export the explosion project out to

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.520 
to export the explosion project out to
click<00:02:48.730> export<00:02:51.780> all<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.840> code<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.350> generated

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
click export all the code is generated

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.110 
click export all the code is generated
for<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.040> on<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.190> fly<00:02:54.400> that's<00:02:54.640> all<00:02:54.850> done<00:02:55.090> now

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
for you on the fly that's all done now

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.150 
for you on the fly that's all done now
so<00:02:55.480> if<00:02:55.960> I<00:02:56.080> go<00:02:56.230> over<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.440> where<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.680> explosion

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
so if I go over to where the explosion

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.210 
so if I go over to where the explosion
was<00:02:57.280> actually<00:02:57.520> created<00:02:57.730> inside<00:02:58.720> my<00:02:58.930> folder<00:02:59.380> ok

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
was actually created inside my folder ok

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.550 
was actually created inside my folder ok
here<00:03:00.520> I<00:03:00.760> can<00:03:01.480> actually<00:03:01.570> use<00:03:01.870> my<00:03:01.930> explosion

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
here I can actually use my explosion

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.440 
here I can actually use my explosion
that<00:03:03.100> was<00:03:03.160> created<00:03:03.580> these<00:03:03.970> are<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.270> newer

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
that was created these are the newer

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.170 
that was created these are the newer
files<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.930> were<00:03:05.020> created<00:03:05.050> and<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:07.000> my

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
files that were created and is my

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.050 
files that were created and is my
explosion<00:03:08.280> spreadsheet<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.670> was<00:03:09.760> created

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
explosion spreadsheet that was created

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.910 
explosion spreadsheet that was created
for<00:03:10.180> me<00:03:10.240> on<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.450> fly<00:03:10.600> it's<00:03:11.380> factually<00:03:11.710> open

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
for me on the fly it's factually open

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.920 
for me on the fly it's factually open
this<00:03:12.010> up<00:03:12.130> inside<00:03:12.400> core<00:03:13.330> energy<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:13.780> can

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
this up inside core energy so you can

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.300 
this up inside core energy so you can
see<00:03:14.080> what<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.260> actually<00:03:14.320> does<00:03:14.620> for<00:03:14.830> you<00:03:14.980> so

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
see what it actually does for you so

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.620 
see what it actually does for you so
train<00:03:15.910> up<00:03:16.170> load<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.320> up<00:03:18.180> go<00:03:19.180> from<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.450> main

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
train up load it up go from the main

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.980 
train up load it up go from the main
file<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:21.700> he<00:03:21.760> creates<00:03:22.060> a<00:03:22.120> default<00:03:22.300> iPhone

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
file and he creates a default iPhone

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.600 
file and he creates a default iPhone
project<00:03:23.350> for<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.620> just<00:03:23.890> as<00:03:23.980> an<00:03:24.100> example

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
project for you just as an example

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.690 
project for you just as an example
so<00:03:25.480> there's<00:03:25.930> your<00:03:26.080> explosion<00:03:26.740> all<00:03:27.430> put

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
so there's your explosion all put

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.490 
so there's your explosion all put
together<00:03:27.850> for<00:03:28.210> you<00:03:28.300> very<00:03:28.540> quickly<00:03:28.960> very<00:03:29.320> nice

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
together for you very quickly very nice

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.530 
together for you very quickly very nice
neat<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.520> don't<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:30.820> be<00:03:31.000> use<00:03:31.210> the<00:03:31.330> code

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
neat and you don't you be use the code

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.970 
neat and you don't you be use the code
and<00:03:31.690> repurpose<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.110> code<00:03:32.320> for<00:03:32.470> your<00:03:32.680> games

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
and repurpose the code for your games

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.230 
and repurpose the code for your games
etc<00:03:34.350> ok<00:03:35.350> so<00:03:35.410> that's<00:03:35.770> a<00:03:35.860> very<00:03:36.190> quick<00:03:36.520> example<00:03:36.850> of

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
etc ok so that's a very quick example of

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.940 
etc ok so that's a very quick example of
what<00:03:37.330> we<00:03:37.510> can<00:03:37.690> do<00:03:37.960> with<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.440> project<00:03:38.830> with<00:03:38.920> the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
what we can do with the project with the

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.850 
what we can do with the project with the
tool<00:03:39.510> create<00:03:40.510> an<00:03:40.600> explosion<00:03:40.930> export<00:03:41.710> it

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
tool create an explosion export it

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.880 
tool create an explosion export it
straight<00:03:42.220> out<00:03:42.250> into<00:03:42.790> our<00:03:42.850> SDK<00:03:43.480> or<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:44.170> PNG<00:03:44.530> file
