00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
actually work one of the couple things

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.180 
actually work one of the couple things
I'd<00:03:46.390> recommend<00:03:46.510> is<00:03:46.960> obviously<00:03:47.500> when<00:03:48.100> you're

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
I'd recommend is obviously when you're

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.020 
I'd recommend is obviously when you're
going<00:03:48.280> to<00:03:48.370> go<00:03:48.460> and<00:03:48.610> do<00:03:48.760> it

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
going to go and do it

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.130 
going to go and do it
there's<00:03:49.270> some<00:03:49.420> different<00:03:49.690> techniques<00:03:49.840> that

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
there's some different techniques that

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.360 
there's some different techniques that
maybe<00:03:50.290> can<00:03:50.440> make<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.560> little<00:03:50.710> bit<00:03:50.860> faster<00:03:51.220> draw

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
maybe can make a little bit faster draw

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.070 
maybe can make a little bit faster draw
use<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.700> open<00:03:51.940> host<00:03:52.120> technique<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.630> get<00:03:52.750> most

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
use the open host technique to get most

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.410 
use the open host technique to get most
of<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.320> water<00:03:53.500> off<00:03:54.240> secondly<00:03:55.240> if<00:03:55.360> you're

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
of the water off secondly if you're

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.640 
of the water off secondly if you're
