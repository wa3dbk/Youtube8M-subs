00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.839 
part right underneath needs to go on the
center<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.080> your<00:02:22.800> key<00:02:23.069> so<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.400> see<00:02:23.670> these

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
center of your key so you see these

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.750 
center of your key so you see these
holes<00:02:24.170> some<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.440> may<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.920> closed<00:02:26.400> holes

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
holes some of you may have closed holes

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.540 
holes some of you may have closed holes
I<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.239> open<00:02:27.660> but<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.800> doesn't<00:02:29.130> matter<00:02:29.250> you

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
I have open but it doesn't matter you

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.370 
I have open but it doesn't matter you
need<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.940> pretend<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.690> center<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.110> your

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
need to pretend that the center of your

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.520 
need to pretend that the center of your
finger<00:02:31.819> covers<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.120> center<00:02:33.569> of<00:02:33.870> each<00:02:34.110> hole<00:02:36.530> so

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
finger covers the center of each hole so

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.610 
finger covers the center of each hole so
here<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.010> good<00:02:38.250> idea<00:02:38.540> this<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.900> generally

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
here is a good idea this is generally

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.740 
here is a good idea this is generally
what<00:02:40.800> your<00:02:40.950> fingers<00:02:41.340> should<00:02:42.090> be<00:02:42.209> doing<00:02:42.540> when

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
what your fingers should be doing when

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.580 
what your fingers should be doing when
you're<00:02:42.930> playing<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.350> flute<00:02:45.080> now<00:02:46.080> it's<00:02:46.319> time

you're playing the flute now it's time

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.590 
you're playing the flute now it's time

that<00:04:04.889> I<00:04:04.920> see<00:04:05.310> quite<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:06.060> lot<00:04:06.450> with<00:04:06.959> beginning

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
that I see quite a lot with beginning

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.420 
that I see quite a lot with beginning
students<00:04:07.709> as<00:04:07.799> well<00:04:09.319> as<00:04:10.319> they<00:04:10.470> play<00:04:10.680> like<00:04:10.859> this

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
students as well as they play like this

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.190 
students as well as they play like this
and<00:04:11.819> I<00:04:12.150> don't<00:04:12.299> know<00:04:12.359> how<00:04:12.510> they<00:04:12.690> get<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:12.870> sound

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
and I don't know how they get a sound

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.140 
and I don't know how they get a sound
when<00:04:13.650> their<00:04:13.769> flute<00:04:14.010> is<00:04:14.639> way<00:04:14.850> down<00:04:15.090> here

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
when their flute is way down here

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.870 
when their flute is way down here
hopefully<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.650> clears<00:04:17.250> up<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.609> lot<00:04:17.849> of

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
hopefully that clears up a lot of

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.210 
hopefully that clears up a lot of
questions<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:18.989> may<00:04:19.140> have<00:04:19.169> on<00:04:19.709> how<00:04:20.159> to
