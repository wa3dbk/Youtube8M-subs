00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.540
 welcome thank you very much for 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.880
 accompany us while the frog legs 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.220
 they were the only reference we had of 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.470
 a dish prepared with this amphibian a 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.230
 miraculous drink crossed in our 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.110
 road offered to combat problems of 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.989
 anemia pneumonia fatigue physical stress 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.610
 2 and to prepare it in a bad mood 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.650
 a congested area of ​​the capital 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.349
 Peruvian and has a demand 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.140
 impressive although it is difficult to 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.329
 believe 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.430
 It would be unforgivable to visit the capital 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.590
 Peruvian and not know the ruins 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.890
 archaeological because it is another way of 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.690
 connect with your history and culture of 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.579
 all that exist far and wide 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.690
 from the city we visited the most 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.120
 emblematic la huaca pucllana 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.600
 was built by the Lima culture between 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.969
 the year 400 and 700 after Christ almost 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.399
 in its entirety with adobes in position 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.320
 vertical with small side voids 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.300
 what gives a shelf aspect full 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.700
 from books 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.310
 at each higher level it is accessed through 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.700
 ramps in the form of zig zag and from the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.010
 high the view is spectacular throughout 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.200
 of the tour the tourists can see the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.300
 elegant restaurant built to a 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.640
 side of the ruins and a series of 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.740
 life -size recreations of the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.720
 rituals that made the pachamama 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.729
 the one that caught our attention was 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.220
 This one shows that the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.200
 people of the lima culture offered 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.060
 and they fed on different products 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.340
 grown on their land 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.829
 but also amphibians these frogs 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.500
 perfectly arranged in the pan are 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:44.289
 proof of that last thing not what 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.259
 We knew but we were interested and he left us 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.899
 thinking if the Incas ate frogs and so 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.490
 they recreated them in the huaca pucllana 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.369
 possibly the Peruvians still maintained 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.440
 alive that tradition was just an idea 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.580
 but just in case we encourage 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.280
 investigate and this is what we discovered 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.290
 although it is difficult to believe in a 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.940
 congested area of ​​the city of Lima 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.979
 amphibians have become the 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.980
 main ingredient to raise the 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.810
 energies defenses moods and everything 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.360
 whatever comes to mind 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.030
 in the local source of life betsy us 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.190

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.020
 prepare the most aphrodisiac juices and 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.660
 curatives of the Peruvian capital 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.520
 his speed to work is worthy of 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.530
 recognize but your ability to 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.680
 turn one of these frogs into a 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.840
 appetizing and curative juice what is more and if 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.030
 do not believe me just look like in a matter of 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.030
 seconds of this little animal becomes 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.160
 in a drink according to dona rosa 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.600
 preparation serves to cure several 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.850
 diseases 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.330
 are prepared based on the frog and 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.980

 bone pains for the brain to 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:10.560
 malnutrition of children 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.560
 adults who suffer bone pain 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.349
 We could not believe how people tested 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.540
 the juice without any qualms and is that 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.239
 they also take it with pleasure while they read 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.400
 the newspaper early in the day but 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.800
 clear for those who place their faith in 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.230
 natural healing products everything is 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.110

 child consumes his favorite is extract 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.200
 of frog with honey bee and not even a 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.569
 time was wrong as I said with the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.060
 immediate americas vehicles and it should be 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:44.360
 be a good friend who had tuberculosis 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.200
 in my work and I took her as a frog and with 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.180
 sure got up because it's good for 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.190
 do not kidnap low defenses what is 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.769
 the importance of taking these hours of 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.569
 the morning what I think is effective 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.670
 before taking food and that's why 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.770
 that I take 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.140
 with that he has energy for the whole day 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:07.690
 for the whole afternoon for a long time more 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.910
 in a pot the maca boils with the plant 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.370
 kiwicha and in the other soy milk 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.620
 either serves as a basis for 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.600
 the juices and according to the needs of the 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.530
 client the others are added 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.560
 ingredients 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.750
 many magic powders liqueurs like water 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.570
 of mantle or chucho wash or herbs 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.090
 medicinal honey of all kinds different 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.960
 fruits and the most requested this body 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.419
 green with four legs and moving the 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.700
 Dona Rosa's fishbowl hosts daily 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.730
 about 100 frogs are brought 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.320
 directly from Lake Titicaca 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.230
 depending on the clientele in a day of 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.450
 work uses at least 60 and 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.540
 the others just wait for their 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.790
 turn but not only them our 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.919
 producing producer, tourist guide and 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.860
 others also waited his turn then 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.140
 Although it is 100% Peruvian, it had never been 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.900
 daring to approve the frog extract 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.940
 I actually say daring because it was not 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.890
 it's not easy to prove it after knowing that 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.650
 a liquefied corpse was in 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.110
 that pink rose glass helped us with a 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.650
 first attempt and then came the 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.650
 of fire 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.150
 if he is rich 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.580
 ah 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.750
 after so many faces and gestures do not 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.760
 it was so bad 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.100
 the recommendation is better to forget about 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.650
 the background and enjoy its flavor 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.260
 and you have to admit that such a drink 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.200
 forceful as this one definitely will 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.830
 gives energy all day that's what 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.830
 we guarantee
