 properties of the banana for the skin 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.299
 it seems incredible that there are so many 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.519
 properties of the banana for the skin 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.469
 but the truth is that this fruit is 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.170
 excellent for making masks 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.330
 Facials prevent acne and wrinkles and 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.090
 help take care of the skin affected by 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.880
 diseases like psoriasis if you're 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.949
 looking for something easy and cheap natural 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.800
 to have a prettier skin 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.720
 answer is the banana the pulp of 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.119
 banana for the skin the banana has 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.669
 many properties for the skin for its 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.829
 nutritional richness and generally 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.640
 used in masks of all kinds 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.379
 alone or combined with other foods 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.600
 probably the easiest option is the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.210
 mask to hydrate in depth 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.539
 a banana puree is made and placed 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.730
 on the skin for about 10 to 20 minutes 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.860
 then rinse gently with water and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.460
 Dry a clean towel with paper 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.289
 also the banana is rich in potassium and 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.140
 for this reason it has properties 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.260
 anti-aging especially if we combine it 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.510
 with honey for that we make a mash of a 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.050
 fruit and we combine it with a spoonful 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.420
 of honey 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.240
 we let the mixture rest until 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.400
 get brown then wash your face well 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.800
 and we put the mask all over 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.800
 face without forgetting to place it 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.470
 under the eyes we let act 10 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.140
 minutes and then when we start to 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.870
 feel the skin tight we can rinse 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.660
 with warm water first and with cold water 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.700
 then the good thing about this mask is 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.250
 that we can use it how many times 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.500
 we want as long as it does not harm the skin 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.480
 the recommendable ones are three times 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.510

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.640
