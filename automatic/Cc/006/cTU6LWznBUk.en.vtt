and<00:01:55.340> very<00:01:55.910> interesting<00:01:56.450> in<00:01:56.600> different<00:01:56.930> ways

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
and very interesting in different ways

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.870 
and very interesting in different ways
so<00:01:57.680> we've<00:01:57.800> got<00:01:57.950> them<00:01:58.100> exploding<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.760> they're

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
so we've got them exploding and they're

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.270 
so we've got them exploding and they're
flying<00:01:59.060> off<00:01:59.240> into<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.510> distance<00:01:59.690> Avram<00:02:00.530> can

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
flying off into the distance Avram can

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.710 
flying off into the distance Avram can
you<00:02:01.400> save<00:02:01.610> them<00:02:01.790> at<00:02:01.910> this<00:02:02.030> point<00:02:02.210> I<00:02:02.390> think<00:02:02.630> the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
you save them at this point I think the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.030 
you save them at this point I think the
best<00:02:02.869> way<00:02:02.930> to<00:02:03.050> save<00:02:03.290> them<00:02:03.470> is<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.710> do<00:02:03.800> a<00:02:03.830> better

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
best way to save them is to do a better

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.010 
best way to save them is to do a better
job<00:02:04.130> singing<00:02:07.240> salmon<00:02:08.240> suggested<00:02:08.750> we<00:02:08.869> do

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
job singing salmon suggested we do

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.440 
job singing salmon suggested we do
something<00:02:09.289> kind<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.770> like<00:02:09.950> high<00:02:10.429> action<00:02:10.729> like

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
something kind of like high action like

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.990 
something kind of like high action like
double<00:02:12.170> may<00:02:12.290> cry<00:02:12.590> style<00:02:13.010> mechanic<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.820> so<00:02:13.970> I

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
double may cry style mechanic and so I

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.180 
double may cry style mechanic and so I
was<00:02:14.209> trying<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.480> think<00:02:14.540> about<00:02:14.810> what<00:02:15.320> kind<00:02:16.040> of

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
was trying to think about what kind of

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.600 
was trying to think about what kind of
game<00:02:16.459> mechanic<00:02:17.030> would<00:02:17.180> be<00:02:17.860> really<00:02:18.860> signature

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
game mechanic would be really signature

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.840 
game mechanic would be really signature
to<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.000> series<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.709> was<00:02:21.850> weapon

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
to the series and so it was weapon

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.570 
to the series and so it was weapon
juggling<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.630> keeping<00:02:23.989> an<00:02:24.170> enemy<00:02:24.860> suspended

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
juggling and keeping an enemy suspended

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.690 
juggling and keeping an enemy suspended

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
in the air while he's being shot at home

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.390 
in the air while he's being shot at home
