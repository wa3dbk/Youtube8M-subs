00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.350

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.360

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.410
 training send us an email to 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.689
 instructors of mexico hotmail.com 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.060
 also find us on facebook as 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.829
 School instructors you live 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.939
 we invite you to be part of the new 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.939
 teacher generation 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.480
 Accompanied by tambourines and 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.620
 instructors for all of you use 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.050
 of metronomes for android devices 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.750
 and also unveiled meters to 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.190
 Android devices are tools 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.190
 that will help us very much our 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.610
 work because today it is becoming more common 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.370
 that each person had a device 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.980
 that has the operating system of 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.809
 Android and there are quite a few applications that 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.830
 can they help us in their work? 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.300
 read as what is the metronome and the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.720
 decibelimeter let's meet them 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.060
 well then first we have this this 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.630
 application that is called digital 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.630
 metronome 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.909
 which presents this screen 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.219
 we can see that it has different types 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.479
 of applications like for example that 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:29.039
 page that can indicate us in a way 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.399
 immediately the cadence we want 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.399
 to choose 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.009
 the beats that can tell us how many 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.140
 types of repetitions we want so 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.270
 regular I use two to stand 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.670
 left and right foot the cadence 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.290
 normal let's say the most common cycle is the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.480
 of 120 steps per minute 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.220
 this button here tells us if 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.690
 we want the cell phone to vibrate if not 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.730
 we can be watching it we can 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.410
 feel every time it vibrates would be the 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.410
 percussion or with sound 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.220
 with these keys here we can change 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.479
 the cadence 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.479
 that we want to use 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.160
 and with this one here we can change the 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.160
 design and what it shows on screen 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.800
 and we also have this other application 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.800
 of metronome 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.190
 this is a bit more classic is the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:51.620
 classic metronome here we can see that 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.620
 have many types of sounds we want 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.069
 and with this from here we can start 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.290
 here we have a cadence of 130 steps 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.930
 per minute 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.959
 and with this button here with this 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.330
 let's say as an indicator we can upload or 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:18.150
 lower the cadence I want to lower it 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.260
 at 120 steps per minute it costs a lot 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.040
 work to hit him and he does not have a button 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.040
 to do it manually 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.660
 there he is at 120 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.870
 then this we can place it in front 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.010
 to us while we execute some 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.019
 touch that goes 120 steps per minute 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.510
 and the hand indicates the foot 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:50.700
 left foot right also has to 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.700
 sound for vibration 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:04.920
 this application is called metro no 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.920
 and the last one is called metronome 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.750
 is the one I like the most, it 's very easy to 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.220
 handle of course that the versions 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.920
 free bring some kind of advertising 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:22.180
 but we can buy it to avoid this 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:25.540
 here we can listen in this place of 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.310
 here we can modify the cadence that 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.550
 we want here we're going to use the 60's 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.990
 steps per minute that would be for 1 and 2 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.990
 of the modern and ancient dartboard 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.460
 very well or we can easily change it 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.449
 leaving the key pressed to go 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.460
 faster 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:54.350
 at 110 steps per minute 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.350
 for honor mark or flag 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.270
 with me 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.600
 as we can see has enough 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.370
 tools that can help us 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.760
 I can modify it to 120 steps 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.760
 minute 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.919
 or I can change it 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:29.919
 at 130 steps per minute 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.830
 and well these are the applications 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.570
 android metronome that are pretty 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.040
 help for us the instructors of 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.020
 war bands verify 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.940
 constantly that we are teaching 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.740
 the correct cadence and these 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.630
 tools that are free to 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.289
 Android devices can help us 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.659
