your<00:04:23.220> car<00:04:23.460> is<00:04:23.490> not<00:04:24.000> named<00:04:24.419> all<00:04:24.599> the<00:04:24.630> way<00:04:24.810> up<00:04:25.050> the

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
your car is not named all the way up the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.990 
your car is not named all the way up the
engine

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
engine

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.350 
engine
it<00:04:27.420> tells<00:04:28.200> your<00:04:28.560> car<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.610> motors<00:04:30.060> mean

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
it tells your car that the motors mean

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.380 
it tells your car that the motors mean
the<00:04:30.870> motor<00:04:31.080> is<00:04:31.230> cold<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:32.430> needs<00:04:32.640> more<00:04:32.940> fuel

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
the motor is cold and it needs more fuel

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.950 
the motor is cold and it needs more fuel
so<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:34.170> causes<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.680> car<00:04:34.950> to<00:04:35.160> run<00:04:35.310> rich<00:04:35.720> so<00:04:36.720> if

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
so it causes the car to run rich so if

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.960 
so it causes the car to run rich so if
you're<00:04:37.440> driving<00:04:37.650> around<00:04:38.010> with<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.280> thermostat

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
you're driving around with a thermostat

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.630 
you're driving around with a thermostat
that's<00:04:39.450> opening<00:04:40.020> too<00:04:40.260> soon<00:04:40.800> because<00:04:41.490> the

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
that's opening too soon because the

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.270 
that's opening too soon because the
springs<00:04:42.000> are<00:04:42.240> worn<00:04:42.480> it<00:04:43.470> will<00:04:43.650> cause<00:04:43.830> your<00:04:44.070> car

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
springs are worn it will cause your car

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.380 
springs are worn it will cause your car
to<00:04:44.550> run<00:04:44.730> 10<00:04:45.420> 20<00:04:46.230> 30<00:04:46.830> degrees<00:04:47.220> cooler<00:04:47.490> which

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
to run 10 20 30 degrees cooler which

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.330 
to run 10 20 30 degrees cooler which
will<00:04:48.600> cause<00:04:48.780> your<00:04:48.990> engine<00:04:49.140> management<00:04:49.890> to

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
will cause your engine management to

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.330 
will cause your engine management to
pump<00:04:50.820> more<00:04:51.060> gas<00:04:51.510> into<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.230> chambers<00:04:52.830> causing

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
pump more gas into the chambers causing

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.720 
pump more gas into the chambers causing
it<00:04:53.430> to<00:04:53.550> run<00:04:54.060> rich<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:55.680> you're<00:04:56.040> using<00:04:56.400> more<00:04:56.670> gas

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
it to run rich and you're using more gas

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.540 
it to run rich and you're using more gas
so<00:04:57.630> where<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:57.900> may<00:04:58.080> be<00:04:58.110> getting<00:04:58.440> 25<00:04:59.040> miles<00:04:59.370> to

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
so where you may be getting 25 miles to

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.430 
so where you may be getting 25 miles to
the<00:04:59.640> gallon<00:04:59.820> on<00:05:00.060> a<00:05:00.090> good<00:05:00.300> Thunder<00:05:00.630> stack<00:05:00.870> these

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
the gallon on a good Thunder stack these

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.520 
the gallon on a good Thunder stack these
are<00:05:01.590> now<00:05:01.800> getting<00:05:02.780> 20<00:05:03.780> miles<00:05:04.020> to<00:05:04.140> the<00:05:04.230> gallon

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
are now getting 20 miles to the gallon

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.620 
are now getting 20 miles to the gallon
or<00:05:05.070> 18<00:05:05.669> miles<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.210> gallon

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
or 18 miles to the gallon

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.890 
or 18 miles to the gallon
okay<00:05:07.260> so<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.950> worst<00:05:08.220> disk<00:05:08.580> gets<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:09.450> richer

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
okay so the worst disk gets the richer

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.440 
okay so the worst disk gets the richer

blow<00:06:02.820> hoses<00:06:03.450> and<00:06:03.630> things<00:06:03.990> like<00:06:04.169> that<00:06:04.229> the<00:06:04.800> most

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
blow hoses and things like that the most

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.210 
blow hoses and things like that the most
common<00:06:05.460> cause<00:06:05.729> of<00:06:06.090> cars<00:06:06.690> overheating<00:06:07.590> is<00:06:08.010> when

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
common cause of cars overheating is when

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.490 
common cause of cars overheating is when
they<00:06:08.340> blow<00:06:08.580> a<00:06:08.610> hose<00:06:08.910> or<00:06:09.240> gets<00:06:09.720> a<00:06:09.810> radiator<00:06:10.260> leak

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
they blow a hose or gets a radiator leak

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.040 
they blow a hose or gets a radiator leak
so<00:06:11.010> if<00:06:11.130> you<00:06:11.250> ever<00:06:11.370> see<00:06:11.580> a<00:06:11.610> coolant<00:06:12.000> leak<00:06:12.060> get

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
so if you ever see a coolant leak get

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.020 
so if you ever see a coolant leak get
somebody<00:06:13.500> to<00:06:13.830> find<00:06:14.130> out<00:06:14.370> where<00:06:14.580> that<00:06:14.610> cooler

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
somebody to find out where that cooler

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.570 
somebody to find out where that cooler
is<00:06:15.270> leaking<00:06:15.660> from<00:06:15.780> and<00:06:16.320> get<00:06:16.560> that<00:06:16.680> repaired<00:06:17.100> so

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
is leaking from and get that repaired so

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.610 
is leaking from and get that repaired so
you<00:06:17.640> don't<00:06:17.820> get<00:06:17.940> your<00:06:18.090> motor<00:06:18.300> overheated<00:06:18.960> now

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
you don't get your motor overheated now

you need to replace it it increases your
fuel<00:08:02.740> mileage<00:08:02.770> and<00:08:03.370> it<00:08:03.909> saves<00:08:05.400> components

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 
fuel mileage and it saves components

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.320 
fuel mileage and it saves components
