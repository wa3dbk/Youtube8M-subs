00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
able to see it up close I had done this

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.880 
able to see it up close I had done this
video<00:06:03.030> before<00:06:03.450> but<00:06:04.020> I<00:06:04.200> realized<00:06:04.650> that<00:06:04.800> my

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
video before but I realized that my

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.530 
video before but I realized that my
camera<00:06:05.280> wasn't<00:06:05.490> on<00:06:05.700> the<00:06:05.820> right<00:06:05.970> setting<00:06:06.390> so

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
camera wasn't on the right setting so

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.510 
camera wasn't on the right setting so
they<00:06:06.630> kept<00:06:06.870> zooming<00:06:07.260> in<00:06:07.380> and<00:06:07.500> out<00:06:07.650> so<00:06:08.340> that's

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
they kept zooming in and out so that's

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.010 
they kept zooming in and out so that's
the<00:06:08.730> reason<00:06:08.760> why<00:06:09.090> i<00:06:09.210> already<00:06:09.480> cut<00:06:09.690> the<00:06:09.870> lace

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
the reason why i already cut the lace

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.710 
the reason why i already cut the lace
