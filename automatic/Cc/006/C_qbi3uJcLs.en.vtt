lobster<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:03.060> supreme<00:02:04.060> call<00:02:04.360> of<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.630> sea<00:02:04.810> i

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
lobster and supreme call of the sea i

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.710 
lobster and supreme call of the sea i
think<00:02:05.140> is<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.380> highest<00:02:05.710> here<00:02:06.510> but<00:02:07.510> we<00:02:07.600> also

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
think is the highest here but we also

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.919 
think is the highest here but we also
have<00:02:07.870> the<00:02:08.319> fishing<00:02:09.009> outfit<00:02:09.340> which<00:02:09.610> gives<00:02:10.060> 2.5%

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
have the fishing outfit which gives 2.5%

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.010 
have the fishing outfit which gives 2.5%
extra<00:02:11.740> XP<00:02:12.120> so

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
extra XP so

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.510 
extra XP so
