the uranium mining companies one of the
findings<00:04:16.310> was<00:04:16.550> that<00:04:16.580> uranium<00:04:17.450> miners<00:04:17.840> were

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
findings was that uranium miners were

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.270 
findings was that uranium miners were

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.409 
pay they were all nice and they were
polite<00:06:37.020> and<00:06:37.379> everything<00:06:37.889> you<00:06:38.399> know<00:06:38.550> about<00:06:38.999> it

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 
polite and everything you know about it

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:42.679 
polite and everything you know about it
but<00:06:40.169> there<00:06:40.770> was<00:06:40.949> a<00:06:40.979> person<00:06:41.879> I<00:06:42.270> guess<00:06:42.509> they

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:42.689 
but there was a person I guess they

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:46.189 
but there was a person I guess they
called<00:06:42.990> safety<00:06:43.349> men<00:06:43.740> and<00:06:44.009> I<00:06:44.339> guess<00:06:44.759> he<00:06:45.199> assumed

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 
called safety men and I guess he assumed

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.989 
called safety men and I guess he assumed
that<00:06:46.319> he<00:06:46.619> was<00:06:46.800> the<00:06:47.069> one<00:06:47.279> that<00:06:47.580> he's<00:06:47.669> supposed

00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:47.999 
that he was the one that he's supposed

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:50.809 
that he was the one that he's supposed
to<00:06:48.059> be<00:06:48.270> telling<00:06:48.719> that<00:06:48.749> telling<00:06:49.559> them<00:06:49.800> you<00:06:50.729> know

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 
to be telling that telling them you know

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:52.369 
to be telling that telling them you know
how<00:06:51.209> it's<00:06:51.449> going<00:06:51.659> to<00:06:51.749> affect<00:06:51.990> their<00:06:52.139> life

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:52.379 
how it's going to affect their life

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:56.179 
how it's going to affect their life
later<00:06:52.709> on<00:06:52.969> but<00:06:53.969> I<00:06:54.509> guess<00:06:55.229> that<00:06:55.409> man<00:06:55.649> never<00:06:55.889> said

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:56.189 
later on but I guess that man never said

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:59.139 
later on but I guess that man never said
anything<00:06:56.490> about<00:06:56.759> that

00:06:59.139 --> 00:06:59.149 
anything about that

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:03.290 
anything about that
it<00:07:00.149> was<00:07:00.330> wandering<00:07:00.749> by<00:07:01.550> things<00:07:02.550> like<00:07:02.819> that<00:07:03.059> you

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
it was wandering by things like that you

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:14.290 
it was wandering by things like that you
know<00:07:03.449> he<00:07:04.319> was<00:07:04.499> never<00:07:04.680> told<00:07:05.069> now<00:07:05.399> to<00:07:06.089> this<00:07:06.240> day

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.350 

in<00:07:15.300> the<00:07:15.419> case<00:07:15.599> of<00:07:15.809> our<00:07:16.680> uranium<00:07:17.069> miners<00:07:17.699> the

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
in the case of our uranium miners the

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.079 
in the case of our uranium miners the
damage<00:07:18.689> is<00:07:18.839> caused<00:07:19.050> by<00:07:19.379> inhalation<00:07:19.919> of<00:07:20.279> the

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:21.089 
damage is caused by inhalation of the

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:23.409 
damage is caused by inhalation of the
radiation<00:07:21.749> now<00:07:22.740> the<00:07:22.860> lining<00:07:23.159> of<00:07:23.219> the<00:07:23.279> lung

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:23.419 
radiation now the lining of the lung

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:25.579 
radiation now the lining of the lung
consists<00:07:24.419> of<00:07:24.449> cells<00:07:24.749> that<00:07:24.870> are<00:07:25.080> turning<00:07:25.409> over

00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:25.589 
consists of cells that are turning over

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:28.399 
consists of cells that are turning over
rapidly<00:07:25.860> they're<00:07:26.459> dividing<00:07:26.999> frequently<00:07:27.839> and

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:28.409 
rapidly they're dividing frequently and

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:30.619 
rapidly they're dividing frequently and
so<00:07:29.370> they're<00:07:29.519> susceptible<00:07:30.389> to<00:07:30.419> radiation

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:30.629 
so they're susceptible to radiation

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:34.790 
so they're susceptible to radiation
damage<00:07:32.029> radiation<00:07:33.029> affects<00:07:33.389> the<00:07:33.689> DNA<00:07:34.559> of<00:07:34.709> the

damage radiation affects the DNA of the

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.399 
damage radiation affects the DNA of the
cells<00:07:34.830> the<00:07:35.249> genetic<00:07:35.639> code<00:07:35.849> and<00:07:36.269> can<00:07:37.199> cause

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:37.409 
cells the genetic code and can cause

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:39.230 
cells the genetic code and can cause

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 
changes in the genetic code which then

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:45.529 
changes in the genetic code which then
lead<00:07:39.959> to<00:07:39.990> a<00:07:40.139> cancer<00:07:43.189> we<00:07:44.189> have<00:07:44.279> a<00:07:44.360> generation<00:07:45.360> of

Navajo widows from from uranium mining
