you the lag so we'll see if it matters

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.509 
you the lag so we'll see if it matters
i'm<00:02:37.500> gonna<00:02:37.680> give<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:37.860> guy<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.069> chance<00:02:38.280> though

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
i'm gonna give this guy a chance though

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.250 
i'm gonna give this guy a chance though
it<00:02:38.550> looks<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:38.910> he's<00:02:39.120> got<00:02:39.360> 18<00:02:39.630> that's<00:02:40.050> 10

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
it looks like he's got 18 that's 10

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.170 
it looks like he's got 18 that's 10
times<00:02:40.500> better<00:02:40.680> than<00:02:40.830> mine<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.970> is

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
times better than mine so this is

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.559 
times better than mine so this is
probably<00:02:42.569> gonna<00:02:42.930> end<00:02:43.170> poorly<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:44.610> need<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.390> find
