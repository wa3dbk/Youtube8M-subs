550<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.420> today<00:00:24.420> we'll<00:00:24.750> be<00:00:24.810> testing<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.710> WR

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
550 and today we'll be testing the WR

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.980 
550 and today we'll be testing the WR
450<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:28.740> basically<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.430> WR<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.180> like<00:00:30.779> most

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
450 and basically the WR is like most

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.250 
450 and basically the WR is like most
any<00:00:31.199> other<00:00:31.320> 450<00:00:32.039> enduro<00:00:32.600> the<00:00:33.600> foresail<00:00:34.020> turns

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
any other 450 enduro the foresail turns

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.439 
any other 450 enduro the foresail turns
it<00:00:34.440> over<00:00:34.500> really<00:00:34.920> easy<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.969> about<00:00:36.180> an<00:00:36.359> inch

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
it over really easy it's about an inch

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.900 
it over really easy it's about an inch
thick<00:00:36.810> and<00:00:37.190> about<00:00:38.190> four<00:00:38.430> inches<00:00:38.670> wide

three and a quarter inch tall on this
particular<00:00:42.210> model<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.750> don't<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> quick

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
particular model I don't have the quick

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.870 
particular model I don't have the quick
disconnect<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.610> screw<00:00:44.850> on

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
disconnect I just have the screw on

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.150 
disconnect I just have the screw on
terminals<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.690> they<00:00:45.780> make<00:00:45.960> these<00:00:46.230> two<00:00:46.890> list

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
terminals and they make these two list

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.660 
terminals and they make these two list
terminals<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:47.940> bolt<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
terminals that you just bolt on the the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.420 
terminals that you just bolt on the the
leads<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.660> also<00:00:51.809> make<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> foam<00:00:53.070> case

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
leads to and we also make a foam case

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.770 
leads to and we also make a foam case
for<00:00:53.700> the<00:00:53.790> battery<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.390> stick<00:00:54.630> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
for the battery you just stick the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.479 
for the battery you just stick the
battery<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.230> there<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.559> then<00:00:55.680> plop<00:00:56.040> it<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
battery in there and then plop it in the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.950 
battery in there and then plop it in the
foam<00:00:56.670> case<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> size<00:00:57.540> of<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.780> original

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
foam case is the size of the original

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.830 
foam case is the size of the original
battery<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.910> I'm<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.360> to<00:01:00.420> give<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.629> demo

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
battery so I'm going to give you a demo

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
battery so I'm going to give you a demo
of<00:01:00.930> how<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.200> four<00:01:01.469> cell<00:01:01.710> turns<00:01:01.950> over<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.430> WR

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
of how the four cell turns over that WR

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.499 
of how the four cell turns over that WR
and<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.899> would<00:01:04.049> go<00:01:04.170> for<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> EXC<00:01:05.369> KTM<00:01:06.060> models

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
and this would go for the EXC KTM models

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.000 
and this would go for the EXC KTM models
and<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.990> KTM<00:01:07.970> sxfs

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
and the KTM sxfs

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:17.010 
and the KTM sxfs
so<00:01:11.010> here's<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.490> demo<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.850> how<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> turns<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.360> over

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.899 

so<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:18.079> can<00:01:18.229> see<00:01:18.469> it<00:01:18.710> just<00:01:19.039> really<00:01:19.369> turns<00:01:19.670> over

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
so you can see it just really turns over

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.230 
so you can see it just really turns over
the<00:01:20.409> 450s<00:01:21.409> really<00:01:21.710> well<00:01:21.920> I'm<00:01:22.909> one<00:01:23.090> of<00:01:23.180> my

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
the 450s really well I'm one of my

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.020 
the 450s really well I'm one of my
earlier<00:01:23.509> demos<00:01:23.869> I<00:01:24.049> did<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.469> sxv<00:01:25.220> 550<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:25.939> it

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
earlier demos I did the sxv 550 and it

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.910 
earlier demos I did the sxv 550 and it
turns<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:26.360> over<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.600> little<00:01:26.810> slower<00:01:27.110> still<00:01:27.649> fast

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
turns it over a little slower still fast

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.499 
turns it over a little slower still fast
enough<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:28.310> turn<00:01:28.460> over<00:01:28.579> the<00:01:28.729> 550<00:01:29.329> and<00:01:29.450> a

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
enough to turn over the 550 and a

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.169 
enough to turn over the 550 and a
powerful<00:01:30.020> turn<00:01:30.350> over<00:01:30.649> but<00:01:31.070> on<00:01:31.189> the<00:01:31.310> 450s<00:01:31.909> it

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
powerful turn over but on the 450s it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.600 
powerful turn over but on the 450s it
really<00:01:32.539> cranks<00:01:33.140> these<00:01:33.259> things<00:01:33.500> over<00:01:33.799> good<00:01:33.979> so

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
really cranks these things over good so

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.039 
really cranks these things over good so
again<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.970> once<00:01:41.210> again<00:01:41.360> this<00:01:41.630> battery<00:01:41.990> is

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
again so once again this battery is

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.160 
again so once again this battery is
probably<00:01:42.470> about<00:01:43.030> three<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.240> four<00:01:44.479> pounds<00:01:44.720> less

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
probably about three to four pounds less

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.309 
probably about three to four pounds less
than<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.530> stock<00:01:46.100> wor<00:01:46.700> battery<00:01:47.060> but<00:01:47.810> it's<00:01:48.020> no

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
than the stock wor battery but it's no

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.919 
than the stock wor battery but it's no
maintenance<00:01:48.560> no<00:01:49.159> trickle<00:01:49.880> charging<00:01:50.179> stick<00:01:50.810> it

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
maintenance no trickle charging stick it

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.749 
maintenance no trickle charging stick it
in<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.289> go<00:01:51.439> and<00:01:51.770> these<00:01:51.920> things<00:01:52.159> last<00:01:52.429> for<00:01:52.729> a

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
in and go and these things last for a

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.279 
in and go and these things last for a
real<00:01:53.000> long<00:01:53.209> time<00:01:53.240> probably<00:01:53.689> four<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.110> five

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
real long time probably four to five

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.039 
real long time probably four to five
years<00:01:54.619> so<00:01:54.880> if<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:56.030> have<00:01:56.209> an<00:01:56.390> electric<00:01:56.810> start

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
years so if you have an electric start

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.350 
years so if you have an electric start
enduro<00:01:57.349> or<00:01:57.679> an<00:01:58.189> electric<00:01:58.459> start<00:01:58.670> MX<00:01:58.909> bike<00:01:59.149> like

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
enduro or an electric start MX bike like

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.570 
enduro or an electric start MX bike like
the<00:01:59.509> SX<00:01:59.840> F<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.039> a<00:02:01.069> way<00:02:01.189> it's<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.399> really

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
the SX F so in a way it's a really

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.630 
the SX F so in a way it's a really
powerful<00:02:01.789> start<00:02:02.299> a<00:02:02.990> great<00:02:03.920> battery<00:02:04.280> for<00:02:04.459> doing

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
powerful start a great battery for doing
