00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:32.059
 I come from a dyda study 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:34.500
 philosophical or in-depth 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.519
 particularly the philosophy we say 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.159
 esoteric to say it in very terms 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:44.480
 general and I specialized in 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:47.280
 particular in numerology e 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.670
 in the tree of life in the cabal 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.460
 in this area which in my opinion is 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.370
 really important to disclose in this 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.840
 moment in particular in this 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.579
 historical moment because something that 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.080
 illuminates our path of 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.850
 knowledge 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.250
 I firmly believe that ours 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:15.479
 salvation and salvation depends on 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:19.259
 ability to know a little about 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.149
 agnostic philosophy then knowledge 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.390
 the greater the degree of knowledge 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:27.149
 the greater our evolutionary capacity 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.899
 the greater our possibility of 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.179
 salvation 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:35.099
 what is the discovery I made 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:39.830
 through numerology to the tree 

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:44.670
 of life is precisely that of one's 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:47.369
 knowledge of myself and humanity 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.930
 of the man of every single person of a 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.560
 profound knowledge that 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.900
 no other esoteric or other chance 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.240
 by so profoundly for example 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.000
 personality aspects more than the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.550
 destiny all those speeches there ours 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.810
 destiny is a consequence of our del 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.000
 our living 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:19.060
 we must be able to understand what is the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.010
 our journey which is ours 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.700
 personalities such as our talents 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:29.420
 what are in which our soul 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.070
 to be able to make the most of what is 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.500
 possible 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:38.510
 given the conditions in which we are 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:41.330
 so what gives me what I'm looking for 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.180
 give to the students in the costs of 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.540
 technology and this capacity 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.330
 introspective so to speak this 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.030
 ability to know yourself for 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.459
 make the best to live better 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.459
 to make the most of one's life 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.470
 we have intimate desires a soul 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.459
 with arrangements with the 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:19.360
 numerology cravings i am numerologist and 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.610
 there are some soul numbers of their own 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.390
 which is ours within us 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:32.260
 prepare our view of 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:35.130
 world that is often obscured by the dai 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:40.170
 social and family cultural conditions 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:44.590
 from life for which we also grow well 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:48.700
 with a certain type of personality of 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:52.540
 talents that may not be 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.300
 compatible with our soul 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:01.890
 and then the illumination, that is, as 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:05.640
 make our life satisfying e 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:10.260
 recovering that number of the soul I would say 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:13.230
 that one wants that vision 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.400
 of existence that is proper to us 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:22.240
 through tools that depend 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:26.860
 from the age of the person to the conflict that 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.620
 there may be and from various to various things that 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.100
 for example in my work I call 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.320
 counseling for my work 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.390
 numerological then the critical points that 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.810
 let's find out about this 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.690
 conflict that is very important because 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.780
 in fact almost all conflicts 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.410
 psychological depend on this desire 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:55.020
 be something and be another being 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:57.520
 also good but there is something 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.690
 innate something that belongs to ours 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:04.200
 birth that must be recovered in the 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.200
 our life 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.000
 yes I believe in reincarnation 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.460
 we say that I am also of culture 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:28.970
 Christian and early Christians believed 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:32.120
 in reincarnation the memory of the 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:36.100
 screw the taste of this I have no 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:39.770
 idea why they don't remember but 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.820
 probably because we give you 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.430
 the life 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.230
 we live life and we must 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:48.920
 recover we have to live better 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:51.860
 this life and where we have some 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:54.980
 criticality to identify if these 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.830
 critical issues may arise from karma e 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.280
 then intervene appropriately on 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.280
 those
