00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.190
 with youtube it was decided today I bring you 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.630
 a small video tutorial of how 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.880
 change in the way of yours and with 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.019
 that your good iphone the first thing that 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.019
 you have to do is go to Syria 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.040
 well once it's loaded we 're going to 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.450
 handle the famous sources we are going to 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.530
 Edit 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.530
 let's add 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.960
 he was a friend are two eggs can we 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.170
 add source but I like I already have it 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.690
 can cancel and I want to put is more 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.210
 to work in the description of the group 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.240
 and this name by searching for itself 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.520
 you see it well 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.700
 well here is we give the one that has 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.100
 as a box and here I should 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.380
 appear to install and I as I already have 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.000
 appears to modify from jsa and after 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.000
 confirm installing 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.910
 then we will see no icon of 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.809
 more than what you will have to do is 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.809
 leave settings 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.710
 well 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.570
 now we wait for him to load 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.030
 OK 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.790
 Now someone should appear to you 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.030
 well, we go down and go here to this 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:26.790
 section of the applications you downloaded 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.790
 Syria or the most expensive initiative 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.899
 the first would choose the form of credit 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.289
 of your icon for example if I 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.210
 I want this form because I give it here and 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.970
 then now in the icon I release myself to 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.430
 appear that way 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.180
 I do not know what happened 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.180
 so 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 is that you have to give a soul holder to 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.360
 to be updated 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.080
 ok it's already 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.170
 and if and in the middle of the screen 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.030
 you can choose this for example this 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.570
 circle before that oscar gave an icon 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.190
 For me to appear is worth for what 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.190
 what we have to do is go down here 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.170
 default box and I want the circle as 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.350
 left that but to prove I'll put the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.660
 skull more than we said and there was 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.140
 what would google for example 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.670
 and we will appear this creek good crime 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.800
 I hope this has been useful for you 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.570
 small video tutorial you know 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.940
 Any doubt do not put it in the 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.550
 comments I will try to solve it and in 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.740
 the next video I will show you how to do 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.140
 that rotate the icons when we change from 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.140
