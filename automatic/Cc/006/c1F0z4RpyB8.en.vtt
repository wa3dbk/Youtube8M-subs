00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.879
 no doubt the volkswagen scirocco has a 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.099
 very different design from the rest of the range 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.870
 volkswagen highlights its aggressive sack a 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.330
 pretty corner ceiling plus for style 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.469
 18-inch coupe wheels and some 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.690
 very tall hips that give you a 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.070
 really muscular look he bolt 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.750
 several and then chili arrives with two 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.150
 motorizations the first is an engine 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.130
 1.4 liter turbo 160 horsepower 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.109
 force able to accelerate atrocious that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.150
 us for now in just 8 seconds 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.830
 this engine promises to yield 12 that managed 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.599
 lose density and 18 kilometers by 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.759
 liter in wallet but the version that 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.399
 we are testing is a 2.0- liter engine 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.020
 211 horsepower turbo capable of 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.969
 accelerate to 13 kilometers per hour in 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.790
 only 6 with the second this model 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.379
 promises to yield 98 kilometers in town and 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.379
 16 I believe the danger on the road 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.770
 we just entered the volwagen if then 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 we notice the sporty character that this 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.520
 car has especially so difficult 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.580
 which is to enter it and for the position 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.650
 of driving really low the steering wheel is 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.600
 adjustable in height and depth and 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.550
 has very good grip very nice to the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.840
 touch plus the bottom is 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.600
 totally flat what gives a 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.369
 more sporty character the seats are 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.780
 quite euros but they are still very 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.970
 comfortable they also have very good 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.619
 side selection in this version 2.0 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.500
 also they include leather and 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.960
 Lumbar adjustment 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.040
 the materials in the cabin are pretty 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.780
 good are very pleasant to the touch 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.060
 especially in this sector of 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.580
 central armrest and armrest 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.680
 the doors the only drawback is 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.110
 that the design already looks a bit old-fashioned 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.060
 just like the design of the board 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.410
 instruments unfortunately the goal goes 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.420
 seriously with does not have much room to 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.760
 be able to carry things for example not 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.380
 I have no glasses holder in the text as 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.640
 most of the cars plus the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.229
 compartment under the radio is 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.060
 totally unusable I can only 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.920
 save a couple of coins there as well 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.899
 that under the central armrest where 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.270
 only few coins and I have space 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.320
 for my cell phone nothing else if I want 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.880
 save any other object 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.860
 I'll just have to leave it in the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.300
 front coasters in terms of 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.710
 security everything the country and then 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.899
 they include six control airbags 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.550
 stability and fatigue detector in addition 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.960
 to follow all models include 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.789
 bluetooth radios dual climate control 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.030
 access that he is with power button 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.670
 rain sensors and cruise control in 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.980
 this version 2.0 also adds seats 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.050
 heated leather bi-xenon headlights 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.070
 and panoramic roof which is not going to 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.070
 open and you can only lift 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.030
 no no 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.910
 and I feel natural administration of the country 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.879
 and what happened while driving down a road 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.819
 with a lot of curve where the suspension rules 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.980
 it helps us to really keep 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.560
 stable and favors this type of 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.930
 driving the address is pretty 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.780
 precise and the exchange box a box of 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.610
 six speed dsg changes meets 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.500
 very well its function in these 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.920
 circumstances really plays 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.069
 well no doubt I've been thinking 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.170
 to handle on these types of routes and it's 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.170
 really entertaining to handle it like this 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.030
 the suspension is a bit more rigid what 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.950
 that we would like for a handling in 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.690
 bumps and imperfections are 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.610
 transmit to the cabin but in 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.110
 no moment becomes uncomfortable in 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.209
 this circumstance the address is 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.220
 pretty soft and nice while 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.560
 the dsg gearbox passes the changes 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.269
 without us even noticing them such as 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.069
 to wait is to go crazy feels very 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.629
 plumbed on the road we can reach 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.519
 high speeds without even noticing 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.470
 all this thanks to I think it is very 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.269
 well and sound without doubt the great 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.280
 problem is the visibility is behind already 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.410
 is very limited we have a coin 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.060
 very girl with two rear headrests 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.530
 that they were not half the little space 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.269
 what we have if this were not enough 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.109
 we have central mirrors that 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.109
 really boy 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.239
 let's see what to give are the seats 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.239
 rear of the volkswagen scirocco 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.310
 As you can see it is quite difficult 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.870
 enter here after this seat I think that 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.700
 in my management position and Dali suffer 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.050
 of you have so much leg space more 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.460
 of what the great 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.840
 problem is the action this fact 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.940
 because I do not have in space I'm 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.070
 touching the chest I'm sorry here you are 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.560
 quite comfortable but if not for the 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.260
 panoramic roof to almost to very dark and 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.180
 It would be pataz and claustrophobic without climbing 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.260
 to feel crazy was difficult to imagine 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.260
 how is it to get off of him 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.430
 if you are interested in occupying the squares 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.810
 back I recommend you people 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.990
 five doors that should carry soon 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.450
 chile however if you want a poster 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.130
 sports coupe style and make it comfortable 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.810
 to maintain the city and also the bed 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.010
 of all looks I feel is 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.010
 return a trick for you
