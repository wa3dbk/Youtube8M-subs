fun it multiplies it like a good
awakening<00:04:14.909> should<00:04:15.150> so<00:04:15.810> all<00:04:16.139> in<00:04:16.320> all<00:04:16.440> he<00:04:16.799> has<00:04:16.919> a

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
awakening should so all in all he has a

00:04:16.949 --> 00:05:49.330 
awakening should so all in all he has a
good<00:04:17.190> move<00:04:17.430> set

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.170 

I<00:05:49.630> had<00:05:50.630> no<00:05:50.900> expectation<00:05:51.860> for<00:05:52.010> her<00:05:52.160> attacks<00:05:52.550> and

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
I had no expectation for her attacks and

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.300 
I had no expectation for her attacks and
there<00:05:53.330> at<00:05:53.419> that<00:05:53.570> interesting<00:05:53.840> either<00:05:54.199> but<00:05:54.980> she

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
there at that interesting either but she

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.640 
there at that interesting either but she
never<00:05:55.490> fought<00:05:55.790> anyone<00:05:56.030> so<00:05:56.600> I<00:05:56.900> guess<00:05:57.350> she<00:05:57.530> can

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
never fought anyone so I guess she can

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.939 
never fought anyone so I guess she can
pass<00:05:58.419> so<00:05:59.419> let's<00:05:59.690> talk<00:05:59.960> about<00:06:00.290> her<00:06:00.530> ultimate

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
pass so let's talk about her ultimate

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.430 
pass so let's talk about her ultimate
when<00:06:01.639> used<00:06:01.880> on<00:06:02.030> anyone<00:06:02.419> who<00:06:02.570> is<00:06:02.720> in<00:06:02.870> Sasuke

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
when used on anyone who is in Sasuke

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.129 
when used on anyone who is in Sasuke
it's<00:06:03.770> decent<00:06:04.280> when<00:06:05.060> she<00:06:05.240> uses<00:06:05.389> on<00:06:05.750> Sasuke

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
it's decent when she uses on Sasuke

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.950 
it's decent when she uses on Sasuke
though<00:06:06.610> she<00:06:07.610> creeps<00:06:07.940> me<00:06:08.150> the<00:06:08.300> hell<00:06:08.479> out<00:06:08.660> I

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.240 
swear when making her character they
captured<00:06:11.600> a<00:06:11.690> wild<00:06:12.050> Sasuke<00:06:12.560> fangirl<00:06:13.100> and

is<00:06:17.090> a<00:06:17.120> nice<00:06:17.479> detail<00:06:17.780> for<00:06:18.199> her<00:06:18.350> to<00:06:18.500> have<00:06:18.680> but<00:06:19.370> it

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
is a nice detail for her to have but it

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.250 
is a nice detail for her to have but it
makes<00:06:19.669> you<00:06:19.790> wonder<00:06:19.820> why<00:06:20.300> he<00:06:20.330> gnihton<00:06:20.870> doesn't
