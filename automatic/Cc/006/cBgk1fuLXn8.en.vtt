here we go

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.240 
here we go
I<00:00:18.090> think<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.529> background<00:00:19.980> you'll

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
I think that in the background you'll

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.519 
I think that in the background you'll
see<00:00:20.279> we<00:00:20.730> are<00:00:20.850> going<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.330> not<00:00:21.539> only<00:00:21.750> see<00:00:22.080> Barbara

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
see we are going to not only see Barbara

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.130 
see we are going to not only see Barbara
Gordon<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.220> Jason<00:00:23.609> Todd<00:00:23.820> beat<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> dynamic

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
Gordon and Jason Todd beat a dynamic

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140 
Gordon and Jason Todd beat a dynamic
kind<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.500> duo<00:00:25.710> but<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.460> think<00:00:26.699> we're<00:00:26.820> gonna<00:00:26.939> see

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
kind of duo but I think we're gonna see

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.300 
kind of duo but I think we're gonna see
Barbara<00:00:27.570> Gordon<00:00:27.869> get<00:00:28.050> actually<00:00:28.619> paralyzed

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
Barbara Gordon get actually paralyzed

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.120 
Barbara Gordon get actually paralyzed
and<00:00:29.699> then<00:00:30.060> Jason<00:00:30.960> Todd<00:00:31.170> get<00:00:31.470> captured<00:00:31.740> or

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
and then Jason Todd get captured or

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.229 
and then Jason Todd get captured or
other<00:00:32.520> way<00:00:32.730> around

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
other way around

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.799 
other way around
you<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.320> saw<00:00:34.559> Jason<00:00:35.190> Todd<00:00:35.370> get<00:00:35.809> somewhat

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
you know we saw Jason Todd get somewhat

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.030 
you know we saw Jason Todd get somewhat
tortured<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.309> game<00:00:39.020> original<00:00:40.020> story<00:00:40.379> and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
tortured in the game original story and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040 
tortured in the game original story and
we<00:00:41.280> also<00:00:41.430> saw<00:00:41.700> Barbara<00:00:42.000> Gordon<00:00:42.300> get<00:00:42.480> paralyzed

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
we also saw Barbara Gordon get paralyzed

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.330 
we also saw Barbara Gordon get paralyzed
but<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.350> think<00:00:43.530> we're<00:00:43.649> gonna<00:00:43.770> see<00:00:44.010> both<00:00:44.280> of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
but I think we're gonna see both of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.660 
but I think we're gonna see both of
those<00:00:44.610> through<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.660> kind<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.469> point<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.430> view

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
those through the kind of point of view

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.760 
those through the kind of point of view
of<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.300> characters<00:00:48.809> themselves<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.530> think

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
of the characters themselves so I think

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.500 
of the characters themselves so I think
we're<00:00:50.100> gonna<00:00:50.219> see<00:00:50.460> Jason<00:00:50.969> Todd<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.329> captured

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
we're gonna see Jason Todd get captured

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.479 
we're gonna see Jason Todd get captured
through<00:00:52.050> his<00:00:52.230> point<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.530> view<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.860> then<00:00:53.370> we're

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
through his point of view and then we're

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.069 
through his point of view and then we're
gonna<00:00:53.579> see<00:00:53.789> Barbara<00:00:54.090> Gordon<00:00:54.390> get<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.960> know

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
gonna see Barbara Gordon get you know

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.200 
gonna see Barbara Gordon get you know
shot<00:00:55.410> through<00:00:55.739> her<00:00:55.949> point<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.340> view<00:00:56.550> because

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
shot through her point of view because

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.760 
shot through her point of view because
you<00:00:57.510> know<00:00:57.600> Batman<00:00:57.989> wasn't<00:00:58.320> there<00:00:58.440> for<00:00:58.559> any<00:00:58.739> of

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you know Batman wasn't there for any of

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.279 
you know Batman wasn't there for any of
those<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.550> think<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.329> Jason<00:01:00.570> Todd<00:01:00.989> is

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
those so I think that Jason Todd is

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.930 
those so I think that Jason Todd is
going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.219> one<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.520> gets<00:01:02.609> captured

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
going to be the one that gets captured

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.350 
going to be the one that gets captured
first<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:05.040> know<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.430> think<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.180> it's

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
first and you know I think that it's

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.320 
first and you know I think that it's
going<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.840> really<00:01:07.080> really<00:01:07.439> sad<00:01:08.189> because<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
going to be really really sad because a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.850 
going to be really really sad because a
lot<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.630> people<00:01:09.780> are<00:01:09.960> saying<00:01:10.170> oh<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
lot of people are saying oh that the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.850 
lot of people are saying oh that the
Robin<00:01:11.250> for<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.880> Batgirl<00:01:12.330> DLC<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.710> know

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
Robin for the Batgirl DLC is you know

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.219 
Robin for the Batgirl DLC is you know
it's<00:01:14.369> Dick<00:01:14.729> Grayson<00:01:15.210> yeah<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> don't<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.170> don't

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
it's Dick Grayson yeah I don't I don't

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.990 
it's Dick Grayson yeah I don't I don't
think<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.670> be

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
think it is I think it's going to be

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.630 
think it is I think it's going to be
Jason<00:01:18.960> Todd<00:01:19.200> because<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.920> know<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.430> says

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
Jason Todd because you know if it says

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.359 
Jason Todd because you know if it says
takes<00:01:21.000> place<00:01:21.299> before<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.290> events<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:23.040> Arkham

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
takes place before the events of Arkham

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:23.840 
takes place before the events of Arkham
Asylum

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
Asylum

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.580 
Asylum
it's<00:01:24.450> probably<00:01:24.720> gonna<00:01:24.840> take<00:01:24.900> place<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.380> two

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
it's probably gonna take place like two

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.010 
it's probably gonna take place like two
years<00:01:25.830> before<00:01:26.009> Arkham<00:01:26.430> Asylum

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
years before Arkham Asylum

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.810 
years before Arkham Asylum
that<00:01:28.020> means<00:01:28.259> Jason<00:01:28.710> Todd<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.130> probably<00:01:29.460> still

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
that means Jason Todd is probably still

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240 
that means Jason Todd is probably still
