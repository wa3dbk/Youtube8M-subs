00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
first I'm not really sure it doesn't

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.560 
first I'm not really sure it doesn't

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and I get to deal with this today so the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.240 
and I get to deal with this today so the
engine<00:00:37.230> mount<00:00:37.380> was<00:00:37.500> replaced<00:00:37.829> about<00:00:37.980> two

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
engine mount was replaced about two

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.220 
engine mount was replaced about two
years<00:00:38.430> ago<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.300> will<00:00:39.480> be<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> first<00:00:39.840> engine

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
years ago this will be the first engine

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.860 
years ago this will be the first engine
mount<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.559> I've<00:00:40.649> had<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.399> far<00:00:41.870> I've

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
mount that I've had to do so far I've

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.299 
mount that I've had to do so far I've
done<00:00:43.200> upper<00:00:43.530> ones<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:43.890> I've<00:00:43.950> never<00:00:44.070> done

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
done upper ones but I've never done

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.709 
done upper ones but I've never done
these<00:00:44.460> lower<00:00:44.670> ones<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.329> going<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.629> be

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
these lower ones so this is going to be

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.200 
these lower ones so this is going to be
interesting<00:00:46.460> what<00:00:47.460> we're<00:00:47.610> looking<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:48.000> down

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
interesting what we're looking at down

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.430 
interesting what we're looking at down
here<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.750> don't<00:00:48.809> know<00:00:48.989> how<00:00:49.140> well<00:00:49.320> this

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
here and I don't know how well this

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.930 
here and I don't know how well this
camera's<00:00:49.829> picking<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.219> behind<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.700> wire

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
camera's picking up behind that wire

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.549 
camera's picking up behind that wire
harness<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.420> see<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.809> clip<00:00:52.079> right<00:00:52.410> in

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
harness you see with that clip right in

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.819 
harness you see with that clip right in
the<00:00:52.649> middle<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.910> mount<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.840> down<00:00:55.350> inside

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the middle is the mount and down inside

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.110 
the middle is the mount and down inside
there<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:57.210> actually<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.350> rubber<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.949> that

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
there is actually the rubber and that

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.810 
there is actually the rubber and that
mount<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.329> completely<00:01:01.020> shot<00:01:01.370> this<00:01:02.370> did<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
mount is completely shot this did have a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.310 
mount is completely shot this did have a
coolant<00:01:03.149> leak<00:01:03.210> from<00:01:03.570> when<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.750> head<00:01:03.899> gasket

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
coolant leak from when the head gasket

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.500 
coolant leak from when the head gasket
went<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.710> believe<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.640> happened<00:01:06.030> was<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
went I believe what happened was is the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.960 
went I believe what happened was is the
coolant<00:01:06.900> got<00:01:07.350> into<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.920> rubber<00:01:08.159> bushing<00:01:08.760> on

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
coolant got into the rubber bushing on

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.030 
coolant got into the rubber bushing on
the<00:01:09.180> actual<00:01:09.479> engine<00:01:09.750> mount<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.170> actually

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the actual engine mount and actually

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.200 
the actual engine mount and actually
caused<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.939> decay<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:14.030> disintegrate<00:01:15.030> per

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
caused it to decay and disintegrate per

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.109 
caused it to decay and disintegrate per
se<00:01:15.420> which<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.810> causing<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> engine<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:17.119> create

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
se which is causing the engine to create

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.580 
se which is causing the engine to create
a<00:01:18.150> lot<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.420> vibration<00:01:18.960> through<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> body<00:01:19.470> of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
a lot of vibration through the body of

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.260 
a lot of vibration through the body of
the<00:01:19.770> car<00:01:20.009> now<00:01:20.189> because<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> bushing<00:01:21.090> being

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the car now because of the bushing being

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.530 
the car now because of the bushing being
bad<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.600> there<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.369> as<00:01:23.369> my<00:01:23.580> brother's<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.180> you

bad in there and as my brother's can you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.940 
bad in there and as my brother's can you

a how-to video this is actually not a
terrible<00:01:34.590> lot<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.460> work<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.030> enough

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
terrible lot of work but it is enough

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.240 
terrible lot of work but it is enough

work that you know it's gonna require

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.539 
work that you know it's gonna require
two<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.759> us<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.619> we<00:01:40.619> want<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.890> kind<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.220> you

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
two of us and we want to kind of be you

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.830 
two of us and we want to kind of be you
know<00:01:41.670> cautious<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.299> what<00:01:42.360> we're<00:01:42.570> doing<00:01:42.750> this

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
know cautious of what we're doing this

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.660 
know cautious of what we're doing this
is<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.049> dangerous<00:01:43.430> we're<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> be

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
is really dangerous we're going to be

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.580 
is really dangerous we're going to be
actually<00:01:45.000> lifting<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> engine<00:01:45.869> up<00:01:46.020> off<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
actually lifting the engine up off the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.399 
actually lifting the engine up off the
actual<00:01:46.979> subframe<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:48.360> remove<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.960> mount<00:01:49.200> so

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
actual subframe to remove this mount so

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.780 
actual subframe to remove this mount so
this<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.710> something<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.310> kind<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.640> have

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
this is something that we kind of have

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.330 
this is something that we kind of have
to<00:01:50.970> keep<00:01:51.119> our<00:01:51.360> awareness<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.860> heightened<00:01:53.310> level

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
to keep our awareness a heightened level

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.920 
to keep our awareness a heightened level
of<00:01:53.640> awareness<00:01:53.790> while<00:01:54.270> we're<00:01:54.450> doing<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.780> so

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
of awareness while we're doing this so

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.929 
of awareness while we're doing this so
we<00:01:55.020> don't<00:01:55.110> crush<00:01:55.860> ourselves<00:01:56.369> with<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> engine

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
we don't crush ourselves with the engine

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.749 
we don't crush ourselves with the engine
or<00:01:57.090> cause<00:01:57.240> any<00:01:57.270> kind<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.780> damage<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.380> car

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
or cause any kind of damage to the car

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.800 
or cause any kind of damage to the car
so<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.909> said<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.180> don't<00:02:00.360> know<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.659> is

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
so like I said I don't know if this is

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.450 
so like I said I don't know if this is
necessarily<00:02:01.350> going<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.649> be<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.829> how-to<00:02:02.070> video

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
necessarily going to be a how-to video

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.870 
necessarily going to be a how-to video
but<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.149> will<00:02:03.899> put<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.860> few<00:02:04.920> clips<00:02:05.310> together<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
but I will put a few clips together and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.809 
but I will put a few clips together and
show<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.360> different<00:02:07.129> steps<00:02:08.129> as<00:02:08.520> well<00:02:08.700> as

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
show you the different steps as well as

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.180 
show you the different steps as well as
the<00:02:08.970> progress<00:02:09.209> as<00:02:09.720> far<00:02:10.110> as<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.770> know<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:10.890> long

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
the progress as far as you know as long

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.850 
the progress as far as you know as long
as<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.610> are<00:02:11.790> going<00:02:11.910> along<00:02:12.090> out

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
as we are going along out

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.040 
as we are going along out
updated<00:02:13.220> on<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.400> progress<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:13.850> but<00:02:14.810> anyway

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
updated on the progress so but anyway

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.270 
updated on the progress so but anyway
this<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.320> a<00:02:15.350> three<00:02:15.620> point<00:02:15.830> one<00:02:15.980> like<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.190> said

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
this is a three point one like I said

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.040 
this is a three point one like I said
this<00:02:16.490> is<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.670> 1990<00:02:17.270> Pontiac<00:02:17.600> Grand<00:02:17.630> Prix

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
this is a 1990 Pontiac Grand Prix

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.110 
this is a 1990 Pontiac Grand Prix
there's<00:02:19.010> not<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.190> whole<00:02:19.400> lot<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.610> movement<00:02:19.880> the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
there's not a whole lot of movement the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.700 
there's not a whole lot of movement the
engine<00:02:20.420> but<00:02:20.600> if<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.840> put<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.050> crowbar<00:02:21.470> down

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
engine but if you put a crowbar down

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.680 
engine but if you put a crowbar down
underneath<00:02:22.070> there<00:02:22.430> when<00:02:23.330> you're<00:02:23.450> under<00:02:23.600> the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
underneath there when you're under the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.030 
underneath there when you're under the
car<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:23.990> you<00:02:24.050> kind<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.290> pry<00:02:24.500> up<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.710> down<00:02:24.890> you

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
car and you kind of pry up and down you

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.650 
car and you kind of pry up and down you
can<00:02:25.070> fill<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.490> engine<00:02:25.610> lifts<00:02:26.030> up<00:02:26.150> quite<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.420> bit

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
can fill the engine lifts up quite a bit

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.870 
can fill the engine lifts up quite a bit
more<00:02:27.500> than<00:02:27.710> what<00:02:27.860> I'm<00:02:27.980> comfortable<00:02:28.250> with<00:02:28.490> and

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
more than what I'm comfortable with and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.190 
more than what I'm comfortable with and
like<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.480> said<00:02:29.540> there's<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.870> lot<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.080> vibration

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
like I said there's a lot of vibration

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.310 
like I said there's a lot of vibration
you<00:02:31.190> can<00:02:31.370> feel<00:02:31.610> inside<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.540> passenger

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
you can feel inside the passenger

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.560 
you can feel inside the passenger
compartment<00:02:33.620> when<00:02:34.250> it's<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.670> any<00:02:35.210> type<00:02:35.540> of

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
compartment when it's in any type of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.890 
compartment when it's in any type of
driving<00:02:36.080> gear<00:02:36.260> such<00:02:36.590> as<00:02:36.620> drive<00:02:37.040> or<00:02:37.280> reverse

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
driving gear such as drive or reverse

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.480 
driving gear such as drive or reverse
the<00:02:38.900> car<00:02:39.260> literally<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:39.980> can<00:02:40.130> just<00:02:40.310> feel<00:02:40.459> it

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
the car literally you can just feel it

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.280 
the car literally you can just feel it
even<00:02:40.790> in<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:40.940> brake<00:02:41.120> pedal<00:02:41.330> like<00:02:41.630> this<00:02:41.810> this

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
even in a brake pedal like this this

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.760 
even in a brake pedal like this this
hardcore<00:02:43.250> like<00:02:44.060> metal-on-metal<00:02:44.810> vibration

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
hardcore like metal-on-metal vibration

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.199 
hardcore like metal-on-metal vibration
it<00:02:45.890> feels<00:02:46.130> like<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.459> pulsating<00:02:47.000> through<00:02:47.030> the

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
it feels like it's pulsating through the

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.690 
it feels like it's pulsating through the
frame<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.660> vehicle<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:48.370> what<00:02:49.370> this<00:02:49.550> is

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
frame of the vehicle so what this is

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.820 
frame of the vehicle so what this is
going<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:49.970> do<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.420> hopefully<00:02:51.200> eliminate<00:02:51.650> that

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
going to do is hopefully eliminate that

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.640 
going to do is hopefully eliminate that
once<00:02:52.280> we<00:02:52.400> replace<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:52.730> lower<00:02:53.060> mount

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
once we replace that lower mount

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.840 
once we replace that lower mount
basically<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.770> process<00:02:55.220> with<00:02:55.370> this<00:02:55.520> is<00:02:55.730> we

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
basically the process with this is we

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.780 
basically the process with this is we
have<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:56.000> jack<00:02:56.300> here<00:02:56.570> that<00:02:56.780> we're<00:02:56.900> going<00:02:57.050> to

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
have a jack here that we're going to

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.850 
have a jack here that we're going to
place<00:02:58.790> underneath<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.540> oil<00:02:59.870> pan<00:03:00.620> in<00:03:00.800> the

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
place underneath the oil pan in the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.170 
place underneath the oil pan in the
transmission<00:03:01.459> pan<00:03:01.640> we're<00:03:01.760> going<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:01.940> run<00:03:02.150> a

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
transmission pan we're going to run a

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.910 
transmission pan we're going to run a
board<00:03:02.450> across<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.870> two<00:03:03.050> over<00:03:03.590> towards<00:03:03.890> the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
board across the two over towards the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.110 
board across the two over towards the
passenger<00:03:04.400> side<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.700> engine<00:03:04.850> because

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
passenger side of the engine because

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.400 
passenger side of the engine because
that's<00:03:05.270> where<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.510> mount<00:03:05.720> actually<00:03:06.110> is<00:03:06.230> and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
that's where the mount actually is and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.670 
that's where the mount actually is and
we're<00:03:06.610> majority<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.700> weight<00:03:07.850> sets<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.680> we're

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
we're majority the weight sets and we're

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.170 
we're majority the weight sets and we're
going<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:09.980> loosen<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.430> bottom<00:03:10.580> bolts<00:03:11.030> in<00:03:11.120> the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
going to loosen the bottom bolts in the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.070 
going to loosen the bottom bolts in the
mount<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:11.480> then<00:03:11.540> we're<00:03:11.690> going<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.840> go<00:03:11.989> ahead

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
mount and then we're going to go ahead

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.500 
mount and then we're going to go ahead
and<00:03:12.380> jack<00:03:12.980> up<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.280> engine<00:03:13.550> very<00:03:13.880> cautiously

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
and jack up the engine very cautiously

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.780 
and jack up the engine very cautiously
and<00:03:14.660> very<00:03:14.840> slowly<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:16.010> we<00:03:16.130> can<00:03:16.250> get<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.520> mount

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
and very slowly so we can get that mount

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.630 
and very slowly so we can get that mount
out<00:03:17.209> of<00:03:17.269> its<00:03:17.600> little<00:03:17.780> it's<00:03:18.049> almost<00:03:18.260> like<00:03:18.440> a

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
out of its little it's almost like a

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.120 
out of its little it's almost like a
steel<00:03:19.640> dish<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:21.019> is<00:03:21.170> welded<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.769> side<00:03:21.980> of

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
steel dish that is welded to the side of

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.949 
steel dish that is welded to the side of
the<00:03:22.190> subframe<00:03:22.580> that<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.030> mount<00:03:23.209> sits<00:03:23.570> down<00:03:23.750> in

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
the subframe that the mount sits down in

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.830 
the subframe that the mount sits down in
that<00:03:24.080> little<00:03:24.230> dish<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:26.120> bushing<00:03:26.480> sits<00:03:26.690> in

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
that little dish and the bushing sits in

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.259 
that little dish and the bushing sits in
there<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.140> then<00:03:27.230> there's<00:03:27.410> two<00:03:27.590> bolts<00:03:28.120> they<00:03:29.120> go

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
there and then there's two bolts they go

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.759 
there and then there's two bolts they go
up<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.540> actually<00:03:29.720> secure<00:03:30.290> it<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.620> that

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
up and actually secure it to that

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.170 
up and actually secure it to that
mounting<00:03:31.400> bracket<00:03:31.730> I<00:03:31.790> guess<00:03:31.940> you<00:03:32.090> would

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
mounting bracket I guess you would

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.750 
mounting bracket I guess you would
consider<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.630> so<00:03:33.310> we're<00:03:34.310> going<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.459> go<00:03:34.580> ahead

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
consider it so we're going to go ahead

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.820 
consider it so we're going to go ahead
