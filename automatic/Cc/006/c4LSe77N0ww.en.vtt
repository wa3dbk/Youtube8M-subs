think they're getting into a rhythm of

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.260 
think they're getting into a rhythm of
of<00:01:36.090> going<00:01:36.689> really<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.049> fast<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.270> I

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
of going really really fast and and I

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.090 
of going really really fast and and I
know<00:01:39.570> Kevin<00:01:40.079> wants<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> championship<00:01:40.920> really

the<00:01:47.340> hay<00:01:47.460> bails<00:01:47.640> or<00:01:47.880> unless<00:01:48.420> they<00:01:48.539> don't<00:01:48.750> know

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
and chatter second and third I mean I

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.650 
and chatter second and third I mean I
don't<00:04:16.310> really<00:04:16.400> think<00:04:16.820> it's<00:04:17.090> going<00:04:17.359> to<00:04:17.419> matter

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
don't really think it's going to matter

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.530 
don't really think it's going to matter
what<00:04:18.380> I<00:04:18.410> do<00:04:18.590> because<00:04:19.549> it's<00:04:20.030> ten<00:04:20.329> point

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
what I do because it's ten point

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.540 
what I do because it's ten point
difference<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.109> you<00:04:21.470> know<00:04:21.950> second<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:22.400> third

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
difference and you know second and third

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.510 
difference and you know second and third
is<00:04:22.669> only<00:04:22.790> two<00:04:22.940> points<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:24.080> I<00:04:24.620> mean<00:04:25.370> if

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
is only two points so I mean if

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.130 
is only two points so I mean if
something<00:04:25.729> happens<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.330> where<00:04:26.599> you<00:04:26.840> know<00:04:26.960> one

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140
