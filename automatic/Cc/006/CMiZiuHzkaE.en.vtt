 people saw him and with the difference 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.189
 Spanish championship for our nerdy 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.229

 of relegation but had almost 60 thousand 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.850
 people in the camp also had a detail of 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.680
 command in football, we saw the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.810
 English League sally a competition that 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.119
 more than half a century for the first time 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.030
 time was played with no English 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.820
 manchester city ​​won without a 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.090
 A single Englishman playing has separated us 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.979
 also from that departure from the psg aldo a 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.270
 play is beautiful you will see and 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.410
 lucas is a player of são paulo he 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.660
 The ball takes a look if you see it. 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.780
 this one played for the first time 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.600
 It would be nice to record your reaction. 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.180
 people who say that the ox hitachi snow 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.040
 I did not see much of this much doubt in that 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.810
 theory but I know that the goal was 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.890
 really unique detail that became famous 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.820
 during the month 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.320
 the escape left her leave says to lucas 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.880
 that comes from thrashing 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.670
 in fact it has not been acting like 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.280
 direct holder and step has beyond now 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.000
 a repercussion of this performance of the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.460
 Lucas 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.120
 the l'Equipe is French speaking that he does not 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.710
 have tactical obedience that exaggerates the 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.590
 individualism he will suffer a little 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.360
 with this kind of thing it stops 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.340
 likely to gain a position he thought 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.500
 would have in the next world cup 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.780
 to close we'll talk about tennis 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.060
 an Argentine won the Brazil Open 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.140
 played at the ibirapuera gym in 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.300

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.410
 with intervention in the doubles the title was 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.260
 to the Spanish guillermo garcia lopez and 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.180
