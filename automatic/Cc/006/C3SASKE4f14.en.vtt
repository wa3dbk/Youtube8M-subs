00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
now this aquarium has about ten fish in

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.249 
now this aquarium has about ten fish in
it<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.520> it<00:00:02.820> still<00:00:03.120> looks<00:00:03.149> quite<00:00:03.629> active<00:00:04.080> and

the<00:00:05.339> beauty<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.819> reef<00:00:06.029> aquarium<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.750> that

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
the beauty of a reef aquarium is that

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.570 
the beauty of a reef aquarium is that
the<00:00:07.049> fish<00:00:07.259> are<00:00:07.410> not<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.710> only<00:00:07.830> focus<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.490> the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
the fish are not the only focus of the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.759 
the fish are not the only focus of the
aquarium<00:00:09.030> in<00:00:09.300> general<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.019> corals<00:00:10.410> are

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
aquarium in general the corals are

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.799 
aquarium in general the corals are
advantageous<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.000> water<00:00:12.210> quality<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.660> the

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
advantageous to the water quality of the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.560 
advantageous to the water quality of the
aquarium<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.740> if<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:14.009> can<00:00:14.190> use<00:00:14.219> corals<00:00:14.790> as<00:00:14.969> one

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
aquarium so if we can use corals as one

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.970 
aquarium so if we can use corals as one
of<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.809> main<00:00:15.990> features<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.830> reef

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
of the main features of the reef

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.980 
of the main features of the reef
aquarium<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.880> can<00:00:18.029> maintain<00:00:18.240> better<00:00:18.690> water

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
aquarium we can maintain better water

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.840 
aquarium we can maintain better water
quality<00:00:19.140> without<00:00:19.680> having<00:00:20.189> as<00:00:20.310> many<00:00:20.460> fish

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
quality without having as many fish

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.480 
quality without having as many fish
whereas<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.869> fish<00:00:22.050> only<00:00:22.260> aquarium<00:00:22.890> or<00:00:23.039> in

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
whereas in a fish only aquarium or in

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.130 
whereas in a fish only aquarium or in
aquarium<00:00:24.000> where<00:00:24.119> there's<00:00:24.269> not<00:00:24.420> many<00:00:24.600> corals

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
aquarium where there's not many corals

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.410 
aquarium where there's not many corals
the<00:00:25.619> fish<00:00:25.830> are<00:00:26.010> really<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.430> main<00:00:26.609> focus<00:00:27.000> so

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the fish are really the main focus so

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.300 
the fish are really the main focus so
therefore<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:27.960> need<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> lot<00:00:28.470> more<00:00:28.769> fish<00:00:29.039> much

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
therefore we need a lot more fish much

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.700 
therefore we need a lot more fish much
bigger<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.150> more<00:00:30.300> impressive<00:00:30.630> fish<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.560> make

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
bigger and more impressive fish to make

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.520 
bigger and more impressive fish to make
the<00:00:31.890> aquarium<00:00:32.160> look<00:00:32.550> good<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> large<00:00:34.079> cover

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the aquarium look good so a large cover

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.799 
the aquarium look good so a large cover
of<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.920> lot<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.430> corals<00:00:35.850> will<00:00:36.239> increase<00:00:36.660> your

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
of a lot of corals will increase your

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.650 
of a lot of corals will increase your
water<00:00:37.020> quality<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.879> increase<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.090> focus<00:00:39.329> of

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
water quality and increase the focus of

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.130 
water quality and increase the focus of
the<00:00:40.050> aquarium<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.040> corals<00:00:41.579> themselves

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
the aquarium to the corals themselves

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.869 
the aquarium to the corals themselves
requiring<00:00:43.140> less<00:00:43.469> fish<00:00:43.800> obtaining<00:00:44.730> better

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
requiring less fish obtaining better

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.720 
requiring less fish obtaining better
water<00:00:45.090> quality<00:00:45.530> now<00:00:46.530> apart<00:00:46.920> from<00:00:47.039> selecting

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
water quality now apart from selecting

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.180 
water quality now apart from selecting
your<00:00:48.149> aquarium<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:49.350> also<00:00:49.530> need<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.920> select

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
your aquarium you also need to select

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.380 
your aquarium you also need to select
what<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.789> you're<00:00:50.910> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.120> put<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.360> your

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
what it is you're going to put in your

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.900 
what it is you're going to put in your
aquarium<00:00:51.809> now<00:00:52.199> there's<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.100> three<00:00:53.610> main

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
aquarium now there's really three main

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.569 
aquarium now there's really three main
types<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.840> saltwater<00:00:55.320> aquarium<00:00:55.920> there's<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
types of saltwater aquarium there's a

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.119 
types of saltwater aquarium there's a
saltwater<00:00:56.940> fish<00:00:57.120> only<00:00:57.510> aquarium<00:00:58.109> there's<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
saltwater fish only aquarium there's a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.920 
saltwater fish only aquarium there's a
reef<00:00:59.399> aquarium<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> there's<00:01:00.840> an

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
reef aquarium and there's an

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.260 
reef aquarium and there's an
invertebrate<00:01:01.500> aquarium<00:01:02.270> understanding

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
invertebrate aquarium understanding

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.759 
invertebrate aquarium understanding
which<00:01:03.449> one<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.290> want<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> keep

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
which one it is that you want to keep

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.880 
which one it is that you want to keep
and<00:01:05.070> which<00:01:05.970> equipment<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.689> information<00:01:07.380> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
and which equipment and information you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.920 
and which equipment and information you
need<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.130> keep<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.180> very<00:01:09.390> important

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
need to keep that one is very important

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.170 
need to keep that one is very important
a<00:01:10.110> fish<00:01:10.830> only<00:01:11.040> aquarium<00:01:11.640> means<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.030> there's

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
a fish only aquarium means that there's

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.399 
a fish only aquarium means that there's
nothing<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> aquarium<00:01:12.990> which<00:01:13.260> is

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
nothing in the aquarium which is

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.530 
nothing in the aquarium which is
susceptible<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.979> copper<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.970> therefore<00:01:15.420> it's

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
susceptible to copper so therefore it's

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.120 
susceptible to copper so therefore it's
very<00:01:15.689> easy<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.140> medicate<00:01:16.650> these<00:01:16.830> aquariums

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
very easy to medicate these aquariums

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.039 
very easy to medicate these aquariums
and<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.850> tend<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> run<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.450> salt<00:01:18.720> level<00:01:18.990> a

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
and you tend to run the salt level a

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.260 
and you tend to run the salt level a
little<00:01:19.290> bit<00:01:19.409> lower<00:01:19.650> there's<00:01:20.610> also<00:01:20.820> an

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
little bit lower there's also an

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.969 
little bit lower there's also an
invertebrate<00:01:21.840> aquarium<00:01:22.350> which<00:01:22.740> means

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
invertebrate aquarium which means

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.530 
invertebrate aquarium which means
there's<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:23.369> really<00:01:23.700> many<00:01:24.000> fish<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
there's not really many fish in the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.719 
there's not really many fish in the
aquarium<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.110> whole<00:01:25.560> target<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.580> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
aquarium the whole target of the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.310 
aquarium the whole target of the
aquarium<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> corals<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> little

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
aquarium is the corals and the little

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.050 
aquarium is the corals and the little
and<00:01:28.439> vertebrates<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.790> tend<00:01:30.030> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
and vertebrates in it and you tend to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.520 
and vertebrates in it and you tend to
run<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.600> few<00:01:30.810> fish<00:01:31.049> which<00:01:31.290> keep<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
run just a few fish which keep the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.800 
run just a few fish which keep the
organic<00:01:31.950> load<00:01:32.159> fairly<00:01:32.579> low<00:01:32.790> which<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.630> also

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
organic load fairly low which is also

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.109 
organic load fairly low which is also
quite<00:01:34.110> easy<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.530> maintain<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.640> hardest<00:01:36.000> of

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
quite easy to maintain the hardest of

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.060 
quite easy to maintain the hardest of
the<00:01:36.270> three<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.689> maintain<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.530> pretty<00:01:37.860> much<00:01:38.009> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the three to maintain is pretty much a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.520 
the three to maintain is pretty much a
reef<00:01:38.369> aquarium<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> reef<00:01:39.960> aquarium

your reef aquarium is to maintain by the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.959 
your reef aquarium is to maintain by the

amount of fish you put in it if you have

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.450 
amount of fish you put in it if you have
a<00:02:03.000> reef<00:02:03.240> aquarium<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:04.619> various<00:02:05.070> small

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
a reef aquarium just with various small

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.310 
a reef aquarium just with various small
fish<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.090> it'll<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> lot<00:02:06.780> easier<00:02:06.840> to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
fish in it it'll be a lot easier to

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.440 
fish in it it'll be a lot easier to
maintain<00:02:07.500> than<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.550> highly<00:02:08.970> populated

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
maintain than a highly populated

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.500 
maintain than a highly populated
aquarium<00:02:10.110> particularly<00:02:10.950> with<00:02:11.069> large<00:02:11.370> fish<00:02:11.730> so

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
aquarium particularly with large fish so

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.250 
aquarium particularly with large fish so
basically<00:02:12.840> what<00:02:13.050> I'm

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
basically what I'm

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.559 
basically what I'm
saying<00:02:13.439> is<00:02:13.709> larger<00:02:14.430> fish<00:02:14.640> produced<00:02:15.360> dis

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
saying is larger fish produced dis

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.949 
saying is larger fish produced dis
portion<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:17.430> small<00:02:17.730> fish<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.629> a<00:02:18.659> reef

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
portion and small fish so a reef

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.410 
portion and small fish so a reef
aquarium<00:02:19.439> containing<00:02:19.950> small<00:02:20.370> fish<00:02:20.849> will

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
aquarium containing small fish will

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.569 
aquarium containing small fish will
maintain<00:02:21.659> much<00:02:22.200> better<00:02:22.439> water<00:02:22.680> quality<00:02:22.769> than

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
maintain much better water quality than

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.250 
maintain much better water quality than
a<00:02:23.610> reef<00:02:23.819> aquarium<00:02:24.269> supporting<00:02:24.720> larger<00:02:25.049> fish

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
a reef aquarium supporting larger fish

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.289 
a reef aquarium supporting larger fish
keeping<00:02:26.099> an<00:02:26.280> invertebrate<00:02:26.760> aquarium<00:02:27.209> is

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
keeping an invertebrate aquarium is

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.210 
keeping an invertebrate aquarium is
quite<00:02:27.510> easy<00:02:27.720> because<00:02:28.349> you<00:02:28.650> don't<00:02:28.680> have<00:02:29.040> to

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
quite easy because you don't have to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.220 
quite easy because you don't have to
deal<00:02:29.400> with<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.670> amount<00:02:29.879> of<00:02:29.940> fish<00:02:30.120> waste<00:02:30.390> as<00:02:30.720> a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
deal with the amount of fish waste as a

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.530 
deal with the amount of fish waste as a
reef<00:02:31.500> aquarium<00:02:32.010> or<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.220> fish<00:02:32.459> only<00:02:32.640> aquarium<00:02:33.209> so

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
reef aquarium or a fish only aquarium so

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.059 
reef aquarium or a fish only aquarium so
your<00:02:33.690> water<00:02:33.810> quality<00:02:34.290> tends<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.680> maintain

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
your water quality tends to maintain

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.449 
your water quality tends to maintain
very<00:02:35.280> high<00:02:35.459> therefore<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:37.079> corals<00:02:37.470> thrive<00:02:37.680> on

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
very high therefore the corals thrive on

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.819 
very high therefore the corals thrive on
the<00:02:38.909> other<00:02:39.030> hand<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.540> fish<00:02:39.930> aquarium<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.590> quite

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
the other hand a fish aquarium is quite

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.130 
the other hand a fish aquarium is quite
easy<00:02:41.040> because<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.180> various<00:02:42.480> medications

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
easy because of the various medications

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.890 
easy because of the various medications
that<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.409> can<00:02:43.590> use
