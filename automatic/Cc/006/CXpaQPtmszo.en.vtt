00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:01.970 
so we ran over similar thing right here

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.889 
so we ran over similar thing right here
comparing<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.210> EMV<00:00:03.480> REO<00:00:03.870> remote<00:00:04.259> wha<00:00:04.529> to

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:05.899 
comparing the EMV REO remote wha to

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.379 
comparing the EMV REO remote wha to
basic<00:00:06.899> delmach<00:00:07.379> private<00:00:07.890> be<00:00:08.010> sort<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.389> circuit

basic delmach private be sort of circuit
on<00:00:09.780> using<00:00:10.559> my<00:00:10.769> old<00:00:11.040> original<00:00:11.400> EMP<00:00:11.910> REO<00:00:12.210> remote

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
on using my old original EMP REO remote

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.550 
on using my old original EMP REO remote
wha<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.769> not<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.070> reissue<00:00:14.460> but<00:00:15.560> reissues

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
wha this is not a reissue but reissues

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.950 
wha this is not a reissue but reissues
you<00:00:16.740> know<00:00:16.830> they<00:00:16.949> respond<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.520> similar<00:00:17.880> way<00:00:18.060> so

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
you know they respond in similar way so

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.679 
you know they respond in similar way so
hopefully<00:00:19.320> i'll<00:00:19.410> give<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> good<00:00:19.890> idea<00:00:20.010> of

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
hopefully i'll give you a good idea of

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.840 
hopefully i'll give you a good idea of
how<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.750> EMV<00:00:22.170> compares<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> dunlop<00:00:23.519> type<00:00:23.730> of

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
how the EMV compares to a dunlop type of

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.939 
how the EMV compares to a dunlop type of
system<00:00:24.240> now<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.750> dumb-off<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.380> one<00:00:25.529> sr<00:00:25.800> that

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
system now the dumb-off the one sr that

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.390 
system now the dumb-off the one sr that
i<00:00:25.980> have<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:27.180> old<00:00:27.359> rackmount<00:00:28.189> volume<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.279> at

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
i have is the old rackmount volume is at

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.759 
i have is the old rackmount volume is at
zero<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:30.480> range<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.929> all<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.170> way<00:00:31.260> up<00:00:31.380> at<00:00:31.529> one

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
zero the range is all the way up at one

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.180 
zero the range is all the way up at one
so<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> basic<00:00:32.940> gcp<00:00:33.570> 95<00:00:34.050> crybaby<00:00:34.649> and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
so it's like a basic gcp 95 crybaby and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:45.580 
so it's like a basic gcp 95 crybaby and
i<00:00:35.280> am<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:35.670> using<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:37.500> eq<00:00:37.860> at<00:00:37.980> all

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:59.710 

hey

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:21.520 

Oh

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.390 

bye

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.660 

right<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:25.760> the<00:01:26.330> EMB<00:01:26.840> is<00:01:27.310> dialed<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:28.430> for<00:01:28.610> a

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
right so the EMB is dialed in for a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.490 
right so the EMB is dialed in for a
similar<00:01:28.940> sort<00:01:29.240> of<00:01:29.360> tone<00:01:29.540> trying<00:01:30.080> to<00:01:30.229> kind<00:01:30.440> of

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
similar sort of tone trying to kind of

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:40.500 
similar sort of tone trying to kind of
get<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:30.920> crybaby<00:01:31.460> type<00:01:31.670> of<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:31.910> field

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:49.790 

hey

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:02:03.220 

Oh

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.870 

so<00:02:04.230> comparing<00:02:04.830> them<00:02:04.980> you<00:02:05.160> can<00:02:05.310> tell<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.730> know

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
so comparing them you can tell you know

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.480 
so comparing them you can tell you know
it's<00:02:06.870> not<00:02:07.140> quite<00:02:07.470> as<00:02:07.620> apparent<00:02:08.040> as<00:02:08.070> it<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.369> a

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
it's not quite as apparent as it is on a

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.600 
it's not quite as apparent as it is on a
clean<00:02:08.790> demo<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.510> the<00:02:10.440> EMV<00:02:10.770> does<00:02:11.160> kick<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.550> a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
clean demo but the EMV does kick in a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:25.940 
clean demo but the EMV does kick in a
good<00:02:11.790> amount<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.120> body<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:25.770> main

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
good amount of body and the main

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.860 
good amount of body and the main
difference<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.520> i<00:02:26.670> mean<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.910> feel<00:02:27.180> obviously

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
difference is i mean the feel obviously

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.750 
difference is i mean the feel obviously
it's<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.020> different<00:02:28.320> fiscal<00:02:28.470> range<00:02:28.920> but<00:02:29.580> with

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
it's a different fiscal range but with

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.930 
it's a different fiscal range but with
the<00:02:29.880> EMB<00:02:30.300> me<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.500> entire<00:02:31.830> range<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.460> usable

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
the EMB me the entire range is usable

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:44.370 
the EMB me the entire range is usable
there's<00:02:33.120> no<00:02:33.270> dead<00:02:33.540> spots<00:02:33.570> like<00:02:34.050> on<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> crime

modern<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.590> sound<00:03:31.860> so<00:03:32.400> let's<00:03:32.580> take<00:03:32.730> the

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
modern of a sound so let's take the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:52.870 
modern of a sound so let's take the
crybaby<00:03:33.450> down<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.810> range<00:03:34.260> three

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
so again what we saw in the clean demo

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.850 
so again what we saw in the clean demo
is<00:03:55.880> this<00:03:56.880> fans<00:03:57.510> up<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.960> low<00:03:58.140> end<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.530> low<00:03:58.680> end

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
is this fans up the low end the low end

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.010 
is this fans up the low end the low end
tone<00:03:59.070> but<00:03:59.670> what<00:03:59.790> happens<00:04:00.210> is<00:04:00.390> you're<00:04:00.720> stuck

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
with you know a diminished high end now

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.860 
with you know a diminished high end now
the<00:04:03.480> E<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.690> B<00:04:03.990> if<00:04:04.740> we<00:04:05.010> wanted<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.280> lower<00:04:05.870> than

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
the E and B if we wanted to lower than
