00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:17.770
 here in my house with my own machine 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:21.340

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.480

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.370

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.810

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:38.410
 and this is a whole roll that came 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.040

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.560
 Here I am going to show you 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.460
 of the ribbon roll I use it 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.370
 almost everything I have left over 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.460
 why 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.970
 for the ribbon that gives the blanket 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.730
 well I did double crazy yes 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.660
 here and here on both sides everything 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:14.150
 complete and the blanket then almost use 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.010
 as I say almost the yard I have a spare 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.180
 little but 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:24.300
 That's why he had done it 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.000
 previously it is this and right now 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.500
 immediately after showing that is black 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.500
 I show this red quickie 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.570
 well 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.690
 roll up like that and here's the blanket 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.750
 they are something big they fit 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.990
 about 30 brochitas 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.480
 here in this blanket because they have the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.300
 skewers that I bought on the other occasion 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.320
 in the store to walgreens of the brand and 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.290
 those that are black are not study but 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.930
 they are like white professionals but 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.340
 these are in black 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.910
 here we open in the blanket because it's like that 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.200
 black black inside and here inside 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.970
 I also set the bar and as in 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.560
 the right cover here I set the bar 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.790
 as you see here sewn with white thread 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.040
 I could have sewn with black thread but 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.040
 I liked how the white thread was 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.560
 with a one 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.510
 the divisions for each brooch and then 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.710
 here are my skewers as I say 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:45.550
 are are elf are black are like 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.060
 but professionals are or are not 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.390
 do you study 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:56.300
 here they are all 30 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.520
 small bags for each brush and 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.620
 this one that is wider is like to put 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.980
 a kabuki 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.879
 or a clamp 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:12.920
 a little scissors is not a book something a 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:14.670
 because here is this lipstick are here 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.290
 as told 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:22.180
 here again we close them 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:26.530
 and we started to roll 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.019
 and we can mess it up little by little with 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.469
 the ribbon so that it looks good 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.469
 closed 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.939
 and now we can carry us travel 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.370
 A) Yes 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.700
 is 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.750
 is the one that was second, this is the 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.400
 first thing I did here I did it with 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.819
 a fabric that I had left over from a 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.360
 disguise and I wanted to try to make my own 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.250
 blanket and well no I 'm not so bad 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.990
 3 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.530
 excuse the whole center said I bring 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.480
 with him this 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.390
 well, the blanket is here if it is 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.940
 can appreciate a little more the 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.480
 bags because that's another color the other 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.109
 It is very black 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.820
 Here I have my brushes white these 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.310
 They are what are called professionals 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:28.780
 these cost a dollar 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:30.729
 online on the soft page 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.499
 country 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:37.930
 free in face highlights facebook.com and 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:39.880
 it can be a dollar in the package that 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.870
 I believe that 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.420
 comes for 12 brushes to 12 dollars or 1 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.960
 dollar to one dollar each of the brushes 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:54.550
 individually here also use the thread 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.220
 white for the sachets and in the end I made 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:01.090
 a little bag also to put a 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.330
 kabuki pincitas labiales or what a 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.940
 brush more harder than not to fit 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.910
 these divisions 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.190
 because this lover is like that also the 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.449
 we close in roll 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.040
 Y 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.320
 as well 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.420
 we close them with the ribbon to list me 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.500
 it was a little long but then of 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.800
 animal 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:31.509
 there we give more laps and it's like that 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:34.000
 my two blankets made homemade and as already 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:38.199
 they had mentioned in another video I 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.590
 I bought my mac clips nothing more than 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.590
 these are 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.550
 small sizes like to travel 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.650
 the size of a single hand but good 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.830
 this had already shown in another video 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:01.220
 but I'm planning how I bought the two 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:03.440
 sets the roses and the water green 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.890
 I'm planning to make a small blanket 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:10.030
 for this is to put them all together 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:13.360
 I know they are different 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.480
 sets but then when one travels then 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.700
 to bring them all together and not bring 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.490
 234 all the bags of each mind better 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.280
 only one but obviously it was 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.840
 a blanket you are smaller not so 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.720
 long 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.090
 and more like good that's all I hope that 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.130
 you liked it and see you in the 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.130
