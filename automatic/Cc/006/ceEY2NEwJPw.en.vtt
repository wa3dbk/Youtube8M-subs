00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
roof of the cab and then we've got three

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.490 
roof of the cab and then we've got three
different<00:01:29.179> mirrors<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:29.780> we<00:01:29.869> have<00:01:30.050> to<00:01:30.170> find<00:01:30.409> a

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
different mirrors that we have to find a

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.980

down<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.179> side<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:35.740> there's<00:01:36.740> another<00:01:36.950> mirror

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
down the side and there's another mirror

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.160 
down the side and there's another mirror
that<00:01:37.369> also<00:01:37.520> helps<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.240> operator<00:01:38.690> see<00:01:38.960> on<00:01:39.050> his

you're not blind if you try and fix this
mirror<00:01:43.159> because<00:01:43.520> it's<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.700> little<00:01:43.819> bit<00:01:43.970> tricky

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
particular model isn't too big so it

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.400 
particular model isn't too big so it
doesn't<00:04:23.030> need<00:04:23.150> a<00:04:23.180> very<00:04:23.480> large<00:04:23.690> trailer<00:04:24.110> and

doesn't need a very large trailer and
all<00:04:25.100> that's<00:04:25.280> needed<00:04:25.370> is<00:04:25.640> to<00:04:25.760> set<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.060> Machine

feature<00:04:36.290> of<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.530> model<00:04:36.710> is<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:36.890> it's

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
feature of the model is that it's

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.740 
feature of the model is that it's
flexible<00:04:37.280> because<00:04:37.790> you<00:04:38.030> can<00:04:38.150> change<00:04:38.420> the<00:04:38.570> work

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
adding on the grab as you can see this

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.150 
adding on the grab as you can see this
just<00:04:56.300> hooks<00:04:56.600> over<00:04:56.780> when<00:04:57.170> our<00:04:57.290> man<00:04:57.530> wakes<00:04:57.920> up

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
just hooks over when our man wakes up

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.280 
just hooks over when our man wakes up
and<00:04:58.280> is<00:04:58.370> able<00:04:58.610> to<00:04:58.700> actually<00:04:58.850> put<00:04:59.150> it<00:04:59.270> on<00:04:59.360> now

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
and is able to actually put it on now

he's done it at last and he wants a pay
rise<00:05:02.480> for<00:05:02.510> that<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.980> grab<00:05:04.160> just<00:05:04.310> hangs<00:05:04.610> so<00:05:04.850> it

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
rise for that the grab just hangs so it

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.700 
rise for that the grab just hangs so it
rotates<00:05:05.120> freely<00:05:05.660> and<00:05:05.990> in<00:05:06.080> fact<00:05:06.230> it<00:05:06.410> does<00:05:06.530> that

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
rotates freely and in fact it does that

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.460 
rotates freely and in fact it does that
in<00:05:06.830> two<00:05:06.980> directions<00:05:07.160> and<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:08.900> two<00:05:09.080> halves<00:05:09.320> of

in two directions and the two halves of
the<00:05:09.530> grab<00:05:09.740> also<00:05:10.220> interlock<00:05:10.730> so<00:05:11.030> they<00:05:11.120> open

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
the grab also interlock so they open

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.830 
the grab also interlock so they open
evenly<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.190> for<00:05:13.190> 360<00:05:13.970> degree<00:05:14.000> rotation<00:05:14.630> of

evenly and for 360 degree rotation of
the<00:05:14.930> grab<00:05:15.110> is<00:05:15.260> also<00:05:15.560> possible<00:05:16.010> one

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
the grab is also possible one

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.680 
the grab is also possible one
interesting

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
interesting

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.330 
interesting
is<00:05:17.870> how<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.050> machine<00:05:18.410> travels<00:05:18.860> when<00:05:19.040> it's<00:05:19.160> got

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
the grab attached and it does this by

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.230 
the grab attached and it does this by

front and then lowering the boom so it

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.650 
front and then lowering the boom so it
