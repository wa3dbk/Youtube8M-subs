voicings<00:00:25.369> in<00:00:25.490> your<00:00:25.610> left<00:00:25.850> hand<00:00:25.970> let's<00:00:26.750> go

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
voicings in your left hand let's go

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.939 
voicings in your left hand let's go
ahead<00:00:27.020> and<00:00:27.200> take<00:00:27.320> a<00:00:27.350> look<00:00:27.560> at<00:00:27.680> the<00:00:27.770> keyboard

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
ahead and take a look at the keyboard

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.130 
ahead and take a look at the keyboard
and<00:00:28.369> learn<00:00:28.580> this<00:00:28.789> melody<00:00:29.180> so<00:00:29.690> the<00:00:29.810> first<00:00:29.990> thing

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
and learn this melody so the first thing

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.630 
and learn this melody so the first thing
we<00:00:30.230> want<00:00:30.380> to<00:00:30.440> do<00:00:30.560> is<00:00:30.710> get<00:00:30.830> the<00:00:30.949> metronome<00:00:31.340> going

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
we want to do is get the metronome going

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.340 
we want to do is get the metronome going
again<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:32.180> let's<00:00:32.329> get<00:00:32.449> that<00:00:32.599> going<00:00:32.660> on<00:00:32.960> two<00:00:33.199> and

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
again so let's get that going on two and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.319 
again so let's get that going on two and
four

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
four

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.870 
four
metronome<00:00:35.329> is<00:00:35.449> pretty<00:00:35.660> simple<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.760> melody<00:00:37.760> is

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
metronome is pretty simple the melody is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.700 
metronome is pretty simple the melody is
pretty<00:00:38.120> simple<00:00:38.360> nobody's<00:00:39.140> on<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.380> fifth

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
pretty simple nobody's on the fifth

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.250 
pretty simple nobody's on the fifth
degree<00:00:39.829> of<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.790> chord<00:00:41.030> that<00:00:41.120> we're<00:00:41.390> on<00:00:41.540> so<00:00:42.050> the

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
degree of the chord that we're on so the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.569 
degree of the chord that we're on so the
melody<00:00:42.410> is<00:00:42.530> going<00:00:42.560> to<00:00:42.710> start<00:00:42.920> on<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.100> G<00:00:43.309> since

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
melody is going to start on the G since

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.569 
melody is going to start on the G since
our<00:00:43.730> first<00:00:43.910> chord<00:00:44.210> of<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:44.360> Blues<00:00:44.630> is<00:00:44.899> a<00:00:44.960> c7<00:00:45.890> my

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
our first chord of the Blues is a c7 my

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.950 
our first chord of the Blues is a c7 my
voicings<00:00:47.000> on<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:47.149> left<00:00:47.329> hand<00:00:47.510> aren't<00:00:47.809> going

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
voicings on the left hand aren't going

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.210 
voicings on the left hand aren't going
to<00:00:48.020> be<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.170> ones<00:00:48.350> we<00:00:48.500> just<00:00:48.680> use<00:00:48.860> they're<00:00:49.070> just

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
to be the ones we just use they're just

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.500 
to be the ones we just use they're just
going<00:00:49.309> to<00:00:49.399> be<00:00:49.550> root<00:00:49.760> position<00:00:49.880> so<00:00:50.360> we<00:00:50.480> can

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
going to be root position so we can

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.540 
going to be root position so we can
really<00:00:50.840> look<00:00:51.320> at<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:51.530> melody<00:00:51.860> and<00:00:52.130> learn<00:00:52.370> it

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
really look at the melody and learn it

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.340 
really look at the melody and learn it
pretty<00:00:53.149> quickly<00:00:53.360> here<00:00:53.630> so<00:00:53.750> here<00:00:53.960> we<00:00:54.050> go

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
pretty quickly here so here we go

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:04.380 
pretty quickly here so here we go
two<00:00:54.890> three<00:00:55.489> four

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.670 

it's<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.449> same<00:01:05.720> thing<00:01:05.990> just<00:01:06.170> up<00:01:06.380> an<00:01:06.500> octave

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
it's the same thing just up an octave

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:21.820 
it's the same thing just up an octave
from<00:01:07.160> before

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.130 

so<00:01:22.830> that's<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.250> melody<00:01:23.540> melody<00:01:24.540> starts<00:01:24.930> on

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
so that's the melody melody starts on

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.470 
so that's the melody melody starts on
the<00:01:25.260> fifth<00:01:25.470> degree<00:01:25.620> of<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.160> corridor<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.760> c7

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
the fifth degree of the corridor on c7

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.140 
the fifth degree of the corridor on c7
and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.470> goes<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> six<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.790> back<00:01:29.940> to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
and then goes up to the six and back to

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.730 
and then goes up to the six and back to
the<00:01:30.270> fifth<00:01:30.510> and<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.900> does<00:01:31.050> that<00:01:31.230> for<00:01:31.410> all<00:01:31.530> three

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the fifth and it does that for all three

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.220 
the fifth and it does that for all three
of<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.010> chords<00:01:32.400> when<00:01:33.300> an<00:01:33.420> idea<00:01:33.720> gets<00:01:33.990> taken

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
of the chords when an idea gets taken

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.580 
of the chords when an idea gets taken
and<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> same<00:01:35.580> in<00:01:36.270> another<00:01:36.870> key<00:01:37.320> it's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and is the same in another key it's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.270 
and is the same in another key it's
called<00:01:37.800> transposition<00:01:38.160> so<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.820> took<00:01:38.940> this<00:01:39.180> idea

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
called transposition so I took this idea

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.719 
called transposition so I took this idea
and<00:01:41.400> put<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.180> up<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.690> half<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.310> also<00:01:44.310> into

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
and put it up and a half and also into

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.380 
and put it up and a half and also into
g7<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> that's<00:01:47.640> really<00:01:47.909> where<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> melody

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
g7 so that's really where the melody

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.630 
g7 so that's really where the melody
comes<00:01:48.780> from<00:01:49.049> let<00:01:49.619> me<00:01:49.680> break<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:49.920> down<00:01:50.040> one<00:01:50.369> step

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
comes from let me break it down one step

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.160 
comes from let me break it down one step
further<00:01:50.880> let's<00:01:51.630> take<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> look<00:01:52.020> at<00:01:52.080> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
further let's take a look at the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.810 
further let's take a look at the
keyboard<00:01:52.380> again<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.040> see<00:01:53.250> what<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.400> meant<00:01:53.670> by

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
keyboard again and see what I meant by

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.999 
keyboard again and see what I meant by
that<00:01:54.030> fifth<00:01:54.450> degree<00:01:54.690> so<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.590> said<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
that fifth degree so as I said the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.859 
that fifth degree so as I said the
melody<00:01:56.340> has<00:01:56.490> really<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.180> fifth<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.630> six

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
melody has really just the fifth and six

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.499 
melody has really just the fifth and six
degrees<00:01:58.080> of<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:59.729> scale<00:01:59.850> over<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> chord

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
degrees of the scale over the chord

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.200 
degrees of the scale over the chord
we're<00:02:00.659> using<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.170> let's<00:02:01.350> break<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.560> down<00:02:01.710> here

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
we're using so let's break it down here

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.510 
we're using so let's break it down here
here's<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.300> C<00:02:03.600> dominant<00:02:04.020> seventh

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
here's that C dominant seventh

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.550 
here's that C dominant seventh
the<00:02:05.970> melodies<00:02:06.360> using<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.960> those<00:02:07.140> two<00:02:07.350> notes

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the melodies using just those two notes

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.350 
the melodies using just those two notes
that's<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> fifth<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> six<00:02:08.729> degrees<00:02:09.090> or

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
that's the fifth and the six degrees or

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.660 
that's the fifth and the six degrees or
using<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.990> C<00:02:10.200> scale<00:02:10.880> five<00:02:11.959> six

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.180 

so<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.750> then<00:02:19.140> you've<00:02:19.410> got<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.740> add<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.980> rhythm

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
so and then you've got the add to rhythm

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.680 
so and then you've got the add to rhythm
into<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:20.790> we've<00:02:20.910> got<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.180> notes<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.630> then

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
into it so we've got the notes and then

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.690 
into it so we've got the notes and then
I<00:02:21.750> combine<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.290> with<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.530> rhythm

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
I combine that with the rhythm

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.369 
I combine that with the rhythm
five<00:02:24.360> six<00:02:24.629> five<00:02:24.750> five<00:02:25.170> six<00:02:25.890> five<00:02:27.290> going<00:02:28.290> into

f7<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.430> same<00:02:29.670> idea<00:02:30.860> five<00:02:31.860> six<00:02:32.190> five<00:02:32.400> one

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
f7 it's the same idea five six five one

let's play it up here five and six go
back<00:02:46.500> down<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.890> c7<00:02:47.610> do<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.849> same<00:02:48.030> melody

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
back down to the c7 do the same melody

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.840 
back down to the c7 do the same melody
as<00:02:48.390> before

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
as before

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.300 
as before
I<00:02:50.000> added<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.840> little<00:02:50.990> bit<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:51.830> different<00:02:52.160> note

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
I added a little bit of a different note

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.110 
I added a little bit of a different note
which<00:02:52.520> is<00:02:52.670> just<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.030> third<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.700> new<00:02:55.820> idea

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
which is just the third so the new idea

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.750 
which is just the third so the new idea
here<00:02:56.570> is
