 (Music) 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 (City traffic) I'm here to encourage you to think about New York City 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Not as one of the greatest human vacations 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 But also as home to a local wildlife that was subject to a great evolutionary experience. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Take an example of a hillside slope in northern Manhattan. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 It is one of the last places in the city that still has clear springs 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 You can drink it from filling your hand without fear for your health. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 These small areas with springs have huge numbers of Northern Slamanders 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 They were objects scattered throughout the city 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 60 years ago, probably 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 But its presence is now limited in the slope of that hill and some places on Staten Island 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Add to her living humiliated 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 At this hillside, 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 We divided it into 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Two parts twice 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Across bridges linking the Bronx and Manhattan. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 But they are still there, 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 On one side of the bridge where the red arrows are 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Around 180 and 167 streets. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Laboratory found that if you take samples of nuclear acid 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Of salamanders in the two different regions 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 You can find out which side of the bridge you live. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 One infrastructure we had built 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 It has changed its evolutionary history. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 We can study those objects in the slope of the hill 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 We know where to find them, we can roll stones and hold them. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 There are other objects in New York City but holding them is difficult 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Such as this coyote. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 We grabbed it with a camera with an automatic camera somewhere 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 I can not reveal his name yet. It is moving to 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 New York for the first time. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 They are very flexible and smart animals. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 This year, one of the cameras scans one of the cameras. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 My colleagues and I are very interested in understanding 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 How to spread it in the area, 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 How to live and stay here, and perhaps its prosperity as well. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 You will inevitably go to your area soon, perhaps already arrived. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 There are things that happen faster than we can check them up close 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 We can not monitor it with the camera 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 So we put traps around the city and its gardens, 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 This is one of our familiar activities. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 These are one of my students and some colleagues are putting up traps. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 There are those we see almost in all forest areas 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 New York: The mouse is white feet. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 It is different from the mouse you might find being in your apartment, 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 It is an original type, lived here even before the advent of humans 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 They can be found in forests and meadows. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Because it is scattered with the forest places of the city, 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 We use them as models to understand how species adapt to urban environments. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 This means that 400 years ago 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 These neighborhoods were covered 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Forests and various plant species. This mouse 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 It was everywhere 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Minor genetic differences among different members in the entire region. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 But given the current situation, 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Its presence is confined to some small islands 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Which are scattered around the city. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Across 18 short portions of DNA, we take them from mice 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 If we gave someone a mouse without informing us about their place of living, 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 We can tell which garden you live in, reflecting the pace of their differences 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Note the center of this colored shape here 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 There are some mixed colors. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 There are some gardens that are still connected to each other 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Across forest areas, mice can move between them 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 And spread their genes so as not to be different, 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 But they become different in the gardens in the entire city. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 What I say is different 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 What exactly do I mean? 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 To answer this question 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 We are carrying the gene sequence of thousands of mice in the city 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 And compared with the genes of thousands of rural mice. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Her ancestors lived outside New York City 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 In large wilderness areas. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Genes are short parts of DNA 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 It symbolizes amino acids, 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Which are the building blocks of proteins. 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 When a basal pair differs in genetics, the result is a different amino acid 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Gives a different form and composition to the protein. 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 When changing protein composition, 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 You change her function in the body. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 If change leads to a longer life, or more children, 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Which evolutionary biologists call validity, 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 That base pair will spread rapidly in an urban area. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 This crazy picture is called Manhattan Land 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Because it resembles the line of sight 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Each point represents a gene. 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 The higher the point in the drawing, 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Whenever they are different between city and rural mice. 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 These located in the most skyscrapers are the most varied 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Especially those that go beyond the red line. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 These genes symbolize a tumor such as the immune response to disease 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 Because there are probably more diseases 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 In densely populated urban areas, 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Metabolism, how mice use energy 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 And carry heavy metals. You probably know that 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Land in New York City is contaminated 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Shot, chrome and the like. 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Now the hard work begins 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 We return to the wild areas of New York Gardens 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Monitors the lives of mice and the impact of those genes on them. 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 I encourage you to look at your gardens in a different way. 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 I will not be the successor of Charles Darwin, 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 But one of you might be, keep your eyes open. Thanks. 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 (clap) 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.091
