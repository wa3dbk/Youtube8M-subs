00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.900
 well the truth that very important 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.090
 answering for the triumph I think the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.430
 team is really very very big and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.020
 against an opponent who has excellent 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.720
 plays 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:36.480
 very well I am in the sense of Pedro 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.670
 caixinha 24 well very well 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.950
 very happy to join this project so 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.480
 important we knew that obviously 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.440
 when there are big changes sometimes 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.610
 shocking but as he said sometimes the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.720
 team had to accommodate what 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.670
 first it was going to be difficult because 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.050
 Obviously, every process takes time and 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.839
 well I think that little by little the team is going 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.970
 getting his result from his doing 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.330
 the positive result and I think that juana 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.330
 good way 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.960
 I think we need the team 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.280
 I needed to finish with the arc at zero 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.290
 because we came from a series said 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.390
 party in which I had not been converting 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.680
 and I think defensively we made a 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.570
 very important work I repeat you had 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.130
 many people of them move in 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.180
 attack players who really play 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.010
 very well that has a good footing then 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.660
 I think we're going with three points that 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.790
 we needed it and against a rival like 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.790
 This is really a very good person 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.830
 very calmly here who wants 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.240
 erase the figure of waldo the people what 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.070
 you must remember and you have to remember it 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.450
 because it's been great not only for 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.910
 Cross before but for the whole team 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.899
 all mexico here I come to do my 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.640
 I work doing it in the best way 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.930
 try to respect the institution that 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.330
 He made the sacrifice to hire me and I 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.710
 I'm very grateful I found a 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.940
 really very nice city with people 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.800
 that really treats me very well in the 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.450
 club have made me feel very comfortable and 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.289
 I think that is the most important thing for 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.210
 I hope God wants what one 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.070
 wants to try to determine with the arc 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.049
 in zero obviously that I think the 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.369
 team as I told you today molina took out two 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.229
 balls on the line that saved me and 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.769
 we really did work 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.769
 defensive
