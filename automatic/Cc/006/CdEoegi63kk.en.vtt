 to a great question that sends us to 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.099
 gabi from the city of Guadalajara and its 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.259
 question says the following hello carlos

 what father you decided to open a space 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.990
 for us entrepreneurs with a lot 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.290
 taste a couple of years ago I opened my own 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.530
 family business here works my mom 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.870
 my husband my two sisters and I opened 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.360
 this business with the idea of ​​helping my 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.969
 family and I'm the owner myself 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.280
 desperate because I do not know what to do my 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.649
 Mom is already an older person and can not 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.500
 with many of the responsibilities my 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.110
 sisters do not do their part I have many 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.820
 problems with my husband for all this 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.949
 situation and frankly I'm 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.590
 fed up I want to continue helping my 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.930
 family but stress is eating me 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.270
 that you recommend me to do hello gabi 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.920
 greetings I understand perfectly well by 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.899
 what you're going through and I know a lot 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.570
 people who will be watching us has also 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.420
 been in your shoes I understand you because 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.590
 just like you I also work with 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.869
 my family when 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.630
 and I started working together 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.000
 we had enough frictions what 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.280
 we discovered was that the reason for said 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.990
 frictions were because my wife and I 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.359
 we are very different 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.039
 she has skills that I do not have and 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.219
 vice versa the first thing you should do 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.170
 gabi is to make sure that each person is 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.509
 doing something where you use your 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.390
 talents and that you truly enjoy 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.640
 do anything and rita more to a person who 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.770
 dedicate himself to doing something he does not like and 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.110
 where you are not really using 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.479
 your talents so start over there 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.130
 make sure that each member of the team 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.799
 work is doing something that 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.959
 truly enjoy the second that 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.569
 you should do is take into account the 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.640
 personalities of each individual there are 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.129
 people who do not like it 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.719
 tell them what you should do there are others for 

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:10.179
 example that they feel more comfortable 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:13.120
 working in a team environment 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.069
 you must take this into consideration because 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.620
 you can not treat all of it 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.569
 way for a person to give their best 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.000
 of yourself at work you should feel 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.520
 that you are confident but not 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.470
 you can give confidence in the same way 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.480
 who likes to work in a way 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.910
 independent and someone who likes 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.250
 teamwork next thing 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.860
 you should take into account is that having a 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.690
 family business the business does not stop 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.880
 be business door business 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.220
 for you are a team of 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.100
 work that should serve a community 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.350
 of clients if one of those members of the 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.170
 equipment fails you have to adjust the nuts 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.120
 with training and motivation or in the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.940
 worst give you the opportunity to 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.250
 that person you find elsewhere 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.520
 a job where you can really use 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.470
 his talents now is also important 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.110
 that all the members of the team 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.600
 work belonging to your family be 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.700
 honest really want to be 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.500
 working there I know that maybe in a 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.170
 principle accept not to work in team 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.180
 for the excitement of starting a business 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.280
 of family but over time people 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.170
 he realizes that maybe that's not 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.500
 truly what you want and you have to 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.560
 be honest to recognize it and take a 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.660
 different direction asks your relatives to 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.220
 they tell you if they really want 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.440
 continue working 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.350
 you will have two answers if they tell you that 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.840
 yes then make the necessary adjustments 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.150
 so that each one of you get 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.220
 batteries and give the best of itself if 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.750
 answer is no then it's time 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.580
 to give the opportunity to the other 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.160
