00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.930
 OK 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.610
 how about friends of autocosmos.com my 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.440
 name is jorge blancarte welcome and 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.320
 good what is promised is debt we bring 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.420
 the hyundai grand test and 10 sedan 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.700
 this vehicle that in other markets is 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.500
 you know it as surplus was presented 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.430
 at the new delhi autoshow in February 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.170
 of 2014 and arrived in our country just 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.270
 ending last year what do you think 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.190
 if we are going to know it to begin 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.770
 we have that this sedan compared to the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.090
 hatch version is longer measures three thousand 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.199
 nine hundred ninety five millimeters 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.480
 that is 230 millimeters more from there the 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.820
 Wide wheelbase and height is 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.760
 the same this increase is for obviousness 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.159
 by the trunk esthetically they are equal 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.920
 only in the rear part from 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.570
 post ce is where the difference comes to 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.970
 we like the version more 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.830
 hatchback is more dynamic and harmonious 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.510
 but surely many will like it 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.580
 this sedan model since our 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.780
 market gives preference to this type of 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.729
 vehicles 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.280
 the version we are testing is the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.119
 gls with manual box that has a price 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.630
 of 174 900 pesos however has a 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.369
 entry price of 134 thousand 900 pesos and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.960
 comes to compete directly against the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.479
 sales leader in the segment 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.850
 chevrolet aveo let's get to know the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.440
 inside and see what our 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.149
 first great but that we found 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.430
 this vehicle is that to open the 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.830
 trunk can only be done in half 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.520
 of the control or by means of a lever 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.440
 which is next to the driver's seat 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.570
 that is other vehicles can be done 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.909
 by pressing a button that 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.490
 is right in this area to forces this 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.439
 trunk is by means of control 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.420
 another point that we also dislike 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.549
 quite is that supposedly the car 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.979
 it's bigger and it must have more 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.970
 capacity that's true the ability to 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.340
 the trunk is 407 liters however 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.679
 is everything we can aspire to 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.800
 that the rear seats can not be 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.680
 fold like in the hatch model there is 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.489
 true the trunk is 257 liters or 100 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.200
 56 but can increase up to 1200 2 if 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.140
 we fold the seats in the second row 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.880
 for us that is versatility and this 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.650
 it's a but we really did not like it 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.060
 this model the equipment is the same 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.610
 that the hatch model in the same version 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.319
 gl that air conditioning insurance 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.150
 elevators and mirror controls 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.340
 electrical systems as well as 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.519
 infotainment with radio cedé 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.890
 Play mp3 with auxiliary inputs like 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.239
 usb or bluetooth we could only synchronize 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.880
 our smartphone by means of 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.709
 bluetooth never for usb otherwise 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.860
 we found a dog in the equipment 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.660
 and is that if you do not have the gls version the 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.450
 more equipped will not have 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.870
 ie intermittent wiper 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.209
 below this one you only have 2 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.330
 in terms of security we have bags of 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.459
 frontal air and ABS brakes 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.830
 Design is very attractive and avant-garde 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.140
 the quality of materials as garments 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.750
 it's quite favorable and to the touch it 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.120
 They feel very well the space for seats 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.519
 rear is quite broad both for 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.319
 legs like the head fit well four 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.480
 people and can enjoy the 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.819
 armrest with cup holders that 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.769
 places in the middle and good part something that 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.049
 We definitely did not like this 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.940
 watch that looks cheap and clashes with 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.220
 all the interior and the good quality of 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.530
 materials 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.110
 with respect to handling we have to this 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.620
 vehicle has the same engine as all 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.890
 the models of this range ie 1.25 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.730
 liters has a power of 88 horses 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.120
 and the torque is 88 pounds well the 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.190
 transmission is 5-speed manual 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.350
 which is very fast since the 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.480
 changes are very short and enter with 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.040
 very easy something that we like a lot 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.290
 of this vehicle is the work of the 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.120
 suspension is quite high as 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.459
 soft to lessen the feeling of 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.440
 bumps like bumps in the streets thanks 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.480
 to the electronic address gives a lot 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.459
 road safety allows you to take 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.100
 very good curves like making turns 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.350
 fast in the city transit is ideal 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.910
 since it really is quite docile 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.489
 to move easily between 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.870
 cars when changing lanes another point 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.850
 that we liked a lot is the good 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.040
 acceleration that you have thus allows you 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.810
 pass easily and quickly at low 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.910
 speeds which is essential in 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.919
 city ​​however already on the road the 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.510
 behavior is different then in a 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.940
 high slope the speed of 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.360
 Ascent is between 80 and 90 kilometers 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.159
 hour 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.379
 we would have liked it to be better 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:42.330
 less about 100 kilometers to himself in 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:44.759
 a line that gives without problems the 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.009
 120 kilometers per hour on top of this 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.360
 speed the engine starts to suffer and you 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.669
 account for the intensity of noise 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.530
 which increases in the passenger compartment 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.289
 fuel performance that advertises 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.840
 the manufacturer is 18 kilometers per 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.909
 liter however to our tests we 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.400
 gave 15 kilometers per liter 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:04.289
 we think it was pretty good put 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.719
 that we use all the time 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.000
 air conditioning and we revolutionized it to 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:11.400
 pleasure in no time we take care of the 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.139
 fuel we think is a good 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.689
 option for those who are looking for 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.819
 a cooler design not obsolete like the 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:20.009
 of chevrolet aveo mechanically what 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:21.449
 feel more agile than the latter because 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.430
 The weight / power ratio is more 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.199
 balanced in the hyundai as data 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.810
 additional between one and the other there is a 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.550
 difference of 156 kilograms 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.319
 also linked this point the 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.500
 fuel efficiency is better in 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:36.629
 this Korean and comparing the trunks 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.330
 Hyundai is the largest since it is 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:42.360
 400 liters while that of aveo is 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.110
 of 351 liters to finish just us 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.820
 need to add 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.850
 we prefer the hatchback model 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.930
 this is because of its versatility ability to 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.479
 load and design 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.729
 if you liked this video share it 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.370
 Thanks for visiting autocosmos.com dot
