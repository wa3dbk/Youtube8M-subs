00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
every time theoretically but um let's

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.510 
every time theoretically but um let's
see<00:00:36.579> about<00:00:37.270> that<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:38.500> could<00:00:39.040> have<00:00:39.160> done<00:00:39.280> this<00:00:39.460> in

long just to prove that this is not a

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.719

fluke but um I hope you guys at least

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.969 
fluke but um I hope you guys at least
believe<00:01:16.060> that<00:01:16.240> is<00:01:16.390> part<00:01:16.570> of<00:01:16.600> Luke<00:01:16.780> now<00:01:16.990> but<00:01:17.829> to

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
believe that is part of Luke now but to

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.270 
believe that is part of Luke now but to
get<00:01:18.189> to<00:01:18.430> how<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.729> stun<00:01:19.149> someone<00:01:19.390> I<00:01:20.040> might<00:01:21.040> have

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
get to how to stun someone I might have

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.609 
get to how to stun someone I might have
to<00:01:21.460> speculate<00:01:21.909> a<00:01:21.939> little<00:01:22.060> bit<00:01:22.390> so<00:01:23.079> this<00:01:23.439> is

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
to speculate a little bit so this is

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.819 
to speculate a little bit so this is
this<00:01:24.189> is<00:01:24.340> what<00:01:24.640> I<00:01:25.380> interpreted<00:01:26.380> this<00:01:26.619> whole

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
this is what I interpreted this whole

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.870 
this is what I interpreted this whole
thing<00:01:27.130> as<00:01:27.570> each<00:01:28.570> person<00:01:28.869> has<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.490> range<00:01:30.490> in

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
thing as each person has a range in

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.200 
thing as each person has a range in
front<00:01:31.240> of<00:01:31.329> him<00:01:31.479> marked<00:01:32.350> or<00:01:32.500> shaded<00:01:33.189> red<00:01:33.399> where

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
front of him marked or shaded red where

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.160 
front of him marked or shaded red where
he<00:01:34.450> could<00:01:34.689> kill<00:01:35.140> or<00:01:35.380> stun<00:01:35.890> you<00:01:36.159> easily<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
he could kill or stun you easily the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.209 
he could kill or stun you easily the
trick<00:01:38.439> is<00:01:38.619> to<00:01:39.119> knife<00:01:40.119> him<00:01:40.479> and<00:01:40.799> make<00:01:41.799> him<00:01:41.920> stop

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
trick is to knife him and make him stop

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.969 
trick is to knife him and make him stop
moving<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:42.759> get<00:01:43.450> inside<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:44.079> green<00:01:44.530> shaded

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
moving and get inside the green shaded

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.609 
moving and get inside the green shaded
area<00:01:45.100> where<00:01:45.969> he<00:01:46.119> has<00:01:46.329> no<00:01:46.570> control<00:01:46.780> over<00:01:46.960> where

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
area where he has no control over where

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.920 
area where he has no control over where
he<00:01:47.770> doesn't<00:01:48.039> get<00:01:48.100> any<00:01:48.340> prompt<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:49.060> stun<00:01:49.719> him

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
he doesn't get any prompt and stun him

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.779 
he doesn't get any prompt and stun him
before<00:01:50.320> he<00:01:50.469> gets<00:01:50.680> chance<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.310> move<00:01:51.460> around

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
before he gets chance to move around

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.149 
before he gets chance to move around
again<00:01:52.000> because<00:01:52.840> if<00:01:53.020> weakest<00:01:53.320> chances<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.950> move

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
again because if weakest chances to move

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.209 
again because if weakest chances to move
this<00:01:54.670> will<00:01:54.909> happen<00:01:55.090> see<00:01:55.390> here<00:01:55.750> in<00:01:56.590> this<00:01:56.920> clip

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
this will happen see here in this clip

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.459 
this will happen see here in this clip
he'd<00:01:57.729> asked<00:01:58.149> me<00:01:58.179> properly<00:01:58.630> but<00:01:59.020> he<00:01:59.170> takes<00:01:59.350> a

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
he'd asked me properly but he takes a

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.279 
he'd asked me properly but he takes a
lot<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.649> time<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.100> actually<00:02:00.130> get<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:00.969> me<00:02:01.090> so<00:02:01.780> I

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
lot of time to actually get to me so I

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.870 
lot of time to actually get to me so I
get<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.770> chance<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.130> move<00:02:03.250> around<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.700> right

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
get a chance to move around and right

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.920 
get a chance to move around and right
about<00:02:04.119> here<00:02:04.479> I<00:02:04.630> get<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.380> prompt<00:02:05.950> on<00:02:06.070> him

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
about here I get a prompt on him

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.980 
about here I get a prompt on him
and<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.170> was<00:02:07.710> able<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.310> clear<00:02:08.700> him<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.600> this<00:02:09.840> is

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
and I was able to clear him so this is

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.990 
and I was able to clear him so this is
why<00:02:10.140> most<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.710> us<00:02:10.860> failed<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.430> nightstand

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
why most of us failed to nightstand

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.150 
why most of us failed to nightstand
sometimes<00:02:12.390> it's<00:02:12.630> because<00:02:12.990> of<00:02:13.380> mistakes<00:02:13.860> like

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
sometimes it's because of mistakes like

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.000

these so it really does take a lot of
tries<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.970> actually<00:02:21.390> perfect<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.080> because

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
tries to actually perfect this because

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.699
