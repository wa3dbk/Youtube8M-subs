00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.140
 fertilization and planting is performed in the pit 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.330
 as previously shown 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.240
 or when preparing the area for 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.070
 plantation as you see the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.930
 fertilizers is the organic matter already 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.140
 distributed in the punches and being 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.880
 mechanically incorporated into fertilizer 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.640
 information starts if after payment 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.960
 seedlings and extends until early 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.780
 production of plants 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.489
 the duration of this period will depend on the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.040
 numerous factors such as species 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.860
 used quality of seedlings 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.150
 conditions 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.390
 among others 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.550
 the amount of fertilizers applied must 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.430
 meet the needs of the plant for the 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.410
 production formation and growth 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.359
 amount of fertilizer recommended should be 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.750
 be parceled out three to four times 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:04.000
 during the rainy season 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.110
 the production fertilizer aims to obtain high 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.600
 productivity 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.820
 the high quality of the fruits and expenses 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.450
 compatible with the income obtained with 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 marketing of fruits is applied 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.190
 every year the determination 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.960
 of the nutrients applied and the quantity 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.600
 should be based on results from 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.150
 analysis of soil and leaf when 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.189
 You want to make a more accurate fertilization 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.520
 adults should be divided into three 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:32.740
 applications during the rainy season. 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.079
 fertilizer should be applied around the 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.299
 plant forming a radius ranging from 30 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.159
 inches to five feet and 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.439
 depending on the species and age of 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.420
 plant 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.280
 you see that fertilization should occur in the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.380
 last third of the area strip 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.460
 corresponding to the crown diameter of the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.040
 tree weed eliminated while the 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.140
 preparation of the area must have its control 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.140
 continued during the phases that follow the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.500
 planting the weeds can be manual 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.450
 chemistry or mechanics and aim to maintain 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.820
 streets between the rows and the 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.200
 between free plants of weeds and grasses 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.479
 weed 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.910
 invasive plants compete with 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.060
 nutrients from soil and water 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.430
 mainly forms a generally 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.500
 area around the plant corresponding to 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.019
 area of ​​your canopy projection should be 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.769
 kept free of weeds throughout the year 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.380
 while the remaining area must be mowed 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.720
 periodically 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.120
 the resources for the elimination of plants 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.790
 invasive species in small areas are weeding 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.950
 manual or mechanical 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.230
 rotating hoes as 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.840
 these should be avoided as they 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.390
 the roots of the fruit trees in the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.320
 dry a good weed by cutting the system 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.540
 of the bush has good results 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.340
 efficient chemical weeding but has 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.680
 higher initial cost and requires 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.220
 knowledge and criteria and the orientation of 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.220
 an agronomist engineer 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.040
 Another important cultural practice is 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.990
 pruning pruning for fruiting 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.640
 plants are necessary for good 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.640
 canopy and fruit production
