this<00:00:20.779> year<00:00:21.130> between<00:00:22.130> LeSean<00:00:22.610> McCoy<00:00:22.640> and

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
this year between LeSean McCoy and

this year between LeSean McCoy and
DeMarco<00:00:23.329> Murray<00:00:23.450> as<00:00:24.349> well<00:00:24.590> so<00:00:24.739> I<00:00:24.800> think<00:00:24.829> Murray

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
DeMarco Murray as well so I think Murray

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.190 
DeMarco Murray as well so I think Murray
a<00:00:25.520> lesser<00:00:26.119> workload<00:00:26.509> actually<00:00:26.869> helps<00:00:27.110> them

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
a lesser workload actually helps them

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.760

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
in I think he has a monster year and I'm

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.240 
in I think he has a monster year and I'm
not<00:00:44.540> ready<00:00:44.720> to<00:00:44.810> totally<00:00:45.140> right<00:00:45.590> off<00:00:45.770> Giovanni

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
not ready to totally right off Giovanni

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.370 
not ready to totally right off Giovanni
Bernard<00:00:46.460> either<00:00:46.910> even<00:00:47.750> though<00:00:47.810> jeremyhill

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
Bernard either even though jeremyhill

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.890 
Bernard either even though jeremyhill
will<00:00:48.830> get<00:00:49.130> the<00:00:49.370> vast<00:00:50.090> majority<00:00:50.300> of<00:00:50.630> their<00:00:50.750> work

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
will get the vast majority of their work

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.560 
will get the vast majority of their work
there<00:00:51.230> I<00:00:51.260> think<00:00:51.490> Giovanni<00:00:52.490> Bernards<00:00:53.150> role<00:00:53.360> is

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
there I think Giovanni Bernards role is

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.050 
there I think Giovanni Bernards role is
just<00:00:54.200> enough<00:00:54.440> I<00:00:54.680> had<00:00:54.980> Anderson<00:00:55.460> one<00:00:55.580> spot<00:00:55.820> over

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060

to be most valuable this year and it's
their<00:02:46.370> draft<00:02:46.730> worthy<00:02:47.950> potentially<00:02:48.950> but<00:02:49.430> I

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
their draft worthy potentially but I
