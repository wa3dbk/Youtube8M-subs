00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.600

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.910
 Yes 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.470
 Yes 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.530

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.440

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.750
 that ends in the gerard behind yoda yes 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.180
 unfortunately it was anyway 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.470
 we are indeed starting the first cp 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.700
 brought in many cars, I think five 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.170
 or six and yes own everything went up 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.820
 rolls to when the dunes too 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.520
 actually came long piece duijnen 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.500
 very good by very has cost costs 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.680
 make sure where we are with five 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.000
 minutes away and so at 2 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.220
 jack is also nothing wrong 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.720
 and I just want to go to the numbers 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.259
 christophe did not return from a finnish 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.110
 to drive and 12 kilometers before the end 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.640
 yes we are to them or dock 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.640
 diggle and rolled five times 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.870
 yes there was none at all in the route book 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.600
 danger or or or or 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.660
 something crazy stood a stepping stone and more 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.400
 did not say it even though we thought 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.280
 went through him through a bed actually 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.560
 and I already thought I had the step 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.530
 and I jump from that from that 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.149
 riverbed and to my big one 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.850
 I am surprised you will come across another jump 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.880
 and the rear of engine fly power 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.280
 and was nothing to hold on to 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.460
 so for free rolled the straight 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.620
 sides and the soft soft heel 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.260
 bad from the start 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.970
 how the car looked but now afterwards 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.840
 it all turns out it all 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.560
 not too bad 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.390
 so at least tomorrow for them 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.690
 starting is not what you can hope for 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.690
 can get 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.650
 tom was your day to go today despite 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.969
 Peter ' s crash of course everything day 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.349

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.849
 junior 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.099
 back a flat band, the second in 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.319
 there are always four or five of us 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.939
 white food and before we rest well 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.150
 driven geris taste in the dunes 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.200
 and we have a great one we have 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.849
 day had 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.400
 that is nice and prospects for the 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.170
 rest of the rally we are now twelfth 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.030
 overall i think i see one 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.469
 bit our place is now 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.239
 and we hope we are on the screens 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.069
 yet one thing for it is anyway 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.650
 still made mistakes and things 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.269
 while on that on safe but still on there 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.049
 I learn to continue to do devoured things like that 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.049
 as we are busy 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.379
