00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:07.780
 good friends and in this video we are going to 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.050
 learn how to root an xperia 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.840
 which I have not done with the super user 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.760
 that here we can see it several videos yo 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.910
 I saw how other phones could be 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.029
 surrounded with this 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.400
 but the exception of my experian a that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.500
 I could do it until I came across this 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.570
 peculiar application 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.370
 this is going to learn how to use it 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.670
 we open 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.580
 we go to configuration when opening the 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.570
 application is going to come this little button 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.250
 over here and we'll turn on the beta 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.220
 and then we give this green button and 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.230
 will start rooting the system to 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.450
 finish will inform us that everything is 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.250
 ready good I imagine in the click 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.550
 right we give to our phone 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.450
 will be dragged 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.910
 to check that this works we're going 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.430
 here I will leave the link below 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.300
 application video 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.940
 we verify says congratulations we have 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.150
 root access we are root users 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.240
 this application I will leave you link 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.580
 then I did not like it because to give it 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.460
 permission to all my applications was 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.680
 in Chinese and for that after doing 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.680
 all this I downloaded the super user 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.830
 here we see that our binary is already 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.830
 downloaded and we already have root access 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.860
 then to replace this with this 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.110
 our phone will remain root what 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.700
 only that we will not leave this 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.600
 application but we will be using 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.270
 is 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.270
 we go to configurations 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.729
 or else because if it will not be coming out 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.439
 the reports every time in Chinese we 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.439
 we go in applications 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.020
 in all 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.730
 we give it all and we look for the application 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.730
 which is in Chinese 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.540
 here it is 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.540
 we click 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.530
 and we give in disable 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.540
 disable says we accept 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.250
 nothing will remain root 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.409
 and we see that the option of 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.409
 enable we do not do anything anymore we go 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.469
 now 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.010
 and they realize the application 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.000
 disappeared our systems follows 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.950
 being root but the application the ico of 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.130
 the application disappeared from our 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:16.920
 menu and now we will be using this to 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.920
 confirm that we are going to check again 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.530
 we are still root 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.530
 we arrived here 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.270
 the binary still here I had a little 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.450
 problem I had this box as well as 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.300
 this and I got an application from me 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.520
 binary and when downloading the application 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:46.290
 stop being root to have root rights 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.180
 then I recommend deactivating it for 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.600
 already we re not update and 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.360
 let's be rooted in our phone let's go 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.790
 to open an application that works with 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.400
 this application if it was not root if not 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.400
 you have access, you can not use it 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.640
 we see that all good I do not have connected 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.230
 in my wifi 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.230
 it works like this application fails 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.570
 active a wifi 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.510
 it is not that it is connected to any network 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:50.980
 in short our applications now no longer 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.980
 they will ask us for access 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.689
 those Chinese letters will no longer turn us 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:04.809
 to leave 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:04.809
 that still knows how to open the root explore 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:20.159
 I had a little problem with the text 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:23.999
 so I have to reinstall it 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:25.439
 but I assure you that this works 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:28.939
 done this application that I am using 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:32.190
 to record my screen works with 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:35.070
 devices rute a 2 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.950
 I recommend that you use it and use this 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.610
 process 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.770
 since I tried to do it with this and not 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.080
 it worked for me but you can replace the 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.789
 previous 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:51.060
 and may god keep them friends and even 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.060
 soon
