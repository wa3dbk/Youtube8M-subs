00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649

team wrestlers and they have had their

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.650 
team wrestlers and they have had their
differences<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.430> there<00:00:41.879> was<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> lot<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.329> doubt

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
differences and there was a lot of doubt

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.229 
differences and there was a lot of doubt
um<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.320> think<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:44.070> both<00:00:44.250> sides<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.940> far<00:00:45.120> as

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
um I think on both sides as far as

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.900 
um I think on both sides as far as
trusting<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.840> another<00:00:45.870> um<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.190> all<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.670> but

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
trusting one another um and all that but

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.220 
trusting one another um and all that but
I<00:00:47.969> still<00:00:48.300> think<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.809> was<00:00:48.870> great<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> see

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.560 
I still think that it was great to see
them<00:00:49.440> together<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:50.010> sort<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> dream<00:00:51.210> team

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570

them together it's sort of a dream team

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
together as one coherent stable fighting

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.250 
together as one coherent stable fighting
together<00:01:08.820> because<00:01:09.540> they<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.750> clashing

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
together because they have clashing

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.480 
together because they have clashing
Styles<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:10.799> they're<00:01:10.920> able<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> use<00:01:11.310> them
