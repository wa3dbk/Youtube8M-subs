seeing<00:03:20.080> them<00:03:20.440> they're<00:03:21.340> still<00:03:21.489> in<00:03:21.880> their

seeing them they're still in their
shells<00:03:22.650> they're<00:03:23.650> baked<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:25.080> guess<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:28.050> covered

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
shells they're baked I guess and covered

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.870 
shells they're baked I guess and covered
in<00:03:29.230> salt<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:31.870> don't<00:03:32.110> happens<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.980> few<00:03:33.640> years

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
in salt you don't happens a few years

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.020 
in salt you don't happens a few years
ago<00:03:34.209> you'd<00:03:34.780> often<00:03:34.989> see<00:03:35.470> people<00:03:36.250> just<00:03:36.730> sitting

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
ago you'd often see people just sitting

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.390 
ago you'd often see people just sitting
on<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.390> street<00:03:37.720> eating<00:03:38.500> these<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.310> they're

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
on the street eating these and they're

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.550 
on the street eating these and they're
just<00:03:39.550> spitting<00:03:39.910> out<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.150> shells<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.870> into

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
just spitting out the shells and into

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.460 
just spitting out the shells and into
like<00:03:41.739> places<00:03:42.340> littered<00:03:42.910> with<00:03:43.470> sunflower

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
like places littered with sunflower

an empty inside which they cook it like

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.470 
an empty inside which they cook it like
this<00:04:53.960> they<00:04:54.890> put<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:56.150> kinda<00:04:56.750> on<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:56.960> pole<00:04:57.380> and

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
this they put the kinda on a pole and

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.000 
this they put the kinda on a pole and
while<00:04:59.480> it's<00:04:59.780> dripping<00:05:00.320> they're<00:05:00.560> cooking<00:05:00.950> it

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
while it's dripping they're cooking it

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.720 
while it's dripping they're cooking it
in<00:05:01.190> an<00:05:01.310> oven<00:05:01.660> and<00:05:02.660> just<00:05:02.780> spinning<00:05:03.350> it<00:05:03.500> and<00:05:03.770> so

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
in an oven and just spinning it and so

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.250 
in an oven and just spinning it and so
the<00:05:05.140> branches<00:05:06.140> I<00:05:06.470> guess<00:05:07.240> they<00:05:08.240> just<00:05:08.540> start

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
the branches I guess they just start

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.280 
the branches I guess they just start
dripping<00:05:09.560> and<00:05:09.950> then<00:05:10.070> harden<00:05:10.760> up<00:05:10.910> as<00:05:11.290> they

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
dripping and then harden up as they

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.810 
dripping and then harden up as they
reach<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:12.740> ovens<00:05:13.070> heat<00:05:13.340> then<00:05:15.640> and<00:05:16.640> yeah<00:05:16.760> you

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
reach the ovens heat then and yeah you

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.410 
reach the ovens heat then and yeah you
got<00:05:17.210> you<00:05:17.660> get<00:05:17.840> this<00:05:18.140> big<00:05:18.590> thing<00:05:19.060> this<00:05:20.060> is<00:05:20.210> quite

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
got you get this big thing this is quite

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.390 
got you get this big thing this is quite
small<00:05:20.690> actually<00:05:21.260> they<00:05:21.560> have<00:05:21.770> sizes<00:05:22.490> like<00:05:22.930> huge

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
small actually they have sizes like huge

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.660 
small actually they have sizes like huge
massive<00:05:26.590> shock<00:05:27.590> watching<00:05:30.400> it's<00:05:31.400> because

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
massive shock watching it's because

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.760 
massive shock watching it's because
these<00:05:31.970> names<00:05:32.360> are<00:05:32.570> in<00:05:32.660> Lithuanian<00:05:33.320> it's<00:05:33.560> hard

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
these names are in Lithuanian it's hard

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.850 
these names are in Lithuanian it's hard
to<00:05:33.950> translate<00:05:34.310> like<00:05:34.880> I<00:05:35.440> guess<00:05:36.440> it<00:05:36.620> would<00:05:36.830> be

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
to translate like I guess it would be

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.810 
to translate like I guess it would be
called<00:05:37.220> something<00:05:37.610> like<00:05:38.000> a<00:05:38.800> branch<00:05:39.800> II<00:05:40.550> I

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
called something like a branch II I

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.850 
called something like a branch II I
guess<00:05:41.330> and<00:05:41.660> something<00:05:42.380> with<00:05:42.560> branches<00:05:44.860> I'll

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
guess and something with branches I'll

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.260 
guess and something with branches I'll
open<00:05:46.130> it<00:05:46.250> up<00:05:47.800> never<00:05:48.800> seen<00:05:49.220> them<00:05:49.460> be<00:05:49.670> bought<00:05:49.970> as

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
open it up never seen them be bought as

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.210 
open it up never seen them be bought as
like<00:05:50.540> just<00:05:50.870> a<00:05:51.080> snack

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
table you're supposed to cut this up in

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.549 
table you're supposed to cut this up in
pieces<00:06:04.970> and<00:06:05.450> serve<00:06:05.720> it

00:06:06.549 --> 00:06:06.559

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
all right so here's a piece and you just

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.929 
all right so here's a piece and you just

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:14.939 
heat it with tea or something else I

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:24.100 
heat it with tea or something else I
guess<00:06:15.180> I<00:06:15.449> don't<00:06:15.539> know<00:06:15.689> or<00:06:16.259> milk<00:06:19.699> it's<00:06:20.699> really

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.089 

it's<00:06:25.110> crumbles<00:06:25.680> a<00:06:25.800> lot<00:06:25.949> and<00:06:27.740> that's<00:06:28.740> it<00:06:29.069> I

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:29.099 
it's crumbles a lot and that's it I

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:30.459 
it's crumbles a lot and that's it I
guess

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:30.469 
guess

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:34.689 
guess
that's<00:06:31.469> five<00:06:32.099> things<00:06:32.129> that<00:06:32.759> I<00:06:32.969> showed<00:06:33.479> you

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 
that's five things that I showed you

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:39.260 
that's five things that I showed you
they're<00:06:35.749> usually<00:06:36.749> in<00:06:37.339> Lithuania<00:06:38.339> or<00:06:38.580> more

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
they're usually in Lithuania or more

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.989 
they're usually in Lithuania or more
like<00:06:39.449> Eastern<00:06:39.960> Europe<00:06:40.379> I<00:06:40.529> guess<00:06:40.740> because<00:06:41.610> I've

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:41.999 
like Eastern Europe I guess because I've

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:44.149 
like Eastern Europe I guess because I've
seen<00:06:42.180> them<00:06:42.360> abroad<00:06:43.199> in<00:06:43.620> neighboring

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:44.159 
seen them abroad in neighboring

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:47.719 
seen them abroad in neighboring
countries<00:06:44.699> I<00:06:45.620> guess<00:06:46.620> we<00:06:46.830> do<00:06:46.979> share<00:06:47.339> a<00:06:47.400> lot<00:06:47.699> of

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:47.729 
countries I guess we do share a lot of
