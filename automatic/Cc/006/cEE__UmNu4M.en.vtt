00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.170
 hi everyone had the room in this 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.940
 video we will make the comparison between the 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.470
 kourouma armored and one on rim 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.849
 I chose these two vehicles because 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.190
 that they look alike on some 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.139
 points so we start this gameplay with 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.969
 kourouma I could have done just as well 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.040
 started with the urgent but I have 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.450
 decided to take the court or then me 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.400
 to show you that both vehicles 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.320
 are able to do one thing that's 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.810
 this one they are both capable 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.310
 to push any vehicle then 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 depending on the vehicle 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.060
 it will take more or less momentum if you 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.110
 want to push a truck for example there 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.130
 will have to be that your wrath males be 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.690
 launched at full power 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.910
 whereas if you want to push a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.080
 car as you see it pretty simple 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.500
 there is no need to be launched at full 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.260
 power 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.090
 it pushes them easily so that says 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.660
 frame vehicle or so-called test of 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.690
 speed 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.860
 so we start with a speed test 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.180
 there we see that the court or evil by 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.890
 much faster than one on rim 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.210
 but that was to be expected when we 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.489
 sees the size of the urgent unss 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.200
 well we see that the vehicle is big 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.030
 so it will inevitably have a little more 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.440
 wrong 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.149
 the curve to be blinder we also see by 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.350
 relation to the landscape that scrolls for 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.570
 watch it scrolls anyway 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.280
 relatively quickly there by the way we are 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.310
 almost arrived at the end of the track with the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.500
 kourouma year bound while one on 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.300
 rims it's hard to get there we're there 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.470
 only now so already there 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.540
 kourouma scores a point 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.610
 now we will do the test of 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.110
 resistance so resistance tests on 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.820
 will start with resistance by 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.549
 balls so at the level of resistance 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.870
 by bullets look at it kourouma first 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.659
 looked right 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.440
 she is already burning she has 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.960
 already exploded 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.970
 it takes about 300 balls for the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.130
 kourouma to explode a kourouma one 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.610
 on rims he looks at us and he has nothing 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.299
 still he needs him a thousand bullets 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.250
 about to destroy it 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.380
 here it took about 1000 balls 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.470
 so it takes 1800 and 1200 it's 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.150
 this is an approximation 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.010
 so we can say already that one on 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.930
 rims and three times stronger than 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.740
 kourouma and it will be confirmed with 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.049
 the test so this test there for the yard where 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.720
 my only one explosive and she does exist 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.009
 more while for one on rims him 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.540
 we had seen in a previous video 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.710
 who needed more than 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.749
 it 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.370
 so a query he's still in place 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.480
 of queries he still in place it's 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.630
 for that I pulled them enough 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.710
 quickly 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.810
 we know very well that after 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.120
 two requests there is nothing we take them 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.220
 third he still has nothing so what 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.400
 is still pretty big for a 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.380
 vehicle to support that's so many 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.420
 so many requests and it may be 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.190
 4th and that's only where it explodes 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.240
 so case of request to destroy a 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.010
 vehicle is huge 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.520
 the urgent need to mark a point which 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.710
 does one everywhere in this test of course one 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.030
 takes that the most important points 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.090
 after that, for sure, we can do 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.190
 many other tests 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.230
 we can even make hundreds but 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.090
 but we are interested here 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.090
 is what we use the most so we 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.740
 does the tests on precisely the utility 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.960
 the vehicle in the free mode 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.640
 so here we make the mood clash gift 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.040
 here I am dead quite quickly so 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.220
 there I just wanted to test ball to 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.040
 resistance make resistance rather 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.600
 how the character can withstand 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.850
 inside the vehicle 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.530
 so we saw that in the ain on rims 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.660
 it was pretty quick I got 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.100
 killing two there we are in the yard where my 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.570
 I will not let the gameplay 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.170
 to the bones since anyway he 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.990
 are not standing 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.940
 I stayed about ten minutes on 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.650
 place and for ten minutes I got 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.020
 taken balls like that without dying 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.430
 so in fact my life they go down and 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.030
 they come up and whenever I 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.460
 go in the red 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.590
 the time another balme touches i 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.630
 my life has time to go up so the 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.030
 yard or bad marks a point on this test 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.310
 there then of course there is the 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.230
 kourouma who wins the test between 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.580
 the urgent and the armored kourouma 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.080
 but what you need to know is that 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.070
 it's a test that's done on 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.890
 most important points 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.500
 after that it is sure that the opinions will diverge 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.070
 always there are some who will prefer the ins 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.200
 urgent 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.630
 there are some who will prefer kourouma there 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.760
 it's just indicative 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.540
 kourouma she is a bit more shit and 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.940
 than one on rim 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.670
 it's just indicative by 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.780
 example if you are facing a guy I 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.120
 do not know if you're dealing with a guy who 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.100
 is bombing you right now 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.720
 with explosives that's for sure if you 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.040
 are in kourouma good bah you have 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.720
 no luck now if you're in 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.350
 insurgent you have chances of 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.120
 you get out 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.410
 after if you are facing guys who 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.209
 you shoot with bullets 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.500
 necessarily with kourouma you have 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.240
 more chance of getting out of it 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.640
 so this test as I told you it is 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.960
 just as an indication depending on 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.380
 the situation in which you are 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.110
 find 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.570
 bach such or such vehicle will be more 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.400
 useful for you but in the meantime if 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.560
 you never hesitate between the two 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.120
 know that kourouma is a little more 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.860
 shit and that the urgent ins 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.300
 so that's all for this test it's 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.840
 everything for this video and I tell you 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.440
 right away 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.440
 ciao
