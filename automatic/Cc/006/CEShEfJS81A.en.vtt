example these h1 h2 and h3 tags are
header<00:00:24.390> tags<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.710> my<00:00:26.189> browser<00:00:26.519> knows<00:00:26.910> that

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
header tags so my browser knows that

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.030 
header tags so my browser knows that
each<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.390> these<00:00:27.689> sections<00:00:28.019> are<00:00:28.910> headers

each of these sections are headers

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.330 
each of these sections are headers
because<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.369> put<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.149> tag<00:00:34.079> around<00:00:35.010> start

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
because I put this a tag around start

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.700 
because I put this a tag around start
programming<00:00:35.730> now<00:00:36.000> my<00:00:36.780> browser<00:00:37.079> knows<00:00:37.410> that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
programming now my browser knows that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.380 
programming now my browser knows that
this<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.219> actually<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> full<00:00:39.030> weight<00:00:40.399> so<00:00:41.399> HTML

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
this is actually a full weight so HTML

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.869 
this is actually a full weight so HTML
does<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> great<00:00:42.870> job<00:00:42.930> formatting<00:00:43.770> text<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.730> if

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
does a great job formatting text but if

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.299 
does a great job formatting text but if
we<00:00:45.030> want<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.390> improve<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.930> design<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.160> to

so<00:02:29.050> what<00:02:29.260> if<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:29.740> more<00:02:29.920> than<00:02:30.070> one<00:02:30.370> h1<00:02:30.880> tag

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
so what if I have more than one h1 tag

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.180
