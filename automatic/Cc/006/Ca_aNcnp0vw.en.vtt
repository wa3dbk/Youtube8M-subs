one<00:04:23.300> or<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.630> other<00:04:23.780> I<00:04:24.550> enjoy<00:04:25.550> both<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:26.120> really

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
one or the other I enjoy both I really

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.640 
one or the other I enjoy both I really
do<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.220> if<00:04:28.220> I<00:04:29.080> didn't<00:04:30.080> have<00:04:30.139> a<00:04:30.200> good<00:04:30.380> character

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
do and if I didn't have a good character

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.940 
do and if I didn't have a good character
I<00:04:30.830> wouldn't<00:04:31.310> enjoy<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.729> rolling<00:04:32.060> so<00:04:32.240> much<00:04:32.270> and

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
I wouldn't enjoy the rolling so much and

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.469 
I wouldn't enjoy the rolling so much and
if<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:34.039> didn't<00:04:34.340> have<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.610> fun<00:04:34.849> strategic

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
if I didn't have the fun strategic

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:36.590 
if I didn't have the fun strategic
element

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
element

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.010 
element
then<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.990> think<00:04:37.440> I<00:04:38.180> would<00:04:39.180> be<00:04:39.330> too<00:04:39.540> consumed

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
then I think I would be too consumed

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.620 
then I think I would be too consumed
into<00:04:40.410> an<00:04:40.590> acting<00:04:41.280> role<00:04:41.520> or<00:04:41.820> emotional<00:04:42.450> role

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
into an acting role or emotional role

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.530 
into an acting role or emotional role
and<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:43.800> like<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.310> strategy<00:04:44.850> of<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.000> game<00:04:45.090> I

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
and I like the strategy of the game I

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.360 
and I like the strategy of the game I
like<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.110> random<00:04:46.470> luck<00:04:46.620> I<00:04:46.830> like<00:04:47.040> all<00:04:47.220> those

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
like the random luck I like all those

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.640 
like the random luck I like all those
elements<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:48.030> I<00:04:48.060> like<00:04:48.330> putting<00:04:49.260> together<00:04:49.380> a

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
elements to I like putting together a

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.100 
elements to I like putting together a
character<00:04:50.130> statistically<00:04:50.880> if<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:51.750> wanted<00:04:52.020> to

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
character statistically if I wanted to

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.080 
character statistically if I wanted to
act<00:04:52.260> go<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:52.740> Uncle<00:04:53.130> do<00:04:53.220> acting<00:04:53.580> I<00:04:53.730> don't<00:04:54.000> just

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
act go to Uncle do acting I don't just

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.000 
act go to Uncle do acting I don't just
want<00:04:54.420> to<00:04:54.660> do<00:04:54.750> act<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:55.110> want<00:04:55.320> to<00:04:55.440> play<00:04:55.590> this<00:04:55.770> game

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
want to do act I want to play this game

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.550 
want to do act I want to play this game
too<00:04:56.690> so<00:04:57.690> what<00:04:58.620> do<00:04:58.680> you<00:04:58.770> think<00:04:59.270> is<00:05:00.270> what<00:05:00.900> I<00:05:01.170> don't

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
too so what do you think is what I don't

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.870 
too so what do you think is what I don't
know<00:05:01.620> if<00:05:01.740> I<00:05:01.800> want<00:05:01.980> to<00:05:02.010> open<00:05:02.280> that<00:05:02.310> debate<00:05:02.730> if

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
know if I want to open that debate if

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.790 
know if I want to open that debate if
one<00:05:03.150> sides<00:05:03.450> they're<00:05:03.870> not<00:05:04.050> this<00:05:04.380> is<00:05:04.530> what<00:05:04.680> I'm

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
one sides they're not this is what I'm

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.060 
one sides they're not this is what I'm
saying<00:05:05.160> that<00:05:05.310> they're<00:05:05.850> both<00:05:06.030> needed<00:05:06.510> an

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
saying that they're both needed an

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.370 
saying that they're both needed an
integral<00:05:08.070> into<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:08.910> game<00:05:09.080> do<00:05:10.080> you<00:05:10.170> disagree

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
integral into the game do you disagree

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.150 
integral into the game do you disagree
with<00:05:10.530> me<00:05:10.740> say<00:05:11.610> why<00:05:12.410> role-playing<00:05:13.410> versus<00:05:13.980> role

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
with me say why role-playing versus role

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.320 
with me say why role-playing versus role
playing<00:05:14.430> I<00:05:15.110> say<00:05:16.110> both
