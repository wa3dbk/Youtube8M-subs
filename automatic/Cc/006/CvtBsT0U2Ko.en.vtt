00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.240
 what compulsions these phenomena 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.480
 Every year around 200,000 people in Germany turn against their will 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.670
 brought into psychiatry people of all strata and all educational groups 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.939
 It is especially common for older people like the Berliner to hit this AZ 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.939
 the multiple have been instructed against their will 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.789
 the project 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.599
 thank Antwerp for a commitment 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.140
 build there 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.449
 you have to stay 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.769
 Honda or beat 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:34.970
 and from 8 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.750
 we've got by against per race because one says long did not need to think about it 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.550
 This time were heads and empty 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.900
 m in their own homes accused of lack of housing 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.030
 Street there were complaints from the neighborhood 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.030
 no question she could have used foreign help well 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.650
 her supervisor decided but for a compulsory briefing 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.440
 allegedly for the benefit of the affected 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.340
 For the pensioner, this was torture 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.630
 I not only got into Michel Barnier's Roche 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.050
 under the name of still everyone out against each other 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.740
 please do not let it stop 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.770
 the drugs and I could not get him up 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.180
 she resisted the tutelage 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.450
 Tomas reigns among the lawyers Giesener supports 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.020
 continue 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.330
 the psychiatric expert were right and that more and more people are not 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.420
 conform to the social norm 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.420
 in the Zurich were forcibly resigned 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.640
 it needed 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.460
 Without Guinea's tribute to society, one has to be very clear that this is all 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.680
 What is inconvenient is what is conspicuous that the break 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.320
 is done during the opening goal deliberately in the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.810
 Rough shape but you have to say unfortunately way too often and too often 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.460
 Profile viewer against the interests of individuality how fast it is to 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.369
 Forced induction can confirm this earlier 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.330
 Nurse of a psychiatry 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.850
 Retirement homes would have people arrested 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.640
 the reasons for increasing cost pressure overload or simply 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.819
 Convenience vineyard 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.139
 which is about half a percent 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:23.039
 because dapd is his work then we will see that the people are being distributed 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.039
 that means that the country is after the expulsion 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.289
 then something will be called out of it 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.909
 we have ourselves most France 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.199
 completely harmless 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:41.689
 the law says the sufferer must either be himself or others 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:42.560
 threaten 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.920
 before it can be instructed by a doctor or caregiver, the aspect applies 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.820
 but caring more and more often, the fundamental rights would be affected 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.520
 broken during the now emeritus political scientist 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.989
 Whew the Canaries co-founder of the Committee of Fundamental Rights 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.140
 and democracy 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.539
 the ears move coast end sentence 1 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.299
 it will not come to that easily 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.679
 Human dignity is inviolable 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.679
 since winter both ministers emphasized 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:18.309
 Applications were made every year 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.529
 fundamental right 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:23.339
 we had several then founded 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:26.339
 completely changed that currently a lot of these lines 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.199
 the St joseph hospital in berlin-weisssee 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.719
 one of the clinics in which this AZ was housed 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:39.429
 a Christian showcase open democratic and modern 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:41.819
 the forced introduction of Giesela z 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.119
 Be expression of Puma never offender returns the line 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:47.220
 Westerners an ethical question 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.500
 In humans, a psychosis has become such a severe mental one 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.870
 Disturbance graphic leaves you there because you do not see illness yourself 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.500
 have in it and let them in their ranks without all sides in place 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.920
 the one duty of care and they also have to get one out of the 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.439
 Treat TuS Ickern 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.549
 the District Court has suspended the support for this term again 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.799
 she was able to freely embroider her will 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.320
 how far can a mentally ill person take responsibility for himself 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.289
 take over 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.119
 the line between caring and deprivation of liberty is sometimes narrow 

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:25.349
 a forced induction should remain the exception 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:29.209
 In case of doubt, more and more people are violating the rights of freedom of those affected 

00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:34.319
 decided and observed for the smooth running of the community 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:37.279
 also the Bremen criminal lawyer Helmut Kohl Nr 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:40.379
 the bow to his listeners the known and relatives 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.380
 and he creates what this disturbing factor so to speak of the ice for it yet 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:49.580
 Professionals with facilities and procedures so on these numbers 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.150
 More that's all the problem is that the care law is now 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.910
 he device has become to the big business and getting more and more every year 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:59.650
 more people 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.070
 under care is set up for the care concerned and 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.409
 to lock people away 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.469
 there is just comfortable 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:08.270
 no room for but 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.900
 the normalization of life has long since been established with the help of science 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.689
 you look for answers to the question what is normal what 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:16.839
 Sun normal 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:20.209
 but where science is supposed to provide clarity there is little room for 

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:24.569
 Grays that do not fit are locked away, the dangerous is just 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.520
 the readiness oasis 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.930
 with even more people even earlier 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.330
 Percent say no to say and then to Rios too 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.349
 seem to prevail 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.650
 a beforehand the company must be supported 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.570
 Percent one way or the other with chemistry including everyone 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.240
 lock away and so on and this readiness grows with the 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.970
 supposedly believing or having the supposed certainty Bradl has 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.590
 Science game against which is dangerous who should be sick of the 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.160
 Risks, and so on, the number of forced admissions increases 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.690
 rapid 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.350
 and also the number of childcare services has been scarce in the last 20 years 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.849
 tripled 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:05.020
 but what should give society the feeling of security 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.660
 there is a setback for the freedoms of hundreds of thousands of citizens 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.199
 as Giesela counts
