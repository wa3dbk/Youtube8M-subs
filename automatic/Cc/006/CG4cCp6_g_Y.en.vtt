00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
texture pack I run at 60 frames on the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.420 
texture pack I run at 60 frames on the
default<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.890> run<00:00:40.890> at<00:00:41.420> over<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> hundred<00:00:43.430> so

texture<00:02:53.239> packs<00:02:53.450> here<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.930> was<00:02:54.830> using<00:02:55.010> that<00:02:55.130> will

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
texture packs here I was using that will

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.530 
texture packs here I was using that will
be<00:02:55.520> photo<00:02:56.090> realism<00:02:56.450> and<00:03:00.730> see<00:03:01.730> how<00:03:01.820> fast<00:03:02.239> it's

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
be photo realism and see how fast it's

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.590 
be photo realism and see how fast it's
going<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.810> switch<00:03:02.989> to<00:03:03.020> this
