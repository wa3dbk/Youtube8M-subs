work some functions as well as learning

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.359 
work some functions as well as learning
the<00:00:18.090> trick<00:00:18.390> itself<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:25.170> Thomas<00:00:25.560> Ida<00:00:25.769> split<00:00:26.130> up

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
the trick itself the Thomas Ida split up

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.759 
the trick itself the Thomas Ida split up
into<00:00:26.609> three<00:00:27.000> sections<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:28.199> start<00:00:29.179> sensor<00:00:30.769> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
into three sections the start sensor and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.410 
into three sections the start sensor and
the<00:00:31.980> catch<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:34.559> let's<00:00:34.890> learn<00:00:35.130> how<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.489> start<00:00:35.940> it

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the catch so let's learn how to start it

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.660 
the catch so let's learn how to start it
there<00:00:37.140> are<00:00:37.290> many<00:00:37.530> ways<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.160> starting<00:00:38.550> with

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
there are many ways and starting with

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.030 
there are many ways and starting with
homicide<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.329> will<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.379> showing<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.829> one

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
homicide I will just be showing you one

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:52.610 
homicide I will just be showing you one
way<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.879> inverse<00:00:42.390> suicide<00:00:42.989> way<00:00:51.530> when<00:00:52.530> you

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
way the inverse suicide way when you

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.200 
way the inverse suicide way when you
practice<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.340> few<00:00:53.370> times<00:00:53.550> cuts<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
practice this a few times cuts the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.860 
practice this a few times cuts the
string<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.600> helicopter<00:00:56.539> after<00:00:57.539> you're

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
string in a helicopter after you're

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.510 
string in a helicopter after you're
happy<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.379> doing<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> helicopter<00:00:59.370> and

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
happy with doing the helicopter and

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.389 
happy with doing the helicopter and
unwrapping<00:01:00.000> gern<00:01:00.480> couch<00:01:00.899> try<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.800> unwrap<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
unwrapping gern couch try and unwrap the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.460 
unwrapping gern couch try and unwrap the
string<00:01:02.670> before<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.300> catch<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.750> now<00:01:04.229> let's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
string before you catch it now let's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.440 
string before you catch it now let's
learn<00:01:04.650> what<00:01:04.949> happens<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> center<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
learn what happens in the center of the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.539 
learn what happens in the center of the
trick<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.020> you've<00:01:07.500> now<00:01:07.650> got<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> start<00:01:08.280> ready

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
trick so you've now got the start ready

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.520 
trick so you've now got the start ready
and<00:01:08.790> all<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.090> need<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.930> center<00:01:10.320> is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
and all you need to do for the center is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.620 
and all you need to do for the center is
to<00:01:10.680> throw<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> string<00:01:11.310> around<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> axle<00:01:12.240> let

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
to throw the string around the axle let

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.820 
to throw the string around the axle let
go<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.900> both<00:01:13.110> sticks<00:01:14.750> as<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.439> halfway

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
go of both sticks as you can see halfway

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.560 
go of both sticks as you can see halfway
through<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.460> trick<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.060> two<00:01:18.270> sticks

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
through the trick that the two sticks

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.719 
through the trick that the two sticks
become<00:01:18.990> parallel<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.280> doesn't<00:01:20.520> happen

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
become parallel if this doesn't happen

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.370 
become parallel if this doesn't happen
when<00:01:21.060> your<00:01:21.240> sticks<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:21.960> gone<00:01:22.170> wrong

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
when your sticks you have gone wrong

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.890 
when your sticks you have gone wrong
somewhere<00:01:25.549> now<00:01:26.549> let's<00:01:26.820> learn<00:01:27.030> how<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> catch

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
somewhere now let's learn how to catch

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.109 
somewhere now let's learn how to catch
the<00:01:28.170> sticks<00:01:28.500> there<00:01:29.250> are<00:01:29.340> two<00:01:29.520> ways<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.939> catch

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the sticks there are two ways to catch

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.590 
the sticks there are two ways to catch
the<00:01:30.299> sticks<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.810> string<00:01:31.350> switch<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the sticks the string switch and the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.270 
the sticks the string switch and the
full<00:01:33.840> release<00:01:35.329> as<00:01:36.439> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.590> see<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
full release as you can see on the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.280 
full release as you can see on the
string<00:01:38.579> switch<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.180> swap<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> hand<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.200> you

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
string switch you swap the hand that you

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.289 
string switch you swap the hand that you
are<00:01:40.409> holding<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.920> string<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
are holding the string with but on the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.850 
are holding the string with but on the
full<00:01:42.509> release<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.170> let<00:01:43.350> go<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.680> whole

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
full release you let go of the whole

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.830 
full release you let go of the whole
thing<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.430> catch<00:01:44.610> both<00:01:44.880> sticks<00:01:45.270> separately

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
thing you catch both sticks separately

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.899 
thing you catch both sticks separately
if<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.560> are<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:46.920> learning<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.430> would<00:01:47.549> need<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
if you are just learning I would need a

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.789 
if you are just learning I would need a
string<00:01:48.240> switch<00:01:48.509> as<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> sticks<00:01:49.409> are<00:01:49.590> more

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
string switch as the sticks are more

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.859 
string switch as the sticks are more
controlled<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.850> after<00:01:51.149> time<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:51.750> you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
controlled but after time and if you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.840 
controlled but after time and if you
want<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.170> modify<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:52.979> side<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.729> may

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
want to modify it it on the side you may

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.639 
want to modify it it on the side you may
want<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.060> do<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.329> full<00:01:54.540> release<00:01:54.689> as<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.409> can

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
want to do the full release as you can

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.630 
want to do the full release as you can
easily<00:01:55.860> add<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.579> spin<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:56.909> example
