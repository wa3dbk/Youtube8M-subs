what<00:00:56.409> I<00:00:56.440> mean<00:00:56.769> right<00:00:57.580> here<00:00:58.059> like<00:00:58.360> this<00:00:58.540> will

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
what I mean right here like this will

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.479 
what I mean right here like this will
give<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:58.930> appearance<00:00:59.170> that<00:00:59.769> my<00:01:00.040> hairline<00:01:00.430> is

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
receding when it's not it's only because

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.000 
receding when it's not it's only because
the<00:01:02.800> wig<00:01:02.979> does<00:01:03.190> not<00:01:03.400> fit<00:01:03.729> properly<00:01:03.760> and<00:01:04.690> so<00:01:05.440> you

this money and the only reason why we're
tweezing<00:01:33.610> her<00:01:33.910> is<00:01:34.120> because<00:01:34.330> I<00:01:34.540> don't<00:01:34.990> have

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
tweezing her is because I don't have

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.560 
tweezing her is because I don't have

plans to cut it but you know this is an
invisible<00:01:38.020> part<00:01:38.560> wig<00:01:38.620> so<00:01:39.160> in<00:01:39.490> reality<00:01:40.120> you<00:01:41.110> are

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
invisible part wig so in reality you are

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.240

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430
