instructions<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.890> that's<00:02:20.730> pretty<00:02:21.090> much<00:02:21.269> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
instructions and that's pretty much the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.110 
instructions and that's pretty much the
way<00:02:21.569> it's<00:02:21.750> all<00:02:21.870> broken<00:02:22.260> out<00:02:22.730> Wally's<00:02:23.730> gonna<00:02:23.819> be

a<00:02:24.150> pretty<00:02:24.480> nice<00:02:24.750> fun<00:02:25.230> build<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.680> believe<00:02:26.060> and

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
a pretty nice fun build I believe and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.259 
a pretty nice fun build I believe and
since<00:02:30.920> it's<00:02:31.920> such<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.069> big<00:02:32.639> character<00:02:32.880> in<00:02:33.120> that

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
since it's such a big character in that

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.289 
since it's such a big character in that
