what what they are potentially are the

i can access reflects the fact that

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.950 
i can access reflects the fact that
these<00:00:31.349> are<00:00:31.820> uncomplete<00:00:32.820> listings<00:00:33.270> they<00:00:33.809> also

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
these are uncomplete listings they also

list it to be released in november i

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.500 
list it to be released in november i
think<00:00:35.820> again<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.300> date<00:00:37.140> would<00:00:37.380> probably<00:00:37.680> be

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
think again that date would probably be

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.119 
think again that date would probably be
subject<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> change<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.290> i<00:00:40.379> would<00:00:40.649> think<00:00:40.980> that

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
subject to change and i would think that

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.280 
subject to change and i would think that
to<00:00:41.460> release<00:00:41.969> these<00:00:42.210> wave<00:00:42.450> three<00:00:42.690> figures<00:00:42.899> that

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
to release these wave three figures that

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.799 
to release these wave three figures that
soon<00:00:43.590> would<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.700> potentially<00:00:44.789> more<00:00:45.510> than<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
soon would be potentially more than the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.420 
soon would be potentially more than the
market<00:00:46.020> would<00:00:46.320> bear<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> look

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
market would bear so just have a look

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.220 
market would bear so just have a look
going<00:00:48.059> through<00:00:48.329> them<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:48.570> at<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.750> time<00:00:48.960> we've
