 Well then I would like to explain to you how to use this dulde 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.960

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.060
 I'm about this much 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.100

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.490
 You propose 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.490
 I use it like this 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.320
 With that 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:04.990
 There is a lot of water here, but when using it in a shallow place less than 1 meter 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.210
 This weak jerk is a rod wrench for some reason 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.440
 Sakai City Day 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.710
 I such too much diving so much and I'll be weak 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.740
 Or if you jerk this upwards 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.030
 It is still sharp in the shallow range 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.460
 One us to 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.460

 Masser 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.800
 I did it 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.800
 Why 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:18.770
 I 'm good off 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.569
 Then around the age of 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.240
 Evening masume 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:25.889
 At the end 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.889
 I came alive 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.339
 While I get stuck 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.339
 Well then 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:45.650

 Today is One day using this Darudo 100 on Anjima 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.650
 I think I could capture the spring no pond 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.700
 Here is one point advice 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.270
 Mahal's no pond 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.100
 Dar and Car 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.870
 Of taking advantage of the good dart crisp 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.550
 It is a good fishing-paced 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:12.870
 It is hard to be traced by rusting with this 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:16.080
 I think that two such people were addicted today 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:22.009
 But this is weak but everyone 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:22.009

 Quick guitar with this sharp in was the kind of timing 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:56.500
