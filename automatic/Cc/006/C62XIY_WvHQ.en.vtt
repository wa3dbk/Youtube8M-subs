00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:05.170
 currently generates now we will talk a bit about the truck drivers' leader 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.670
 Why 60% more 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.710
 with the transport of cargo from Brazil 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.280
 is made by the roads 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.089
 but all this importance does not translate into infrastructure of highways 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.270
 according to the national transport confederation 75% of Brazilian roads 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.230
 has some degree of imperfection 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.240
 In addition cargo thefts that have already surpassed a thousand occurrences per year alone 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.080
 grow the pizzato fbi reporter went to know a little more 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.350
 it's difficult and still the truckers 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.409
 inside it off the track 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:39.409
 that's what we'll see now 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.319
 little distance for them can last forever 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:50.600
 while inside the house 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.860
 my representative in Brasilia 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.720
 in this action does not exist and forgiveness for the Northeastern the traced by the fatality 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.740
 medellín - in the southern region of chile 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.020
 plan B 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.810
 kristin davis alderman of this 75 year old lady 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.300
 for maria rita eight months became part of another statistic 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.780
 the Germans 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.780
 they cry for the fun videos on the roads 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.850
 gilmar fabris 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.310
 was 33 years old and a highway died in Paraiba 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.369
 only in the first eight months of that year 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.640
 statistics ons 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.670
 in general 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.159
 national level, but we have almost 30,000 accidents involving 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.380
 accidents happen 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.780
 in 3d good visibility 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.940
 almost 400 accidents occur with 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.600
 in broad daylight 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.810
 two thirds of these accidents 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.810
 happen so I wanted to get back together 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.560
 according to the abnt Brazilian association of traffic medicine 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.200
 ninety-two percent of the trucker's accidents are caused by 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.599
 human failure 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.389
 the same research indicates that 55% of them confessing that they direct 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.219
 - with 20% assuming that verdurama 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.000
 Added to sleep 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.519
 responsible for 60% of the accidents with the truck driver 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:36.569
 but we know that 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.810
 four hours of work the individual having achieved the attention 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:42.749
 chile has 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.479
 every now and then they explain 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:47.529
 attention braga 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:50.889
 the type of work that we have developed that has to have a concentration and 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.689
 permanent attention 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.549
 labor offices depend on those of attention 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:01.829
 and if you give your attention it will logically compete so that at 8 o'clock 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.839
 accidents increased by 1 2 times the risk of accidents 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:11.419
 a minute and a half to avoid all this marcelo did not accept a beautiful woman 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:16.329
 martini does not like driving at night or when he's at home enjoying every 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.499
 moment next to wife maria 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.499
 and both of them because they know what lies ahead 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.269
 from young lady 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.739
 the world 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.569
 so not for me 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.569
 per day 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.459
 the indigenous leader 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:41.039
 a marathon married to marcelo to two and a half years 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:43.339
 and thus being the Corinthian marking 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:44.350
 he left 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.419
 Do you keep expecting a phone call? 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.660
 his return 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.229
 it has passed through your head a concern for who pushed me 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:54.919
 more road safety 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:59.049
 if they always want to leave is already the last one of us worries about 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.359
 the accident case on the road ' 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.780
 is asphalt because they are as evident as none of these options 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.089
 management 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.209
 this one had a concern you have a qi 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.969
 I think everything 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:14.309
 which worries 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:16.859
 and this is part of the strategy 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.859
 the contraction of demand or we will see table 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:24.609
 a desperate my knowledge of him 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.449
 state 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.680
 left a woman at home 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.680
 often knows one day 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.270
 to ronaldo 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.169
 now for me 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.129
 For her, people do not have it. 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.289
 it's more that feeling of loneliness on her part 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:10.449
 from my part 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.719
 today the anniversary date of transportation 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.649
 You do not know the day that you treated well then you find little already 

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:19.120
 I am worried 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.919
 camilli valesca is very uncomfortable very small but in the least 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.300
 narrow 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.300
 that is the purpose 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:33.659
 I did not expect to be pressured by the Guimarães profession 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:37.219
 between the headlines 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.009
 the problem 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.539
 a serious mistake 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.539
 the defender admitted 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.580
 has air conditioning 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:55.439
 It's okay, then, the bce says. 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:06.210
 two people I said more can adopt 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.809
 has tightened 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:11.649
 I trained until italia improvise people that this food on the other bank in the 

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:14.649
 Street 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.260
 the initiative
