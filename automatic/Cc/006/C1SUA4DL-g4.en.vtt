00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.330 
think it's both okay what does a charge
really<00:00:42.180> do<00:00:42.329> because<00:00:42.780> you've<00:00:43.050> seen<00:00:43.500> how<00:00:43.800> strong

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
a little bit interesting as well but

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.070 
a little bit interesting as well but
with<00:01:11.880> how<00:01:12.000> wealth<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.450> addicts<00:01:12.689> been<00:01:12.840> doing

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
with how wealth and addicts been doing

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.359

and they've been pulling that pic i

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.679 
and they've been pulling that pic i
think<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.909> was<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> bit<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.330> an<00:01:15.420> experiment

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
think that was a bit of an experiment

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.130 
think that was a bit of an experiment
here<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:17.040> what<00:01:17.340> stood<00:01:17.549> out<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> me<00:01:17.880> was

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
here but really what stood out to me was

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.850 
here but really what stood out to me was
they<00:01:19.140> were<00:01:19.619> playing<00:01:19.950> such<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.090> methodical

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
they were playing such a methodical

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.679 
they were playing such a methodical
objective<00:01:22.860> based<00:01:23.189> game<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:24.509> they

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
objective based game you can see they

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.690 
objective based game you can see they
just<00:01:24.900> tried<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.290> take<00:01:25.530> every<00:01:25.890> advantage<00:01:25.920> went

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
they were just playing as textbook as

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.969 
they were just playing as textbook as
they<00:01:36.299> could<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:37.439> trying<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.740> get<00:01:37.860> them

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
they could I think trying to get them

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.130 
they could I think trying to get them
more<00:01:38.189> into<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.700> kind<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.420> mode<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.990> they

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
more into that kind of mode that they

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.300 
more into that kind of mode that they
want<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.650> going<00:01:40.920> into<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> playoffs

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
want to be and going into the playoffs

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.039 
want to be and going into the playoffs
and<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:42.600> did<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.780> because

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
and I like that they did that because

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.889 
and I like that they did that because
against<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> team<00:01:43.770> that's<00:01:44.149> looked<00:01:45.149> upon<00:01:45.840> as

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
against the team that's looked upon as

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.899 
against the team that's looked upon as
inferior<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.619> yourself<00:01:47.009> you're<00:01:47.369> often<00:01:47.579> want

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
inferior to yourself you're often want

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.460 
inferior to yourself you're often want
to<00:01:47.970> go<00:01:48.060> for<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.360> flashy<00:01:48.570> plays<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.170> know<00:01:49.259> just

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
to go for as flashy plays you know just

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.870 
to go for as flashy plays you know just
want<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.680> engage<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.950> know<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.280> better<00:01:50.549> so

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
want to engage you know you better so

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.120 
want to engage you know you better so
you'll<00:01:51.030> you'll<00:01:51.509> play<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:52.020> little<00:01:52.710> more<00:01:52.920> dive

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
you'll you'll play a little more dive

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.550 
you'll you'll play a little more dive
dive<00:01:53.579> harder<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.350> went<00:01:55.500> for

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
dive harder and I like that I went for

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.050 
dive harder and I like that I went for
the<00:01:55.649> methodical<00:01:55.890> approach<00:01:56.219> as<00:01:56.549> Monty<00:01:56.880> said

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the methodical approach as Monty said

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.580 
the methodical approach as Monty said
because<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.450> shows<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.229> respect

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
because it shows that they have respect

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.719 
because it shows that they have respect
for<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.799> game<00:01:58.920> they<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.250> all<00:01:59.399> what<00:01:59.610> they

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
for the game they just all what they

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.219 
for the game they just all what they
want<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.939> do<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.180> learn<00:02:00.360> from<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.899> it

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
want to do is learn from this and it

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.020 
want to do is learn from this and it
shows<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.469> even<00:02:01.530> from<00:02:01.890> these<00:02:02.100> easier<00:02:02.729> games

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
shows that even from these easier games

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.090 
shows that even from these easier games
they<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.270> still<00:02:03.570> learn<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.960> definitely<00:02:04.770> want

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
they can still learn I definitely want

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.590 
they can still learn I definitely want

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.850 
I thought it was very very good i felt
that<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.239> times<00:02:09.479> we<00:02:09.690> call<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.959> 2v<00:02:10.229> tues<00:02:10.410> his

that the times we call the 2v tues his

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.890 
that the times we call the 2v tues his

initiation seemed good he landed a lot

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.860 
initiation seemed good he landed a lot
of<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.050> abilities<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.440> he<00:02:13.590> needed

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
of the abilities that he needed

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.600 
of the abilities that he needed
to<00:02:13.989> there<00:02:14.379> was<00:02:14.530> some<00:02:14.860> counter<00:02:15.190> gangsta<00:02:15.489> that

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
to there was some counter gangsta that

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.670 
to there was some counter gangsta that
cost<00:02:16.120> some<00:02:16.330> lives<00:02:16.360> but<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:16.870> mean<00:02:17.049> that's<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.590> be

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
cost some lives but I mean that's to be

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.839 
cost some lives but I mean that's to be
expected<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.220> again<00:02:18.400> like<00:02:18.519> this<00:02:18.670> especially

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
expected and again like this especially

because<00:02:54.220> when<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.970> owner<00:02:55.120> was<00:02:55.239> locked<00:02:55.480> in<00:02:55.660> you

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
because when the owner was locked in you

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.990 
because when the owner was locked in you
know<00:02:56.379> off<00:02:56.560> camera<00:02:56.590> we're<00:02:57.459> lucky<00:02:57.670> enough<00:02:57.849> to

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
know off camera we're lucky enough to

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.610 
know off camera we're lucky enough to
sit<00:02:58.209> with<00:02:58.359> these<00:02:58.659> guys<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:58.900> talk<00:02:59.230> about<00:02:59.409> the

about the 2v once when do you initiate

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.899 
about the 2v once when do you initiate
it<00:03:10.209> why<00:03:10.959> do<00:03:11.019> you<00:03:11.260> initiate<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.739> 2v1<00:03:12.129> how

at<00:03:22.540> home<00:03:22.690> i<00:03:23.340> don't<00:03:24.340> know<00:03:24.519> if<00:03:24.669> they<00:03:24.760> really

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
at home i don't know if they really

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.550 
at home i don't know if they really
thought<00:03:25.000> about<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.419> theory<00:03:25.750> behind<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:26.139> so

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
thought about the theory behind it so

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.470 
thought about the theory behind it so
originally<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.340> feel<00:03:27.700> like<00:03:27.790> TV<00:03:28.090> ones<00:03:28.239> came

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
originally I feel like TV ones came

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.470 
originally I feel like TV ones came
about<00:03:28.690> because<00:03:29.430> strategically<00:03:30.430> if<00:03:30.609> you<00:03:30.730> push

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
about because strategically if you push

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.720 
about because strategically if you push
push<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.840> 2v1<00:03:32.260> onto<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:32.829> team<00:03:33.129> that<00:03:33.310> doesn't<00:03:33.519> know

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
push a 2v1 onto a team that doesn't know

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.339 
push a 2v1 onto a team that doesn't know
how<00:03:33.849> to<00:03:33.910> deal<00:03:34.180> with<00:03:34.329> it<00:03:34.450> so<00:03:34.480> you'll<00:03:35.079> even<00:03:35.230> see

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
how to deal with it so you'll even see

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.800 
how to deal with it so you'll even see
even<00:03:35.889> though<00:03:36.069> Koreans<00:03:36.459> are<00:03:36.549> really<00:03:36.819> adept<00:03:37.540> at

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
even though Koreans are really adept at

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.479 
even though Koreans are really adept at
to<00:03:38.079> be<00:03:38.200> wanting<00:03:38.440> they<00:03:38.620> are<00:03:38.889> not<00:03:39.069> necessarily

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
to be wanting they are not necessarily

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.920 
to be wanting they are not necessarily
really<00:03:39.790> good<00:03:39.970> at<00:03:40.180> dealing<00:03:40.389> with<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.660> three<00:03:40.810> be

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
really good at dealing with the three be

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.689 
really good at dealing with the three be
one<00:03:41.079> dive<00:03:41.260> as<00:03:41.440> they<00:03:41.560> came<00:03:41.709> in<00:03:41.859> two<00:03:41.980> worlds<00:03:42.310> so

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
one dive as they came in two worlds so

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.309 
one dive as they came in two worlds so
you<00:03:43.150> can<00:03:43.299> push<00:03:43.510> strategies<00:03:43.870> like<00:03:43.989> that<00:03:44.169> and

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
you can push strategies like that and

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.629 
you can push strategies like that and
catch<00:03:44.470> people<00:03:44.739> off<00:03:44.829> guard<00:03:44.859> but<00:03:45.250> not<00:03:45.400> only<00:03:45.549> that

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
catch people off guard but not only that

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.490 
catch people off guard but not only that
it<00:03:46.060> allows<00:03:46.389> you<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.569> have<00:03:46.660> a<00:03:46.690> weak<00:03:46.959> duo<00:03:47.199> lane

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
it allows you to have a weak duo lane

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.369 
it allows you to have a weak duo lane
and<00:03:47.739> end<00:03:48.430> up<00:03:48.910> having<00:03:49.239> them<00:03:49.389> split<00:03:49.720> even<00:03:49.989> in<00:03:50.109> CS

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
and end up having them split even in CS

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:51.780 
and end up having them split even in CS
with<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.739> with<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.040> enemies<00:03:51.370> tube<00:03:51.549> you<00:03:51.639> want

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
with the with the enemies tube you want

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.189 
with the with the enemies tube you want
while<00:03:51.940> simultaneously<00:03:52.299> holding<00:03:52.750> down<00:03:53.049> the

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
while simultaneously holding down the

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.170 
while simultaneously holding down the
enemy's<00:03:53.410> top<00:03:53.590> laner<00:03:53.769> so<00:03:53.980> for<00:03:54.340> example<00:03:54.430> if<00:03:54.819> the

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
enemy's top laner so for example if the

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.400 
enemy's top laner so for example if the
enemy<00:03:55.359> top<00:03:55.540> laner<00:03:55.720> was<00:03:55.930> something<00:03:56.230> like<00:03:56.349> a

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
enemy top laner was something like a

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.839 
enemy top laner was something like a
cinch<00:03:56.799> who<00:03:57.040> you<00:03:57.129> need<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.310> hold<00:03:57.430> down<00:03:57.609> or<00:03:57.760> else

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
cinch who you need to hold down or else

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.159 
cinch who you need to hold down or else
to<00:03:57.970> become<00:03:58.180> an<00:03:58.269> unstoppable<00:03:58.419> split<00:03:58.900> pusher

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
to become an unstoppable split pusher

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.189 
to become an unstoppable split pusher
you<00:03:59.470> would<00:03:59.590> want<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.769> be<00:04:00.010> one<00:04:00.129> into<00:04:00.340> that<00:04:01.199> it's

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:02.199 
you would want to be one into that it's

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.420 
you would want to be one into that it's
actually<00:04:02.470> really<00:04:02.590> interesting<00:04:02.680> how<00:04:03.190> it<00:04:03.340> is

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
actually really interesting how it is

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.159 
actually really interesting how it is
developed<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.150> still<00:04:04.419> remember<00:04:04.449> playing<00:04:04.930> its

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
developed I still remember playing its

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:06.449 
developed I still remember playing its
role<00:04:05.319> delete<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.709> first<00:04:05.859> time<00:04:06.099> they<00:04:06.220> swapped

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
role delete the first time they swapped

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:07.710 
role delete the first time they swapped
their<00:04:06.579> bottling<00:04:06.970> up<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.180> top<00:04:07.359> and<00:04:07.540> you're<00:04:07.629> like

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
their bottling up to top and you're like

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.270 
their bottling up to top and you're like
what<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.079> hell<00:04:08.260> is<00:04:08.410> going<00:04:08.680> on<00:04:08.739> why<00:04:08.949> would<00:04:09.190> you

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
what the hell is going on why would you

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.860 
what the hell is going on why would you
do<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:09.459> so<00:04:10.120> basically<00:04:10.449> they<00:04:10.510> did<00:04:10.629> I<00:04:10.750> would

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
do that so basically they did I would

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.569 
do that so basically they did I would
bad<00:04:11.019> matchups<00:04:11.470> either<00:04:11.680> top<00:04:11.980> play<00:04:12.129> matchup<00:04:12.459> you

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
bad matchups either top play matchup you

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.129 
bad matchups either top play matchup you

mind games that come out from this so

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.760 
mind games that come out from this so
first<00:05:16.479> of<00:05:16.659> all<00:05:16.719> you<00:05:16.870> talk<00:05:17.020> about<00:05:17.050> even<00:05:17.349> setting

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
first of all you talk about even setting

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.290 
first of all you talk about even setting

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
up a two-on-one and as well which lane

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.480

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
did it go for back in season two as well

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.430 
did it go for back in season two as well
red<00:05:21.909> team<00:05:22.150> usually<00:05:22.389> goes<00:05:22.750> top<00:05:23.050> lane<00:05:23.289> because

red team usually goes top lane because

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.959 
red team usually goes top lane because
double<00:05:23.860> golems<00:05:24.159> and<00:05:24.280> there<00:05:24.490> was<00:05:24.580> a<00:05:24.610> real

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:24.969 
double golems and there was a real

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.119 
double golems and there was a real
reason<00:05:25.300> to<00:05:25.479> not<00:05:25.659> do<00:05:25.900> that<00:05:26.080> then<00:05:26.560> maybe<00:05:26.919> you

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:27.129 
reason to not do that then maybe you

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.129 
reason to not do that then maybe you
juked<00:05:27.370> people<00:05:27.819> out<00:05:28.000> but<00:05:28.210> then<00:05:28.509> secondary<00:05:29.020> to

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
juked people out but then secondary to

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.869 
juked people out but then secondary to
that<00:05:29.199> you<00:05:29.680> look<00:05:29.860> at<00:05:29.979> like<00:05:30.069> jungle<00:05:30.460> patterns

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:30.879 
that you look at like jungle patterns

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.189 
that you look at like jungle patterns
for<00:05:31.000> example<00:05:31.300> a<00:05:31.330> member<00:05:31.539> on<00:05:31.659> one<00:05:31.840> of<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:31.990> very

for example a member on one of the very

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.529 
for example a member on one of the very
first<00:05:32.469> days<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:33.460> blue<00:05:33.639> side<00:05:33.819> jungler<00:05:34.150> got<00:05:34.270> his

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
first days the blue side jungler got his

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.870 
first days the blue side jungler got his
blue<00:05:34.870> into<00:05:35.289> enemy<00:05:35.650> red<00:05:35.860> and<00:05:36.069> was<00:05:36.279> right<00:05:36.580> there

largely because of 2v ones because she's

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.420 
largely because of 2v ones because she's
so<00:05:50.050> strong<00:05:50.380> in<00:05:50.500> lane<00:05:50.650> people<00:05:51.009> want<00:05:51.190> to<00:05:51.279> dodge

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
against hers let's say you're playing

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.909 
against hers let's say you're playing
against<00:05:53.020> a<00:05:53.110> Caitlyn<00:05:53.289> you<00:05:53.469> don't<00:05:53.620> want<00:05:53.740> a<00:05:53.800> lane

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
against a Caitlyn you don't want a lane

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.439 
against a Caitlyn you don't want a lane
against<00:05:54.190> Caitlyn<00:05:54.460> so<00:05:54.610> you<00:05:54.729> dodged<00:05:54.880> into<00:05:55.060> one

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
against Caitlyn so you dodged into one

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.209 
against Caitlyn so you dodged into one
that<00:05:55.779> puts<00:05:55.990> her<00:05:56.080> in<00:05:56.199> an<00:05:56.289> amazing<00:05:56.830> position

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:57.219 
that puts her in an amazing position

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:58.920 
that puts her in an amazing position

not just arguably the best ad at to be

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.279 
not just arguably the best ad at to be
wanting<00:06:01.539> because<00:06:01.719> they<00:06:01.779> were<00:06:01.870> pushing<00:06:02.169> power
