00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.690
 forecast for July 10th 20 friends went 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.800
 so the second decade of July is an interesting time 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.750
 fishing adventures weather pleases 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.890
 light day 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.800
 although in the afternoon in the scorching sun fishing 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.280
 tedious and hard for real fishermen 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.260
 there will be a bust in fishing during this period 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.949
 basically the bursts are cool on 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.350
 early dawn and evening period

 almost all the fish becomes 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.180
 predictable and stable 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.970
 Cyril because of the heat almost all fish 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.960
 goes to the depth or turns in places 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:09.080

 and fishing becomes uncomfortable and 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.690
 lethargic 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.550
 pikeperch is well caught during this period 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.440
 heads perch chuka 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.540
 bream and carp crucian carp roach and rudd 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.750
 become capricious and have a long time 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.170
 to persuade the rest of the fish to bite and 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.430
 from the sultry heat goes to deep pits and 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.950

 reservoirs with stagnant water or on rivers 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.230
 with a weak course of lure should
