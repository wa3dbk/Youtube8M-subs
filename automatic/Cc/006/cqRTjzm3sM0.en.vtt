however<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.280> Samsung<00:02:51.790> with<00:02:52.329> its<00:02:52.510> much<00:02:52.750> bigger

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
however the Samsung with its much bigger

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.270 
however the Samsung with its much bigger
screen<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.530> would<00:02:53.620> think<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.129> would

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
screen you would think that it would

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.899 
screen you would think that it would
weigh<00:02:54.459> more

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
weigh more

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.059

nope<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.329> only<00:02:55.480> weighs<00:02:55.750> four<00:02:56.470> point<00:02:56.799> six

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
nope it only weighs four point six

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.399 
nope it only weighs four point six
ounces<00:02:57.579> so<00:02:57.790> it's<00:02:57.939> just<00:02:58.180> marginally<00:02:58.629> lighter

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
ounces so it's just marginally lighter

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.679 
ounces so it's just marginally lighter
excuse<00:02:59.950> me<00:03:00.099> marginally<00:03:00.609> heavier<00:03:00.909> than<00:03:01.480> the

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:01.689 
excuse me marginally heavier than the

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.409 
excuse me marginally heavier than the
nokia<00:03:02.079> phone<00:03:02.409> so<00:03:02.919> considering<00:03:03.879> the<00:03:04.000> size<00:03:04.209> of

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419 
nokia phone so considering the size of

nokia phone so considering the size of
the<00:03:04.480> screen<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:05.049> can<00:03:05.079> see<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.560> relative

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
the screen you can see the relative

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.429 
the screen you can see the relative
thicknesses<00:03:06.669> here<00:03:06.909> the<00:03:07.359> Samsung<00:03:07.900> phone<00:03:08.200> on

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
thicknesses here the Samsung phone on

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.069 
thicknesses here the Samsung phone on
the<00:03:08.560> right<00:03:08.829> is<00:03:09.099> actually<00:03:10.030> thinner<00:03:10.689> than<00:03:10.930> the

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
the right is actually thinner than the

the right is actually thinner than the
nokia<00:03:11.439> phone<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:12.189> all<00:03:12.459> things<00:03:12.669> considered

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
nokia phone so all things considered

the display over here the Samsung sinks
a<00:03:18.549> long<00:03:18.819> three-pointer<00:03:19.209> with<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.169> fact<00:03:20.379> that

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
a long three-pointer with the fact that

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.500 
a long three-pointer with the fact that
its<00:03:20.739> weight<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.220> more<00:03:21.519> or<00:03:21.669> less<00:03:21.729> the<00:03:22.060> same<00:03:22.239> as

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
its weight is more or less the same as
