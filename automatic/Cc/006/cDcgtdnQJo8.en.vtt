 world of the human being and the magical world 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.949
 It gets together in the night of San Juan there 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.110
 Celtic ritual objects that were believed the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.390
 San Juan night there are some plants that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.000
 nothing else is given on that day those plants 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.270
 you take them in a dark container or 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.700
 glass lids and so are supposed to 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.140
 there are going to be an elf colors cap I know 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.900
 that our own elf that is going to be 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.810
 at your service but these little ones 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.340
 they have a dark and gloomy past 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.680
 the story relates that many years ago 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.929
 it was Saint Patrick who banished these 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.230
 beings from your country expelled by their 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.620
 sorcery and nexus 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.930
 with Satanism they love orgies 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.750
 they somehow provoke what 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:45.200
 promote this situation then 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.380
 they are also very ambiguous part d 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.690
 sexuality as a sexual part have 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.120
 that now you can call it 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.040
 Well, need to feed 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.740
 sexually because it 's level of love 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.780
 due to these acts they were earning the 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.760
 terror and contempt of all 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.530
 people in the network circulate about 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.570
 videos that could be taken as 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.820
 evidence that these beings are more 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.340
 close to what we think in a factory 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.380
 it was possible to capture a small being that passes 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.390
 from one place to another you have the suspicion 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.090
 that this place was home to hundreds 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.460
 of goblins which was destroyed for the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.890
 construction of said factory another 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.320
 evidence could be this video which 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.720
 It was taken inside an art gallery 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.610
 The most surprising thing is that this painting 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.320
 which has as a background a forest 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.840
 seem to be inhabited by a small 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.760
 goblin if we approach the image you can 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.730
 see clearly how the little person 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.410
 move between the trees of the painting 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.170
 surprising you do not believe it will be that the 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.150
 reality has surpassed fantasy or 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.370
 this will be a call to humanity for 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.320
 Take care of your planet for good or for 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.270
 wrong while the human being does not learn to 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.880
 take care of your environment apparently the 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.190
 goblins will continue among us remember 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.140
 they are watching us 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.140
