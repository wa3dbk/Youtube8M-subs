working because usually in one day I can

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.729 
working because usually in one day I can
go<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> my<00:00:51.570> video<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.930> I'll<00:00:52.199> see<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.559> within

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
go to my video and I'll see that within

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.670 
go to my video and I'll see that within
the<00:00:53.070> first<00:00:53.600> eight<00:00:54.600> hours<00:00:55.110> or<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.410> it'll<00:00:55.590> be

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the first eight hours or so it'll be

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.090 
the first eight hours or so it'll be
like<00:00:55.739> maybe<00:00:56.039> 900<00:00:56.969> 800<00:00:57.420> views<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.829> video

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
like maybe 900 800 views and that video

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.560 
like maybe 900 800 views and that video
I<00:00:59.160> think<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.460> probably<00:00:59.609> like<00:00:59.789> 500<00:01:00.480> or

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
I think it's probably like 500 or

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.900 
I think it's probably like 500 or
something<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.489> for<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.550> topics

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
something like that and for the topics

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.429 
something like that and for the topics
where<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.180> was<00:01:03.449> talking<00:01:03.840> about<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.199> only<00:01:04.350> been

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
where I was talking about it's only been

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.020 
where I was talking about it's only been
just<00:01:04.710> stabbed<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.250> any<00:01:05.400> video<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.790> do

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
just stabbed but just any video I do

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.940 
just stabbed but just any video I do
make<00:01:06.210> where<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.510> am<00:01:06.780> talking<00:01:06.990> about<00:01:07.200> really

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
make where I am talking about really

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.469 
make where I am talking about really
basically<00:01:08.250> anything<00:01:08.610> it'll<00:01:08.970> get<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> same

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
basically anything it'll get the same

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.120 
basically anything it'll get the same
type<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.840> feedback<00:01:10.200> it'll<00:01:10.740> get<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> same

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
type of feedback it'll get the same

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.399 
type of feedback it'll get the same
amount<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:12.270> view<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.840> always<00:01:12.960> tell<00:01:13.049> when

some<00:01:57.240> some<00:01:57.990> nudes<00:01:58.290> very<00:01:59.130> very<00:01:59.340> interesting

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
some some nudes very very interesting

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.550 
some some nudes very very interesting
especially<00:02:00.000> because<00:02:00.450> he<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.810> married<00:02:01.020> man<00:02:01.350> I

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
especially because he is a married man I

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.170 
especially because he is a married man I
thought<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.369> was<00:02:02.490> absolutely<00:02:03.030> insane

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
thought that that was absolutely insane

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.600 
thought that that was absolutely insane
and<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.770> see<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.100> know<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.340> damage

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
and to see you know the damage

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.609 
and to see you know the damage
especially<00:02:05.969> right<00:02:06.360> after<00:02:06.390> keemstar<00:02:07.020> was<00:02:07.380> let

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
especially right after keemstar was let

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.609 
especially right after keemstar was let
back<00:02:07.890> into<00:02:08.190> him<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:09.840> let<00:02:10.140> allowed<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.500> go

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
back into him like let allowed to go

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.320 
back into him like let allowed to go
back<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.950> umg<00:02:11.220> events<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.790> would<00:02:11.940> think<00:02:12.150> that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
back to umg events you would think that

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.910 
back to umg events you would think that
he

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
he

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.339 
he
maybe<00:02:13.099> I<00:02:13.550> guess<00:02:14.090> I'll<00:02:14.330> have<00:02:14.569> some<00:02:14.810> mercy<00:02:15.050> or

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
maybe I guess I'll have some mercy or

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.490 
maybe I guess I'll have some mercy or
something<00:02:15.860> like<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.340> know<00:02:16.370> he'd<00:02:16.640> maybe

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
something like that you know he'd maybe

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.260 
something like that you know he'd maybe
not<00:02:18.500> report<00:02:18.950> on<00:02:19.069> it<00:02:19.220> because<00:02:19.489> he<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:20.030> caught

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
not report on it because he just caught

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.290 
not report on it because he just caught
a<00:02:20.420> loud<00:02:20.720> he's<00:02:20.989> got<00:02:21.230> unbanned<00:02:21.800> from<00:02:22.220> all<00:02:22.730> um<00:02:23.030> you

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
best for Chris because that was a very

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.780 
best for Chris because that was a very
very<00:02:30.140> shitty<00:02:30.410> situation<00:02:31.069> that<00:02:31.190> he's<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.459> right

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
now I'm very sure he's gonna probably

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.830 
now I'm very sure he's gonna probably
have<00:02:34.760> some<00:02:34.970> problems<00:02:35.330> with<00:02:35.450> his<00:02:35.660> wife
