park<00:02:35.200> because<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.560> already<00:02:35.950> did<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.940> I

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
park because I already did that and I

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.600 
park because I already did that and I
already<00:02:37.360> had<00:02:37.540> had<00:02:37.870> program<00:02:38.500> but<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.250> actually

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
already had had program but I actually

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.820 
already had had program but I actually
read<00:02:39.970> downloaded<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:40.630> for<00:02:41.320> sake<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.680> this

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
tutorial so right after this a is parked

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.840 
tutorial so right after this a is parked
and<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.210> value<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.750> hundred<00:02:47.350> just<00:02:48.250> click<00:02:48.610> on

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
and the value is hundred just click on

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.670 
and the value is hundred just click on
park<00:02:49.570> all<00:02:50.910> after<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.000> click<00:02:52.270> that<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:53.530> need

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
park all after you click that you need

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.220 
park all after you click that you need
to<00:02:53.800> wait<00:02:54.010> for<00:02:54.040> for<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.790> moment<00:02:55.270> until<00:02:55.480> it<00:02:55.990> will

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.580 
to actually use it because most games
are<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:07.480> know<00:03:07.600> are<00:03:07.930> not<00:03:07.990> up<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.560> that

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
are you know are not up to that

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.850 
are you know are not up to that
optimized<00:03:09.310> for<00:03:09.550> running<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.540> know<00:03:10.660> Gua<00:03:11.470> cores

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
optimized for running you know Gua cores

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.900 
optimized for running you know Gua cores
CPUs<00:03:12.550> most<00:03:13.540> games<00:03:13.900> like<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.860> run<00:03:15.070> a<00:03:15.280> dual<00:03:15.580> core

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
CPUs most games like to run a dual core

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.150 
CPUs most games like to run a dual core
even<00:03:16.210> though<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.690> have<00:03:16.870> in<00:03:17.080> co<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.290> core<00:03:17.590> CPUs

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
even though you have in co a core CPUs

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.950 
even though you have in co a core CPUs
because<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.790> doesn't<00:03:19.090> matter<00:03:19.240> test<00:03:19.540> that

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
because it doesn't matter test that

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.710 
because it doesn't matter test that
that's<00:03:20.230> just<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.560> way<00:03:20.830> that<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.720> developers

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
that's just the way that the developers

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.580 
that's just the way that the developers
optimize<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.680> game<00:03:23.860> but<00:03:24.670> with<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:25.600> value

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
optimize the game but with this value

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.060 
optimize the game but with this value
this<00:03:26.950> is<00:03:27.070> actually<00:03:27.580> a<00:03:27.610> program<00:03:28.410> program<00:03:29.410> know

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
this is actually a program program know

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.300 
this is actually a program program know
which<00:03:30.880> has<00:03:31.360> been<00:03:31.570> done<00:03:31.840> by<00:03:32.230> someone<00:03:32.710> else<00:03:32.920> that

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
which has been done by someone else that

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.350 
which has been done by someone else that
can<00:03:33.610> actually<00:03:34.290> go<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.320> your<00:03:36.360> operating

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
can actually go to your operating

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.440 
can actually go to your operating
systems<00:03:37.840> registry<00:03:38.830> settings<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:39.460> changes

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
systems registry settings and changes

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.730 
systems registry settings and changes
this<00:03:40.780> easily<00:03:41.530> we<00:03:42.280> just<00:03:42.580> click<00:03:42.850> of<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.090> button<00:03:43.740> so

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
this easily we just click of a button so

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.860 
this easily we just click of a button so
you<00:03:45.460> have<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.700> you<00:03:46.030> don't<00:03:46.210> need<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.510> do<00:03:46.630> that

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
you have to you don't need to do that

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.900 
you have to you don't need to do that
you<00:03:47.170> know<00:03:47.290> manually<00:03:47.860> on<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.220> registry<00:03:48.610> saying

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
you know manually on the registry saying

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.550 
you know manually on the registry saying
since<00:03:49.270> if<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.570> don't<00:03:49.750> have<00:03:49.930> like<00:03:50.200> if<00:03:50.350> you're

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
since if you don't have like if you're

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.970 
since if you don't have like if you're
non<00:03:50.770> expert<00:03:51.420> Windows<00:03:52.420> 7<00:03:52.840> or<00:03:53.020> any<00:03:53.200> windows<00:03:53.680> or

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
non expert Windows 7 or any windows or

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.500 
non expert Windows 7 or any windows or
green<00:03:54.460> system<00:03:54.880> user<00:03:55.800> so<00:03:56.800> so<00:03:57.520> most<00:03:57.790> game<00:03:58.030> should

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
green system user so so most game should

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.810 
green system user so so most game should
run<00:03:58.780> all<00:03:59.020> your<00:03:59.290> four<00:03:59.530> cores<00:03:59.860> if<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:00.460> haven't

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
run all your four cores if you haven't

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.730 
run all your four cores if you haven't
quad<00:04:01.090> core<00:04:01.390> but<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:02.020> don't<00:04:02.290> actually<00:04:02.440> recommend

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
quad core but I don't actually recommend

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.910 
quad core but I don't actually recommend
this<00:04:03.160> like<00:04:03.480> like<00:04:04.480> for<00:04:04.750> six<00:04:04.990> cores<00:04:05.320> I<00:04:05.470> have<00:04:05.770> no

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
this like like for six cores I have no

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.830 
this like like for six cores I have no
idea<00:04:06.160> because<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.550> never<00:04:06.700> owned<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.360> six<00:04:07.630> core

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
idea because I never owned a six core

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.100 
idea because I never owned a six core
CPU<00:04:08.290> so<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:08.620> don't<00:04:08.920> have<00:04:09.130> any<00:04:09.370> idea<00:04:09.790> about<00:04:10.120> these

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
CPU so I don't have any idea about these

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.620 
CPU so I don't have any idea about these
six<00:04:11.320> cores<00:04:11.590> but<00:04:11.890> I<00:04:11.920> do<00:04:12.340> have<00:04:12.640> an<00:04:12.790> idea<00:04:13.090> for<00:04:13.240> the

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
six cores but I do have an idea for the

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.630 
six cores but I do have an idea for the
quad<00:04:14.020> core<00:04:14.290> CPU<00:04:14.740> is<00:04:14.890> this<00:04:15.070> I<00:04:15.220> have<00:04:15.340> works

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
quad core CPU is this I have works

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.990 
quad core CPU is this I have works
pretty<00:04:15.880> well<00:04:16.230> but<00:04:17.230> it<00:04:17.590> actually<00:04:17.859> boosts<00:04:18.760> your

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
pretty well but it actually boosts your

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.450 
pretty well but it actually boosts your
FPS<00:04:19.210> is<00:04:19.780> truly<00:04:20.430> truly<00:04:21.430> working<00:04:22.410> so<00:04:23.460> absolutely

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
FPS is truly truly working so absolutely

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.450 
FPS is truly truly working so absolutely
finish<00:04:24.820> that<00:04:25.290> it's<00:04:26.290> close
