00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
specific balsamic flavor with this but

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.650 
specific balsamic flavor with this but
um<00:06:26.530> you<00:06:27.190> don't<00:06:27.310> have<00:06:27.550> any<00:06:27.760> that<00:06:28.030> I<00:06:28.270> don't<00:06:28.540> taste

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
um you don't have any that I don't taste

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.480 
um you don't have any that I don't taste
any<00:06:28.840> vinegar<00:06:29.020> at<00:06:29.349> all<00:06:29.530> period<00:06:29.830> and<00:06:30.190> that's

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
any vinegar at all period and that's

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.100 
any vinegar at all period and that's
probably<00:06:30.669> contributing<00:06:31.539> to<00:06:31.539> the<00:06:31.780> fact<00:06:32.020> that

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
probably contributing to the fact that

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.710 
probably contributing to the fact that
it<00:06:32.260> has<00:06:32.410> a<00:06:32.440> balsamic<00:06:33.660> actually

starting to drool put quite a bit yeah
it's<00:06:38.080> getting<00:06:38.290> the<00:06:38.350> drooling<00:06:39.040> going<00:06:39.310> but<00:06:39.490> it's

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
it's getting the drooling going but it's

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.660 
it's getting the drooling going but it's
