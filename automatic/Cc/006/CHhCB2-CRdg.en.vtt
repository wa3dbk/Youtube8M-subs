game<00:00:40.780> was<00:00:40.960> okay<00:00:41.290> i<00:00:41.320> thought<00:00:41.560> we<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:43.180> lost<00:00:43.330> a<00:00:43.510> lot

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
game was okay i thought we we lost a lot

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.910 
game was okay i thought we we lost a lot
of<00:00:43.660> but<00:00:43.870> well<00:00:44.020> we<00:00:44.170> didn't<00:00:44.320> lose<00:00:44.440> a<00:00:44.500> little<00:00:44.710> ball

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
of but well we didn't lose a little ball

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.050 
of but well we didn't lose a little ball
but<00:00:45.070> we<00:00:45.160> didn't<00:00:45.340> have<00:00:45.430> a<00:00:45.490> lot<00:00:45.610> of<00:00:45.670> ball<00:00:45.880> at<00:00:45.970> the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
but we didn't have a lot of ball at the

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.220 
but we didn't have a lot of ball at the
back<00:00:46.210> end<00:00:46.420> of<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.570> half<00:00:46.720> where<00:00:46.960> they<00:00:47.050> come

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
back end of the half where they come

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.670 
back end of the half where they come
back<00:00:47.380> into<00:00:47.560> the<00:00:47.710> game<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:50.200> know<00:00:50.320> there's<00:00:50.590> a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
back into the game you know there's a

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.920 
back into the game you know there's a
your<00:00:51.070> decisions<00:00:51.490> are<00:00:51.610> questionable<00:00:52.540> but<00:00:52.750> i'm

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
your decisions are questionable but i'm

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.600 
your decisions are questionable but i'm
probably<00:00:53.559> have<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:53.830> run<00:00:53.980> them<00:00:54.130> parts<00:00:54.400> to<00:00:54.580> it

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
probably have to run them parts to it

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.180 
probably have to run them parts to it
but<00:00:54.910> i<00:00:55.320> thought<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.470> second<00:00:56.830> half<00:00:56.980> our

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
but i thought the second half our

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.890 
but i thought the second half our
kicking<00:00:57.370> game<00:00:57.489> dropped<00:00:58.180> off<00:00:58.330> a<00:00:58.360> little<00:00:58.570> bit<00:00:58.750> we

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
kicking game dropped off a little bit we

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.000 
kicking game dropped off a little bit we
just<00:00:58.930> didn't<00:00:59.230> get<00:00:59.290> any<00:00:59.440> distance<00:00:59.739> on<00:00:59.920> their

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
just didn't get any distance on their

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.210 
just didn't get any distance on their
kicks<00:01:00.220> and<00:01:00.540> but<00:01:01.540> you<00:01:02.290> know<00:01:02.440> full<00:01:02.890> credit<00:01:03.040> to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
kicks and but you know full credit to

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.710 
kicks and but you know full credit to
our<00:01:03.340> guys<00:01:03.610> they<00:01:03.640> showed<00:01:04.059> a<00:01:04.089> lot<00:01:04.239> of<00:01:04.270> desire

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
our guys they showed a lot of desire

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.960 
our guys they showed a lot of desire
I'll<00:01:05.650> add<00:01:05.800> a<00:01:05.830> lot<00:01:05.979> of<00:01:06.040> ball<00:01:06.250> on<00:01:06.430> our<00:01:06.580> goal<00:01:06.760> line

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
I'll add a lot of ball on our goal line

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.090 
I'll add a lot of ball on our goal line
and<00:01:07.150> we<00:01:07.900> hung<00:01:08.050> in<00:01:08.229> there<00:01:08.260> and<00:01:08.530> we<00:01:08.590> scrambled

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
and we hung in there and we scrambled

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.460 
and we hung in there and we scrambled
them<00:01:09.300> you<00:01:10.300> know<00:01:10.390> we<00:01:10.509> repelled<00:01:10.900> attack<00:01:11.259> after

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
them you know we repelled attack after

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.020 
them you know we repelled attack after
attack<00:01:11.680> after<00:01:12.040> attack<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:12.700> then<00:01:12.790> we<00:01:12.880> came

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
attack after attack and then we came

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.760 
attack after attack and then we came
away<00:01:13.240> and<00:01:13.540> ended<00:01:13.780> up<00:01:13.869> with<00:01:13.990> penalty<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.440> put

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
away and ended up with penalty and put

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:42.429 
away and ended up with penalty and put
it<00:01:14.860> away<00:01:14.950> so<00:01:15.700> over<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.030> moon

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.200 

you<00:01:43.439> bring<00:01:43.619> my<00:01:43.770> executed<00:01:44.490> real<00:01:44.670> well<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:44.880> go

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
you bring my executed real well and go

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.700 
you bring my executed real well and go
we<00:01:45.719> certainly<00:01:45.990> didn't<00:01:46.229> do<00:01:46.289> what<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.530> planned

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
we certainly didn't do what we planned

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.410 
we certainly didn't do what we planned
to<00:01:46.890> do<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.280> that's<00:01:48.119> pretty<00:01:48.299> disappointing

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
to do so that's pretty disappointing

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.469 
to do so that's pretty disappointing
from<00:01:48.929> where<00:01:49.109> we're<00:01:49.590> watching<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.490> last<00:01:51.210> 20

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
from where we're watching and last 20

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.789 
from where we're watching and last 20
minutes<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.840> first<00:01:52.049> staff<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.590> almost

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
minutes of the first staff it almost

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.749 
minutes of the first staff it almost
looked<00:01:53.009> like<00:01:53.039> you<00:01:53.310> were<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.579> score

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
looked like you were going to score

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.819 
looked like you were going to score
every<00:01:53.969> time<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.270> work<00:01:54.390> forward<00:01:54.840> yeah<00:01:55.319> i<00:01:55.710> think

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
every time you work forward yeah i think

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.959 
every time you work forward yeah i think
that<00:01:55.979> camouflage<00:01:56.520> what<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.819> actually

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
that camouflage what was actually

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.870 
that camouflage what was actually
happening<00:01:58.159> we<00:01:59.159> weren't<00:01:59.310> they<00:01:59.429> defensively

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
happening we weren't they defensively

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.480 
happening we weren't they defensively
tonight<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.569> there<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.929> got<00:02:01.709> those<00:02:01.799> 16<00:02:02.159> points

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
tonight and there we got those 16 points

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.059 
tonight and there we got those 16 points
pretty<00:02:03.179> easy<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:03.719> honest<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.170> playing<00:02:04.890> for

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
pretty easy to be honest and playing for

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.370 
pretty easy to be honest and playing for
similar<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> what<00:02:05.789> we<00:02:05.909> wanted<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.179> do<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.780> then

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
similar to what we wanted to do and then

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.960 
similar to what we wanted to do and then
the<00:02:07.469> second<00:02:07.770> half<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:08.129> went<00:02:08.310> away<00:02:08.399> from<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.849> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the second half we went away from it and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.219 
the second half we went away from it and
there<00:02:09.090> was<00:02:09.209> every<00:02:09.450> man<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.599> himself<00:02:09.750> again

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
there was every man for himself again

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.900 
there was every man for himself again
and<00:02:10.379> we<00:02:11.039> didn't<00:02:11.190> have<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> defense<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.790> back

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
and we didn't have the defense to back

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.970 
and we didn't have the defense to back
it<00:02:12.000> up<00:02:12.060> we<00:02:12.180> do<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.480> same<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.379> now<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:13.709> with<00:02:13.920> a

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
it up we do the same so now we with a

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:30.540 
it up we do the same so now we with a
lot<00:02:14.129> of<00:02:14.160> work<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.430> do

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.730 

that<00:02:31.480> was<00:02:31.600> massive<00:02:31.780> feels<00:02:32.170> like<00:02:32.350> game<00:02:32.530> turn

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
that was massive feels like game turn

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.580 
that was massive feels like game turn
out<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:34.300> got<00:02:34.480> us<00:02:34.600> back<00:02:34.930> up<00:02:35.140> though<00:02:35.320> we

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
out and it's got us back up though we

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.020 
out and it's got us back up though we
know<00:02:35.710> it<00:02:35.830> can<00:02:35.950> beat<00:02:36.130> top<00:02:36.370> size<00:02:36.610> because<00:02:36.880> all<00:02:37.000> of

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
know it can beat top size because all of

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.750 
know it can beat top size because all of
one<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.510> top<00:02:37.720> side<00:02:37.960> this<00:02:38.110> year<00:02:38.190> but<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:39.580> can

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
one of the top side this year but we can

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.280 
one of the top side this year but we can
prove<00:02:39.970> now<00:02:40.210> that<00:02:40.240> we're<00:02:40.540> up<00:02:40.840> there<00:02:41.020> with<00:02:41.170> them

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
prove now that we're up there with them

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.660 
prove now that we're up there with them
I<00:02:41.410> think<00:02:41.590> we<00:02:41.650> look<00:02:41.770> pretty<00:02:41.830> good<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.190> attack<00:02:42.520> of

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
I think we look pretty good in attack of

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.570 
I think we look pretty good in attack of
town<00:02:42.850> right<00:02:43.290> on<00:02:44.290> their<00:02:44.530> line<00:02:44.710> to<00:02:44.980> command

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
town right on their line to command

00:02:45.580 --> 00:03:01.500 
town right on their line to command
lizard<00:02:45.940> time<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.420> it's<00:02:47.140> positive

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:19.270
