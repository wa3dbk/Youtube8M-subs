the functioning of this gun this gun is
a<00:00:58.649> flywheel<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.000> trigger<00:01:00.629> -<00:01:01.140> or<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
a flywheel so the trigger - or the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.709 
a flywheel so the trigger - or the
on/off<00:01:02.460> switch<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.820> right<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.359> turn<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
on/off switch is right here to turn the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.980 
on/off switch is right here to turn the
flywheel<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:05.489> trigger<00:01:06.119> pull<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.960> a

flywheel on the trigger pull is like a

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.870 
flywheel on the trigger pull is like a
inch<00:01:07.350> long<00:01:07.710> trigger<00:01:08.100> pull<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.640> really

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
inch long trigger pull it's a really

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.240 
inch long trigger pull it's a really
large<00:01:09.000> trigger<00:01:09.479> pull<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.680> kind<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.130> hard

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
large trigger pull so it's kind of hard

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.429 
large trigger pull so it's kind of hard
to<00:01:11.369> get<00:01:11.520> high<00:01:11.760> rate<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.000> fire<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.630> are<00:01:13.170> not

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.469 
flywheel the accuracy will decrease when
you<00:01:46.799> shoot<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> high<00:01:47.520> rate<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.759> fire<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.299> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
you shoot a high rate of fire like I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.380 
you shoot a high rate of fire like I
said<00:01:48.689> earlier<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.259> also<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.189> noise<00:01:50.430> uh<00:01:50.790> it's

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
said earlier and also the noise uh it's

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.510 
said earlier and also the noise uh it's
kind<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.720> loud<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.500> revving<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.369> then

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
kind of loud the revving so then

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.010 
kind of loud the revving so then
everyone<00:01:53.820> will<00:01:53.970> know<00:01:54.030> where<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.479> are<00:01:54.509> in

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
everyone will know where you are in

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.539 
everyone will know where you are in
battle<00:01:55.290> um<00:01:56.750> also<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.409> loading<00:01:58.649> speed<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.310> kind

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
battle um also the loading speed is kind

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.289 
battle um also the loading speed is kind
of<00:01:59.700> an<00:01:59.850> issue<00:02:00.110> not<00:02:01.110> an<00:02:01.320> issue<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.340> you'd

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
of an issue not an issue but it's you'd

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.080 
of an issue not an issue but it's you'd
get<00:02:03.689> kind<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.990> slow<00:02:04.229> at<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.409> because<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:05.700> turn

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
get kind of slow at it because you turn

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.730 
get kind of slow at it because you turn
it<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.509> then<00:02:06.630> put<00:02:06.840> one<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.350> turn<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.710> to

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
it and then put one in and turn it to

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.119 
it and then put one in and turn it to
pull<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.209> so<00:02:09.209> let's<00:02:09.360> go<00:02:09.450> slow<00:02:09.860> overall<00:02:10.860> I

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
pull in so let's go slow overall I

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.590 
pull in so let's go slow overall I
definitely<00:02:11.730> recommend<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.239> gun

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
definitely recommend this gun

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.690 
definitely recommend this gun
I really<00:02:13.110> like<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.680> stock<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.310> really

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.040 
I really like it the stock is really
awesome<00:02:15.150> I'd<00:02:15.240> say<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.900> best

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
awesome I'd say that this is the best

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.990 
awesome I'd say that this is the best
stock<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.410> all<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.650> stock<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.100> far<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.580> also

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
stock of all the stock so far and also

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.790 
stock of all the stock so far and also
the<00:02:18.300> flywheel<00:02:18.750> system<00:02:19.110> in<00:02:19.200> here<00:02:19.320> seems<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.710> be

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
the flywheel system in here seems to be

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.860 
the flywheel system in here seems to be
a<00:02:19.860> lot<00:02:20.130> better<00:02:20.400> than<00:02:20.550> all<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.300> other<00:02:21.420> flywheel

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
a lot better than all the other flywheel

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.010 
a lot better than all the other flywheel
systems<00:02:22.610> we<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.880> put<00:02:24.090> fresh<00:02:24.450> batteries<00:02:24.480> in

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
systems we just put fresh batteries in

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.920 
systems we just put fresh batteries in

25 feet when I shot about paste shots I
shot<00:03:08.580> one<00:03:08.760> out<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:08.940> time<00:03:09.180> they<00:03:09.390> could<00:03:09.570> reach<00:03:09.720> up

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
shot one out of time they could reach up

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.050 
shot one out of time they could reach up
to<00:03:10.050> 40<00:03:10.500> feet<00:03:10.740> I'd<00:03:11.400> see<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.730> effective

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
to 40 feet I'd see the effective

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.820 
to 40 feet I'd see the effective
brand-new<00:03:12.330> this<00:03:12.420> gun<00:03:12.630> is<00:03:12.810> around<00:03:13.200> 30<00:03:13.740> feet
