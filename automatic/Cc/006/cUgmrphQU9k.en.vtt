00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.930
(buzzing like an engine)

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.160
 Robo, robo wheel 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.360
 Go round and round and round 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.060
 Robo robo wheel 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.500
 Go ro-rollin' down. 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.060
I'm Nate from Design Squad, 
and I'm here with:

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.160
This is a robo wheel.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.100
It's made from two paper plates
and some string.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.930
To start it off,
I give it a little turn,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.360
and when it starts
to come back the other way,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.100
I pull to help it out.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.600
(revving like an engine)

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.500
(beat boxing)
 Let go, let's go 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.860
 Robo robo wheel 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.600
DESI:
We're trying to make these

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.100
move really fast on the driveway
and race them.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.700
ZARA: We have to release these
at exactly the right point,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.300
or it won't work.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.300
Ah!

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.130
Mine was spinning backwards.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.900
One...

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.500
You've got to release it
at the right time.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.160
NATE:
When the wheel turns,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.430
it winds the string.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.360
So when it stops and the
string is all wound up,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.360
potential energy.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.500
Now when it spins fast,
boom!

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.500
Kinetic energy.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.460
One, two, three, go!

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.560
Ho, ho, ho.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.100
I think I got
a jump on you there.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.900
Good race, though.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.130
We're building a ramp

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.200
for the robo wheels to make
a jump off of.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.030
Blast off!

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.300
(laughing)

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.460
Sweet!

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.600
It's robo wheel bowling!

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.930
(robotic voice):
Robo bowling.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.800
Go!

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.930
Oh!

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.960
Go.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.860
Oh!

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.560
Go.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.960
Yay!

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.930
ANNA:
We're decorating

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.130
the robo wheels and I'm hoping
that when it starts spinning,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.530
it looks like it's kind
of all blending together.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.560
When it spins faster,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.260
I think it's going to look
really pretty,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.460
like a firework exploded.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.460
ZARA:
We should definitely

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.760
take a look at it
while it's spinning.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.800
And they're really fun to
decorate because you can really

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.630
personalize it.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.260
AJ: The colors are
blending together.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.130
NATE: I love seeing it
change speed

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.230
because then the design changes.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.900
Now, the robo wheel
is a demonstration

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.830
of something called
a fly wheel--

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.660
a wheel that's spinning
to store rotational energy.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.900
We can see the same
kind of rotational energy

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.000
that we have in the robo wheel

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.260
in the bicycle wheel.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.600
So, that's part of what helps
keep you coasting along

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.730
even when you're not pedaling.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.630
Zoom!

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.800
Kinetic energy.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.430
Instructions to make
your own robo wheel

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.960
are on the Design Squad website.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.730
ZARA:
That looks really, really cool.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.500
Looks like a flying saucer.
