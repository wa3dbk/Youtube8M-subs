00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
years in our Vancouver in Canada so I

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.710 
years in our Vancouver in Canada so I
think<00:03:58.799> because<00:03:59.519> we<00:03:59.700> travel<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:00.329> much<00:04:00.480> like

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
think because we travel so much like

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.569 
think because we travel so much like
this<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:01.200> one<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.620> reason<00:04:01.980> why<00:04:02.159> we<00:04:02.370> can

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
this is one of the reason why we can

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.979 
this is one of the reason why we can
adjust<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.150> new<00:04:03.359> place<00:04:03.659> so<00:04:03.689> easily<00:04:05.989> question

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
adjust to new place so easily question

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.020 
adjust to new place so easily question
number<00:04:07.230> nine<00:04:07.470> how<00:04:07.829> do<00:04:07.889> we<00:04:08.159> start<00:04:08.489> learning<00:04:08.879> to

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
number nine how do we start learning to
