00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
know it's suppose really it's it it's a

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.390 
know it's suppose really it's it it's a
bit<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:55.870> desire<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.350> live<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.530> simple<00:03:56.950> life

bit of a desire to live a simple life

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.250 
bit of a desire to live a simple life
and<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.180> fact<00:03:58.330> also<00:03:58.540> that<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.930> got<00:03:59.019> connected

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
and the fact also that it got connected

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.910 
and the fact also that it got connected
with<00:03:59.500> it

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
with it

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.440 
with it
with<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.310> Hobbit<00:04:00.459> thing<00:04:00.910> which<00:04:01.120> was<00:04:01.269> never

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
our intention in diversity I think

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.970 
our intention in diversity I think
that's<00:04:04.780> again<00:04:05.049> probably<00:04:05.410> reflecting<00:04:05.890> the

that's again probably reflecting the
same<00:04:06.160> sort<00:04:06.400> of<00:04:06.430> thing<00:04:06.579> and<00:04:06.760> maybe<00:04:06.790> that's<00:04:07.150> what

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
same sort of thing and maybe that's what

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.630 
same sort of thing and maybe that's what
token<00:04:08.049> was<00:04:08.200> portraying<00:04:08.680> now<00:04:08.920> was

token was portraying now was

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.990 
token was portraying now was
