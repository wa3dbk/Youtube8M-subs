00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
that cut the corners of the cards are

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.119 
that cut the corners of the cards are
sharp<00:03:58.239> not<00:03:58.480> rounded<00:03:58.959> you<00:03:59.290> can<00:03:59.470> tell<00:03:59.680> that<00:03:59.889> it's

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
sharp not rounded you can tell that it's

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.979 
sharp not rounded you can tell that it's
kind<00:04:00.730> of<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:00.879> homemade<00:04:01.239> production<00:04:01.750> but<00:04:01.870> that's

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
kind of a homemade production but that's

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.080 
kind of a homemade production but that's
not<00:04:02.139> too<00:04:02.560> big<00:04:02.739> of<00:04:02.829> a<00:04:02.889> deal<00:04:03.099> I<00:04:03.340> mean<00:04:03.940> I<00:04:03.970> think

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
not too big of a deal I mean I think

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.580 
not too big of a deal I mean I think
that<00:04:04.299> you<00:04:04.690> won't<00:04:04.870> have<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:05.049> big<00:04:05.169> problem<00:04:05.440> with

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
that you won't have a big problem with

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.949 
that you won't have a big problem with
that<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:06.370> game<00:04:06.549> itself<00:04:06.940> I<00:04:07.269> won't<00:04:07.780> say<00:04:07.900> that

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
that the game itself I won't say that

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.869 
that the game itself I won't say that
it's<00:04:08.199> balanced<00:04:08.889> because<00:04:09.099> it<00:04:09.340> really<00:04:09.579> is<00:04:09.699> it<00:04:09.819> I

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
it's balanced because it really is it I

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.430 
it's balanced because it really is it I
mean<00:04:10.030> if<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.209> get<00:04:10.299> I've<00:04:10.720> seen<00:04:10.959> people<00:04:11.230> play

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
mean if you get I've seen people play

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.409 
mean if you get I've seen people play
and<00:04:11.650> they<00:04:11.799> went<00:04:11.980> many<00:04:12.669> many<00:04:12.910> many<00:04:13.120> turns

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
and they went many many many turns

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.720 
and they went many many many turns
before<00:04:13.930> they<00:04:14.169> finally<00:04:14.650> got<00:04:14.799> any<00:04:15.069> axe<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.609> then

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
before they finally got any axe and then

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.490 
before they finally got any axe and then
it<00:04:15.849> broke<00:04:16.060> on<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.299> very<00:04:16.479> next<00:04:16.630> turn<00:04:16.959> those

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
it broke on the very next turn those

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.979 
it broke on the very next turn those
titanium<00:04:17.919> axes<00:04:18.430> are<00:04:18.549> really<00:04:18.820> powerful<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:19.479> so

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
titanium axes are really powerful and so

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.150 
titanium axes are really powerful and so
the<00:04:20.109> best<00:04:20.289> way<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:20.440> get<00:04:20.680> rid<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:20.829> them<00:04:21.039> is<00:04:21.130> to

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
the best way to get rid of them is to

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.589 
the best way to get rid of them is to
steal<00:04:21.489> them<00:04:21.729> but<00:04:21.940> then<00:04:22.060> of<00:04:22.150> course<00:04:22.330> they<00:04:22.450> get

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
steal them but then of course they get

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:23.790 
steal them but then of course they get
something<00:04:22.810> that<00:04:22.990> might<00:04:23.110> stop<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:23.469> from

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
something that might stop you from

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.370 
something that might stop you from
stealing<00:04:23.950> there's<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.909> lot<00:04:25.240> of<00:04:25.390> luck<00:04:25.630> and<00:04:25.780> again

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
stealing there's a lot of luck and again

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.740 
stealing there's a lot of luck and again
she<00:04:26.500> was<00:04:26.650> rolling<00:04:26.980> the<00:04:27.010> dice<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:27.760> became<00:04:28.090> since

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
she was rolling the dice so became since

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.540 
she was rolling the dice so became since
it's<00:04:28.900> so<00:04:29.020> luck<00:04:29.290> or<00:04:29.530> in<00:04:29.650> it<00:04:29.800> and<00:04:30.010> there's<00:04:30.460> not

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
it's so luck or in it and there's not

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.090 
it's so luck or in it and there's not
much<00:04:30.730> strategy<00:04:31.030> then<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.960> has<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.320> rely<00:04:32.680> solely

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
much strategy then it has to rely solely

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.920 
much strategy then it has to rely solely
on<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.460> thing<00:04:33.670> all<00:04:34.210> right<00:04:34.360> well<00:04:34.600> you<00:04:34.690> can<00:04:34.810> make

another<00:04:42.900> this<00:04:43.900> game<00:04:44.380> is<00:04:44.650> very<00:04:44.980> much<00:04:45.450> based<00:04:46.450> I

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
another this game is very much based I

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.380 
another this game is very much based I
think<00:04:46.840> towards<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.800> same<00:04:48.130> group<00:04:48.910> of<00:04:49.030> people

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
think towards the same group of people

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.710 
think towards the same group of people
who<00:04:49.540> like<00:04:49.780> munchkin<00:04:50.970> although<00:04:51.970> I<00:04:52.000> don't<00:04:52.420> know

who like munchkin although I don't know

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.020 
who like munchkin although I don't know
why<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.140> didn't<00:04:54.040> find<00:04:54.190> this<00:04:54.370> nearly<00:04:54.880> as

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
why I didn't find this nearly as

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.570 
why I didn't find this nearly as
annoying<00:04:55.540> as<00:04:55.780> much<00:04:56.020> kid<00:04:56.260> can<00:04:56.440> be<00:04:56.590> but<00:04:57.400> at<00:04:57.490> the

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
annoying as much kid can be but at the

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.070 
annoying as much kid can be but at the
same<00:04:57.730> time<00:04:57.940> it's<00:04:58.120> definitely<00:04:58.750> in<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.900> same

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
same time it's definitely in the same

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.800 
same time it's definitely in the same
genre<00:04:59.110> of<00:04:59.650> games<00:04:59.920> most<00:05:00.730> gamers<00:05:01.060> people<00:05:01.690> who

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
going to shy away from this I found it

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.390 
going to shy away from this I found it
okay<00:05:07.660> at<00:05:07.840> best<00:05:07.870> yes<00:05:08.710> I<00:05:08.860> had<00:05:08.980> a<00:05:09.010> good<00:05:09.220> time
