00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.800
 Ah ah ah 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.800
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.640
 Yes I have tried a lot of rhythm training 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.640
 Can dance freely 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:29.710
 I aim to say that I will play with various parts while keeping the rhythm 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:36.250
 Dance only if you dance only with the neck 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:41.770
 Using the chest while turning or using the neck and using the mold 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:46.490
 It's not fun or it 's time to make rhythms and ticks in many places 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.270
 The whole body it might have got to take the dance is where most fun 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.100
 When I can dance 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.769
 I can't help but have fun 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:59.850
 So one more thing to take the rhythm of practicing using various parts 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:05.580
 up turn keep the rhythm at the same pace all the time 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.680
 Keep the pitch all the time the same as not getting faster or slower 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.370
 The rhythm is much bigger 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.950
 Like walking to keep natural 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:20.520
 Let's also practice that people feel comfortable 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:28.560
 I think that I can cope with various dances in this way 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:31.360
 Though there may be various complicated things , think about practice by yourself and think about how to use the type 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.000
 Do while devised various wind how to use the waist 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:42.290
 Since it is the best thing to be able to do it in yourself, please try hard 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.100
 Also please Good luck please playing in various parts until the next 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.100

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.710

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.220
