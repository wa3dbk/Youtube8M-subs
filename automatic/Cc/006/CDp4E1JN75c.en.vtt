00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
this is the piece that fell off just now

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:47.780 
this is the piece that fell off just now
I<00:02:36.080> don't<00:02:36.350> know<00:02:36.410> if<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.560> saw

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.610 

but

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.430 

this<00:02:54.620> piece<00:02:54.860> right<00:02:54.980> here

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.670 

that's<00:02:59.440> what<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.680> was<00:02:59.740> attached<00:03:00.099> to<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.660> that

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.640 

goes<00:03:05.680> right<00:03:05.950> up<00:03:06.130> under<00:03:06.400> here<00:03:07.349> and<00:03:08.349> you<00:03:08.440> can<00:03:08.560> see

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
goes right up under here and you can see

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.400 
goes right up under here and you can see
what<00:03:08.800> those<00:03:08.860> two<00:03:09.040> holes<00:03:09.310> are<00:03:09.930> as<00:03:10.930> opposed<00:03:11.319> to

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
what those two holes are as opposed to

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.650 
what those two holes are as opposed to
where<00:03:11.530> those<00:03:11.650> two<00:03:11.890> two<00:03:12.610> plastic<00:03:13.239> pegs<00:03:13.450> were

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
where those two two plastic pegs were

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.640 
where those two two plastic pegs were
they<00:03:14.410> go<00:03:14.560> right<00:03:14.709> up<00:03:14.890> in<00:03:15.010> there<00:03:16.380> so<00:03:17.380> let<00:03:17.470> me<00:03:17.530> see

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
they go right up in there so let me see

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.870 
they go right up in there so let me see
if<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.770> can<00:03:17.920> show<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:21.190> lights<00:03:21.400> pretty<00:03:21.610> good

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
if I can show you the lights pretty good

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.410 
if I can show you the lights pretty good
so<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.269> shouldn't<00:03:22.420> be<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.600> problem<00:03:24.120> it's<00:03:25.120> two

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
so it shouldn't be a problem it's two

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.160 
so it shouldn't be a problem it's two
plastic<00:03:25.750> pegs<00:03:27.510> let's<00:03:28.510> go<00:03:28.660> ahead<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.959> insert

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
plastic pegs let's go ahead and insert

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.000 
plastic pegs let's go ahead and insert
it<00:03:29.290> there<00:03:29.319> and<00:03:31.110> not<00:03:32.110> sure<00:03:32.350> if<00:03:32.470> you<00:03:32.560> can<00:03:32.709> see<00:03:32.890> it

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
it there and not sure if you can see it

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.920 
it there and not sure if you can see it
but<00:03:33.730> there<00:03:33.850> are<00:03:33.880> also<00:03:34.000> two<00:03:34.209> smaller<00:03:34.660> holes

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
but there are also two smaller holes

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.000 
but there are also two smaller holes
really<00:03:35.190> those<00:03:36.190> pegs<00:03:36.430> go<00:03:40.080> boom<00:03:41.080> right<00:03:41.620> on<00:03:41.799> there

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
really those pegs go boom right on there

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.900 
really those pegs go boom right on there
and<00:03:43.620> now<00:03:44.620> we'll<00:03:44.799> go<00:03:44.890> ahead<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.130> we'll<00:03:45.280> take

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
and now we'll go ahead and we'll take

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.090 
and now we'll go ahead and we'll take
our<00:03:46.060> hex<00:03:46.269> and<00:03:47.730> secure<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:48.850> onto<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.780> onto<00:03:50.530> the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
our hex and secure it onto the onto the

00:03:51.100 --> 00:04:09.330 
our hex and secure it onto the onto the
bolt

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.080 

okay<00:04:10.340> no<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:10.700> finishes<00:04:11.599> that<00:04:12.730> okay<00:04:13.730> here

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
okay no that finishes that okay here

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.120 
okay no that finishes that okay here
there's<00:04:14.569> usually<00:04:14.719> a<00:04:14.900> lip<00:04:15.139> but<00:04:15.799> I<00:04:15.829> had<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.009> take

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
there's usually a lip but I had to take

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.920 
there's usually a lip but I had to take
an<00:04:16.220> exacto<00:04:16.639> knife<00:04:16.789> and<00:04:16.910> I<00:04:17.000> cut<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.329> I<00:04:17.509> cut<00:04:17.900> a

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
an exacto knife and I cut it I cut a

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.719 
an exacto knife and I cut it I cut a
little<00:04:18.079> bit<00:04:18.259> of<00:04:18.350> it<00:04:18.470> off<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:18.919> kind<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:19.340> tapered

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
little bit of it off I kind of tapered

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.430 
little bit of it off I kind of tapered
it<00:04:19.840> so<00:04:20.840> I<00:04:20.870> can<00:04:21.079> get<00:04:21.229> the<00:04:21.940> get<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.090> grip<00:04:23.330> on<00:04:23.509> and

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
it so I can get the get the grip on and

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.510 
it so I can get the get the grip on and
see<00:04:24.590> if<00:04:24.680> I<00:04:24.770> have<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:24.919> same<00:04:25.070> problem<00:04:25.430> with

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
see if I have the same problem with

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:35.439 
see if I have the same problem with
these<00:04:25.669> ones<00:04:30.849> if<00:04:31.849> you<00:04:31.970> notice<00:04:32.500> they're<00:04:34.449> two

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
these ones if you notice they're two

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.779 
these ones if you notice they're two
different<00:04:35.780> sizes<00:04:36.190> obviously<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.580> one<00:04:37.699> with

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
different sizes obviously the one with

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.570 
different sizes obviously the one with
the<00:04:37.880> bigger<00:04:38.120> hole<00:04:38.449> is<00:04:39.440> going<00:04:39.680> to<00:04:39.740> go<00:04:39.889> over<00:04:40.220> the

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
the bigger hole is going to go over the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.589 
the bigger hole is going to go over the
throttle<00:04:42.639> when<00:04:43.639> I'm<00:04:43.789> installing<00:04:44.030> these<00:04:44.300> grips

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
throttle when I'm installing these grips

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.420 
throttle when I'm installing these grips
I'm<00:04:45.470> going<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.680> make<00:04:45.800> sure<00:04:45.830> that<00:04:46.009> I'm<00:04:46.250> going<00:04:46.370> to

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
I'm going to make sure that I'm going to

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.339 
I'm going to make sure that I'm going to
twist<00:04:46.639> away<00:04:46.759> from<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.300> throttle<00:04:47.570> that<00:04:48.110> way<00:04:48.320> I

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
twist away from the throttle that way I

00:04:48.349 --> 00:05:04.429 
twist away from the throttle that way I
don't<00:04:48.560> flood<00:04:49.009> the<00:04:49.160> engine

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:04.439 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:06.379 

all<00:05:04.979> right<00:05:05.069> that<00:05:05.249> one<00:05:05.399> went<00:05:05.999> on<00:05:06.089> without<00:05:06.330> a

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
all right that one went on without a

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.559 
all right that one went on without a
problem<00:05:06.919> let's<00:05:07.919> kind<00:05:08.099> of<00:05:08.209> get<00:05:09.209> a<00:05:09.269> little<00:05:09.449> bit

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 
problem let's kind of get a little bit

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:11.899 
problem let's kind of get a little bit
of<00:05:09.679> maybe<00:05:10.679> some<00:05:10.889> water<00:05:11.069> I<00:05:11.369> use<00:05:11.580> some<00:05:11.699> simple

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
of maybe some water I use some simple

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.659 
of maybe some water I use some simple
green<00:05:12.179> that<00:05:12.419> work<00:05:12.569> pretty<00:05:12.779> well<00:05:13.580> that's<00:05:14.580> got

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
green that work pretty well that's got

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.979 
green that work pretty well that's got
to<00:05:14.759> let<00:05:14.849> it<00:05:14.879> dry<00:05:15.119> but<00:05:15.569> huh<00:05:15.979> yeah
