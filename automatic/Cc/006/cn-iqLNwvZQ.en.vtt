00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.220

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.349
 different and it's not going to be a review it's not going 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.119

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.630

 this in words I do not show my 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.660

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.629
 of 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.910
 subscribers that I add on facebook that 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.760
 they would give me on facebook that they tell me 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.590
 for facebook worth the redundancy 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.170

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.340
 delighted I do not know why to do anything 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.440

 I have the buses that 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.360

 both marvel and absolute edition 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.010

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.470

 the one of osman I win it but I do not have them 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.770
 here very well on this side we have the 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.350
 comics of the trades of 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.090
 Superman editorial already know death 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.940
 of superman in the kingdom of 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.380
 superman a world without superman everything is 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.260
 I have some books that I just read 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.740
 here of which I want to recommend 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.870
 This one called under the dome is 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.680
 written by stephen king is the same 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.350
 caliber it's that or what you think 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.330
 equally but it's very good there is a 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.850
 TV series based on the book 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.800
 that I recommend you see not because 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:26.500
 be so good however if you help them 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:28.330
 a lot to fill this kind of lack 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.340
 of good scenes that narrates very well 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.930
 the scenarios however, because 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.850
 complements extremely well with the series 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.720
 There are two things that I think of the series 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.300
 but well let's also continue and 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.270
 we have this that is the last one that I have 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.360
 a box of girl comics and comics 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.580
 stacked on this side 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.870
 that look ugly do not apply to us like that 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.690
 because they start to become curved 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.620
 up and they are horrible I also have 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.780
 on this side a comic tower that is 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.060
 which I leave here because they do not fit there 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.520
 in an antibacterial gel that should not 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.680
 missing is clear and I have more comics 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.140
 placed in this closet, however, 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.530
 the I can show why 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.230
 it would look all dark dark in the camera 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.870
 do not have these things then do not record 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.060
 absolutely wrong here back I have the 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.799
 town where I keep my dvds with a 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.979
 skull up there 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.810
 and I also have more comics still 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.810
 these but with masses and comics you know 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.000
 classic salary comics but snacks and I 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.770
 I moved from home and left the rest of the comics in 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.560
 the other so that they would not be sent and apart 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.759
 here it does not fit so that 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.830
 I feel for today I hope that you have 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.509
 liked and I have a dynamic that 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.060
 Well, if you like it because it calls 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.770
 attention they can do it freely if 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.569
 They also want to show their collection of 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.669
 comics or want to show where 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:52.120
 you keep your comics as they are a 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.280
 video pass - and I gladly put it on the 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.020
 video answer the link of your video to 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.580

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.840
