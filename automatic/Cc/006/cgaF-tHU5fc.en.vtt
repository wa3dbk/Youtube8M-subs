00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.540

 A: My name is Aileen. Y: my name is Yongka 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.780
 And we are a couple 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.100
 And we live in China! 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.380
 I introduce you, and you introduce me 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.740
 He is Corean 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.880
 He is called Yongka, or he is also known as Bboy Yongka or Bboy KeiA 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.080
 He's a dancer, he's a professional dancer! 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.900

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.040
 If he is very good! 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.460
 You can search it on YouTube, his group is called TG Breakers 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.040
 Now you introduce me 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.040
 Her name is Aileen 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.040
 It's Colombian American 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.520
 She was a gymnast 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.060
 If I was a gymnast when I was younger. We love going to the gym to practice laps. 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.700
 We are not professional but we love doing that 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.300
 And we like to dance 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.640
 So let's put some dance videos in the future 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.560
 So how long have you been living here in China? 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.480
 Almost 3 years 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.960
 And you? 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.280
 I have been here for 4 years 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.260
 More than all I want to show you is how life is here in China, and from a foreign point of view 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.220
 And how is having an interracial relationship. He is Korean and I am Colombian American. 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.640
 Clearly, we have cultural differences 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.640
 And I would like to share this with you 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.520
 I hope you like the video, this is just an introduction. 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.800
 A Surprise for Yoon! 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.820
 We are waiting for Yoon, and we are going to give him this. 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.940
 (The Moras are good for Men) 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.220
 Because he is a Man! 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.380
 At last Yoon arrived! 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.660
 This is Yoon's restaurant. 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.720
 Time to return to the house! 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.480
 "Dung Dung" What? 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.260
 (Singing a Korean song, horribly) 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.920
 And I also want to tell you that we met here in China 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.040
 And in those times the most convenient language for us was Chinese 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:43.100
 I do not know if it would be interesting, a bit weird that an American and a Korean use Chinese to communicate 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.620
 This was just an introduction from us. Next week we will put another video. 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.140
 Please subscribe, and I'll see you for the next one!
