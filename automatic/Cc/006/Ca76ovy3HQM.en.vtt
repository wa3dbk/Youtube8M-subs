00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.900 

vigor<00:01:34.050> is<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:34.440> of<00:01:34.530> my<00:01:34.710> favorite<00:01:35.190> ap<00:01:35.610> carries

vigor is one of my favorite ap carries

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.730 
vigor is one of my favorite ap carries
of<00:01:36.030> all<00:01:36.180> time<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.990> reason<00:01:37.290> for<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.470> is

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
of all time and the reason for that is

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.190 
of all time and the reason for that is
his<00:01:37.920> birth<00:01:38.190> potential<00:01:38.880> vigor<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:40.020> able

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
his birth potential vigor is just able

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.350 
his birth potential vigor is just able
to<00:01:40.440> dish<00:01:40.619> out<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.130> massive<00:01:41.640> birth<00:01:41.880> damaged

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
to dish out so massive birth damaged

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.600 
to dish out so massive birth damaged
after<00:01:42.510> you<00:01:42.840> form<00:01:43.170> some<00:01:43.380> minions<00:01:43.770> first<00:01:44.070> but

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
after you form some minions first but

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.490 
after you form some minions first but
what<00:01:44.790> I'm<00:01:44.910> afraid<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.690> vigor<00:01:46.110> somehow

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
what I'm afraid of is the vigor somehow

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.469 
what I'm afraid of is the vigor somehow
doesn't<00:01:46.920> fit<00:01:47.100> into<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> meta<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.940> well<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
doesn't fit into the meta that well and

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.540 
doesn't fit into the meta that well and
therefore<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.140> play<00:01:49.350> ratio<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.890> extremely

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
therefore the play ratio is extremely

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.240 
therefore the play ratio is extremely
low<00:01:50.729> -<00:01:51.000> unfortunately<00:01:51.860> fitting<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> meta<00:01:53.160> or

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
low - unfortunately fitting the meta or

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.550 
low - unfortunately fitting the meta or
not<00:01:53.580> fighter<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.240> still<00:01:54.420> very<00:01:54.750> solid<00:01:54.990> caster

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
