00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.529
 graceful interlacing of the thinnest threads 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.469
 or fancy cobwebs whether frosty 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.530
 pattern or just magic is the rarest 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.969
 Good luck to see such near this lace 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.980
 woven on bobbins 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.289
 first lace created with 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.240
 specially carved wooden sticks 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.670
 bobbins appeared in Russia in 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.920
 thirteenth century they were not ours 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.140
 imported as they would say now but about 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.929
 tom as a foreign circle migrated to 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.660
 Russia and became known to anyone Russian 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.180
 unknown for certain there is only a legend 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.640
 about the clever serf landowner schools 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.469
 his which studied the work of foreign 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.989
 lace on their toilets their defense 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.710
 I made tools started to catch up 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.510
 europe 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.940
 later adventurous serf 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.770
 turned a hobby into a business of weaving lace 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.379
 and profitably marketed in Moscow through 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.670
 intermediaries of course every fact of this 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.370
 stories can be questioned 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.340
 except perhaps one bobbin lace 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.739
 has always been an occupation for earning and not 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.870
 for the fun of our exception 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.700
 today's heroin hope 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.460
 Konstantinovna not just weaves lace 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.650
 but carefully preserves and transfers traditions 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.530
 ancient and truly elite 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.630
 mastery hope the troubled musician by 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.610
 education and a skilled worker by vocation 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.070
 owns a variety of crafts 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.270
 sewing and knitting beadwork and 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.520
 cross-stitch 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.189
 but the main thing is able to weave lace on 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.770
 bobbin lace causes full 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:34.100
 delighted with and knowing not only women 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.820
 but in men and twenty years ago I 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.979
 bad luck 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.939
 one woman came to our club 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.960
 needlewoman 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.960
 she taught us gave impetus 1 start but 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.399
 taught us here these are the basics of weaving 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.250
 on bobbins 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.460
 and then I could read books somewhere 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.140
 what to do specifically 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.360
 but lace workmanship 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.760
 choosy does not tolerate fuss does not forgive 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.880
 mistakes and requires special arrangement 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.020
 workplace should definitely have here 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.810
 such a stand 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.560
 such a stand of course should do 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.009
 stoler 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.300
 and this we have called pillow she form 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.000
 the cushion inside it may have sawdust but 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.720
 I have here a thick foam 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.390
 5 this is a working such a drawing he 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.600
 called skolok is a big treasure 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.720
 or any needlewoman and in my home 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.290
 there is such a treasure too 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:39.739
 some kind of contented big set 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:43.310
 fragments themselves bobbins they are 14 16 in length 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.890
 centimeters long now believe no i 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.230
 I did myself I could not find the master 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.360
 who will make me a cock or twenty 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.970
 I want to go back from the nursery 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.440
 cribs you know and here is this notch for 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.510
 to be here already 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.320
 chop the strings too, I have done the most 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.130
 knife and the thickness of these to the caps and 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.840
 should be 10 14 millimeters and more 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.310
 under the melodic sound of skillful hands 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.860
 magic is born 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.350
 partly weaving process 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:18.410
 similar to conducting orchestras in me 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:20.870
 at work in this work 6 pairs of bobbins 1 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.049
 6 pairs 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.660
 suspension here it is I see it on the suspension I 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:30.079
 I am making a complete ban on me it is difficult 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.130
 do slowly on where to go from above 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:36.140
 and bottom 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.090
 the sound from the bottom above is this for you so 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.810
 slowly one turn i have to do 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:45.980
 this is a running pair I take the next one 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:49.930
 stick above the bottom below the top this and 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.930
 called a complete ban 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.140
 work born in this exciting 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:07.430
 process seem woven from the air 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:10.270
 weaving on bobbins 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:14.150
 I work therefore I wove it somewhere 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.220
 4 months I will take his work my hope 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.829
 Konstantinovna does not sell but willingly 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.359
 shows at various exhibitions 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.120
 There are numerous confirmations 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.060
 certificates and diplomas 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:30.950
 Here's diploma diplomas but I am more than 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:33.979
 I cherish but I do not know in general, the more I 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.290
 Of course I value my work here 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.600
 ancient surprisingly beautiful and craftsmanship 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.580
 weaving on bobbins gives joy 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.100
 not only at the skilled worker but also for those who 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.639
