00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 how today you start and welcome 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 a guide yes currently dominating 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.730
 shot gates and was so from apple 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.349
 bit the picture of my channel i have 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.960
 just think the erdinger times 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.820
 again a little money and so and so 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.350
 this time is a glitch guide 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.699
 I think I never played the clip 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.830
 on a channel but at least 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.880
 Sometime is always the first time and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.830
 I recently with the youtube 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.810
 Munich and the racer his colleague 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.240
 By the way, I also have youtube munich 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.990
 in the description linked so can 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.369
 above the ok 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.990
 Definitely drop by 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.059
 if you have pleasurable and I've read 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.620
 the round is also shanghai in the logo with 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.320
 the plucked as he suddenly meant 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.120
 me you, I have such a flash with one 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.770
 Dude recently seen and 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.809
 tried and that works quite well 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.969
 can make itself invisible in the light 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.829
 I thought so make invisible 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.570
 sounds very interesting 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.559
 Just take it with you and then you are now too 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.420
 you have driven this place you have 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.739
 now about seen it away as 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.719
 said it is also mainly 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.460
 only in the mode of conquest and you have to 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.890
 Stop high and on this white track 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.719
 Run down until you come in handy 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.359
 And cellphone gets more it's handy 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.250
 including therefore the map says there 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.670
 so to speak, a Untier drop under the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.229
 oecd- and could roll there because everything 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.950
 possible in half what to do with it 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.810
 can make 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.189
 Building real shit is easy 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.590
 In any case, quite funny to the faithful 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.430
 but you can not and that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.170
 I'll say it in advance 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.909
 everyone who thinks now okay me 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.590
 can now only because I invisible 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.210
 am the opponent somehow engage the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.580
 is not the city, so to speak 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.840
 an invisible wall causing him not 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.579
 that means you can shoot 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.750
 you can be displayed on the map you 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.640
 I can also do other things 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.020
 right show but you can not do that 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.130
 enemy shoots that goes again 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.409
 not so and here you can see them now 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.680
 and as this puddle drop man sustained 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.970
 down so that's just white now 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.110
 not if that's not a hero at all 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.759
 But you have to just like I said 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.530
 this trail just up and down 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.659
 run and then you are under the web 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.399
 yes exactly and that's just everything 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.880
 water below does not ask me 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.680
 Why 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.880
 and if you have something with several colleagues 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.170
 do you have the advantage that you 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.670
 can rise to each other like you here 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.680
 right now you can just open up 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.689
 go on the other and then stop 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.159
 his primary weapon is how you can pull it 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.810
 Now you could just shoot the hack 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.370
 Can with a little budget bit of action 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.260
 do and so on and 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.490
 However, as I said only in the context of man 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.680
 it just can not affect you 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.360
 now here for example the 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.070
 colleague here the helaba he puts 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.040
 is light on top of me and tried 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.940
 then stop with the RPG to dare 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.380
 shooting zuschieÃŸe on the two 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.720
 but then that's what you have to do 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.040
 just look at it for a moment 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.240
 Wild boar were found near the wall 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.680
 you see so the bounces the shots 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.060
 also immediately from so do not say exactly 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.630
 even if it looks like that at first sight 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.570
 looks 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.490
 But the warning light comes on 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.900
 So you have a certain influence 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.190
 already out of play by going to the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.330
 example rum shoots and thereby on the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.980
 map is displayed and the opponents 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.390
 can really be happy because the opponents 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.860
 not at all realize that will 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.480
 you'll see it again 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.710
 just ultra funny but you can 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.020
 she shot me, which I honestly 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.790
 I also think that's pretty good because of which 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.740
 laws make no idea then 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.150
 every one of the map flattened properly 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.220
 make and know who you are from where and 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.780
 So that's not possible but what 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.970
 is that going on for example now 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.800
 up here too many places so now 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.120
 then lay down in front of it then stop there 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.130
 of course, it is a murder here 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.900
 effort but very funny then hold 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.870
 under the map goes to this setting 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.920
 and then everything jump in the air and he 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.560
 is of course you also see right 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.380
 top c4 c4 explosive filled that is 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.700
 possible only from down here you can 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.940
 you do not have to do it then 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.630
 set up an example or so and then 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.280
 is that okay 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.360
 So therefore, and you will of course 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.530
 I just said that before 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.350
 displayed on the map 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.300
 it's also really funny when here for 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.950
 for the armor-up or eg here 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.070
 that's really funny he thinks now 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.090
 For example, someone shoots here 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.320
 useless where does that come from? 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.790
 You can also just have a look 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.320
 how distributed now is he thinks that 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.160
 compromise now he looks up he 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.989
 that can not be 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.220
 he comes to the returning is because 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.690
 once around and then it is mine 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.550
 It's all too much and he just takes him away 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.190
 that's pretty funny anyway 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.410
 to try and yes to dream 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.910
 just perfect makes a lot of fun 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.130
 I just got it from you 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.080
 hear what your opinion said now 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.680
 so rosi rodachtal new domain is yet 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.420
 Totally what should that be open 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.189
 what makes the film so we are or 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.150
 says that by means of funny maybe 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.920
 also try it out 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.969
 Just boring, I mean 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.349
 Of course, nothing is great now 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.519
 special but it is already on 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.900
 a little bit fun and especially if you like that 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.579
 one can already do with colleagues 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.889
 really one or the other great things 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.509
 make everything cool in any case 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.970
 but at least I find your skin 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.690
 opinion definitely again in the 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.330
 Comments 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.560
 and yes generally burden it there if 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.449
 you liked the video and me too 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.419
 show that the video was good and 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.949
 of course feedback like I said like that 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.370
 Of course, the whole is raised there as well 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.870
 to let 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.220
 and if you want to support me 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.320
 then share the video with yours 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.970
 friends send it around or it falls 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.800
 on facebook sounds a bit shit 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.930
 But the biggest support is the 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.389
 you can get as a youtuber so yes 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.610
 We definitely cool what was there and 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.349
 joann us to say to my 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.349
 next time purely georgia people
