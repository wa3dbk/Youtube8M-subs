00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.190
 tonight we will know if here 

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:08.400
 will finish the project who would be the 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.400
 winner 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:17.920
 and the winner 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.590
 I thank you very much for thinking that 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.880
 me the truth is something very nice and I think 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:29.230
 what 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:31.029
 I do not know is something magical and good is the 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.800
 opinion of the rules but we are in 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.460
 one night of evaluations let's see what 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.460
 what your teachers say 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.590
 and all that talent I think like that 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.050
 he got there and although he's doing the 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.120
 effort what is loose because it manages to give 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.370
 Another step is ceasing to be a girl and 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.520
 cause insecurity saw her on stage 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.230
 and I see her overreacted and I do not believe her 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.910
 is working hard with her today 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.100
 as to the strokes and as for the 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.559
 low shoulder shoulders positions 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.010
 back what we want is that you 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.280
 you feel safe in your emotional part 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.860
 this physical part according to age 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.090
 that you have, let's see how the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.090
 walked by the legs 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.409
 she 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.299
 music 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.069
 in the back also right the 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.069
 mistakes back tighten the problems 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.159
 action 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.369
 now it is not about walking like that 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.509
 how could I spine since it costs 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:37.479
 work use it so that we can see you as 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.119
 a whole lady I the only thing that I demand 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.570
 is that the bible that was in 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.570
 chain 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.219
 do you think he needs to 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.140
 finish growing in this project and I 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.390
 I think what is missing from vivienne 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.130
 this demonstrate your safety and your 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.709
 sensuality prove it and here you have 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.119
 grown up show it on stage here 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.340
 at the time of my thanks very much because 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.950
 viviana has grown enormously I have 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.900
 seen with this security it 's time that 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.900
 you show it in this scenario because 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.760
 many videos successes forward because no 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.590
 they represented the interest this is not the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.900
 you need the house that is 14 years old 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.880
 tonight sings us a beautiful theme 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.770
 composed by christina aguilera de 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.160
 sung also by her this is to live 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.160
 football 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.460
 no no 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.740
 night 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.740
 and they are good 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.400
 increase the one who thinks that 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.180
 efe 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.180
 anyway 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.190
 the minimum 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.520
 and the floor 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.760
 look 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.760
 have 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.230
 finish 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.930
 yes 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:00.030
 we hear you 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.060
 living and it 's a song that comes 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.780
 from inside what he says is beautiful 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.960
 I really never felt you 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.600
 I felt that he was singing was not 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.669
 a performance like any other and 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.010
 nothing else you saw unstable in the 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.820
 scenario you looked uncomfortable in the 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.310
 scenario was a bit of a disaster 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.830
 you have the voice you have the power 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.020
 you have the talent but something is not there 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.250
 marching that we are not reaching this 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.129
 communion of body and talent that thank you 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.750
 to 70 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.880
 says villarreal 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:43.040
 why do you want that is happening to you 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:46.350
 this you feel your position that has been 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.020
 failed well yes I have failed and I think 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:52.170
 that has been because of insecurity because it has 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.230
 been very difficult for me to leave that 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:58.440
 girl what are you after in the change 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.360
 yes then I think that that has been very very 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.360
 difficult is difficult because apart we are 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.780
 women I understand you but you have to 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.780
 go as well as lightning and change attitude 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.330
 everything when you sing the first thing in the 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.370
 either music or voice is like 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.220
 another instrument has to combine with 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.400
 music with all music if in the 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.560
 moment you felt something else you let it go 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.990
 because that's what you feel is that everything 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.169
 that you sing inside your soul that 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:31.349
 out 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:31.349
 ok a lot of good luck 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:37.280
 a lost 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.690
 it's not an option for an artist in the 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.030
 stage you have to let go you have 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.440
 to feel it with a lot of love what 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.300
 you want to do to conquer the public 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.520
 it's the first thing one more do not be afraid 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.140

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.140
