00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 I can't do more because I'm so sad and tired. 

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:15.001
 Anyway, I think I'll be fine when I see you. 

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:20.002
 ~ I want to protect ~ 

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:25.003
 Even your bad habits 

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:30.004
 they'll smile on my face if I'm tired. 

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:39.005
 If you're having trouble, I'll go and tell you how much I love you 

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:45.006
 until the day you fall into my arms. 

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:54.007
 I can't smile, I don't even remember when I smiled. 

00:00:54.008 --> 00:01:02.008
 Even today, I feel when I open my eyes, everything can disappear like a dream. 

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:09.009
 Even if I see you, I feel you're not with me. 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:16.510
 I think I still can't express myself well enough that I love you. 

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:23.011
 ~ I want to protect ~ 

00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:29.012
 Even your bad habits 

00:01:29.013 --> 00:01:33.013
 they'll smile on my face if I'm tired. 

00:01:33.014 --> 00:01:43.014
 If you're having trouble, I'll go and tell you how much I love you 

00:01:43.015 --> 00:01:50.015
 until the day you fall into my arms. Ooh ~ ~ 

00:01:50.017 --> 00:02:00.017
 If you leave, can you find a warmth for someone else to be happy? 

00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:04.018
 Oooh ~ ~ 

00:02:04.018 --> 00:02:09.018
 Even so, I can't let go! Baby ~ ~ 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:16.019
 It's more painful than death! 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.020
 ~ OH ~ 

00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:30.021
 ~ Love ~ 

00:02:30.022 --> 00:02:36.022
 ~ More than anyone else ~ ~ I'm next to you ~ 

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:40.023
 I'm not gonna let go of your hand! 

00:02:40.024 --> 00:02:50.024
 I can't give it to other arms! 

00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:54.525
 My heart can't let go! 

00:02:54.526 --> 00:02:57.026
 Why? 

00:03:03.527 --> 00:03:10.027
 Thank you for watching! :)
