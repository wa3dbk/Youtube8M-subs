helicopter is ready to fly you can also

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.040 
helicopter is ready to fly you can also
charge<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.399> helicopter<00:00:48.149> using<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> cable

this<00:00:49.170> inside<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> controller<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.460> I

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
this inside the controller but I

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.860 
this inside the controller but I
wouldn't<00:00:50.730> recommend<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.300> since<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.660> will<00:00:51.719> use

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
wouldn't recommend it since it will use

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.709 
wouldn't recommend it since it will use
up<00:00:52.019> your<00:00:52.170> batteries<00:00:52.590> quickly<00:00:53.449> you<00:00:54.449> want<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
up your batteries quickly you want to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.330 
up your batteries quickly you want to
take<00:00:54.899> off<00:00:55.079> from<00:00:55.289> an<00:00:55.469> even<00:00:55.710> surface<00:00:55.949> when

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
take off from an even surface when

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.520 
take off from an even surface when
you're<00:00:56.489> using<00:00:56.640> your<00:00:56.760> helicopter<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.929> would

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you're using your helicopter so I would

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.290 
you're using your helicopter so I would
suggest<00:00:58.769> using<00:00:59.129> perhaps<00:00:59.460> an<00:00:59.850> old<00:01:00.000> piece<00:01:00.149> of

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
suggest using perhaps an old piece of

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.709 
suggest using perhaps an old piece of
cardboard<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.949> magazine<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.850> some<00:01:03.090> sort<00:01:03.449> as

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
cardboard or a magazine of some sort as

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.720 
cardboard or a magazine of some sort as
a<00:01:04.050> smooth<00:01:04.440> surface<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> helicopter

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
a smooth surface so the helicopter

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.540 
a smooth surface so the helicopter
doesn't<00:01:05.910> hang<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.360> when<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.660> cakes<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:07.550> now

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
doesn't hang up when the cakes are now

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.670 
doesn't hang up when the cakes are now
are<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.790> ready<00:01:08.940> to<00:01:09.180> go

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
are you ready to go

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.410 
are you ready to go
give<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.830> helicopter<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.760> third<00:01:12.120> to<00:01:12.390> one

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
give the helicopter one third to one

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.360 
give the helicopter one third to one
half<00:01:12.600> throttle<00:01:13.050> initially<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.920> help<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.220> get

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
half throttle initially to help you get

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.230 
half throttle initially to help you get
it<00:01:14.490> off<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.820> ground

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
it off the ground

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.640 
it off the ground
you<00:01:15.360> wanted<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.660> clear<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.930> ground<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.530> get

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
you wanted to clear the ground and get

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.289 
you wanted to clear the ground and get
it<00:01:16.770> into<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.040> air<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:17.369> reduce<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.670> throttle

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
it into the air then reduce the throttle

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.270 
it into the air then reduce the throttle
now<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.200> get<00:01:19.380> enough<00:01:19.530> throttle<00:01:19.920> initially

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
now I can get enough throttle initially

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.039 
now I can get enough throttle initially
