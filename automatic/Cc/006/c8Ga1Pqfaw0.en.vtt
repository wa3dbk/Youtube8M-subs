00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I hope you're all doing well, hello

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
everyone. I'm Loic DablÃ©,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Today, accompanied by

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the papaya, dates,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
my friend the pineapple

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the orange, the banana, the kiwi,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and my friend the pok pok.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We're going to prepare a fruit salad.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
An original fruit salad of course.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Rather than...

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
a syrup that we usually do...

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm going to make

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
a kind of coulis

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
with the kinkeliba.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The kinkeliba that we normally see

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in cereals normally, across Africa

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
we use it in tea...

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
with it virtues

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
for digestion

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
for intestinal transit and so on.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We'll start the syrup, which will cook

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
for between 35 and 45 minutes...

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
a little water...

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
a bit of sugar

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Quite a bit actually, because

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
it will allow

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the preparation to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to transform into syrup...

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We'll reduce it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
for about 45 minutes

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and we'll get a super syrup

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
for our fruit salad.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You have to watch

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
every five minutes,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
if it reduces too much it will burn

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and you'll have to start over.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Low heat, water,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
add water if it reduces too much

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and let it simmer

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
for

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
like I said 35

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to 45 minutes. Now it is perfect

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
it's very syrupy...

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
As you can see all the leaves are covered in syrup.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And now we have

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
at the bottom of the pot

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
a syrup that we'll use to

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
cover the fruit.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'll put it aside...

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and now we'll

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
move to the cutting...

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We'll take some different fruit

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and we can have fun with shapes

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
textures and tastes...

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The idea of the fruit salad...

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We have our papaya...

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
What can I do with the papaya? I'll cut it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
like this...

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So now what should I do?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'll skin it, always better

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
when we take off the skin...

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
we'll go freestyle. I'll

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
make slices like this...

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Voila...

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We have some tiny bananas...

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
you know that bananas brown

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
they become black

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
that is why I add lemon

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
so that they don't blacken...

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
We have our orange...

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
What we'll do with the oranges is make supremes.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So now we have

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
small white markings,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and we're going to cut

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
just before and after them...

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Repeat the operation...

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Voila...

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We'll cut some kiwi...

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Important for the equilibrium...

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
kiwi provides fiber...

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
it also adds colour for the salad.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
What can I do with the kiwi?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We'll

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
cut rounds...

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
To finish...

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
a local pineapple...

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So now we have all our fruits...

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We've our pok pok...

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
We're going to play with shapes again...

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
We're going have the stand up by themselves...

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Large pieces of pineapple...

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
A nice presentation...

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Start with the larger pieces...

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
We're going to try

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to place the bananas like this...

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
then...

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
little dates...

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
spread them out...

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
A perfect little set-up...

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Normally you add

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
it all to a

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
add it to a

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
plate or a bowl...

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
with a bit of syrup, that's it...

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I'm making

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
an interesting plate...

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Add some papaya...

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
For some colour

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
some blueberries,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
to add some hints of black...

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
the kinkeliba syrup...

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And this is a great fusion...

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And as decoration...

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
small edible flowers...

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
to finish...

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Fruit salad...

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
with kinkeliba syrup

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
the pok pok,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
All our friend have come together on the plate...

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
who all say hi, me too...

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Take care and see you soon...
