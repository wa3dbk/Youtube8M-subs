today<00:00:01.079> I'm<00:00:01.170> going<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.380> show<00:00:01.530> you<00:00:01.560> how<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.040> test

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
today I'm going to show you how to test

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.330 
today I'm going to show you how to test
a<00:00:02.550> spark<00:00:02.879> on<00:00:03.060> that<00:00:03.270> wall<00:00:03.449> motive<00:00:05.299> this<00:00:06.299> is<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
a spark on that wall motive this is the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.910 
a spark on that wall motive this is the
tiny<00:00:08.340> thing<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.700> little<00:00:08.910> house<00:00:09.210> for<00:00:09.920> testing

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
tiny thing a little house for testing

spark<00:00:11.219> on<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.610> would<00:00:12.980> show<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.040> how<00:00:14.160> it

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
spark on that would show you how it

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:25.720 
spark on that would show you how it
works<00:00:17.180> isn't<00:00:18.180> even<00:00:18.690> would<00:00:24.170> it<00:00:25.170> then<00:00:25.230> bit

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
works isn't even would it then bit

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.300 

my<00:01:26.280> advice<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:27.299> can't<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:28.049> your<00:01:28.500> old<00:01:28.829> spark

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
my advice you can't see your old spark

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.490 
my advice you can't see your old spark
plugs<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.700> work<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:30.090> will<00:01:30.270> get<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> these

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
plugs that work we will get one of these

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.300 
plugs that work we will get one of these
they<00:01:32.460> work<00:01:33.290> anything<00:01:34.290> test<00:01:34.560> she<00:01:35.009> got<00:01:35.159> good

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
they work anything test she got good

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.850 
they work anything test she got good
