a review of the syma x5
mini<00:00:14.570> quadcopter<00:00:15.309> now<00:00:16.309> this<00:00:16.490> is<00:00:16.640> a<00:00:16.699> pretty

mini quadcopter now this is a pretty

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.990 
mini quadcopter now this is a pretty
cool<00:00:17.090> little<00:00:17.300> quadcopter<00:00:18.080> I<00:00:18.770> like<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:19.699> size

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
cool little quadcopter I like the size

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.660 
cool little quadcopter I like the size
of<00:00:20.390> it<00:00:20.539> and<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.960> three<00:00:21.560> bladed<00:00:21.890> props<00:00:22.310> on<00:00:22.640> a

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
of it and the three bladed props on a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.690 
of it and the three bladed props on a
little<00:00:22.940> quad<00:00:23.180> like<00:00:23.420> this<00:00:23.690> looks<00:00:24.050> pretty<00:00:24.260> cool

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
little quad like this looks pretty cool

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.210 
little quad like this looks pretty cool
it's<00:00:25.700> kind<00:00:25.940> of<00:00:26.030> the<00:00:26.210> little<00:00:26.420> brother<00:00:26.810> of<00:00:27.680> the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
it's kind of the little brother of the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.630 
it's kind of the little brother of the
syma<00:00:28.520> x3<00:00:29.500> which<00:00:30.500> if<00:00:30.680> you<00:00:30.800> saw<00:00:31.010> my<00:00:31.190> review<00:00:31.610> of

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
syma x3 which if you saw my review of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.729 
syma x3 which if you saw my review of
this<00:00:31.910> I<00:00:32.149> wasn't<00:00:32.390> too<00:00:32.719> big<00:00:32.930> of<00:00:33.050> a<00:00:33.110> fan<00:00:33.379> of<00:00:33.620> it

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
this I wasn't too big of a fan of it

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.139 
this I wasn't too big of a fan of it
just<00:00:34.010> because<00:00:34.190> it's<00:00:34.340> a<00:00:34.430> little<00:00:34.610> too<00:00:34.879> big<00:00:35.120> to

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
just because it's a little too big to

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.040 
just because it's a little too big to
fly<00:00:35.570> indoors<00:00:36.430> but<00:00:37.430> not<00:00:37.699> really<00:00:38.090> agile<00:00:38.780> enough

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
fly indoors but not really agile enough

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.260 
fly indoors but not really agile enough
to<00:00:39.289> fly<00:00:39.530> outdoors<00:00:40.160> that<00:00:40.550> got<00:00:40.730> pushed<00:00:41.120> around

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
to fly outdoors that got pushed around

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.140 
to fly outdoors that got pushed around
by<00:00:41.630> the<00:00:41.690> wind<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:42.140> lot<00:00:42.489> so<00:00:43.489> I<00:00:43.520> was<00:00:43.670> really<00:00:43.940> happy

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
by the wind a lot so I was really happy

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.130 
by the wind a lot so I was really happy
to<00:00:44.329> see<00:00:44.510> this<00:00:45.170> being<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.220> small<00:00:46.720> because<00:00:47.720> now

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
to see this being so small because now

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.139 
to see this being so small because now
this<00:00:48.410> is<00:00:48.649> the<00:00:48.829> perfect<00:00:49.070> size<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:49.489> fly<00:00:49.970> around

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
this is the perfect size to fly around

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.630 
this is the perfect size to fly around
the<00:00:50.420> house<00:00:50.890> you<00:00:51.890> know<00:00:51.980> they've<00:00:52.130> got<00:00:52.250> this<00:00:52.399> nice

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
the house you know they've got this nice

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.520 
the house you know they've got this nice
protective<00:00:53.120> built-in<00:00:53.630> frame<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:54.380> can

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
protective built-in frame so you can

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.440 
protective built-in frame so you can
kind<00:00:54.739> of<00:00:54.800> bounce<00:00:54.950> it<00:00:55.220> off<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.370> walls<00:00:55.790> and<00:00:56.329> the

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
kind of bounce it off the walls and the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.630 
kind of bounce it off the walls and the
canopy<00:00:56.960> blocks<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.860> props<00:00:58.130> from<00:00:58.370> hitting<00:00:58.550> the

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
canopy blocks the props from hitting the

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.049 
canopy blocks the props from hitting the
ceiling<00:00:59.410> it's<00:01:00.410> really<00:01:00.829> stable<00:01:01.250> it's<00:01:01.790> really

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
ceiling it's really stable it's really

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.580 
ceiling it's really stable it's really
quiet<00:01:02.980> flies<00:01:03.980> really<00:01:04.430> nicely<00:01:05.049> though<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:06.320> yaw

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
quiet flies really nicely though the yaw

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.730 
quiet flies really nicely though the yaw
rate<00:01:06.890> is<00:01:07.159> pretty<00:01:07.579> slow<00:01:08.030> it<00:01:08.719> has<00:01:09.020> two<00:01:09.409> rates

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
rate is pretty slow it has two rates

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.879 
rate is pretty slow it has two rates
there's<00:01:10.610> a<00:01:10.869> high<00:01:11.869> and<00:01:12.079> a<00:01:12.139> low<00:01:12.319> rate<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:12.740> can

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:12.889 
there's a high and a low rate you can

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:15.489 
there's a high and a low rate you can
switch<00:01:13.189> between<00:01:13.490> them<00:01:13.880> on<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.090> button<00:01:14.479> here<00:01:14.869> but

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499 
switch between them on a button here but

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:18.370 
switch between them on a button here but
the<00:01:15.679> all<00:01:15.920> rate<00:01:16.159> does<00:01:16.429> not<00:01:16.700> change<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:17.749> it's

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
the all rate does not change and it's

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.379 
the all rate does not change and it's
it's<00:01:18.649> pretty<00:01:19.039> slow<00:01:19.399> so<00:01:19.639> that's<00:01:19.909> that's<00:01:20.209> really

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:20.389 
it's pretty slow so that's that's really

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
it's pretty slow so that's that's really
the<00:01:20.869> one<00:01:21.109> limiting<00:01:22.039> factor<00:01:22.639> in<00:01:23.170> you<00:01:24.170> know<00:01:24.289> the

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
the one limiting factor in you know the

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.929 
the one limiting factor in you know the
flight<00:01:24.649> characteristics<00:01:25.219> for<00:01:25.789> this

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
flight characteristics for this

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.440 
flight characteristics for this
otherwise<00:01:26.389> I<00:01:26.630> really<00:01:26.899> like<00:01:27.079> the<00:01:27.229> way<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.380> flies

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
otherwise I really like the way it flies

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.449 
otherwise I really like the way it flies
let's<00:01:29.450> see<00:01:29.630> we've<00:01:29.810> got<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.319> full<00:01:30.920> set<00:01:30.950> of<00:01:31.249> spare

00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:31.459 
let's see we've got a full set of spare

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.389 
let's see we've got a full set of spare
props<00:01:31.939> a<00:01:32.509> screwdriver<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.560> change<00:01:33.889> the<00:01:34.130> props

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
props a screwdriver to change the props

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.899 
props a screwdriver to change the props
and<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:34.759> USB<00:01:35.209> charging<00:01:35.659> cable<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:36.529> then<00:01:37.490> we've

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
and a USB charging cable and then we've

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.940 
and a USB charging cable and then we've
got<00:01:38.119> this<00:01:38.270> transmitter<00:01:38.899> which<00:01:39.289> I've<00:01:39.649> said

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
got this transmitter which I've said

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.099 
got this transmitter which I've said
before<00:01:40.159> about<00:01:40.670> these<00:01:40.880> cyma<00:01:41.209> transmitters<00:01:41.959> and

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
before about these cyma transmitters and

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.889 
before about these cyma transmitters and
I<00:01:42.170> just<00:01:42.409> absolutely<00:01:43.099> hate<00:01:43.340> them<00:01:43.609> I<00:01:43.939> wish<00:01:44.630> they

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
I just absolutely hate them I wish they

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.699 
I just absolutely hate them I wish they
would<00:01:45.079> stop<00:01:45.109> with<00:01:45.679> this<00:01:46.929> xbox360<00:01:47.929> style<00:01:48.409> with

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
would stop with this xbox360 style with

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.879 
would stop with this xbox360 style with
the<00:01:48.829> big<00:01:49.009> thumb<00:01:49.279> pads<00:01:49.929> it's<00:01:50.929> just<00:01:51.139> not<00:01:51.560> it's

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:51.889 
the big thumb pads it's just not it's

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:54.129 
the big thumb pads it's just not it's
just<00:01:52.189> not<00:01:52.369> a<00:01:52.399> good<00:01:52.729> way<00:01:52.969> to<00:01:52.999> fly<00:01:53.389> especially

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:54.139 
just not a good way to fly especially

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:57.909 
just not a good way to fly especially
for<00:01:54.469> pinchers<00:01:55.359> so<00:01:56.359> a<00:01:56.389> little<00:01:56.869> bit<00:01:57.079> awkward<00:01:57.590> you

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:57.919 
for pinchers so a little bit awkward you

00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:00.639 
for pinchers so a little bit awkward you
know<00:01:57.950> but<00:01:58.279> again<00:01:58.369> it's<00:01:58.880> it's<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.719> slow<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.049> mild

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
know but again it's it's a slow and mild

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.249 
know but again it's it's a slow and mild
enough<00:02:01.039> flyer<00:02:01.789> that<00:02:02.209> you<00:02:02.359> know<00:02:02.479> even<00:02:02.749> pincers

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
enough flyer that you know even pincers

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.169 
enough flyer that you know even pincers
can<00:02:03.529> probably<00:02:03.770> fly<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.399> well<00:02:04.789> with<00:02:04.999> their

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
can probably fly it well with their

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.300 
can probably fly it well with their
thumbs<00:02:05.479> or<00:02:05.840> just<00:02:06.200> deal<00:02:06.439> with<00:02:06.469> pinching<00:02:07.130> these

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
thumbs or just deal with pinching these

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.089 
thumbs or just deal with pinching these
big<00:02:07.520> thumb<00:02:07.819> pads<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:09.229> again<00:02:09.530> you've<00:02:09.709> got<00:02:09.860> dual

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
big thumb pads and again you've got dual

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.400 
big thumb pads and again you've got dual
rates<00:02:10.399> on<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.729> left<00:02:10.970> stick<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:11.569> you've<00:02:12.230> got<00:02:12.380> a

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
rates on the left stick and you've got a

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.530 
rates on the left stick and you've got a
flip<00:02:12.739> button<00:02:13.010> on<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.400> right<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:14.090> flips

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
flip button on the right and it flips

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.720 
flip button on the right and it flips
pretty<00:02:14.840> decently<00:02:15.380> even<00:02:15.830> with<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.130> frame<00:02:16.400> on

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
pretty decently even with the frame on

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.920 
pretty decently even with the frame on
it<00:02:17.440> let's<00:02:18.440> see<00:02:18.770> it's<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.730> get<00:02:19.850> about<00:02:20.090> 30min

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
it let's see it's you get about 30min

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.990 
it let's see it's you get about 30min
thirty<00:02:21.590> minutes<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:22.010> charge<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.549> for<00:02:22.579> about<00:02:22.879> a

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
thirty minutes to charge it for about a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.970 
thirty minutes to charge it for about a
six<00:02:23.390> minute<00:02:23.599> flight<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:25.000> oh<00:02:26.000> this<00:02:26.599> when<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.620> got

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
six minute flight and oh this when I got

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.360 
six minute flight and oh this when I got
this<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:29.180> props<00:02:29.569> I<00:02:30.019> think<00:02:30.200> my<00:02:30.439> back<00:02:30.920> props

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
this the props I think my back props

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.360 
this the props I think my back props
were<00:02:31.849> reversed<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.230> every<00:02:33.590> time<00:02:33.799> I<00:02:33.860> would<00:02:34.069> try

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
were reversed so every time I would try

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.500 
were reversed so every time I would try
to<00:02:34.430> take<00:02:34.819> off<00:02:36.280> no<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.430> was<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.670> front<00:02:37.939> pop<00:02:38.150> drop

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
to take off no it was the front pop drop

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.929 
to take off no it was the front pop drop
front<00:02:38.959> props<00:02:39.379> were<00:02:39.620> reversed<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:40.310> when<00:02:40.549> I<00:02:40.579> take

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
front props were reversed so when I take

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.699 
front props were reversed so when I take
off<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.420> would<00:02:41.540> flip<00:02:41.840> over<00:02:42.019> that<00:02:42.170> way<00:02:42.500> because

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
off it would flip over that way because

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.520 
off it would flip over that way because
the<00:02:43.040> back<00:02:43.250> props<00:02:43.609> were<00:02:43.819> working<00:02:44.180> fine<00:02:44.540> but<00:02:45.409> the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
the back props were working fine but the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.670 
the back props were working fine but the
front<00:02:45.769> pop<00:02:45.980> props<00:02:46.430> were<00:02:46.670> pushing<00:02:47.120> air<00:02:47.329> down

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
front pop props were pushing air down

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.259 
front pop props were pushing air down
because<00:02:48.680> they<00:02:48.859> were<00:02:48.890> reversed<00:02:49.519> so<00:02:49.819> every<00:02:50.090> time

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
because they were reversed so every time

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.789 
because they were reversed so every time
I<00:02:50.299> try<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.629> take<00:02:50.810> off<00:02:51.049> it<00:02:51.230> would<00:02:51.349> flip<00:02:51.620> like

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
I try to take off it would flip like

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.610 
I try to take off it would flip like
that<00:02:51.859> so<00:02:52.790> if<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.239> happens<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.930> yours

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
that so if that happens to yours

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.699 
that so if that happens to yours
whichever<00:02:55.370> side<00:02:55.459> lifts<00:02:56.299> is<00:02:56.480> fine<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.440> then

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
whichever side lifts is fine and then

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.830 
whichever side lifts is fine and then
just<00:02:58.010> switch<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.609> props<00:02:58.909> on<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.299> other<00:02:59.450> side

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
just switch the props on the other side

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.319 
just switch the props on the other side
you<00:03:00.739> know<00:03:00.829> from<00:03:01.099> left<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.459> right<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.060> then<00:03:02.209> it

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
you know from left to right and then it

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.020 
you know from left to right and then it
should<00:03:02.540> work<00:03:02.750> fine<00:03:03.019> so<00:03:03.379> I<00:03:03.769> have<00:03:04.129> no<00:03:04.400> idea<00:03:04.760> how

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
should work fine so I have no idea how

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.000 
should work fine so I have no idea how
that<00:03:05.090> happened<00:03:05.840> if<00:03:06.049> you<00:03:06.230> know<00:03:06.379> that<00:03:06.650> happened

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
that happened if you know that happened

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.220 
that happened if you know that happened
in<00:03:07.129> customs<00:03:07.700> or<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.120> factory<00:03:08.629> just<00:03:08.870> put<00:03:09.019> it<00:03:09.139> on

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
in customs or the factory just put it on

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.800 
in customs or the factory just put it on
wrong<00:03:09.849> so<00:03:10.849> that's<00:03:11.000> something<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.420> keep<00:03:11.540> an<00:03:11.689> eye

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
wrong so that's something to keep an eye

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.210 
wrong so that's something to keep an eye
out<00:03:11.840> for<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.500> thought<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.889> was<00:03:13.069> worth

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
out for and I thought that was worth

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.220 
out for and I thought that was worth
mentioning<00:03:15.220> also<00:03:16.220> it<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.849> has<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.689> the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
mentioning also it it has the the

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.280 
mentioning also it it has the the
battery<00:03:18.470> is<00:03:19.010> just<00:03:19.519> kind<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.299> in<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.260> little

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
battery is just kind of in a little

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.770 
battery is just kind of in a little
compartment<00:03:22.159> here<00:03:22.189> on<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.519> bottom<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.150> the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
compartment here on the bottom and the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.520 
compartment here on the bottom and the
cable<00:03:24.470> sticks<00:03:25.069> out<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.609> the<00:03:25.940> bottom<00:03:26.359> and<00:03:26.629> so

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
cable sticks out the the bottom and so

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.500 
cable sticks out the the bottom and so
it<00:03:27.829> can<00:03:28.069> kind<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.400> get<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.579> little<00:03:28.910> in<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.359> way

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
it can kind of get a little in the way

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.390 
it can kind of get a little in the way
like<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.049> cable<00:03:30.440> wants<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.859> stick<00:03:31.160> down

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
like the cable wants to stick down

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.670 
like the cable wants to stick down
farther<00:03:31.970> than<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.480> feet<00:03:32.780> sometimes<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:33.620> you

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
farther than the feet sometimes so you

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.250 
farther than the feet sometimes so you
kind<00:03:33.889> of<00:03:33.919> have<00:03:34.069> to<00:03:34.329> smash<00:03:35.329> it<00:03:35.359> and<00:03:35.780> push<00:03:35.989> it<00:03:36.139> out

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
kind of have to smash it and push it out

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.530 
kind of have to smash it and push it out
of<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.470> way<00:03:36.849> but<00:03:37.849> you<00:03:37.940> know<00:03:38.060> it's<00:03:38.180> kind<00:03:38.389> of<00:03:38.480> a

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
of the way but you know it's kind of a

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.259 
of the way but you know it's kind of a
minor<00:03:38.810> complaint<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.799> you<00:03:40.280> can<00:03:40.579> open<00:03:41.120> this

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
minor complaint and you can open this

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.439 
minor complaint and you can open this
little<00:03:41.949> hatch<00:03:42.949> here<00:03:43.549> and<00:03:43.730> get<00:03:43.909> the<00:03:44.060> battery

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
little hatch here and get the battery

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.920 
little hatch here and get the battery
out<00:03:45.069> and<00:03:46.069> let's<00:03:46.280> see<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.430> think<00:03:46.489> it's<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:47.000> 200

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
out and let's see I think it's a 200

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.479 
out and let's see I think it's a 200
milli<00:03:48.109> amp<00:03:48.349> hour<00:03:48.530> battery<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:50.780> then<00:03:50.959> also<00:03:51.489> the

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
milli amp hour battery and then also the

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.750 
milli amp hour battery and then also the
it's<00:03:52.970> got<00:03:53.180> LEDs<00:03:53.810> here<00:03:54.199> in<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.409> front<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.069> they

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
it's got LEDs here in the front and they

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.210 
it's got LEDs here in the front and they
blink<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.479> entire<00:03:56.900> time<00:03:57.379> they<00:03:57.680> never<00:03:57.859> go

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
blink the entire time they never go

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.990 
blink the entire time they never go
solid<00:03:58.609> and<00:03:59.209> then<00:04:00.169> so<00:04:00.680> you've<00:04:00.859> got<00:04:01.040> no<00:04:01.280> LVC

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
solid and then so you've got no LVC

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.670 
solid and then so you've got no LVC
warning<00:04:02.030> like<00:04:02.690> they're<00:04:02.930> you<00:04:03.169> know<00:04:03.199> normally

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
warning like they're you know normally

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.199 
warning like they're you know normally
you'd<00:04:03.829> have<00:04:04.040> solid<00:04:04.489> lights<00:04:04.729> and<00:04:05.030> then<00:04:05.120> when

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
you'd have solid lights and then when

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.789 
you'd have solid lights and then when
you<00:04:05.299> get<00:04:05.389> to<00:04:05.449> LBC<00:04:06.019> the<00:04:06.169> lights<00:04:06.349> would<00:04:06.500> start

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
you get to LBC the lights would start

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:07.270 
you get to LBC the lights would start
blinking

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
blinking

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.879 
blinking
well<00:04:08.030> these<00:04:08.329> lights<00:04:08.659> blink<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:09.199> entire<00:04:09.560> time

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
well these lights blink the entire time

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.789 
well these lights blink the entire time
you're<00:04:10.069> flying<00:04:10.389> so<00:04:11.389> you<00:04:11.479> have<00:04:11.810> no<00:04:12.049> idea<00:04:12.470> when

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
you're flying so you have no idea when

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.069 
you're flying so you have no idea when
lvc<00:04:13.400> is<00:04:13.579> about<00:04:13.849> to<00:04:14.030> kick<00:04:14.239> in<00:04:14.449> you<00:04:14.629> just<00:04:14.750> kind<00:04:15.019> of

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
lvc is about to kick in you just kind of

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.349 
lvc is about to kick in you just kind of
happen<00:04:15.440> you<00:04:16.130> know<00:04:16.250> pay<00:04:16.459> attention<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:17.180> notice

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
happen you know pay attention and notice

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.500 
happen you know pay attention and notice
when<00:04:17.720> it's<00:04:17.840> starting<00:04:18.229> to<00:04:18.320> lose<00:04:18.530> power<00:04:19.510> all

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
when it's starting to lose power all

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.819 
when it's starting to lose power all
right<00:04:20.690> well<00:04:20.840> that's<00:04:20.959> all<00:04:21.289> I<00:04:21.349> have<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.680> say

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
right well that's all I have to say

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.680 
right well that's all I have to say
about<00:04:21.949> it<00:04:22.190> so<00:04:22.310> now<00:04:22.760> let's<00:04:22.970> go<00:04:23.150> take<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.479> for<00:04:23.630> a

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
about it so now let's go take it for a

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.800 
about it so now let's go take it for a
flight<00:04:24.880> all<00:04:25.880> right<00:04:26.060> this<00:04:26.270> is<00:04:26.449> the<00:04:26.479> flight

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
flight all right this is the flight

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.469 
flight all right this is the flight
review<00:04:27.020> of<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.680> syma<00:04:27.949> expore<00:04:28.909> assault

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
review of the syma expore assault

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:36.409 
review of the syma expore assault
quadcopter<00:04:30.669> go<00:04:31.669> ahead<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.120> give<00:04:32.300> her<00:04:32.450> a<00:04:32.479> spin

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.119 

so<00:04:37.419> you<00:04:37.569> can<00:04:37.750> hear<00:04:37.990> it's<00:04:38.110> pretty<00:04:38.379> quiet<00:04:38.680> it's

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:39.129 
so you can hear it's pretty quiet it's

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:40.830 
so you can hear it's pretty quiet it's
got<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.310> little<00:04:39.550> bit<00:04:39.759> of<00:04:39.910> a<00:04:40.030> unique<00:04:40.539> sound

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
got a little bit of a unique sound

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.010 
got a little bit of a unique sound
because<00:04:41.259> it's<00:04:41.440> got<00:04:41.590> those<00:04:41.830> tiny<00:04:42.220> little<00:04:43.020> gear

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
because it's got those tiny little gear

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.559 
because it's got those tiny little gear
drive<00:04:44.470> motors<00:04:45.099> but<00:04:45.490> as<00:04:45.699> you<00:04:45.819> can<00:04:45.940> see<00:04:46.000> it<00:04:46.389> is

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:46.569 
drive motors but as you can see it is

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:49.710 
drive motors but as you can see it is
quite<00:04:46.900> stable<00:04:47.729> it's<00:04:48.729> like<00:04:48.879> I<00:04:49.000> maybe<00:04:49.180> need<00:04:49.389> just

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
quite stable it's like I maybe need just

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.850 
quite stable it's like I maybe need just
a<00:04:49.840> touch<00:04:50.199> of<00:04:50.229> trim<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:52.080> then<00:04:53.080> here's<00:04:53.500> full

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
a touch of trim and then here's full

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.610 
a touch of trim and then here's full
pure<00:04:54.220> light<00:04:54.490> so<00:04:55.349> pretty<00:04:56.349> slow<00:04:56.919> y'all<00:04:57.340> rates

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
pure light so pretty slow y'all rates

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.129 
pure light so pretty slow y'all rates
but<00:04:59.620> it's<00:04:59.979> it's<00:05:00.400> doable<00:05:00.909> I'm<00:05:01.300> on<00:05:01.479> higher<00:05:01.810> rate

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
but it's it's doable I'm on higher rate

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.890 
but it's it's doable I'm on higher rate
for<00:05:02.379> pitch<00:05:02.830> so<00:05:03.129> you<00:05:03.250> can<00:05:03.370> see<00:05:03.580> it<00:05:03.729> it's<00:05:04.629> got<00:05:04.870> a

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
for pitch so you can see it it's got a

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.760 
for pitch so you can see it it's got a
decent<00:05:05.229> amount<00:05:05.530> of<00:05:05.919> throw<00:05:06.990> but<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.199> yaw<00:05:08.470> rate

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
decent amount of throw but the yaw rate

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.399 
decent amount of throw but the yaw rate
kind<00:05:09.310> of<00:05:09.490> keeps<00:05:09.789> you<00:05:10.030> from<00:05:10.300> getting<00:05:10.599> too<00:05:11.050> crazy

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
kind of keeps you from getting too crazy

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:17.990 
kind of keeps you from getting too crazy
with<00:05:11.800> it

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.690 

but<00:05:18.630> it's<00:05:18.840> really<00:05:19.200> nice<00:05:19.590> and<00:05:19.950> smooth<00:05:20.340> now<00:05:20.640> you

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
but it's really nice and smooth now you

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.150 
but it's really nice and smooth now you
can<00:05:21.200> fly<00:05:22.200> nice<00:05:22.530> circuits<00:05:23.190> with<00:05:23.460> it<00:05:24.920> and<00:05:25.920> have

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
can fly nice circuits with it and have

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.760 
can fly nice circuits with it and have
to<00:05:26.190> keep<00:05:26.520> a<00:05:26.700> little<00:05:26.880> docile<00:05:27.620> so<00:05:28.620> it'd

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
to keep a little docile so it'd

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.040 
to keep a little docile so it'd
definitely<00:05:28.980> be<00:05:29.250> a<00:05:29.370> good<00:05:29.640> beginner<00:05:30.120> quad<00:05:30.570> or

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
definitely be a good beginner quad or

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.810 
definitely be a good beginner quad or
just<00:05:31.380> you<00:05:31.590> know<00:05:31.740> anybody<00:05:32.130> that<00:05:32.430> wants<00:05:32.700> the

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
just you know anybody that wants the

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.950 
just you know anybody that wants the
nice<00:05:33.060> relaxing<00:05:33.840> indoor<00:05:34.290> flyer<00:05:35.150> it's<00:05:36.150> just<00:05:36.480> you

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
nice relaxing indoor flyer it's just you

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.730 
nice relaxing indoor flyer it's just you
know<00:05:37.110> nice<00:05:37.590> and<00:05:37.860> easy<00:05:38.040> to<00:05:38.310> fly<00:05:39.320> if<00:05:40.320> it<00:05:40.500> had<00:05:40.710> a

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
know nice and easy to fly if it had a

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.220 
know nice and easy to fly if it had a
little<00:05:41.040> bit<00:05:41.430> faster<00:05:41.970> y'all<00:05:42.300> rate<00:05:42.600> it<00:05:42.840> actually

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 
little bit faster y'all rate it actually

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.010 
little bit faster y'all rate it actually
probably<00:05:43.650> be<00:05:43.800> pretty<00:05:44.360> pretty<00:05:45.360> decent<00:05:45.960> for

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
probably be pretty pretty decent for

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.330 
probably be pretty pretty decent for
just<00:05:46.620> about<00:05:46.770> anybody<00:05:48.680> but<00:05:49.680> it<00:05:49.830> seems<00:05:50.100> to<00:05:50.310> be

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
just about anybody but it seems to be

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.190 
just about anybody but it seems to be
that<00:05:50.520> they<00:05:50.700> got<00:05:51.270> it<00:05:51.390> dialed<00:05:51.660> down<00:05:51.960> for

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
that they got it dialed down for

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.530 
that they got it dialed down for
beginners<00:05:52.850> alright<00:05:53.850> well<00:05:54.000> let's<00:05:54.150> give<00:05:54.360> it<00:05:54.390> a

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
beginners alright well let's give it a

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.790 
beginners alright well let's give it a
flip<00:05:56.060> OOP<00:05:57.060> that<00:05:57.090> was<00:05:57.570> that<00:05:57.990> was<00:05:58.110> my<00:05:58.320> bad<00:05:58.560> on

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
flip OOP that was that was my bad on

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.230 
flip OOP that was that was my bad on
that<00:05:59.010> one<00:06:00.650> so<00:06:01.650> losing<00:06:02.430> a<00:06:02.640> little<00:06:02.790> bit<00:06:02.940> of

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
that one so losing a little bit of

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:11.920 
that one so losing a little bit of
height<00:06:03.450> after<00:06:03.900> a<00:06:03.930> flip<00:06:09.410> throttle<00:06:10.410> into<00:06:10.650> one

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
height after a flip throttle into one

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.510 
height after a flip throttle into one
there<00:06:12.930> we<00:06:13.080> go<00:06:15.110> if<00:06:16.110> you<00:06:16.169> kind<00:06:16.590> of<00:06:16.650> throttle<00:06:16.950> into

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
there we go if you kind of throttle into

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.400 
there we go if you kind of throttle into
the<00:06:17.640> flip<00:06:17.940> that<00:06:18.210> certainly<00:06:18.690> helps<00:06:19.169> with<00:06:19.230> the

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
the flip that certainly helps with the

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.560 
the flip that certainly helps with the
recovery<00:06:22.700> still<00:06:23.700> a<00:06:23.729> little<00:06:23.880> pretty<00:06:24.210> slow<00:06:24.510> to

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
recovery still a little pretty slow to

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
recovery still a little pretty slow to
recover<00:06:24.780> though<00:06:26.419> but<00:06:27.419> nice<00:06:27.630> clean<00:06:28.080> flips<00:06:28.440> just

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
recover though but nice clean flips just

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:39.470 
recover though but nice clean flips just
a<00:06:28.919> little<00:06:29.160> slow<00:06:29.400> on<00:06:29.430> the<00:06:29.640> recovery<00:06:30.180> that's<00:06:30.360> all

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.740 

so<00:06:39.900> that's<00:06:40.170> given<00:06:41.130> in<00:06:41.220> full<00:06:41.550> y'all<00:06:42.360> right

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
so that's given in full y'all right

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.220 
so that's given in full y'all right

video<00:07:15.020> flying<00:07:15.440> there<00:07:15.740> I<00:07:15.770> think<00:07:16.070> I<00:07:16.220> drained<00:07:16.610> the

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:16.730

that<00:07:18.320> was<00:07:18.410> a<00:07:18.440> good<00:07:18.710> sample<00:07:19.190> of<00:07:19.250> what<00:07:19.400> she<00:07:19.580> flies

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850 
that was a good sample of what she flies

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.890 
that was a good sample of what she flies
like<00:07:20.210> and<00:07:20.690> that<00:07:21.410> is<00:07:21.620> the<00:07:21.890> cyma<00:07:22.310> x4<00:07:23.240> assault

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:23.900
