00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
where water is coming in I've got an

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.459 
where water is coming in I've got an
area<00:00:37.710> up<00:00:37.829> here<00:00:38.600> where<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> put<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> new<00:00:40.200> hatch

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
area up here where I put the new hatch

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.560 
area up here where I put the new hatch
on<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:41.190> kind<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.520> temporarily<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.239> sealed

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
on just kind of temporarily and sealed

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.410 
on just kind of temporarily and sealed
it<00:00:42.719> down<00:00:42.899> with<00:00:43.140> tape<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.340> edges<00:00:44.550> because

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
it down with tape on the edges because

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.410 
it down with tape on the edges because
before<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.140> had<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> piece<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.770> plexiglass

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
before it just had a piece of plexiglass

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.200 
before it just had a piece of plexiglass
wrapped<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.629> some<00:00:48.960> plastic<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.820> was<00:00:50.969> still

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
wrapped in some plastic and it was still

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.799 
wrapped in some plastic and it was still
leaking<00:00:52.250> but<00:00:53.250> everything<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.180> could<00:00:54.449> find

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
leaking but everything that I could find

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.779 
leaking but everything that I could find
I<00:00:55.230> closed<00:00:55.739> up<00:00:56.010> my<00:00:56.610> only<00:00:56.789> suspect<00:00:57.180> now<00:00:57.750> might<00:00:58.199> be

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
I closed up my only suspect now might be

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.880 
I closed up my only suspect now might be
this<00:00:59.789> area<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.600> where<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.870> masked<00:01:01.199> step<00:01:01.590> is

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
this area here where the masked step is

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.579 
this area here where the masked step is
and<00:01:02.219> maybe<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.329> needs<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.719> rebated<00:01:04.409> maybe

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
and maybe that needs to be rebated maybe

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.469 
and maybe that needs to be rebated maybe
there<00:01:04.769> but<00:01:05.040> there's<00:01:05.280> awful<00:01:06.000> lot<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.299> water

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
there but there's awful lot of water

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.280 
there but there's awful lot of water
that<00:01:06.630> gets<00:01:06.900> into<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.350> boat<00:01:07.680> still<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:09.290> so

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
that gets into this boat still and so

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.719 
that gets into this boat still and so
we're<00:01:10.530> gonna<00:01:10.619> take<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> look<00:01:11.100> inside<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
we're gonna take a look inside here and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
we're gonna take a look inside here and
I'll<00:01:11.850> show<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.260> bilges<00:01:13.619> are<00:01:13.799> full

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
I'll show you that the bilges are full

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100 
I'll show you that the bilges are full
the<00:01:14.610> engine<00:01:14.880> compartment<00:01:15.210> has<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> good<00:01:15.930> bit<00:01:16.080> of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the engine compartment has a good bit of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.730 
the engine compartment has a good bit of
water<00:01:16.700> sitting<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.240> well<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.259> have

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
water sitting in it as well so you have

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.010 
water sitting in it as well so you have
to<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.820> water<00:01:20.939> out<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.930> then

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to get the water out of this and then

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.260 
to get the water out of this and then
figure<00:01:22.409> out<00:01:22.439> next<00:01:23.280> time<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> rains<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.000> need<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
figure out next time it rains I need to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.359 
figure out next time it rains I need to
come<00:01:24.479> sit<00:01:24.720> inside<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.259> boat<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:26.189> some

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
come sit inside the boat with some

come sit inside the boat with some
flashlights<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.500> try<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.619> figure<00:01:28.799> out<00:01:28.950> where

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
flashlights and try and figure out where

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.399

access panel to the engine that I built
still<00:01:54.570> needs<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.899> be<00:01:54.930> fibreglass<00:01:55.649> though<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
still needs to be fibreglass though and

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.830 
still needs to be fibreglass though and
Joe<00:01:57.390> coded<00:01:58.790> so<00:01:59.790> as<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.210> see<00:02:00.270> there's<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
Joe coded so as you can see there's a

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.690 
Joe coded so as you can see there's a
good<00:02:01.049> bit<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.259> standing<00:02:01.829> water<00:02:02.009> down<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.549> those

there's the bills Jerry up there and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.490 
there's the bills Jerry up there and
they're<00:02:06.240> all<00:02:06.360> connected<00:02:06.810> by<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> series<00:02:07.469> of

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
they're all connected by a series of

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.210 
they're all connected by a series of
tubes<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:09.319> water<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.470> either<00:02:10.709> coming<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
tubes so water is either coming in the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.820 
tubes so water is either coming in the
back<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.819> working<00:02:12.209> its<00:02:12.450> way<00:02:12.660> up

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
back and working its way up

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.770 
back and working its way up
or<00:02:14.070> it's<00:02:14.400> coming<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.850> front<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.420> then

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
or it's coming in the front and then

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.900 
or it's coming in the front and then
dribbling<00:02:16.320> its<00:02:16.470> way<00:02:16.650> back<00:02:17.070> toward<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.580> stern

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
dribbling its way back toward the stern

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.260 
dribbling its way back toward the stern
of<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.150> boat<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.720> not<00:02:19.470> quite<00:02:19.680> sure<00:02:20.000> which<00:02:21.000> way

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
of the boat so not quite sure which way

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.960 
of the boat so not quite sure which way
things<00:02:21.720> are<00:02:21.930> flowing<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:23.190> boat<00:02:23.460> overall

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
things are flowing the boat overall

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.790 
things are flowing the boat overall
tilts<00:02:24.750> toward<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.380> stern<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:28.650> know<00:02:28.770> I

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
tilts toward the stern and so you know I

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.970 
tilts toward the stern and so you know I
typically<00:02:29.220> have<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.640> pump<00:02:29.850> out<00:02:30.090> using<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.110> bilge

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
typically have to pump out using a bilge

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.730 
typically have to pump out using a bilge
pump<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.580> then<00:02:33.270> I'll<00:02:33.390> use<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.600> shopback<00:02:34.080> up<00:02:34.560> in

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
pump and then I'll use a shopback up in

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.890 
pump and then I'll use a shopback up in
the<00:02:34.920> forward<00:02:35.460> area<00:02:35.790> here<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.240> get<00:02:36.390> these<00:02:36.540> clean

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the forward area here to get these clean

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.540 
the forward area here to get these clean
and<00:02:37.110> dries<00:02:37.290> up<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:37.710> we're<00:02:37.950> looking<00:02:38.250> forward

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
and dries up so we're looking forward

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.750 
and dries up so we're looking forward

floor stringers are getting pretty
rotted<00:04:04.410> now<00:04:05.900> delaminated<00:04:06.930> really<00:04:07.739> probably

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
rotted now delaminated really probably

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.180 
rotted now delaminated really probably
going<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.520> need<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:08.850> replace<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.830> lot<00:04:10.830> of<00:04:11.010> this

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
going to need to replace a lot of this

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.050 
going to need to replace a lot of this
stuff<00:04:11.489> just<00:04:12.590> because<00:04:13.590> it's<00:04:13.800> been<00:04:14.060> underwater

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
stuff just because it's been underwater

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.060 
stuff just because it's been underwater
too<00:04:15.239> many<00:04:15.540> times<00:04:15.810> when<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.230> original<00:04:16.470> owners

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
too many times when the original owners

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.110 
too many times when the original owners
bought<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.549> boat

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
bought the boat

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.070 
bought the boat
it<00:04:18.720> was<00:04:18.900> literally<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:20.100> know<00:04:20.220> water<00:04:20.730> was

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
it was literally you know water was

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.800 
it was literally you know water was
probably<00:04:22.080> almost<00:04:22.320> halfway<00:04:22.830> up<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.520> walls<00:04:23.810> the

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
probably almost halfway up the walls the

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.740 
probably almost halfway up the walls the
side

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
side

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.679 
side
so<00:04:26.020> it<00:04:26.229> was<00:04:26.349> really<00:04:27.150> really<00:04:28.150> in<00:04:28.240> pretty<00:04:28.419> tough

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:28.689 
so it was really really in pretty tough

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:29.309 
so it was really really in pretty tough
shape

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:29.319 
shape

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.490 
shape
for<00:04:30.099> them<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.250> get<00:04:30.490> clean<00:04:30.789> now<00:04:31.199> so<00:04:32.199> you<00:04:32.289> got<00:04:32.470> a

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
for them to get clean now so you got a

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.890 
for them to get clean now so you got a
holding<00:04:32.979> tank<00:04:33.009> back<00:04:33.580> there<00:04:33.610> underneath<00:04:34.150> so

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
holding tank back there underneath so

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.309 
holding tank back there underneath so
for<00:04:35.259> the<00:04:35.349> head<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:36.400> you<00:04:37.300> know<00:04:37.419> obviously<00:04:37.659> pump

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
for the head and you know obviously pump

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.010 
for the head and you know obviously pump
outs<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:38.740> everything<00:04:39.129> or<00:04:39.340> up<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.699> the<00:04:39.849> up<00:04:40.780> on

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
outs and everything or up to the up on

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.559 
outs and everything or up to the up on
deck<00:04:41.379> but<00:04:42.219> all<00:04:42.370> in<00:04:42.520> all<00:04:42.610> it's<00:04:42.879> a<00:04:42.969> really<00:04:43.419> good

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
deck but all in all it's a really good

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.260 
deck but all in all it's a really good
strong<00:04:43.960> structure<00:04:44.590> this<00:04:45.430> is<00:04:45.639> the<00:04:45.819> area<00:04:46.060> that<00:04:46.240> I

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
strong structure this is the area that I

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.529 
strong structure this is the area that I
don't<00:04:46.599> know<00:04:47.490> might<00:04:48.490> have<00:04:48.729> water<00:04:49.000> coming<00:04:49.509> down

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
don't know might have water coming down

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.360 
don't know might have water coming down
and<00:04:50.020> then<00:04:50.169> just<00:04:50.409> really<00:04:50.620> kind<00:04:50.919> of<00:04:50.979> coming<00:04:51.189> down

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
and then just really kind of coming down

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.640 
and then just really kind of coming down
that<00:04:51.520> compression<00:04:51.939> post<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:52.629> you<00:04:53.500> know

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
that compression post and you know

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.379 
that compression post and you know
filling<00:04:54.039> into<00:04:54.189> the<00:04:54.430> bilges

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
filling into the bilges

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.439 
filling into the bilges
that's<00:04:55.900> my<00:04:56.310> only<00:04:57.310> place<00:04:57.669> that<00:04:57.909> I'm<00:04:58.030> not<00:04:58.180> sure

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
that's my only place that I'm not sure

00:04:58.449 --> 00:04:59.820 
that's my only place that I'm not sure
of<00:04:58.629> and<00:04:58.810> this<00:04:58.900> is<00:04:59.080> where<00:04:59.229> I'm<00:04:59.319> gonna<00:04:59.469> need<00:04:59.680> to

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
sit in a rainstorm and try and figure

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.790 
sit in a rainstorm and try and figure
this<00:05:02.590> out<00:05:02.889> so<00:05:03.310> let's<00:05:04.110> take<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.139> look<00:05:05.379> a<00:05:05.740> little

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
this out so let's take a look a little

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.089 
this out so let's take a look a little
bit<00:05:06.009> further<00:05:06.280> forward<00:05:07.500> so<00:05:08.500> this<00:05:08.650> was<00:05:08.830> looking

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
bit further forward so this was looking

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:11.159 
bit further forward so this was looking
up<00:05:09.280> in<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.490> v-berth<00:05:09.940> you<00:05:10.389> can<00:05:10.539> see<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.810> anchor

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
up in the v-berth you can see the anchor

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.499 
up in the v-berth you can see the anchor
Locker<00:05:11.349> up<00:05:11.620> there<00:05:11.800> just<00:05:12.069> needs<00:05:12.250> a<00:05:12.400> cover<00:05:12.669> to<00:05:13.330> go

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
Locker up there just needs a cover to go

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.559 
Locker up there just needs a cover to go
over<00:05:13.810> that's<00:05:14.020> a<00:05:14.229> draining<00:05:14.680> cover<00:05:15.550> Locker<00:05:15.849> so

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569 
over that's a draining cover Locker so

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:18.059 
over that's a draining cover Locker so
it<00:05:16.659> drains<00:05:16.840> down<00:05:17.020> through<00:05:17.409> the<00:05:17.500> nose<00:05:17.710> of<00:05:17.949> the

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:18.069 
it drains down through the nose of the

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.330 
it drains down through the nose of the
boat<00:05:18.250> and<00:05:19.210> a<00:05:19.690> few<00:05:19.900> more<00:05:20.500> miscellaneous<00:05:21.159> and
