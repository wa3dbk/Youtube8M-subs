00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.570 
stuff so here we go without further ado
I'm<00:00:23.670> using<00:00:24.199> toxic<00:00:25.199> soil<00:00:25.439> mixed<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.160> some

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
I'm using toxic soil mixed with some

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.109 
I'm using toxic soil mixed with some
hair<00:00:27.570> food<00:00:27.810> natural<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.590> better<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.939> don't

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
hair food natural is better but we don't

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.400 
hair food natural is better but we don't
go<00:00:30.210> with<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.510> today<00:00:30.750> okay<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:33.110> y'all<00:00:34.110> see<00:00:34.260> my

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
go with this today okay and y'all see my

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.900 
go with this today okay and y'all see my
braid<00:00:34.620> pattern<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.399> makes<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.730> really

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
braid pattern so it makes it really

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.720 
braid pattern so it makes it really
really<00:00:36.120> easy<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.829> get<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> scalp<00:00:38.460> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
really easy to get up in the scalp and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.610 
really easy to get up in the scalp and
all<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.969> good<00:00:39.149> stuff<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:40.110> usually<00:00:40.440> start

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
all that good stuff so I usually start

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.420 
all that good stuff so I usually start
from<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.430> go<00:00:41.730> ahead<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.030> start<00:00:42.210> oiling

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
from here and go ahead and start oiling

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.970 
from here and go ahead and start oiling
so<00:00:44.430> stick<00:00:44.789> some<00:00:44.969> oil<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:46.320> know<00:00:46.440> how<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.620> goes

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
so stick some oil you know how that goes

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.389 
so stick some oil you know how that goes
and<00:00:47.480> go<00:00:48.480> ahead<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> next<00:00:49.230> part<00:00:49.469> now<00:00:50.100> here's

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and go ahead to the next part now here's

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.920 
and go ahead to the next part now here's
where<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.660> they're<00:00:51.840> really

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
where the you know they're really

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.920 
where the you know they're really
keeping<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.500> together<00:00:52.670> comes<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.750> use

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
keeping it together comes in you can use

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.049 
keeping it together comes in you can use
braid<00:00:55.469> spray<00:00:55.770> which<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.160> course<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.520> recommend

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
braid spray which of course I recommend

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.930 
braid spray which of course I recommend
I<00:00:57.329> ran<00:00:57.870> out<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.770> I'm<00:00:59.010> using<00:00:59.250> some<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.730> wave

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
I ran out so I'm using some of this wave

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.750 
I ran out so I'm using some of this wave
Nouveau<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:01.199> has<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> lot<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.710> glycerin<00:01:02.219> you

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
Nouveau it has a lot of glycerin you

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.609 
Nouveau it has a lot of glycerin you
know<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.390> braid<00:01:03.629> spray<00:01:03.809> probably<00:01:04.379> more

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
know just like braid spray probably more

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.469 
know just like braid spray probably more
so<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.250> keeps<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> hair<00:01:05.790> released<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.420> you

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
so it keeps the hair released so if you

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.300 
so it keeps the hair released so if you
just<00:01:06.600> don't<00:01:06.689> want<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.930> use<00:01:07.049> too<00:01:07.080> much<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.070> for

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
just don't want to use too much so for

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.660 
just don't want to use too much so for
each<00:01:08.460> piece<00:01:08.850> or<00:01:09.450> each<00:01:09.600> row<00:01:10.280> put<00:01:11.280> some<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.549> my

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
each piece or each row put some of my

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.899 
each piece or each row put some of my
hands<00:01:11.939> rub<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.420> together<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:14.340> will<00:01:14.549> rub<00:01:14.760> it

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
hands rub it together and I will rub it

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.530 
hands rub it together and I will rub it
on<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.299> row<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.759> this<00:01:17.759> hair<00:01:18.000> will<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.450> I

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
on that row and this hair will like I

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.080 
on that row and this hair will like I
said<00:01:18.750> before<00:01:18.869> lock<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.460> then<00:01:20.670> I'll<00:01:20.880> go

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
said before lock up so then I'll go

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.260 
said before lock up so then I'll go
through<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:22.189> separate<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.460> pull<00:01:24.090> each

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
through and just separate and pull each

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.370 
through and just separate and pull each
piece<00:01:24.890> which<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.100> top<00:01:26.810> isn't<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:28.049> mad<00:01:28.229> at

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
piece which the top isn't really mad at

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
piece which the top isn't really mad at
up<00:01:28.500> I'm<00:01:28.770> surprised<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.579> wave<00:01:29.790> Nouveau<00:01:30.119> must

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
up I'm surprised this wave Nouveau must

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.140 
up I'm surprised this wave Nouveau must
be<00:01:30.479> working<00:01:31.400> because<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.700> not<00:01:32.880> really

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
be working because it's not really

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.899 
be working because it's not really
matted<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.829> then<00:01:34.829> I'll<00:01:34.979> go<00:01:35.159> ahead<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.670> oil

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
matted and then I'll go ahead and oil

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.090 
matted and then I'll go ahead and oil
the<00:01:36.090> next<00:01:36.360> row<00:01:38.720> massage<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the next row massage that in to the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.210 
the next row massage that in to the
scalp<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.759> hair<00:01:42.350> then<00:01:43.350> move<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
scalp and the hair then move on to the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.649 
scalp and the hair then move on to the
next<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.540> I'll<00:01:46.200> go<00:01:46.380> ahead<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.890> put<00:01:47.040> some<00:01:47.659> wave

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
next and I'll go ahead and put some wave

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.870 
next and I'll go ahead and put some wave
Nouveau<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.770> as<00:01:49.920> well<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:52.399> start<00:01:53.399> to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
Nouveau on that as well and start to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.870 
Nouveau on that as well and start to
separate<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> pieces<00:01:55.430> pretty<00:01:56.430> much<00:01:56.640> like

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
separate the pieces pretty much like

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.639 
separate the pieces pretty much like
this<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.890> what<00:02:02.880> that's<00:02:03.090> going<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.390> do<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:04.079> help

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
this and what that's going to do is help

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.740 
this and what that's going to do is help
this<00:02:04.920> each<00:02:05.189> piece<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.700> lock<00:02:05.909> up<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.210> its<00:02:06.390> own<00:02:06.540> if

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
this each piece to lock up on its own if

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.809 
this each piece to lock up on its own if
you<00:02:06.869> look<00:02:07.049> at<00:02:07.200> these<00:02:07.380> they're<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.520> point

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
you look at these they're to the point

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.850 
you look at these they're to the point
where<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> can't<00:02:09.390> really<00:02:09.720> separate<00:02:10.649> them

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
where you can't really separate them

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.480 
where you can't really separate them
anymore<00:02:11.069> see<00:02:11.640> they're<00:02:11.819> kind<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.150> locked<00:02:12.930> up<00:02:13.200> in

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490

that<00:05:09.169> looks<00:05:09.800> very<00:05:09.979> much<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.430> same<00:05:10.639> but<00:05:11.180> the

difference about the Bahama curl is the

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.499 
difference about the Bahama curl is the
texture<00:05:14.150> this<00:05:14.930> has<00:05:15.409> some<00:05:16.069> kind<00:05:16.370> of<00:05:16.580> shine<00:05:17.150> to

it very shiny very pretty it does get

it very shiny very pretty it does get
dull<00:05:20.150> over<00:05:20.300> time<00:05:20.469> but<00:05:21.469> this<00:05:22.090> Bahama<00:05:23.090> curl<00:05:23.449> has

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110

a<00:05:24.139> lot<00:05:24.560> of<00:05:24.590> texture<00:05:25.280> it<00:05:25.550> reminds<00:05:25.880> me<00:05:25.940> of<00:05:26.029> like

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
a lot of texture it reminds me of like
