all right I'm gonna preheating the tech
for<00:00:05.640> about<00:00:05.819> five<00:00:06.090> minutes<00:00:06.359> I'm<00:00:07.050> going<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.260> go

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.939 

oh<00:00:24.810> well<00:00:25.810> a<00:00:25.840> few<00:00:26.019> minutes<00:00:26.349> in<00:00:26.500> and<00:00:26.650> I<00:00:26.680> just

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
oh well a few minutes in and I just

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.279 
oh well a few minutes in and I just
flipped<00:00:27.189> them<00:00:27.310> for<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.519> first<00:00:27.670> time<00:00:28.289> this

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
flipped them for the first time this

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.769 
flipped them for the first time this
grill<00:00:29.560> does<00:00:29.830> cook<00:00:30.189> very<00:00:30.849> fast<00:00:30.939> as<00:00:31.419> they<00:00:31.570> said

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
grill does cook very fast as they said

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.420 
grill does cook very fast as they said
it<00:00:31.900> does<00:00:32.050> it<00:00:32.230> puts<00:00:32.379> off<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.559> lot<00:00:32.860> of<00:00:32.890> heat<00:00:33.040> and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
it does it puts off a lot of heat and

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.280 
it does it puts off a lot of heat and
even<00:00:33.699> to<00:00:34.180> an<00:00:34.239> open<00:00:34.540> for<00:00:34.720> a<00:00:34.750> while<00:00:34.960> and<00:00:35.140> it's

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
even to an open for a while and it's

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.280 
even to an open for a while and it's
still<00:00:35.850> showing<00:00:36.850> no<00:00:37.090> sign<00:00:37.390> of<00:00:37.420> heat<00:00:37.750> loss<00:00:37.989> so

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
still showing no sign of heat loss so

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.619 
still showing no sign of heat loss so
this<00:00:38.559> this<00:00:39.489> is<00:00:39.640> gonna<00:00:39.850> be<00:00:39.970> interesting<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.480> see

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
burgers from the tech look like as I

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.210 
burgers from the tech look like as I
said<00:01:03.730> they're<00:01:04.089> all<00:01:04.119> almost<00:01:05.050> 200ms<00:01:05.590> exact<00:01:06.009> like

little clones it cooks very evenly I'm

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.090 
little clones it cooks very evenly I'm
impressed<00:01:09.190> with<00:01:09.340> that<00:01:09.490> part<00:01:09.759> just<00:01:10.920> put<00:01:11.920> this

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
impressed with that part just put this

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.190 
impressed with that part just put this
up<00:01:12.310> real<00:01:12.520> quick<00:01:12.729> and<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:14.110> let's<00:01:14.380> see<00:01:14.619> here

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.370 

very<00:01:17.830> juicy

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.109 

all<00:01:22.009> cooked<00:01:22.369> very<00:01:22.610> well<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:23.320> would<00:01:24.320> say<00:01:25.119> the

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
all cooked very well I would say the

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.330 
all cooked very well I would say the
tech<00:01:26.390> lives<00:01:26.630> up<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:26.869> uh<00:01:27.079> to<00:01:27.740> all<00:01:27.829> of<00:01:27.920> its<00:01:28.070> claims

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
tech lives up to uh to all of its claims

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.760 
tech lives up to uh to all of its claims
I<00:01:28.610> think<00:01:28.670> it's<00:01:28.909> a<00:01:28.969> great<00:01:29.090> grill<00:01:29.530> after<00:01:30.530> seeing

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
I think it's a great grill after seeing

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.710 
I think it's a great grill after seeing
how<00:01:30.860> evenly<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.520> tech<00:01:31.759> cooked<00:01:32.119> hamburgers

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
how evenly the tech cooked hamburgers

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.050 
how evenly the tech cooked hamburgers
and<00:01:32.840> steaks<00:01:33.130> it's<00:01:34.130> probably<00:01:34.490> a<00:01:34.520> waste<00:01:34.700> of<00:01:34.880> time

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
and steaks it's probably a waste of time

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.669 
and steaks it's probably a waste of time
to<00:01:35.240> put<00:01:35.390> this<00:01:35.479> on<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.780> grill<00:01:35.960> but<00:01:36.259> to<00:01:36.500> keep

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
to put this on the grill but to keep

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.560 
to put this on the grill but to keep
with<00:01:36.829> tradition<00:01:37.030> we're<00:01:38.030> going<00:01:38.149> to<00:01:38.210> go<00:01:38.299> ahead

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
with tradition we're going to go ahead

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.870 
with tradition we're going to go ahead
and<00:01:38.810> do<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.200> pizza<00:01:39.860> test<00:01:40.250> on<00:01:40.429> the<00:01:40.520> grill<00:01:40.700> to

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
and do the pizza test on the grill to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.120 
and do the pizza test on the grill to
see<00:01:41.060> how<00:01:41.149> evenly<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:42.380> bottom<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.829> this<00:01:42.950> guy

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
see how evenly the bottom of this guy

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.330 
see how evenly the bottom of this guy
will<00:01:43.340> turn<00:01:43.549> out<00:01:43.729> cooked<00:01:44.710> my<00:01:45.710> prediction<00:01:46.220> is

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
will turn out cooked my prediction is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.789 
will turn out cooked my prediction is
that<00:01:46.549> it's<00:01:46.670> going<00:01:46.819> to<00:01:46.880> be<00:01:46.970> very<00:01:47.210> even<00:01:47.799> we'll

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
that it's going to be very even we'll

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.020 
that it's going to be very even we'll
check<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.100> out<00:01:49.189> in<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.369> few<00:01:49.520> minutes<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:49.939> you

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
check it out in a few minutes and you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.090 
check it out in a few minutes and you
can<00:01:50.149> tell<00:01:50.360> me<00:01:50.569> all<00:01:51.439> right<00:01:51.530> I'm<00:01:51.710> gonna<00:01:51.799> take<00:01:51.979> the

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
can tell me all right I'm gonna take the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.449 
can tell me all right I'm gonna take the
beats<00:01:52.280> off<00:01:52.429> the<00:01:52.610> grill<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.229> then<00:01:54.280> we'll<00:01:55.280> turn

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
beats off the grill and then we'll turn

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:56.710 
beats off the grill and then we'll turn
it<00:01:55.640> over<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:56.000> see<00:01:56.119> what<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.299> bottom<00:01:56.599> looks

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
it over and see what the bottom looks

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.240 
it over and see what the bottom looks
like

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.399 

we<00:02:02.250> can<00:02:02.460> see<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.939> believe<00:02:03.659> my<00:02:03.780> prediction<00:02:04.259> was

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
we can see I believe my prediction was

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.120 
we can see I believe my prediction was
correct

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
correct

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.180 
correct
you<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.610> see<00:02:05.850> how<00:02:06.030> evenly<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.409> browned

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
you can see how evenly it is browned

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.839 
you can see how evenly it is browned
across<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.379> all<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.709> different<00:02:10.920> sear<00:02:11.459> marks
