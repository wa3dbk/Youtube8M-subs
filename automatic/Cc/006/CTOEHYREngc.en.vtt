the region I might have changed to

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:51.570 
the region I might have changed to
region<00:04:44.970> yeah<00:04:46.140> the<00:04:47.140> region<00:04:47.530> is<00:04:49.350> um<00:04:50.350> if<00:04:51.280> you<00:04:51.400> can

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580

pop up the Gorgons covering it up but

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.150 
pop up the Gorgons covering it up but
the<00:04:54.550> region<00:04:54.970> is<00:04:55.210> like<00:04:55.420> this<00:04:55.660> purple<00:04:56.380> looking

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
the region is like this purple looking

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.070 
the region is like this purple looking
thing<00:04:57.490> like<00:04:57.820> the<00:04:57.910> same<00:04:58.060> color<00:04:58.270> is<00:04:58.420> this<00:04:58.570> but

through<00:05:00.910> of<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:02.050> new<00:05:02.170> texture<00:05:02.710> pack<00:05:02.890> that

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
through of the new texture pack that

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.980 
through of the new texture pack that
I've<00:05:03.160> been<00:05:03.220> making<00:05:03.400> I'll<00:05:03.820> probably<00:05:04.150> sit<00:05:04.780> once

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
I've been making I'll probably sit once
