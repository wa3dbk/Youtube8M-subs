00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.770
 for me the appeal could go 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.120
 and also to give a lot of energy in it but those flowers and plants that can 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.380
 you do lots of great things 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.669
 and I even dare 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.669
 Search it is a kind of fall investigation 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.070
 4 in the area 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.480
 But we are big cities to be exhibitions the disease the talk 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.690
 with him 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.790
 walk through the city of Amsterdam a four six and curt smith if you see nothing this 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.630
 weekend no more competition 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.990
 and all that did not come that far 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.410
 it has actually always been conceivable 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.780
 editors 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.010
 so i think look very very important but like the price 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.080
 no where does the hospital have and on 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.150
 and what do you do about it 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.340
 I like to listen 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.360
 then feel with four speakers 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.170
 choose a trend and then this is all the concept that I already have 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.390
 have my head 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.400
 kenneth taylor 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.330
 that happens so far for an entire year 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
 and then you get your own state in the store 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.000
 I also did not know a translation of your life too expensive 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.050
 bush we then got it on a walk 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.750
 that is not liked at all then its also i think it is army 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.400
 the building pop 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.070
 and that i like that he go the title 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.070
 I had to motivate myself whether or not in the water 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.410
 and i just want people to enjoy from the beginning 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.510
 further down the street 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.510
 people as a trendsetter 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.710
 we actually have a very limited space and go into the limited space 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.100
 is because of the chaos in boxes the packaging and 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.050
 what you see is that given is created 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.050
 and that is growing, the calling card is in order 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:15.219
 I see my reaction have children 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.859
 hereafter as it were when it is outside on the sidewalk I'm looking forward to it 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:27.429
 then now 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:30.779
 I am waiting 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:34.569
 just there is also much more fun than you get the right people in the right 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.839
 place and some more confidence is in it 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:43.189
 you cannot expect to tackle, but never copy or promise 58
