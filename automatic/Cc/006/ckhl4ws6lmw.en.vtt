00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
you don't want to discard at the end

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.599 
you don't want to discard at the end
phase<00:03:24.840> but<00:03:25.019> usually<00:03:25.349> at<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:26.040> end<00:03:26.069> phase<00:03:26.340> as

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
phase but usually at the end phase as

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
put in a Vanity emptiness back in um and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.869 
put in a Vanity emptiness back in um and
he<00:03:40.769> was<00:03:40.919> talking<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.250> me<00:03:41.340> about<00:03:41.370> this<00:03:41.669> and<00:03:41.849> he

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
he was talking to me about this and he

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.909 
he was talking to me about this and he
said<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.660> hinders<00:03:43.319> him<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> little<00:03:43.799> bit

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
said that it hinders him a little bit

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.470 
said that it hinders him a little bit
but<00:03:44.190> it's<00:03:44.400> also<00:03:44.549> really<00:03:44.910> really<00:03:45.030> nice<00:03:45.329> when

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
but it's also really really nice when

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.150 
but it's also really really nice when
you're<00:03:45.569> going<00:03:45.690> first<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.199> you<00:03:46.590> get<00:03:46.709> that<00:03:46.799> huge

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
you're going first and you get that huge

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.920 
you're going first and you get that huge
field<00:03:47.459> and<00:03:47.760> then<00:03:47.849> when<00:03:47.970> they<00:03:48.090> try<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.359> come

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
field and then when they try to come

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.180 
field and then when they try to come
back<00:03:49.109> and<00:03:49.319> you<00:03:49.410> just<00:03:49.560> flip<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:49.859> vantage

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
back and you just flip that vantage

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.460 
back and you just flip that vantage
emptiness<00:03:50.699> it<00:03:50.819> kills<00:03:51.120> them<00:03:51.419> so<00:03:51.870> uh<00:03:51.900> it

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
emptiness it kills them so uh it

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.170 
emptiness it kills them so uh it
actually<00:03:52.620> works<00:03:53.010> out<00:03:53.160> or<00:03:53.370> really<00:03:53.639> nicely<00:03:53.940> a

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
actually works out or really nicely a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.520 
actually works out or really nicely a
lot<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.989> works<00:03:55.169> out<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.319> lot<00:03:55.730> better<00:03:56.730> than<00:03:57.180> on

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
lot it works out a lot better than on

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.720 
lot it works out a lot better than on
then<00:03:58.530> worse<00:03:58.739> I<00:03:58.949> guess<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.220> could<00:03:59.340> say<00:03:59.519> and

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
then worse I guess you could say and

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.979 
then worse I guess you could say and
then<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.209> one<00:04:00.329> skill<00:04:00.540> jamming<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.870> two

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
then the one skill jamming the two

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.780 
then the one skill jamming the two
eradicated<00:04:01.440> obviously<00:04:02.069> let's<00:04:02.489> move<00:04:02.609> on<00:04:02.760> to

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
eradicated obviously let's move on to

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.900 
eradicated obviously let's move on to
