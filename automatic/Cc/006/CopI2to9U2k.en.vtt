00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello dear sports fans 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.020
 your attention is presented street 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.540
 program on the horizontal bar and parallel bars 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.000
 name maximum where you will need 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.150
 do maximum reps before reaching 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.789
 failure 12 reps and all perform 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.070
 super sets and finally make one 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.740
 maximum push up approach 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.840
 The first super set is wide 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.090
 pull-up on the bar and wide 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.019
 push ups on the bars how do you perform 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.019
 now see on video 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.649
 One caveat is that pulling up 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:08.090
 First, two approaches change behind the head and 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.090
 final two similar 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.220
 further finishing the first super set we 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.320
 go to the second where we already need 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.630
 will push for narrow gusev 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.220
 pull up on the crossbar reverse 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.220
 grip for thickening the back 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.569
 and 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.700
 Who 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
 what 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.199
 there is also a caveat where we need 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.400
 will make the final two super 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.810
 set with hold 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.810
 angle 1 maximum time 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.870
 Who 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.499
 each 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.390
 the conclusion will need to be wrung out on 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.840
 maximum repeat rest between super 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.220
 sets 90 120 seconds between exercises 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.830
 in superset 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.960
 visible rest me program on mass and 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.970
 relief for more street progress 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.850
 trainings use extra weight 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.850
