 Gamer has given me more disgust than 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.860
 Satisfaction or harsh words are equis 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.750
 but let's start from the beginning 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.210
 tell you a little about your beginnings in the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.250
 game everything started a hot afternoon in 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.380
 Africa I was calm in my 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.020
 burrow when I started to feel a 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.880
 burnt smell I looked out the window 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.740
 a little bit with a shotgun being a 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.470
 fire in thrown and blowing smoke 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.170
 for inside an obvious hunter 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.960
 this message will stick it out the door 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.869
 back but in the end it was several and then 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.180
 of two hours of running and running and 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.720
 grab 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.090
 it turned out that this guy was his end here 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.030
 from sega who was on vacation 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.550
 the company was not doing well and the guy 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.330
 I was looking for an idea to make a 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.010
 game and well that idea was me and then 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.610
 the great success of the video game was of 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.500
 casualty after casualness 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.690
 I did not end up embalmed on the ledge of 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.220
 it is to say that at that time I 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.400
 he was faster than nazarena vélez 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.170
 gathering husband I can not help but notice in 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.420
 your words certain resentment for 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.030
 spouse and they had some problem here 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.290
 they are everything you can think of dad 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.630
 guy was a rat 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.850
 and I do not have anything against rats 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.190
 I wanted to pay anyone when we signed 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.920
 contract I asked him for a large house with 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.650
 garden with games and pool and the very 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.870
 crotto and a fish tank of the gerbil that 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.410
 he had died with a wheel and a glass 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.940
 of water to you seems clear I imagine 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.830
 that due to your inexperience does not 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.680
 you gave the fine print of the contract and 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.469
 they fastened the perfect taba contract 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.180
 I do not understand why then why not 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.489
 you did it because the contracts are 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.319
 made for human beings dresses 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.750
 ever a pig in signing a 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.939
 contract and the truth that we do not always 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.420
 sign the owners of the animals 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.439
 I am they are and dad I do not have an owner 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.689
 they are quiet and what are you going to click 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.819
 someone calm down and keep counting 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:14.120

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.859

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.370
 gloves until one day they started 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.169
 suspect I began to check the 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.120
 bag out of the plane and you had 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.459
 to stop stealing I did not steal anything from 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.329

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.230
 then you could not continue 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.169
 collecting rings after that 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.419

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.940
