00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.539
 tiny pieces 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:13.140
 which we will then melt on the gas a 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.140
 very low flame to avoid confusing it 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.380

 small chunks we left 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.950
 a few slices of apple for decoration 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:48.420
 to insert the dry elements together

 our whole egg 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.209
 and we work 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.120
 then we continue adding butter 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.120
 we broke you up 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.230
 amalgamiamo 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.170
 we still make the milk 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.450
 we work the mixture well for 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.450
 eliminate all the rivers 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:15.610
 at this point we can add the 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:18.180
 punishment that came help chunks e 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.180
 amalgamiamo 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.510
 always try to work from the bottom 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.510
 upward 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.659
 we started to heat ours 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.629
 oven so as to bring it to the right 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:59.840
