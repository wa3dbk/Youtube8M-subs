00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
shot but I'm a little bit more reluctant

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.500 
shot but I'm a little bit more reluctant
than<00:02:40.989> she<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.350> because<00:02:41.709> I'm<00:02:42.120> I'd<00:02:43.120> say<00:02:43.360> I'm<00:02:43.480> more

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
on the introverted side than then she is

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.590 
on the introverted side than then she is
potentially<00:02:48.160> maybe<00:02:48.459> in<00:02:48.790> some<00:02:49.060> ways<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.480> then

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
potentially maybe in some ways and then

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.960 
potentially maybe in some ways and then
another<00:02:49.780> way<00:02:49.989> she<00:02:50.290> might<00:02:50.470> have<00:02:51.280> me<00:02:51.519> beat<00:02:51.700> but

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
another way she might have me beat but

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.850 
another way she might have me beat but
the<00:02:52.120> older<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.420> get<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.660> more<00:02:52.780> it's<00:02:53.230> it's<00:02:53.560> kind

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
the older I get the more it's it's kind

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.039 
the older I get the more it's it's kind
of<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.580> chore<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.120> meet<00:02:55.450> new<00:02:55.600> people<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.959> make

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.600 
new friends
I<00:02:57.060> spent<00:02:58.060> probably<00:02:58.299> like<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:58.870> don't<00:02:59.200> know<00:02:59.610> six

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
I spent probably like I don't know six

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.400 
I spent probably like I don't know six
seven<00:03:00.730> years<00:03:01.180> making<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.750> group<00:03:01.959> of<00:03:02.110> friends

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
seven years making the group of friends

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.270 
seven years making the group of friends
that<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:02.560> consider<00:03:02.950> close<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:05.500> took<00:03:06.130> a

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
that I consider close and that took a

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.949 
that I consider close and that took a
lot<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.459> work<00:03:06.640> for<00:03:06.819> me<00:03:06.910> because<00:03:07.120> I'm<00:03:07.360> not<00:03:07.540> I'm

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
lot of work for me because I'm not I'm

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.380 
lot of work for me because I'm not I'm
not<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.440> most<00:03:08.590> outgoing<00:03:08.830> Nathe<00:03:09.459> person<00:03:10.269> by

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
not the most outgoing Nathe person by

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.990 
not the most outgoing Nathe person by
nature<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:11.980> idea<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.250> moving<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.610> a

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
nature and so the idea of moving to a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.970 
nature and so the idea of moving to a
completely<00:03:13.780> new<00:03:13.900> city<00:03:14.260> away<00:03:14.530> from<00:03:14.560> all<00:03:14.860> the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
completely new city away from all the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.860 
completely new city away from all the
friends<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.340> I've<00:03:15.519> already<00:03:15.670> made<00:03:16.000> in<00:03:16.360> my

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
like that I don't know my brain is kind

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.700 
like that I don't know my brain is kind
of<00:04:30.479> plenty<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:30.840> skips<00:04:31.080> all<00:04:31.199> over<00:04:31.439> the<00:04:31.530> place

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
of plenty it skips all over the place

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.730 
of plenty it skips all over the place
sometimes<00:04:32.870> but<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:33.900> will<00:04:34.110> say<00:04:34.289> to<00:04:34.349> close<00:04:34.560> off

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
sometimes but I will say to close off
