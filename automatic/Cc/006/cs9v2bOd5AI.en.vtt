you don't water it or take care of it
will<00:00:18.330> usually<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.869> take<00:00:19.470> off<00:00:19.740> now<00:00:20.640> naturally

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
a post and what I do is I fasten it a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.459 
a post and what I do is I fasten it a
little<00:00:47.610> bit<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.270> growing<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.840> it'll<00:00:49.230> kind

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
little bit as it's growing so it'll kind

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.430 
little bit as it's growing so it'll kind
of<00:00:49.530> go<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.700> birdhouse<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.289> gets

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
of go up to the birdhouse but as it gets

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.439 
of go up to the birdhouse but as it gets
heavier<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.340> done<00:00:53.579> blooming<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.329> it's

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
heavier and it's done blooming and it's

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.420 
heavier and it's done blooming and it's
had<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> growing<00:00:55.110> season<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.770> gotten<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.399> of

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
had a growing season it's gotten out of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.540 
had a growing season it's gotten out of
control<00:00:56.899> so<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.890> go<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.460> I

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
control so all I do is I go in and I

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.709 
control so all I do is I go in and I
choose<00:00:59.910> certain<00:01:00.329> limbs<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.649> don't<00:01:02.039> want

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
choose certain limbs that I don't want

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.140 
choose certain limbs that I don't want
either<00:01:03.719> dead<00:01:04.229> areas<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:05.970> anything

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
either dead areas like if I see anything

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.370 
either dead areas like if I see anything
like<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:07.020> dead<00:01:08.360> twigs<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.720> cut<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.560> off

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
like this with dead twigs I cut that off

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.929 
like this with dead twigs I cut that off
this<00:01:13.380> one<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.740> getting<00:01:13.950> ready<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.490> turn<00:01:14.729> into

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
this one is getting ready to turn into

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.719 
this one is getting ready to turn into
the<00:01:15.270> berry<00:01:15.630> stage<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.470> stopped<00:01:17.040> blooming<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the berry stage it stopped blooming and

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.609 
the berry stage it stopped blooming and
now<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.210> turn<00:01:18.420> into<00:01:18.630> red<00:01:19.020> berries

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
now it's going to turn into red berries

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.100 
now it's going to turn into red berries
which<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.220> actually<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.720> don't<00:01:21.900> like

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
which I actually like if you don't like

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.280 
which I actually like if you don't like
the<00:01:22.290> berries<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.740> can<00:01:23.040> cut<00:01:23.280> them<00:01:23.369> off<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:28.229> I'm

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the berries you can cut them off so I'm

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.410 
the berries you can cut them off so I'm
basically<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> go<00:01:29.340> through<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.000> prune

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
basically going to go through and prune

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.190 
basically going to go through and prune
it<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.850> I'll<00:01:32.850> take<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> certain<00:01:33.630> amount<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
it and I'll take a certain amount of the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.240 
it and I'll take a certain amount of the
long<00:01:34.470> ones<00:01:35.180> this<00:01:36.180> one's<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.049> ground

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.069 

so<00:01:41.250> there's<00:01:41.640> really<00:01:41.820> not<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.479> good<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> bad

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
so there's really not a good or a bad

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.679 
so there's really not a good or a bad
way<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.460> get<00:01:44.610> first<00:01:45.060> all<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.450> dead

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
way to do it just get first all the dead

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.950 
way to do it just get first all the dead
stuff<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.470> then<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.880> trim<00:01:48.299> back<00:01:48.600> some<00:01:48.659> of

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
stuff and then just trim back some of

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.469 
stuff and then just trim back some of
the<00:01:49.140> heavy<00:01:49.530> heavy<00:01:50.130> parts<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.329> don't

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the heavy heavy parts that just don't

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.700 
the heavy heavy parts that just don't
need<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.899> there<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:54.420> then<00:01:55.079> after<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.649> I

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
need to be there and then after that I

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.730 
need to be there and then after that I
can<00:01:56.159> refasten<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.030> little<00:01:57.210> bit<00:01:57.509> get<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.530> back

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
can refasten it a little bit get it back

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.580 
can refasten it a little bit get it back
