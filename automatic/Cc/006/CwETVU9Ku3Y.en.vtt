done<00:02:50.769> oh<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:54.010> think<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.760> said<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:56.519> should<00:02:57.519> let

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
done oh I think it said I should let

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.570 
done oh I think it said I should let
this<00:02:58.239> steam<00:02:59.019> for<00:02:59.440> one<00:02:59.620> minute<00:02:59.830> to<00:03:00.130> minute<00:03:00.280> I'd

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
this steam for one minute to minute I'd

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.850 
this steam for one minute to minute I'd
say<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:00.970> it's<00:03:01.450> better<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.989> let<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.290> steam<00:03:02.530> for

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
say so it's better to let the steam for

I mean does this actually look like cup

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.739 
I mean does this actually look like cup
noodle<00:03:36.769> it's<00:03:37.069> got<00:03:37.340> cup<00:03:37.670> noodle<00:03:38.060> ingredients

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:38.749 
noodle it's got cup noodle ingredients

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:42.330

as<00:03:38.900> i<00:03:38.959> showed<00:03:39.319> you<00:03:39.349> like<00:03:39.769> shrimp<00:03:40.489> eggs<00:03:41.239> and

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
as i showed you like shrimp eggs and

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:53.400 
as i showed you like shrimp eggs and
green<00:03:43.340> onion<00:03:43.819> pieces<00:03:44.569> of<00:03:44.930> meat

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.450 

hmm<00:03:54.960> it's<00:03:55.960> just<00:03:56.290> good<00:03:56.560> it<00:03:56.980> tastes<00:03:58.110> literally

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
hmm it's just good it tastes literally

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.080

like<00:04:00.460> putting<00:04:01.000> rice<00:04:01.420> into<00:04:01.810> cup<00:04:02.710> noodles<00:04:03.160> soup

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
like putting rice into cup noodles soup

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.440 
like putting rice into cup noodles soup
so<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:04.780> think<00:04:05.380> if<00:04:05.950> you<00:04:06.160> don't<00:04:06.370> have<00:04:06.730> this<00:04:07.060> cup

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
so I think if you don't have this cup

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.450 
so I think if you don't have this cup
noodle<00:04:07.810> go<00:04:07.960> home<00:04:08.140> Kutner<00:04:08.800> the<00:04:08.920> rice<00:04:09.070> in<00:04:09.400> your

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
noodle go home Kutner the rice in your

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.000 
noodle go home Kutner the rice in your
country<00:04:10.000> maybe<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.900> can<00:04:11.050> make<00:04:11.410> something

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
country maybe you can make something

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.980 
country maybe you can make something
similar<00:04:12.640> to<00:04:12.670> this<00:04:12.880> after<00:04:13.480> you<00:04:13.570> have<00:04:13.750> finished

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
similar to this after you have finished

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.250 
similar to this after you have finished
eating<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:15.040> noodles<00:04:15.070> of<00:04:15.640> cup<00:04:16.330> noodle<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:16.900> it
