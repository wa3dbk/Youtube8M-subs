00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 and today we are cooking goulash 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.660
 pork 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:18.660
 and for the beginning, select the mode 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:28.260
 frying on our matches cooking add 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:32.040
 time where 20 minutes turn on a person 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.940
 on heating until the slow cooker 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.510
 warmed add oil there immediately 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.510
 one tablespoon 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.290
 that is, quite a bit 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.980
 here and until warmed up to paris 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.280
 Our 40 reports that it is warmed up 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.280
 of the law 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.600
 cover we do not close show face bow 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.939
 I'll cut carrots 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:28.719
 you can grate on the grate we like 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.719
 when the larger one is set up 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.230
 auto mode arkona 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.170
 but 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.060
 sh 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.250
 but 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.250
 we are growing up so here noodles 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.950
 but 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.640
 sh 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.300
 sh 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.260
 So 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.890
 until the onions are fried with carrots we will cut 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:09.050
 pepper 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:09.050
 I hit the core right now on the trip 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:23.640
 so our onion has enough fried 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:29.940
 add to it a garlic which can 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:32.940
 I usually old and less likely 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.940
 garlic press 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.520
 add foot interfere 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.440
 garlic is not recommended for long fry 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:59.550
 pleasant smell will smell so you need 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.550
 only slightly area 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:10.840
 fry as soon as the smell of garlic 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.930
 about the format went slightly we add 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.930
 here 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.890
 pepper continue to fry 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.760
 the window here we have paid the pepper 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:37.680
 enough 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:42.940
 but here we just add meat 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.770
 meat I lied the middle we cut it 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.560
 approximately like beef stroganoff then 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.390
 there are such small pieces many 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.170
 ready goulash to take chopped meat 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:04:02.160
 but why the translator can do it yourself 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:02.160
 easy send us here now 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:12.200
 we had enough wood to grill 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:14.450
 all sides now we can add 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:20.180
 salt pepper 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.180
 our favorite fell down who likes what 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:29.450
 mix thoroughly wraps 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.160
 went all over the dish 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:40.420
 We add those that our 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.220
 tomatoes continue to fry 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.220
 even more dining 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:51.890
 I added frying time somewhere else five 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.740
 minutes we need tomato steel 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.680
 soft fry 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.800
 Well, our tomatoes have allocated enough 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.620
 juice I add quite a bit 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.110
 literally a teaspoon 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:11.360
 I came out the taste of the present mix everything 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:16.090
 how can i add a little bit 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.090
 you can leave some water 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.159
 but 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.860
 But if it no longer necessary to add this 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.970
 because the bowl on the heat of the moment 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.970
 turn on the heating 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:46.919
 open the cover we will try to press the fire 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:52.069
 for 1 hour and wait when I get ready 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:57.030
 hour setting up our wonderful goulash 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:06:01.580

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.580
