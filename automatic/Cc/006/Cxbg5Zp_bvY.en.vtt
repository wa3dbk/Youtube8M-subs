00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.580
 the ones that I have here but always 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.650
 the most tender but yes because I have left 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.570
 the whole pod in each one has a 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.139
 way to set the one that is leaving the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.139
 whole pod 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.020
 you give it here and the advanced ones are the open ones 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.500
 to pegáis washing seeds 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.500

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.859

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.750
 know they are the mines all but all 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.030
 she is like on the first pole 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.899
 cut here and it 's here and here and now 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.899

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.129
 these are tarragona these actions 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.190
 illicit 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.289
 we give you here as always is to say you 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.940

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.789
 wrong , it always does the same 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.350
 first that comes out by a tip be 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.079
 equally 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.480
 the same can start the same can 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.000
 start here that around here I think 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.230
 here the first one wants to start here 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.120
 for them the first look 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.510
 and it continues through being left empty 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.510
 there is nothing 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.490
 so not many of us have not come by 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.860
 a chip too 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.350
 but let's get your little bit of wine from a 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.750
 friend of sanlúcar that I bring a 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.189
 liter a booklet sometimes five liters of 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.960
 he came in a little pot that we're going to 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.850
 teach I do not remember his name 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.409
 gave the card but I'm going to teach I'm going 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.720
 teach wine and from here I send a 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.630
 greeting since the winery does not send me 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.880
 Nobody came and was good 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.890
 the winery will say that you want me to 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.659
 maintain and the wine kitchen is not that 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.899
 I for a bottle of wine or a box of 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.789
 wine 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.649

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.709
 it stays the same then I will buy it where 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.049

00:01:53.709 --> 00:02:00.819

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.289

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:11.920
 advance the subject a little bit 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:16.540
