00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.340
 and of course 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.860
 and 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.520
 actions of people commenting on the state 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.250
 I was like entering the games of the 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.439
 hungry and sky one you can not know can 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.290
 enter with the minecraft and 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:29.560
 normal because you already know that william 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:32.320
 allows the mox very good that you 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.629
 he has shown them almost several times 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.140
 shown that to enter they do so 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:42.100
 that is if they put here and it starts to 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.260
 load good is like that and you get in but not 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.040
 we wash all of them so that they can 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:52.250
 put and put your name does not accommodate 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.630
 and here I have jota gamer I already had that 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.630
 how I had it 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.480
 If you already had and therefore I did not 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.480
 lets in 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.979
 come, he will not let me in because 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.870
 because these are separated letters 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.190
 or pro anyway 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.190
 I mean, if I put it like that 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.160
 they do not let me give 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.330
 why because he's afraid it's because 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.330
 I want to get into this segment 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.350
 well he does not leave me because one is because 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.369
 the best you have a separate man and two 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.930
 because the name is not composed as 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.090
 It should be as if it is not 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.829
 complete with an idea as they have to 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.100
 put the best with a capital letter and 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:50.490
 you must like I put 2 with that as 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.810
 that a man what 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.810
 write skrillex 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.049
 do you write 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.060
 when entering because I'm putting the 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.570
 name with the capital letter in 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.570
 lowercase 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.390
 ah 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.720
 but if you put it right that's what 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.019
 it would be me that I know as his name that 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.680
 go on like this with the day it's called my name is 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:27.519
 johan they put like that they put another name johan 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.170
 Well, whatever you call it and that's how it is 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.650
 as you would see it would be that they put 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.950
 their names well with the lowercase and 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.950
 uppercase 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:52.490
 if I was because I already told you 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.120
 because they have to do as it has to 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.590
 be capitalized with your name 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.590
 good everything 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.790
 goodbye 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.590
 yes
