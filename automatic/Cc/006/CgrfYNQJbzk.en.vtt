vitamin e only gets absorbed by the body
by<00:05:00.320> one-third<00:05:01.159> so<00:05:01.610> if<00:05:01.669> you<00:05:01.789> take<00:05:01.970> a<00:05:02.030> thousand

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
by one-third so if you take a thousand

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.089 
by one-third so if you take a thousand
milligrams<00:05:02.960> you're<00:05:03.409> only<00:05:03.560> going<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:03.979> be

milligrams you're only going to be
absorbed<00:05:05.770> 333<00:05:07.630> besides<00:05:08.630> that<00:05:08.750> is<00:05:08.990> also<00:05:09.229> I<00:05:09.830> i

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
absorbed 333 besides that is also I i

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.740 
absorbed 333 besides that is also I i
believe<00:05:11.630> is<00:05:11.780> also<00:05:12.289> petroleum<00:05:13.159> base<00:05:13.400> but<00:05:13.849> don't

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
believe is also petroleum base but don't

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.930 
believe is also petroleum base but don't
quote<00:05:14.930> me<00:05:15.199> on<00:05:15.229> that<00:05:15.349> all<00:05:16.099> i<00:05:16.190> know<00:05:16.400> is<00:05:16.550> that<00:05:16.669> is

quote me on that all i know is that is

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.469 
quote me on that all i know is that is
not<00:05:17.150> natural<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:18.020> that<00:05:18.590> it's<00:05:18.800> not<00:05:19.479> really

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
not natural and that it's not really

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.070 
not natural and that it's not really
specific<00:05:21.199> how<00:05:21.349> they<00:05:21.530> come<00:05:21.860> up<00:05:22.070> to<00:05:22.340> it<00:05:22.490> if<00:05:23.419> it's

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
specific how they come up to it if it's

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.580 
specific how they come up to it if it's
a<00:05:24.260> lot<00:05:24.440> cheaper<00:05:24.470> to<00:05:25.070> make<00:05:25.580> but<00:05:26.539> hey<00:05:26.990> you<00:05:27.380> only

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
a lot cheaper to make but hey you only
