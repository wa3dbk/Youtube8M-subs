 just follow us all 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.610
 Ten years ago, I sat myself 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.970
 on these chairs 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.590

 At least I did at the time 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.890
 come extremely west because me 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.480
 I really liked the course selection 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.239

 I really liked that at the time 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.430
 the university has very good connections 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.140
 to the industry and not only at 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.100
 us in the business school but just 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.630
 also in other schools for example 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.540

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.979
 a thing not at the middlesex 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.270
 university is particularly enthusiastic 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.860
 that the money is due to study fees 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.350
 is also taken directly again 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.480
 is invested in the infrastructure 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.450
 For example, the last ten were made 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.660
 years spent 200 million pounds 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.970

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.600
