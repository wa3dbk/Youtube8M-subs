00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
first four petals we're going to make a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.679 
first four petals we're going to make a
cross<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.170> same<00:01:07.470> deal<00:01:07.500> even<00:01:08.280> pressure<00:01:08.729> and

alright now we're going to go ahead and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.800 
alright now we're going to go ahead and
add<00:01:29.660> in<00:01:29.930> some<00:01:30.770> diagonals<00:01:33.970> it's<00:01:34.970> repetitive<00:01:35.300> I

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
add in some diagonals it's repetitive I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.260 
add in some diagonals it's repetitive I
know<00:01:36.050> but<00:01:36.590> at<00:01:37.220> least<00:01:37.340> he'll<00:01:37.550> get<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.730> good<00:01:37.940> form

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
know but at least he'll get a good form

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.630 
know but at least he'll get a good form
and<00:01:38.390> work<00:01:38.690> out<00:01:39.160> just<00:01:40.160> make<00:01:40.280> sure<00:01:40.310> that

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
and work out just make sure that

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.150 
and work out just make sure that
frosting<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:41.210> not<00:01:41.330> too<00:01:41.570> stiff<00:01:41.900> I<00:01:42.230> think<00:01:42.980> mine's

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
frosting is not too stiff I think mine's

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.240 
frosting is not too stiff I think mine's
actually<00:01:43.370> too<00:01:43.700> soft<00:01:43.970> right<00:01:44.210> now<00:01:44.390> I<00:01:45.200> made<00:01:46.010> a<00:01:46.040> few

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
actually too soft right now I made a few

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.040 
actually too soft right now I made a few
months<00:01:46.700> before<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.300> so<00:01:47.570> I'm<00:01:47.630> i<00:01:47.720> think<00:01:47.930> my

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
months before this so I'm i think my

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.190 
months before this so I'm i think my
hand<00:01:48.320> warm<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:49.040> frosting<00:01:49.520> in<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.670> bag<00:01:50.200> bosio

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
hand warm the frosting in the bag bosio

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.800 
hand warm the frosting in the bag bosio
it<00:01:51.320> comes<00:01:51.500> out<00:01:52.120> alright<00:01:53.120> so<00:01:53.390> now<00:01:53.510> we<00:01:53.570> have<00:01:53.750> a

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
it comes out alright so now we have a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.650 
it comes out alright so now we have a
nice<00:01:53.930> star<00:01:54.260> pattern<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.090> we're<00:01:56.090> going<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.300> try

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
nice star pattern and we're going to try

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.860 
nice star pattern and we're going to try
and<00:01:56.690> fit<00:01:57.410> two<00:01:58.310> more<00:01:58.490> petals<00:01:58.880> in<00:01:59.180> between<00:01:59.540> each

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
and fit two more petals in between each

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.410 
and fit two more petals in between each
photo<00:02:00.320> we<00:02:00.470> have<00:02:00.620> right<00:02:00.770> now<00:02:01.030> might<00:02:02.030> be<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.180> tight

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
photo we have right now might be a tight

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.960 
photo we have right now might be a tight
squeeze<00:02:02.470> but<00:02:03.470> do<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:03.979> best<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:04.340> can<00:02:06.970> I'm

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
squeeze but do the best you can I'm

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.060 
squeeze but do the best you can I'm
probably<00:02:08.300> going<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.750> end<00:02:08.810> up<00:02:09.020> speeding<00:02:09.470> this

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
probably going to end up speeding this

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:27.559 
probably going to end up speeding this
part<00:02:10.399> up<00:02:10.580> because<00:02:10.970> it's<00:02:11.150> pretty<00:02:11.480> repetitive

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.149
