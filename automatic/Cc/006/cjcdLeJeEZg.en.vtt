Charles and I wanted to show you what I
consider<00:00:16.840> to<00:00:17.140> be<00:00:17.380> the<00:00:17.650> most<00:00:17.680> important<00:00:18.580> thing

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
consider to be the most important thing

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.370 
consider to be the most important thing
when<00:00:18.880> it<00:00:18.910> comes<00:00:19.000> to<00:00:19.270> making<00:00:19.420> Mead<00:00:19.750> that's

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
when it comes to making Mead that's

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.960 
when it comes to making Mead that's
sanitation<00:00:21.160> mm-hmm<00:00:22.950> when<00:00:23.950> you<00:00:24.070> grew<00:00:24.430> up<00:00:24.490> when

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
sanitation mm-hmm when you grew up when

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.019 
sanitation mm-hmm when you grew up when
you<00:00:25.119> mix<00:00:25.450> up<00:00:25.600> honey<00:00:25.869> in<00:00:26.050> water<00:00:26.610> you're<00:00:27.610> making

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
you mix up honey in water you're making

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.720 
you mix up honey in water you're making
a<00:00:28.830> fantastic<00:00:29.830> environment<00:00:30.070> for<00:00:30.490> yeast

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
a fantastic environment for yeast

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.490 
a fantastic environment for yeast
bacteria<00:00:31.119> are<00:00:31.630> all<00:00:31.750> kinds<00:00:31.990> of<00:00:32.080> things<00:00:32.230> to<00:00:32.380> grow

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
bacteria are all kinds of things to grow

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.200 
bacteria are all kinds of things to grow
in<00:00:32.800> that's<00:00:33.220> the<00:00:33.340> point<00:00:33.520> when<00:00:33.820> you<00:00:33.850> put<00:00:34.090> your

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
in that's the point when you put your

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.880 
in that's the point when you put your
east<00:00:34.450> in<00:00:34.660> there<00:00:34.810> it<00:00:35.200> has<00:00:35.230> a<00:00:35.350> nice<00:00:35.530> environment

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
east in there it has a nice environment

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.330 
east in there it has a nice environment
where<00:00:36.220> it<00:00:36.310> can<00:00:36.340> grow<00:00:36.610> real<00:00:36.790> fast<00:00:37.090> but<00:00:38.340> other

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
where it can grow real fast but other

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.090 
where it can grow real fast but other
yeast<00:00:39.880> other<00:00:40.180> bacteria<00:00:40.810> outside<00:00:41.470> influences

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
yeast other bacteria outside influences

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.680 
yeast other bacteria outside influences
can<00:00:42.280> get<00:00:42.460> in<00:00:42.550> there<00:00:42.700> and<00:00:42.880> grow<00:00:43.030> quick<00:00:43.300> too<00:00:43.540> and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
can get in there and grow quick too and

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.090 
can get in there and grow quick too and
you<00:00:43.780> don't<00:00:43.870> want<00:00:44.110> that<00:00:44.200> to<00:00:44.470> happen<00:00:44.620> you<00:00:44.920> want

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
you don't want that to happen you want

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.740 
you don't want that to happen you want
just<00:00:45.430> your<00:00:45.700> yeast<00:00:46.000> so<00:00:46.329> you<00:00:46.420> can<00:00:46.540> make<00:00:46.660> your

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
just your yeast so you can make your

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.840 
just your yeast so you can make your
honey<00:00:46.930> wine<00:00:47.110> to<00:00:47.290> grow<00:00:47.500> and<00:00:47.770> the<00:00:48.370> way<00:00:48.520> you<00:00:48.580> do

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
honey wine to grow and the way you do

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.430 
honey wine to grow and the way you do
that<00:00:49.030> is<00:00:49.330> to<00:00:49.450> make<00:00:49.480> sure<00:00:49.630> you<00:00:49.900> sanitize

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
that is to make sure you sanitize

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.130 
that is to make sure you sanitize
everything<00:00:50.680> correctly<00:00:51.310> properly<00:00:52.270> so<00:00:52.960> that's

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
everything correctly properly so that's

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.540 
everything correctly properly so that's
the<00:00:53.320> most<00:00:53.590> important<00:00:54.070> thing<00:00:54.100> when<00:00:54.310> it<00:00:54.340> comes

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
the most important thing when it comes

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.490 
the most important thing when it comes
to<00:00:54.670> mead<00:00:54.850> making<00:00:55.030> and<00:00:55.930> if<00:00:56.020> you<00:00:56.110> do<00:00:56.230> it<00:00:57.270> nicely

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
to mead making and if you do it nicely

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.110 
to mead making and if you do it nicely
this<00:00:59.500> so<00:01:00.010> make<00:01:00.310> sure<00:01:00.340> you<00:01:00.700> sanitize

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
this so make sure you sanitize

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.079 
this so make sure you sanitize
everything<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:02.620> well<00:01:02.830> and<00:01:03.040> I<00:01:03.280> got<00:01:03.940> some

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
everything really well and I got some

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.090 
everything really well and I got some
things<00:01:04.269> that<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:04.479> wanted<00:01:04.689> to<00:01:04.750> tell<00:01:04.930> you

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
guidelines for sanitation I use

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.169 
guidelines for sanitation I use
something<00:01:29.229> called<00:01:29.259> easy<00:01:29.679> cleaning<00:01:30.130> made<00:01:31.030> by<00:01:31.149> a

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
something called easy cleaning made by a

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.120 
something called easy cleaning made by a
company<00:01:31.509> called<00:01:31.569> LD<00:01:32.079> Carlson<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.950> works

company called LD Carlson it works
really<00:01:33.310> well<00:01:33.399> it's<00:01:33.789> no<00:01:33.999> rinse<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.659> can<00:01:34.810> just

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
really well it's no rinse you can just

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.469 
really well it's no rinse you can just
clean<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.609> not<00:01:36.789> have<00:01:36.969> to<00:01:37.090> rinse<00:01:37.270> it

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
clean it and not have to rinse it

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.499 
clean it and not have to rinse it
although<00:01:37.689> I<00:01:37.810> always<00:01:38.109> rinse<00:01:38.499> it<00:01:38.679> out<00:01:38.799> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
although I always rinse it out and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.120 
although I always rinse it out and
something<00:01:40.509> like<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.719> easy<00:01:41.049> clean<00:01:41.350> this<00:01:41.829> jug

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
something like that easy clean this jug

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.669 
something like that easy clean this jug
cost<00:01:42.369> me<00:01:42.490> $15<00:01:43.240> but<00:01:43.420> I<00:01:43.450> do<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:43.749> lot<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:44.170> movements

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
cost me $15 but I do a lot of movements

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.319 
cost me $15 but I do a lot of movements
and<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:44.920> I<00:01:44.950> need<00:01:45.219> a<00:01:45.249> big<00:01:45.399> jug<00:01:45.579> like<00:01:45.700> 1

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
and so I need a big jug like 1

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.539 
and so I need a big jug like 1
tablespoon<00:01:46.990> per<00:01:47.259> gallon<00:01:47.319> of<00:01:47.710> water<00:01:47.889> and<00:01:48.159> that

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
tablespoon per gallon of water and that

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.520 
tablespoon per gallon of water and that
will<00:01:48.639> sanitize<00:01:48.880> your<00:01:49.689> equipment<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.170> you<00:01:50.319> put
