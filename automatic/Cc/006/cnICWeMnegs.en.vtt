00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
minus 4x on 0 234 we have f of x equals

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:27.050 
minus 4x on 0 234 we have f of x equals
x<00:00:17.359> cubed<00:00:18.359> minus<00:00:18.420> 4<00:00:20.420> on<00:00:21.529> 0<00:00:24.500> and<00:00:25.699> they<00:00:26.699> wanted<00:00:27.000> to

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
x cubed minus 4 on 0 and they wanted to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.210 
x cubed minus 4 on 0 and they wanted to
find<00:00:27.390> all<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> values<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.289> c<00:00:28.500> guaranteed<00:00:29.070> by

find all the values of c guaranteed by

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.939 
find all the values of c guaranteed by
the<00:00:29.279> mean<00:00:29.609> value<00:00:29.640> theorem<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.260> mean<00:00:31.500> value

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the mean value theorem so the mean value

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:44.139 
the mean value theorem so the mean value
theorem<00:00:34.460> says<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.489> there's<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.480> times<00:00:37.350> P<00:00:42.890> over

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
theorem says that there's a times P over

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.790 
theorem says that there's a times P over
P<00:00:45.350> -<00:00:47.239> so<00:00:48.239> all<00:00:48.420> we're<00:00:48.600> going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.320> plug<00:00:49.620> in

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
P - so all we're going to do is plug in

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.130 
P - so all we're going to do is plug in
the<00:00:49.829> art<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.550> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:50.969> our<00:00:51.090> feet<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
the art this is going to be our feet and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.490 
the art this is going to be our feet and
this<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.250> gonna<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.699> our<00:00:53.850> face<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:55.230> we're<00:00:55.379> going

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
this is gonna be our face so we're going

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.540 
this is gonna be our face so we're going
to<00:00:55.590> plug<00:00:55.770> those<00:00:55.980> eyes<00:00:56.250> into<00:00:56.730> our<00:00:56.879> function<00:00:57.120> and

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
to plug those eyes into our function and

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:33.830 
to plug those eyes into our function and
so<00:01:28.250> 0<00:01:29.250> x<00:01:30.240> 0<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.860> when<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.790> put<00:01:33.060> those<00:01:33.210> values<00:01:33.420> into

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
so 0 x 0 so when I put those values into

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.920 
so 0 x 0 so when I put those values into
my<00:01:34.140> formula<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.220> F<00:01:36.060> prime<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.229> Z<00:01:38.030> equals<00:01:39.030> 15

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
my formula I have F prime of Z equals 15

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.040 
my formula I have F prime of Z equals 15
rather<00:01:40.320> 0<00:01:40.890> over<00:01:41.579> 3<00:01:41.820> times<00:01:42.600> 0

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
rather 0 over 3 times 0

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.340 
rather 0 over 3 times 0
over<00:01:45.470> three<00:01:45.950> which<00:01:46.520> is<00:01:46.790> fun<00:01:48.610> so<00:01:49.610> I<00:01:49.640> now<00:01:50.000> have<00:01:50.350> F

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
over three which is fun so I now have F

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.990 
over three which is fun so I now have F
prime<00:01:51.980> of<00:01:52.280> C<00:01:52.780> equal<00:01:53.780> sign<00:01:54.620> they<00:01:55.550> want<00:01:55.820> us<00:01:55.970> to

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
prime of C equal sign they want us to

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
prime of C equal sign they want us to
find<00:01:56.420> C<00:01:57.050> so<00:01:58.180> we<00:01:59.180> need<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.510> find<00:01:59.660> the<00:01:59.840> derivative

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
find C so we need to find the derivative

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.380 
find C so we need to find the derivative
of<00:02:00.590> this<00:02:00.800> function<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.550> set<00:02:01.850> it<00:02:01.970> equal<00:02:02.120> to

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
of this function and set it equal to

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.320 
of this function and set it equal to
five<00:02:03.260> so<00:02:04.360> f<00:02:05.360> prime<00:02:05.780> of<00:02:05.930> T<00:02:06.850> going<00:02:07.850> from<00:02:07.970> this

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
five so f prime of T going from this

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.710 
five so f prime of T going from this
function<00:02:08.900> just<00:02:09.080> replacing<00:02:09.770> C<00:02:10.400> with<00:02:10.700> X<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.330> mean

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
function just replacing C with X I mean

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.830 
function just replacing C with X I mean
X<00:02:12.140> with<00:02:12.380> C<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:12.830> we<00:02:13.460> have<00:02:14.020> three<00:02:15.020> C<00:02:15.680> square<00:02:16.840> minus

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
X with C so we have three C square minus

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.990 
X with C so we have three C square minus
four<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.720> going<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.050> equal<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:22.000> five

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
four and this is going to equal to five

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.080 
four and this is going to equal to five
so<00:02:24.970> now<00:02:25.970> we<00:02:26.030> just<00:02:26.120> solve<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.710> have<00:02:27.950> three<00:02:28.400> C

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
so now we just solve so I have three C

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.310 
so now we just solve so I have three C
squared<00:02:29.630> equals<00:02:30.230> 9<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.700> divide<00:02:32.690> each<00:02:32.720> side<00:02:32.900> by<00:02:33.140> 3

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
squared equals 9 I divide each side by 3

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.630 
squared equals 9 I divide each side by 3
so<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.340> C<00:02:34.610> squared<00:02:34.910> equals<00:02:35.710> 3<00:02:36.710> and<00:02:37.070> then<00:02:37.610> I

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
so that C squared equals 3 and then I

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.510 
so that C squared equals 3 and then I
house<00:02:37.910> he<00:02:38.240> equals<00:02:38.840> us<00:02:39.620> 1<00:02:40.040> minus<00:02:40.570> 3<00:02:41.860> but<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:43.190> have

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
house he equals us 1 minus 3 but I have

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.600 
house he equals us 1 minus 3 but I have
to<00:02:43.730> look<00:02:43.940> at<00:02:44.150> my<00:02:44.330> interval<00:02:44.960> and<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.590> negative<00:02:46.280> 3

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
to look at my interval and I negative 3

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.229 
to look at my interval and I negative 3
3<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:47.210> not<00:02:47.660> between<00:02:48.350> 0<00:02:48.830> &amp;<00:02:49.070> 3<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.850> I<00:02:49.910> can<00:02:50.120> take

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
3 is not between 0 &amp; 3 so I can take

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.620 
3 is not between 0 &amp; 3 so I can take
only<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.989> positive<00:02:51.230> value<00:02:52.010> soon<00:02:52.640> your<00:02:52.820> CV<00:02:53.239> is

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
going to be the positive root 3 and I

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.390 
going to be the positive root 3 and I

get<00:03:24.950> 5<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.550> then<00:03:26.030> I<00:03:26.150> take<00:03:26.420> this<00:03:26.630> number<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.580> I

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
get 5 and then I take this number and I

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.450 
get 5 and then I take this number and I
find<00:03:28.910> F<00:03:29.180> prime<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.720> C<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.170> I<00:03:30.350> use<00:03:30.620> this<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.160> I

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
find F prime of C so I use this and I

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.200 
find F prime of C so I use this and I
to<00:03:31.550> replace<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.600> X<00:03:33.260> with<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.710> seat<00:03:34.100> so<00:03:34.940> I<00:03:34.970> have

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
to replace the X with a seat so I have

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.050 
to replace the X with a seat so I have
three<00:03:35.570> C<00:03:35.750> squared<00:03:36.170> minus<00:03:36.560> four<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.280> then<00:03:37.970> I

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
three C squared minus four and then I

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.480 
three C squared minus four and then I
set<00:03:38.330> it<00:03:38.450> equal<00:03:38.600> to<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:39.020> value<00:03:39.260> I<00:03:39.440> found<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.400> I

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
set it equal to the value I found and I

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.610 
set it equal to the value I found and I
solve<00:03:40.760> for<00:03:40.850> C<00:03:41.210> and<00:03:41.660> then<00:03:41.960> you<00:03:41.990> need<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.380> check

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
solve for C and then you need to check

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.560 
solve for C and then you need to check
that<00:03:42.680> your<00:03:43.160> answers<00:03:43.610> are<00:03:43.880> in<00:03:44.150> your<00:03:44.390> original

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
that your answers are in your original

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.670 
that your answers are in your original
interval<00:03:45.790> so<00:03:46.790> this<00:03:47.120> is<00:03:47.390> mean<00:03:47.750> value<00:03:48.020> theorem

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
interval so this is mean value theorem

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.850 
interval so this is mean value theorem
and<00:03:49.010> number<00:03:49.520> four
