00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.980
 do now 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.640
 is going to be rolling the tortilla 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.340
 so with the ham we are going to try that 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.170
 let us get out here so that when 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.390

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.850
 the few of the liquid that has the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.750
 ham here I already wrapped it 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.750
 rolled up and I saw 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.520
 and this one 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.160
 now here we are going to leave it 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.240
 let it cool down let's try not to 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.110
 is unfolds here to this we're going 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.110
 to put chicken 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.230
 they are very easy and economical rich 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.810
 prepare in the same way here I put him 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.100
 the chicken 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.620
 and I'm going to roll them up 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.540
 and likewise we will go 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.290
 putting here 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.920
 since it gets cold 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.120
 we are going to place them in what is 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.010
 a cast 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.580
 for this to accommodate them but this is the 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.890
 way the tortilla has to be 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.780
 hot because because if it's cold what 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.849
 what's going to happen is that it's going to 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.030
 split the tortilla and it will not help us 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:27.590
 for nothing then you have to ensure that 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.590
 the tortilla is hot 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.209
 here we see how it is already 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.670
 we are wrapping them I repeat again 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.069
 if you like to put 2 slices of 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.420
 ham 2 slices of ham and nothing else 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.420
 in this case I'm going to put 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.030
 Here we can see how the tacos are already 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.680
 they are cold 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.010
 Now let's put the pan with oil 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.590
 to brown it this flutes or tacos 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.120
 it depends as you know them 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:08.720
 here we are going to brown our 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.599
 tacos or flutes I already put the oil 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.350
 warm up and it's hot and ximo now what 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:18.540
 What I'm going to do is add the flutes 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.950
 the oil is heated now if it 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.950
 let's put to brown 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.580
 we are going to give it very well 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.370
 they will give you one side the new one 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.710
 we'll even turn it around 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.290
 will already be on one side now we are going to 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.680
 turn around so this is fine 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.680
 of the other 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.620
 since they are well browned 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.190
 we take it out in fences too 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.800
 terrible excess fat and we're going 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.129
 to prepare 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.899
 well here and the tacos are already 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:13.409
 Now what we are going to do is to put them 

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:13.409
 cream 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.530
 if we are going to put cream 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.319
 reminding them that they can make them 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:38.009

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:42.979

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:52.830

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.830

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:02.670

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.670

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.780
 in the lettuce we are going to put what is 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.780
