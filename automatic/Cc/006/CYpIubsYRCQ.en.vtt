00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.620
 or not 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.719
 well now here I will show you how to do 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.150
 a backup of drivers 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.519
 our pc if you ask for 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.590
 what does this work for us? 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.779
 that when we want to format 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.790
 our pc either because it has some 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.770
 virus or for some other reason what 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.899
 we will do is make a copy of 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.969
 our driver and save it and then 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:29.309
 can format and install the windows 

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:31.230
 seven on our pc and once installed 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.809
 we can install all the drivers of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.270
 our pc easily these drivers what 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.490
 you save in an usb at the moment you already 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.890
 you finished installing windows 7 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.540
 any version install the drivers 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.180
 which is a priority for our system 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.370
 operative keep in mind that this only 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.950
 it works if you are going to format install the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.720
 same operating system this does not work 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.000
 if you are going to install the drivers of a 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.430
 windows xp in an operating system of 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.800
 windows 7 since the drivers are very 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.780
 different and are not accepted but if 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.730
 you are going to make a copy of the drivers 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.409
 windows 7 and put it in a system 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.540
 operating windows 8 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.819
 if you will accept them since they are compatible 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.110
 for more information read the description 

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:12.270

 preamble let's start with the tutorial 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.290
 to make a backup of 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.360
 our drivers will use the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.460
 program called genius drivers 12 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.740

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.280
 we click on backup 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.940
 and then start to analyze the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.890
 drivers that we have in our pc here 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.890

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.250
 and next and start making the copy 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.110
 security of our driver here just 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.030
 we have to wait for this to end 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.370
 process that will depend on how many 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.410
 drivers have our pc once 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.090
 finished the process the program we 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.910
