running this over return right now is

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.259 
running this over return right now is
because<00:03:54.760> uh<00:03:55.080> dimensional<00:03:56.080> prisons<00:03:57.120> like<00:03:58.120> I

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
because uh dimensional prisons like I

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.060 
because uh dimensional prisons like I
said<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.600> step<00:03:58.780> works<00:03:59.080> out<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.590> graveyard

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
said the step works out of the graveyard

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.190 
said the step works out of the graveyard
and<00:04:00.340> if<00:04:00.880> you<00:04:01.030> use<00:04:01.180> return<00:04:01.570> they<00:04:01.780> go<00:04:01.930> back<00:04:02.170> and

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
and if you use return they go back and

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.560 
and if you use return they go back and
if<00:04:02.590> they<00:04:02.739> have<00:04:02.890> something<00:04:03.820> bottomless

if they have something bottomless

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.069 
if they have something bottomless
torrential<00:04:05.400> basically<00:04:06.400> you<00:04:06.549> wasted<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.120> so<00:04:07.780> I

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
torrential basically you wasted it so I

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.940 
torrential basically you wasted it so I
run<00:04:08.320> this<00:04:08.530> because<00:04:09.100> I<00:04:09.610> can<00:04:10.269> always<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:11.860> know

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
run this because I can always you know

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.000 
run this because I can always you know
blaze<00:04:12.250> main<00:04:12.750> if<00:04:13.750> they<00:04:13.810> end<00:04:14.170> up<00:04:14.320> bottomless

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
blaze main if they end up bottomless

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.219 
blaze main if they end up bottomless
thing<00:04:15.190> like<00:04:15.430> my<00:04:15.640> Giga<00:04:15.880> plant<00:04:16.209> I<00:04:16.540> can<00:04:17.019> activate

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
thing like my Giga plant I can activate

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.180 
thing like my Giga plant I can activate
this<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:18.040> like<00:04:18.940> getting<00:04:19.209> it<00:04:19.419> back<00:04:19.630> so<00:04:20.380> just

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
this and like getting it back so just

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.740 
this and like getting it back so just
works<00:04:21.549> a<00:04:21.729> lot<00:04:21.940> better

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
works a lot better

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.409 
works a lot better
then<00:04:24.750> we<00:04:24.840> have<00:04:24.990> three<00:04:25.440> super<00:04:25.800> vice<00:04:26.419> basically

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
then we have three super vice basically

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.230 
then we have three super vice basically
for<00:04:27.449> blazing<00:04:28.139> or<00:04:28.350> Giga<00:04:28.830> plant<00:04:29.130> which<00:04:29.850> is<00:04:30.030> good

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240
