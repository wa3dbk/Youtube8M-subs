 video review of such a smart bracelet 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.590
 smart watch 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.330
 and 06 with a shop of secret affairs but I would like 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.500
 something for you now 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.820
 say at the end of this video will be very 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.859

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.300
 You will learn what I am smart bracelet with us 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.180
 here comes in so small 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.489
 a box with a description of what it is 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:37.070
 e 06 could sport touch bracelet and years 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.620
 smart but also is of the essence and a smart watch 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.920
 of course shops 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:47.550
 pointed out that this is supposedly a copy of xiaomi mi 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.629
 band 2 but xiaomi just after that 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.079
 how they started selling these watches 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:58.039
 have posted a press release that mi band 2 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.850
 there will be no dial 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:05.250
 no watch and there will be a pulse meter 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.119
 very interesting thing for me so 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.670
 necessarily 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.950
 how will they come out i'll order myself though not 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.970
 i can all wait for mi to come 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.810
 band they come with us here is 3 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.270
 pouch i think he is quite 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.759
 mi band compatible 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.930
 first that is possible both there and there 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.479
 put the inconsistency that both want the same 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.460
 here comes this charge 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.920
 I was very pleased charging 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.229
 literally within half an hour and in 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.439
 There is nothing else in the set except 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.780
 here is such a paper where 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.899
 small description of what and how 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.829
 qr-code on the program for the phone in 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.049
 hours there 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.180
 amoled screen here's a button 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.540
 small its just enough touch 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.730
 and see 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.410
 here is such a watch click again 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.870
 how many steps are displayed 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.410
 click again how many meters are we 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.850
 have passed 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:11.270
 push yet how many calories we burned and 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.000
 in principle, again we hit the clock at 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.510
 long hold this button we 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.380
 get into the menu here with us that is 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:25.120
 display do not display sleep phase dachshund 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:29.120
 control mp3 player control 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.610
 camera search our phone 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.950
 very handy thing if you're in an apartment 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.140
 lost your phone just press 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.700
 On this button, your phone is impregnated and 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.110
 here it is 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.350
 vibro, that is, turn on / off the vibra 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.810
 more and more we have nothing here in the menu 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.350
 get hold or quick tap 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.550
 the smart watch button is very good 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.010
 visible then there is a date and time in principle 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.500
 as the clock is convenient enough 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.489
 you can use without any features 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.310
 pedometers counting calories is just a department 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:11.390
 hands and watch the clock is very convenient to 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.060
 the word with the clock if you use it just 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.980
 how I spent four hours with me 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.250
 half day that is basically 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.810
 convenient enough to charge is not necessary 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.959
 quickly more precisely often and how can hours 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.209
 use as usual clock but 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.030
 if you put the software for 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:36.140
 sync your nipple with your smart 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.989
 bracelet that time active life here 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.930
 there is such a bracelet and such a bracelet 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.690
 shrink to 2 and a half days but what 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.140
 I was pleased that synchronization 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.769
 It does not always go, that is, if you only 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.810
 opened the application then she 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.450
 syncs with your bracelet from 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.790
 until you open it in principle 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.700
 bluetooth will not be used not 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.919
 will eat extra energy in the app 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.490
 we see how much we went through today 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:10.660
 steps how much distance we have gone 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:14.680
 and how many calories we burned that is 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.170
 everything is clear and everything is clear application on 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.910
 English, well, in principle, the game is all 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.090
 in general it is also clear here 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.500
 calendar where we are for yesterday and for some 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.830
 day 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.960
 which we can switch and 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:33.300
 view all statistics on our step 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:37.390
 also by the way here we have displayed 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:41.370
 signal level to ours to ours 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:47.680
 bracelet but now I take away 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:52.770
 from he fell near here rose that is 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.770
 very comfortable also here we have 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.280
 tab records that is here with us 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.430
 all our whole is recorded 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:08.580
 activity for the day all our activity 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:11.200
 at night during sleep so all this 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:16.050
 catalog and you sweat over 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:18.670
 can look for a month for 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.180
 for some reason I have here and recorded in 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:25.120
 I probably walked too little 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.300
 just so there is no more fitch 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.830
 there are no ordinary simple ones 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:38.580
 smart bracelet smart watch to maintain 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.580
 your figure and your look by the way 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.310
 chatted chat bracelets 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:49.510
 synchronized what I went through yet 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:52.360
 extra 13 steps to mess of course 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:55.110
 here the sensor is the easiest not to not 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.840
 such as on the si mi band 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:03.220
 there are errors here 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:05.830
 synchronized what else I ask happens 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.920
 It is what it is not very expensive 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.610
 hours and hours so I was pleased they 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:16.170
 inexpensive they are compact and look at 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:19.750
 hand nice enough and some 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:22.660
 fitness tools still allow 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.400
 use in ordinary life you can 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.460
 calculate how much you burned the Quran 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.000
 calories down the aisle if you 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.010
 eg 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.050
 in the morning you can run 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.720
 how many steps did you run 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.270
 made and how many calories you burned it 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.480
 very convenient of course error but where 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:43.870
 Without error, the cost of such hours is not 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:47.050
 very big I liked them again 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:50.520
 I will say that I did not regret that I bought them 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:53.530
 but if you want to get these 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.620
