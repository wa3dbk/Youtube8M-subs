to me is really really really

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.120 
to me is really really really
inspirational<00:02:11.810> because<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.470> pushes<00:02:12.980> the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
inspirational because it pushes the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.040 
inspirational because it pushes the
level<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.489> skating<00:02:13.730> other<00:02:14.239> than<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.720> let's

go back to 1992 plan B questionable if

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.440

good<00:02:29.900> question<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:32.230> know<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.260> always<00:02:33.620> say

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
good question and I know I always say

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.310 
good question and I know I always say
it's<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.070> good<00:02:34.220> question<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.880> next<00:02:35.390> one<00:02:35.510> is<00:02:35.660> why

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
it's a good question the next one is why

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.509 
it's a good question the next one is why

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
does he always say that's a great

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.750 
does he always say that's a great
question<00:02:37.970> well<00:02:39.010> it's<00:02:40.010> probably<00:02:40.489> not<00:02:40.700> a

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
question well it's probably not a

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.000 
question well it's probably not a
problem<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.450> commitment<00:02:42.050> it's<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.410> probably<00:02:42.890> a

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
problem of commitment it's a probably a

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.420 
problem of commitment it's a probably a
problem<00:02:43.610> of<00:02:44.260> practice<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.590> getting<00:02:46.220> your

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
problem of practice and getting your

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.460 
problem of practice and getting your
feet<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:46.790> do<00:02:46.970> what<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.269> want<00:02:47.540> them<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.780> do<00:02:48.050> if

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
feet to do what you want them to do if

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.440 
feet to do what you want them to do if
you're<00:02:48.920> not<00:02:49.100> committing<00:02:49.550> then<00:02:50.090> you're<00:02:50.300> not

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
you're not committing then you're not

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.210 
you're not committing then you're not
committing<00:02:50.840> if<00:02:50.989> you're<00:02:51.320> not<00:02:51.709> committing<00:02:52.100> it's

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
committing if you're not committing it's

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.890 
committing if you're not committing it's
probably<00:02:52.730> because<00:02:53.060> you're<00:02:53.209> scared<00:02:53.570> so<00:02:53.690> if

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
probably because you're scared so if

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.870 
probably because you're scared so if
you're<00:02:54.019> saying<00:02:54.260> you're<00:02:54.410> not<00:02:54.560> scared<00:02:54.980> then<00:02:55.640> you

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
you're saying you're not scared then you

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.220 
you're saying you're not scared then you
probably<00:02:56.180> just<00:02:56.329> need<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.600> practice<00:02:56.810> the
