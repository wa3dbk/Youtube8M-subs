00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
counterclockwise like that ok now that

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.510 
counterclockwise like that ok now that
the<00:02:00.569> wheel<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.709> line<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.220> wheel<00:02:02.369> is

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the wheel is the line on the wheel is

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.240 
the wheel is the line on the wheel is
horizontal<00:02:03.300> we<00:02:03.989> can<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.380> get<00:02:04.920> underneath

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
horizontal we can just get underneath

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.609 
horizontal we can just get underneath
this<00:02:05.670> lever<00:02:06.270> here<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.690> pull<00:02:07.050> right<00:02:07.259> up<00:02:07.289> on<00:02:07.590> it

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
this lever here and pull right up on it

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.140 
this lever here and pull right up on it
and<00:02:09.140> yeah<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.679> gonna<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:11.940> feel

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
and yeah it's gonna it's going to feel

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.360 
and yeah it's gonna it's going to feel
like<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.510> broke<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.620> might<00:02:13.770> flip<00:02:14.160> out

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
like you broke it and you might flip out

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.610 
like you broke it and you might flip out
a<00:02:14.400> little<00:02:14.610> bit<00:02:14.819> at<00:02:15.060> first<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.480> that's<00:02:16.379> how<00:02:16.560> it

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
a little bit at first but that's how it

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.649 
a little bit at first but that's how it
works<00:02:16.920> right<00:02:17.159> here<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.060> here<00:02:18.239> we<00:02:18.329> go<00:02:18.360> this

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
works right here and so here we go this

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.590 
works right here and so here we go this
is<00:02:18.719> a<00:02:19.110> leave<00:02:19.769> here<00:02:19.950> we're<00:02:20.159> going<00:02:20.250> to

careful we're going to push these rubber
parts<00:02:27.650> out<00:02:27.830> like<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:29.830> here<00:02:30.830> we<00:02:30.860> go<00:02:31.690> comes

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
parts out like that and here we go comes

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.650 
parts out like that and here we go comes
right<00:02:32.810> off<00:02:32.990> like<00:02:33.350> this<00:02:33.580> so<00:02:34.580> now<00:02:35.120> what<00:02:35.360> we<00:02:35.480> can

do is we can go to the other side and do
the<00:02:38.750> exact<00:02:39.230> same<00:02:39.430> take<00:02:40.430> our<00:02:40.670> dime<00:02:41.270> here<00:02:41.720> in

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
the exact same take our dime here in

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.560 
the exact same take our dime here in
here<00:02:43.490> I'll<00:02:43.580> switch<00:02:43.790> hands<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.150> make<00:02:44.270> this<00:02:44.420> a

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
here I'll switch hands to make this a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.410 
here I'll switch hands to make this a
bit<00:02:44.750> easy<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.290> PDC<00:02:45.620> insert<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.790> into<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.060> slot

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
bit easy to PDC insert it into the slot

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.050 
bit easy to PDC insert it into the slot
turn<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.470> counterclockwise<00:02:50.170> like<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:52.030> pull<00:02:53.030> up

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
turn it counterclockwise like so pull up

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.950 
turn it counterclockwise like so pull up
on<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.600> lever<00:02:54.040> like<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:55.480> pull<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.600> clip<00:02:56.810> out

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
on the lever like so pull the clip out

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.410 
on the lever like so pull the clip out
lay<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.650> down<00:02:57.890> on<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.130> bag<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.610> then<00:02:59.120> we<00:02:59.270> can

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
lay it down on the bag and then we can

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.480 
lay it down on the bag and then we can
take<00:02:59.600> off<00:02:59.810> the<00:03:00.170> last<00:03:00.980> part<00:03:01.880> here<00:03:03.340> strap<00:03:04.340> is
