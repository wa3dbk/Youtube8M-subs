this week go around do protein bars in
particular<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.250> detour<00:00:08.670> protein<00:00:08.880> bars<00:00:15.740> the

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
particular the detour protein bars the

particular the detour protein bars the
first<00:00:16.980> thing<00:00:17.130> I'd<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.430> say<00:00:17.520> about

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
first thing I'd like to say about

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.910 
first thing I'd like to say about
protein<00:00:18.420> bars<00:00:18.720> those<00:00:19.109> are<00:00:19.230> actually<00:00:19.529> some<00:00:19.740> bad

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
protein bars those are actually some bad

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.490 
protein bars those are actually some bad
that<00:00:20.130> goes<00:00:20.279> with<00:00:20.550> if<00:00:21.000> you're<00:00:21.510> they<00:00:22.289> are

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
that goes with if you're they are

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.400 
that goes with if you're they are
somewhat<00:00:23.430> high<00:00:23.670> calorie<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:25.019> might<00:00:25.170> want<00:00:25.350> to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
somewhat high calorie you might want to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.660 
somewhat high calorie you might want to
look<00:00:25.500> at<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.710> cholesterol<00:00:26.250> if<00:00:26.310> that's<00:00:26.490> an

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
look at the cholesterol if that's an

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.519 
look at the cholesterol if that's an
issue<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.510> you'd<00:00:27.930> probably<00:00:28.199> want

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
issue with you and you'd probably want

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.710 
issue with you and you'd probably want
to<00:00:28.590> look<00:00:28.740> at<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> saturated<00:00:29.460> fats<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
plus side of a protein bar you do have a

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.700 
plus side of a protein bar you do have a
whey<00:00:32.640> protein<00:00:33.149> base<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.660> them<00:00:33.809> usually<00:00:34.290> around

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
whey protein base to them usually around

30<00:00:35.040> grams<00:00:35.309> detour<00:00:35.730> bars<00:00:35.969> are<00:00:36.149> consistent

thing<00:00:39.600> about<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.110> detour<00:00:40.500> selection<00:00:40.980> is

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
thing about the detour selection is

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.030 
thing about the detour selection is
selection<00:00:41.940> itself<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:43.140> original<00:00:43.530> bar<00:00:43.739> comes

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
selection itself the original bar comes

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.069 
selection itself the original bar comes
in<00:00:44.190> four<00:00:44.399> different<00:00:44.430> flavors<00:00:44.879> they<00:00:45.629> also<00:00:45.809> now

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
in four different flavors they also now

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.740 
in four different flavors they also now
make<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> low<00:00:46.710> sugar<00:00:47.070> item<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.969> two<00:00:48.270> flavors

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
make a low sugar item with two flavors

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.540 
make a low sugar item with two flavors
and<00:00:48.930> they<00:00:49.260> also<00:00:49.379> make<00:00:49.649> them<00:00:49.739> lean<00:00:50.039> muscle

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
and they also make them lean muscle
