go we got into the beginning of a game
on<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.820> strike<00:02:00.360> zone<00:02:00.600> which<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:01.140> could<00:02:01.530> be

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
on a strike zone which I think could be

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.399 
on a strike zone which I think could be
a<00:02:01.710> good<00:02:01.950> map<00:02:02.159> for<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.579> oh<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.840> got<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.290> mute

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
a good map for this oh I got to mute

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.199 
a good map for this oh I got to mute

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
I think the best way to play this since

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.070 
I think the best way to play this since
I<00:02:10.950> do<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.370> reflex<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.599> try<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.870> get<00:02:12.989> up

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.520 
and kind of draw their fire a little bit
and<00:02:15.330> then<00:02:15.420> when<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.570> see<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.840> break<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.290> want<00:02:16.320> to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
and then when I see a break I want to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.810 
and then when I see a break I want to
swap<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.860> my<00:02:16.950> pistols<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.400> kill<00:02:17.550> them<00:02:17.640> really

quick<00:02:18.000> or<00:02:18.480> possibly<00:02:19.050> go<00:02:19.170> for<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.410> quick

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
quick or possibly go for a quick

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.840 
quick or possibly go for a quick
throwing<00:02:19.800> knife<00:02:20.040> or<00:02:20.250> something<00:02:20.460> like<00:02:20.640> that

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
throwing knife or something like that

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.570 
throwing knife or something like that
but<00:02:21.030> I'm<00:02:21.150> actually<00:02:21.510> gonna<00:02:21.720> rush<00:02:21.990> bar<00:02:22.290> side

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
but I'm actually gonna rush bar side

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.710 
but I'm actually gonna rush bar side
because<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.670> want<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.970> basically<00:02:24.180> cut<00:02:24.690> off

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
because I want to basically cut off

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.320 
because I want to basically cut off
flank<00:02:25.500> routes<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.040> when<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.490> go<00:02:26.670> bar<00:02:26.910> like<00:02:27.120> this

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
flank routes and when I go bar like this

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.820 
flank routes and when I go bar like this
there's<00:02:27.630> only<00:02:27.780> one<00:02:28.140> way<00:02:28.320> that<00:02:28.470> they<00:02:28.590> can<00:02:28.710> get

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
there's only one way that they can get

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.830 
there's only one way that they can get
to<00:02:28.890> me<00:02:29.100> unless<00:02:29.310> they<00:02:29.880> somehow<00:02:30.180> rush<00:02:30.510> middle

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
to me unless they somehow rush middle

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.820 
to me unless they somehow rush middle
but<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.020> looks<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.290> have<00:02:31.410> some<00:02:31.440> very

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
but it looks like I have some very

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.160 
but it looks like I have some very
aggressive<00:02:32.100> teammates<00:02:32.670> with<00:02:32.850> me<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.780> this

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
aggressive teammates with me so this

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.450 
aggressive teammates with me so this
might<00:02:34.380> make<00:02:34.530> things<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.890> little<00:02:35.040> bit<00:02:35.220> difficult

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
might make things a little bit difficult

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.230 
might make things a little bit difficult
for<00:02:35.790> me

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
for me

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.910 
for me
oh<00:02:36.410> don't<00:02:37.410> want<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:38.660> no<00:02:39.660> no<00:02:39.960> I<00:02:40.230> don't<00:02:40.830> have

blast<00:02:41.580> shield<00:02:41.850> on<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:44.040> they're<00:02:44.160> probably

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
blast shield on this so they're probably

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.770 
blast shield on this so they're probably
gonna<00:02:44.460> be<00:02:44.580> flanking<00:02:44.970> around<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.330> way<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:47.780> saw

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319 
the pistols out so it's probably a

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.629 
the pistols out so it's probably a
decent<00:05:50.740> plan<00:05:51.520> as<00:05:51.729> long<00:05:51.879> as<00:05:52.000> I<00:05:52.060> get<00:05:52.120> ready

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639

why<00:05:59.740> he<00:05:59.979> had<00:06:00.129> turned<00:06:00.310> around<00:06:00.460> but<00:06:00.969> that's

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
why he had turned around but that's

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:12.020 
why he had turned around but that's
probably<00:06:01.960> the<00:06:02.169> reason

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.270 

okay<00:06:12.810> that's<00:06:13.320> a<00:06:13.410> nice<00:06:13.530> little<00:06:13.770> tactic<00:06:14.130> to<00:06:14.250> use

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280

okay that's a nice little tactic to use
I<00:06:14.550> think<00:06:14.580> that's<00:06:14.880> definitely<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.750> most

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
I think that's definitely the most

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.290 
I think that's definitely the most
effective<00:06:17.220> tactic<00:06:17.640> because<00:06:17.820> these<00:06:17.940> akimbo

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
effective tactic because these akimbo

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.470 
effective tactic because these akimbo
pistols<00:06:18.750> are<00:06:18.840> actually<00:06:19.140> quite<00:06:19.590> good<00:06:20.300> how<00:06:21.300> do<00:06:21.360> I

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
pistols are actually quite good how do I

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.240 
pistols are actually quite good how do I
take<00:06:21.660> explosive<00:06:22.200> damage<00:06:22.350> there<00:06:22.740> I<00:06:22.920> thought<00:06:23.190> I

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
take explosive damage there I thought I

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.860 
take explosive damage there I thought I
had<00:06:23.400> in<00:06:23.490> my<00:06:23.550> rad<00:06:23.760> shield<00:06:24.060> like<00:06:24.270> perfectly<00:06:24.750> in
