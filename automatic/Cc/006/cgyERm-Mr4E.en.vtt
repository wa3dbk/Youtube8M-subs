straightforward process if you've got

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.929 
straightforward process if you've got
standard<00:00:18.840> hardware<00:00:19.470> any<00:00:20.279> consumer<00:00:20.760> hardware

standard hardware any consumer hardware

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.450 
standard hardware any consumer hardware
really<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:22.140> not<00:00:22.380> really<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.369> be

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460

a problem for you

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.870 
a problem for you
so<00:00:25.590> what<00:00:26.039> I'm<00:00:26.130> gonna<00:00:26.250> do<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.519> I'm<00:00:26.609> gonna<00:00:26.699> go

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.400 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go
through<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> installation<00:00:27.779> I'm<00:00:27.990> doing<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.320> in

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
through the installation I'm doing it in

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.919 
through the installation I'm doing it in
VMware<00:00:28.710> because<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:30.119> bringing<00:00:30.840> in

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
VMware because I'm bringing in

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.179 
VMware because I'm bringing in
additional<00:00:31.470> hardware<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.009> actually

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
additional hardware to do this actually

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.500 
additional hardware to do this actually
kind<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.520> difficult<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.030> we're<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.180> gonna<00:00:33.360> do

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
kind of difficult so we're just gonna do

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.360 
kind of difficult so we're just gonna do
this<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.809> virtual<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.800> only<00:00:35.040> difference

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
this in virtual the only difference

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.920 
this in virtual the only difference
between<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.180> what<00:00:36.210> you're<00:00:36.480> gonna<00:00:36.600> do<00:00:36.780> is

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
between this and what you're gonna do is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.500 
between this and what you're gonna do is
there's<00:00:37.110> no<00:00:37.230> CD<00:00:37.590> switching<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.550> I've<00:00:39.210> already

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
there's no CD switching so I've already

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.110 
there's no CD switching so I've already
put<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.079> CD<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.890> drive<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.460> we're<00:00:42.030> gonna

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
put the CD in the drive and we're gonna

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.319 
put the CD in the drive and we're gonna
start<00:00:42.450> up<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> machine<00:00:43.879> now<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.940> first<00:00:45.180> thing

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
start up the machine now the first thing

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.330 
start up the machine now the first thing
you're<00:00:45.480> gonna<00:00:45.629> notice<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.260> besides<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
you're gonna notice is besides the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.750 
you're gonna notice is besides the
machine<00:00:47.610> booting<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:49.250> it's<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
machine booting is that it's going to

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.729 
machine booting is that it's going to
pause<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.050> say<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.440> loading

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.550 
default if you need to partition what
you<00:02:05.369> would<00:02:05.490> do<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.969> would<00:02:06.000> push<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:07.229> you

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
you would do is you would push it you

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.280 
you would do is you would push it you
would<00:02:08.479> push<00:02:09.479> see<00:02:10.129> it's<00:02:11.129> for<00:02:11.910> create<00:02:12.239> partition

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
would push see it's for create partition

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.720 
would push see it's for create partition
and<00:02:13.379> then<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.799> could<00:02:13.920> type<00:02:14.099> in<00:02:14.250> how<00:02:14.430> much<00:02:14.580> you

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
and then you could type in how much you

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.089 
and then you could type in how much you
want<00:02:14.939> you<00:02:15.569> know<00:02:15.659> make<00:02:16.140> multiple<00:02:16.709> partitions

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
want you know make multiple partitions

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.619 
want you know make multiple partitions
and<00:02:17.430> whatnot<00:02:17.760> then<00:02:17.939> select<00:02:18.269> them<00:02:18.390> from<00:02:18.540> the

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
and whatnot then select them from the

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.780 
and whatnot then select them from the
list<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.349> from<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.769> case<00:02:19.980> sure<00:02:20.340> we'll<00:02:20.640> make<00:02:20.730> a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
list so from this case sure we'll make a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.990 
list so from this case sure we'll make a
seven<00:02:21.090> gig<00:02:22.250> partition<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.400> then<00:02:23.760> I'll<00:02:23.879> create

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
seven gig partition and then I'll create

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.670 
seven gig partition and then I'll create
another<00:02:24.150> partition<00:02:24.750> over<00:02:25.079> here<00:02:25.260> just<00:02:25.470> show

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
another partition over here just show

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
another partition over here just show
you<00:02:25.739> in<00:02:26.239> general<00:02:27.829> if<00:02:28.829> really<00:02:29.159> no<00:02:29.280> need<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.489> do

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
you in general if really no need to do

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.729 
you in general if really no need to do
this<00:02:29.879> so<00:02:30.629> we'll<00:02:30.810> create<00:02:30.959> this<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.500> we'll<00:02:31.709> use

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
this so we'll create this and we'll use

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.740 
this so we'll create this and we'll use
the<00:02:32.010> quick<00:02:32.129> format<00:02:32.640> NTFS<00:02:33.450> because

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
the quick format NTFS because

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.890 
the quick format NTFS because
significantly<00:02:34.680> better<00:02:35.269> it's<00:02:36.269> gonna<00:02:36.420> format

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
significantly better it's gonna format

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.470 
significantly better it's gonna format
now<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:38.190> once<00:02:38.459> it's<00:02:38.610> done<00:02:38.670> copying<00:02:39.209> all<00:02:39.329> those

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
now so once it's done copying all those

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.330 
now so once it's done copying all those
files<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:40.109> gonna<00:02:40.290> reboot<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.709> machine<00:02:41.040> into

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340

like<00:03:32.510> not<00:03:33.510> password<00:03:37.069> your<00:03:38.069> next<00:03:38.280> screen<00:03:38.519> just

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
like not password your next screen just

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.610 
like not password your next screen just
wants<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.569> know<00:03:39.629> date<00:03:39.930> time<00:03:40.169> and<00:03:40.470> most

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
wants to know date time and most

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.409 
wants to know date time and most
importantly<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.190> timezone<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.269> don't

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
importantly the timezone you don't

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:43.400 
importantly the timezone you don't
really<00:03:42.510> have<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.780> set<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.049> date<00:03:43.199> and<00:03:43.230> time

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
really have to set the date and time

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.110 
really have to set the date and time
here<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.099> figure<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.489> out<00:03:44.549> once<00:03:44.970> it

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
here and figure that out once it

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.180 
here and figure that out once it
connects<00:03:45.840> up<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.079> internet<00:03:46.470> your<00:03:46.949> time

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
connects up to the internet your time

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.119 
connects up to the internet your time
zone<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.579> important<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:48.810> set<00:03:49.109> that<00:03:49.139> hit<00:03:49.680> next

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
zone is important so set that hit next

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.159 
zone is important so set that hit next
