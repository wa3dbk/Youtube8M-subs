00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
back one of those two that'd be amazing

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.740 
back one of those two that'd be amazing
because<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.190> did<00:03:13.370> enjoy<00:03:13.670> using<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.270> gun<00:03:14.570> it

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
because I did enjoy using that gun it

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.390 
because I did enjoy using that gun it
was<00:03:14.840> really<00:03:15.080> overpowered<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:15.770> of<00:03:16.190> course

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
was really overpowered and of course

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.980 
was really overpowered and of course
that's<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.209> greatest<00:03:17.360> thing<00:03:17.510> but<00:03:17.780> now<00:03:17.870> I'm

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
that's the greatest thing but now I'm

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.660 
that's the greatest thing but now I'm
moving<00:03:18.230> on<00:03:18.320> to<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.530> scorpion<00:03:19.310> which<00:03:19.459> the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
moving on to the scorpion which the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.490 
moving on to the scorpion which the
scorpion<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.180> went<00:03:20.420> from<00:03:20.570> a<00:03:20.690> little<00:03:20.990> side<00:03:21.230> arm

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
scorpion it went from a little side arm

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.030 
scorpion it went from a little side arm
which<00:03:21.770> is<00:03:22.250> still<00:03:22.880> used<00:03:22.940> in<00:03:23.450> nowadays<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:24.860> guess

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
which is still used in nowadays I guess

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.620 
which is still used in nowadays I guess
because<00:03:25.220> in<00:03:25.430> some<00:03:25.730> games<00:03:25.940> they<00:03:26.209> still<00:03:26.480> have

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
because in some games they still have

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.900 
because in some games they still have
that<00:03:26.840> like<00:03:27.050> that<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.470> then<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.489> turned<00:03:28.519> into

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
that like that and then it turned into

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.720 
that like that and then it turned into
an<00:03:29.239> actual<00:03:29.800> SMG<00:03:30.800> by<00:03:30.950> itself<00:03:31.250> instead<00:03:31.519> of<00:03:31.670> a

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
an actual SMG by itself instead of a

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.370 
an actual SMG by itself instead of a
