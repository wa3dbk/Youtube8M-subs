one<00:03:47.450> hundred<00:03:47.750> percent<00:03:47.780> others<00:03:48.290> so<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:48.440> start

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
one hundred percent others so you start

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.990

and you quickly pick up to one hundred

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.170 
and you quickly pick up to one hundred
percent<00:03:51.710> those<00:03:52.400> are<00:03:52.610> things<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:52.880> you<00:03:52.970> go<00:03:53.150> a

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
percent those are things that you go a

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.090 
percent those are things that you go a
little<00:03:53.360> slower<00:03:53.630> first<00:03:54.020> and<00:03:54.440> kind<00:03:54.680> of<00:03:54.709> low<00:03:54.890> that

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
little slower first and kind of low that

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.830 
little slower first and kind of low that
be<00:03:55.250> back<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:55.610> sleep<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:55.850> little<00:03:56.000> bit<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.420> then

be back and sleep a little bit and then

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.890 
be back and sleep a little bit and then
then<00:03:57.260> explode<00:03:57.980> kind<00:03:58.910> of<00:03:58.970> percent<00:03:59.300> within<00:03:59.840> a

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
then explode kind of percent within a

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.660 
then explode kind of percent within a
few<00:04:00.080> within<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.590> step<00:04:00.830> or<00:04:00.950> two<00:04:00.980> so<00:04:01.520> that's

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
few within a step or two so that's

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.130 
few within a step or two so that's
something<00:04:01.880> that<00:04:01.970> different<00:04:02.390> people<00:04:02.420> do
