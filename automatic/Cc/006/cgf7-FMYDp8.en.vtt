00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.760
 hello here I am very happy tutorial I had made a card 6 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.920
 tell me 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.920
 that I cut expro culture to be able to put back my iphone 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:12.139
 so it was this one 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.119
 that enter all the by-products 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.119
 here is the difference already 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.650
 between the two 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.099
 a classic card 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.310
 and a map adapted 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.390
 with the ump of course we can not cover but good for 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.419
 help 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.109
 it can be very convenient 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.850
 enriched did not do much for pottery 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.890
 after we have of course 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.710
 a map 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.720
 a copy of a tiny micro-sim 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.580
 so it's a micro-sim 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.640
 for the format now all sim smart cards 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.190
 the new arrivals at the operator will be micro-sim it will take 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.250
 just re-cut them 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.330
 to be careful when one is always the logo of the operator upside down 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.810
 why go wrong 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.680
 I adapted it I put them higher on a bad because it was for 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.120
 to try 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.780
 so I have a lot for me 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.240
 we're going so that's right 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.240
 manseau 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.440
 thomas 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.440
 so I'm going to activate it because I removed the cellular data 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.070
 we will do cellular data 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.880
 we will give back his say yes 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.880
 we will wait here is network brochure 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.370
 here we go on the network 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.260
 actually oracle that's so I thought he does this does not interest me 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.290
 not 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.710
 otherwise there is another solution is also use this system 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.670
 so of course still writing lighter 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.500
 this is the net 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.440
 then we can turn the panade 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.310
 in wi-fi router for computer 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.760
 otherwise there is another problem some themes 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.960
 mario wii fit mayweather so it's a little bit like we'll use on 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.440
 live iphone 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.229
 to make an intermediary for the one there is the kivu lake and the modem 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.379
 so here we are so it will be a next try with the word so it is necessary for you 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.409
 show that to do this 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.870
 a human model with iphone thanks for seeing
