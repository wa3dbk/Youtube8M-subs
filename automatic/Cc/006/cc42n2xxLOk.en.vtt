oh<00:02:23.000> yes<00:02:49.669> at<00:02:50.669> full<00:02:50.970> speed<00:02:51.389> thanks<00:02:52.109> to<00:02:52.200> the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.839 

machines<00:03:33.859> let's<00:03:34.859> focus<00:03:35.189> on<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.489> parts<00:03:35.790> of

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
machines let's focus on the parts of

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.500 
machines let's focus on the parts of
machine<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.299> do<00:03:36.799> it<00:03:37.799> use<00:03:38.129> is<00:03:38.400> complicated<00:03:39.090> and

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
machine to do it use is complicated and

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.330 
machine to do it use is complicated and
indeed<00:03:39.930> chain<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.470> Pistons<00:03:41.010> which

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
indeed chain of Pistons which

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.460 
indeed chain of Pistons which
continually<00:03:41.939> propel<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:42.599> retract<00:03:42.989> slime

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
continually propel and retract slime

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.589 
continually propel and retract slime
blocks<00:03:43.769> like<00:03:44.009> so<00:03:44.280> now<00:03:44.669> the<00:03:44.729> motion<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.419> these

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
blocks like so now the motion of these

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.479 
blocks like so now the motion of these
slime<00:03:46.019> blocks<00:03:46.319> hugging<00:03:46.769> each<00:03:46.889> other<00:03:47.069> Ford

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
slime blocks hugging each other Ford

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.789 
slime blocks hugging each other Ford
sends<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.329> legs<00:03:48.569> into<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.900> bunny<00:03:49.199> hopping<00:03:49.530> or

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
sends the legs into a bunny hopping or

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.369 
sends the legs into a bunny hopping or
frogs<00:03:50.430> tight<00:03:50.699> state<00:03:51.090> which<00:03:51.569> repels<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.139> hell

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
frogs tight state which repels the hell

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.990 
frogs tight state which repels the hell
device<00:03:52.680> forward<00:03:53.069> under<00:03:53.310> its<00:03:53.430> own<00:03:53.579> power

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
device forward under its own power

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.710 
device forward under its own power
so<00:03:54.689> using<00:03:54.900> slime<00:03:55.319> balls<00:03:56.209> that's<00:03:57.209> right<00:03:57.540> it's

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
so using slime balls that's right it's

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.509 
so using slime balls that's right it's
very<00:03:57.959> clever<00:03:58.169> up<00:03:58.379> some<00:03:58.530> ideas<00:03:58.979> it's<00:03:59.250> quite<00:03:59.489> a

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
very clever up some ideas it's quite a

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.369 
very clever up some ideas it's quite a
feat<00:03:59.849> of<00:03:59.879> engineering<00:04:00.030> miserly<00:04:00.989> with<00:04:01.109> no
