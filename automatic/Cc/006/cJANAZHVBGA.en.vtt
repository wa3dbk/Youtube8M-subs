through<00:00:19.640> the<00:00:20.180> pros<00:00:20.600> and<00:00:20.840> cons<00:00:21.050> of<00:00:21.350> each

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
through the pros and cons of each

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.220 
through the pros and cons of each
feature<00:00:22.460> of<00:00:22.700> this<00:00:22.850> device<00:00:23.300> as<00:00:23.600> you<00:00:23.870> can<00:00:24.020> see

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
feature of this device as you can see

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.950 
feature of this device as you can see
it's<00:00:24.410> very<00:00:24.880> compact<00:00:25.880> it's<00:00:26.240> about<00:00:26.420> the<00:00:26.630> size<00:00:26.780> of

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
it's very compact it's about the size of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.040 
it's very compact it's about the size of
a<00:00:27.050> pen<00:00:27.670> here's<00:00:28.670> a<00:00:28.730> sharpie<00:00:29.360> just<00:00:29.600> to<00:00:29.720> compare

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
a pen here's a sharpie just to compare

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.260 
a pen here's a sharpie just to compare
it<00:00:30.110> to<00:00:30.230> so<00:00:30.410> they're<00:00:30.800> pretty<00:00:31.310> close<00:00:31.760> and<00:00:32.090> size

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
it to so they're pretty close and size

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.779 
it to so they're pretty close and size
there<00:00:32.860> they're<00:00:33.860> really<00:00:34.100> about<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.370> same<00:00:34.399> size

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
there they're really about the same size

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:36.900 
there they're really about the same size
obviously<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.989> only<00:00:36.079> difference<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.500> wait

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
obviously the only difference is wait

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.450 
obviously the only difference is wait
this<00:00:37.910> device<00:00:38.329> here<00:00:38.840> does<00:00:39.260> weigh<00:00:39.680> quite<00:00:40.400> a

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
this device here does weigh quite a

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.280 
this device here does weigh quite a
little<00:00:40.790> bit<00:00:40.940> it's<00:00:41.149> not<00:00:41.300> heavy<00:00:41.690> or<00:00:41.810> anything

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
little bit it's not heavy or anything

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.450 
little bit it's not heavy or anything
but<00:00:42.410> it<00:00:42.530> does<00:00:42.649> have<00:00:42.829> a<00:00:42.860> little<00:00:43.070> bit<00:00:43.250> of<00:00:43.280> weight

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
but it does have a little bit of weight

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.729 
but it does have a little bit of weight
to<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:43.910> which<00:00:44.600> I'll<00:00:44.750> talk<00:00:44.930> about<00:00:44.989> in<00:00:45.200> a<00:00:45.380> second

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
to it which I'll talk about in a second

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:46.870 
to it which I'll talk about in a second
the<00:00:45.920> first<00:00:46.130> feature<00:00:46.430> i<00:00:46.550> want<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:46.760> talk<00:00:46.850> about

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
the first feature i want to talk about

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.690 
the first feature i want to talk about
though<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.540> laser<00:00:47.809> pointer<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:49.340> here<00:00:49.610> is

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
though is the laser pointer so here is

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.299 
though is the laser pointer so here is
the<00:00:49.850> laser<00:00:50.059> as<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:50.480> can<00:00:50.630> see<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.110> this<00:00:51.920> is<00:00:52.130> by

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
the laser as you can see and this is by

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.280 
the laser as you can see and this is by
far<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:52.610> best<00:00:53.090> laser<00:00:53.480> pointer<00:00:53.960> I've<00:00:54.079> ever

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
far the best laser pointer I've ever

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.549 
far the best laser pointer I've ever
used<00:00:54.710> I<00:00:55.989> generally<00:00:56.989> don't<00:00:57.079> use<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.350> lot<00:00:57.530> of

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
used I generally don't use a lot of

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.470 
used I generally don't use a lot of
laser<00:00:57.800> pointers<00:00:58.219> but<00:00:58.370> when<00:00:58.520> I<00:00:58.550> do<00:00:58.700> I've

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
laser pointers but when I do I've

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.720 
laser pointers but when I do I've
noticed<00:00:59.960> this<00:01:00.140> one<00:01:00.380> is<00:01:00.590> great<00:01:00.860> it'll<00:01:01.340> shoot

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
noticed this one is great it'll shoot

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.780 
noticed this one is great it'll shoot
all<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.120> way<00:01:02.239> across<00:01:02.360> my<00:01:02.780> house<00:01:03.339> with<00:01:04.339> ease

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
all the way across my house with ease

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.539 
all the way across my house with ease
and<00:01:05.320> it<00:01:06.320> would<00:01:06.500> probably<00:01:06.740> shoot<00:01:07.130> across<00:01:07.340> an

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
and it would probably shoot across an

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.239 
and it would probably shoot across an
arena<00:01:07.850> I<00:01:08.569> have<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.229> lot<00:01:09.439> of<00:01:09.469> confidence<00:01:09.889> in<00:01:10.130> this

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.249 
arena I have a lot of confidence in this

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:12.849 
arena I have a lot of confidence in this
laser<00:01:10.520> pointer<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:11.899> hope<00:01:12.380> that<00:01:12.409> it<00:01:12.709> works

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 
laser pointer and I hope that it works

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:16.389 
laser pointer and I hope that it works
that<00:01:13.189> well<00:01:13.399> for<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:14.060> long<00:01:14.569> time<00:01:14.929> to<00:01:15.170> come<00:01:15.399> the

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
that well for a long time to come the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:17.949 
that well for a long time to come the
next<00:01:16.639> feature<00:01:16.789> I<00:01:16.969> want<00:01:16.999> to<00:01:17.149> talk<00:01:17.240> about<00:01:17.270> is<00:01:17.689> the

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:17.959 
next feature I want to talk about is the

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:21.309 
next feature I want to talk about is the
pen<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:19.670> access<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.240> pen<00:01:20.420> on<00:01:20.539> this<00:01:20.689> device<00:01:20.990> you

00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:21.319 
pen to access the pen on this device you

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:23.830 
pen to access the pen on this device you
basically<00:01:21.649> just<00:01:21.740> pull<00:01:22.249> it<00:01:22.369> apart<00:01:22.459> and<00:01:22.909> it<00:01:23.719> will

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
basically just pull it apart and it will

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.019 
basically just pull it apart and it will
pop<00:01:24.079> out<00:01:24.289> there<00:01:24.679> and<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:25.249> can<00:01:25.369> just<00:01:25.520> flip<00:01:25.939> it

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:26.029 
pop out there and you can just flip it

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:29.379 
pop out there and you can just flip it
over<00:01:26.149> and<00:01:26.409> snap<00:01:27.409> that<00:01:27.679> in<00:01:27.889> now<00:01:28.130> my<00:01:28.999> thing<00:01:29.240> with

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:29.389 
over and snap that in now my thing with

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:32.440 
over and snap that in now my thing with
the<00:01:29.509> pen<00:01:29.749> is<00:01:30.139> it<00:01:30.829> works<00:01:31.130> fine<00:01:31.490> for<00:01:31.549> writing<00:01:32.149> but

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
the pen is it works fine for writing but

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.359 
the pen is it works fine for writing but
I<00:01:32.719> would<00:01:33.200> really<00:01:33.409> only<00:01:33.619> use<00:01:33.889> it<00:01:34.039> if<00:01:34.130> I<00:01:34.219> was

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
I would really only use it if I was

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.339 
I would really only use it if I was
jotting<00:01:34.670> down<00:01:34.849> a<00:01:35.060> quick<00:01:35.479> note<00:01:35.749> or<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.079> phone

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:36.349 
jotting down a quick note or a phone

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:38.109 
jotting down a quick note or a phone
number<00:01:36.770> or<00:01:36.799> an<00:01:37.159> email<00:01:37.279> or<00:01:37.670> something<00:01:37.819> like

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
number or an email or something like

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.719 
number or an email or something like
that<00:01:38.179> to<00:01:39.079> me<00:01:39.289> this<00:01:39.560> device<00:01:40.009> is<00:01:40.249> a<00:01:40.279> little<00:01:40.579> too

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
that to me this device is a little too

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.089 
that to me this device is a little too
heavy<00:01:40.969> to<00:01:41.179> write<00:01:41.359> with<00:01:41.659> I<00:01:42.020> like<00:01:42.469> my<00:01:42.590> pens<00:01:42.859> to<00:01:43.009> be

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099 
heavy to write with I like my pens to be

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.550 
heavy to write with I like my pens to be
light<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:43.549> i<00:01:43.579> can<00:01:43.729> write<00:01:43.880> really<00:01:44.179> quickly<00:01:44.719> if

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
light so i can write really quickly if

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.349 
light so i can write really quickly if
you<00:01:45.979> like<00:01:46.189> a<00:01:46.219> pen<00:01:46.490> that<00:01:46.520> has<00:01:46.819> more<00:01:47.090> weight<00:01:47.299> to

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
you like a pen that has more weight to

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.419 
you like a pen that has more weight to
it<00:01:47.659> then<00:01:47.840> this<00:01:47.990> is<00:01:48.439> probably<00:01:48.770> great<00:01:49.249> you

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
on this is it there's no instructions

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.699 
on this is it there's no instructions
the<00:03:17.239> backs<00:03:17.420> got<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.750> little<00:03:17.959> bit<00:03:18.200> of<00:03:18.290> fine<00:03:18.500> print

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
the backs got a little bit of fine print

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.020 
the backs got a little bit of fine print
writing<00:03:19.220> but<00:03:19.370> there's<00:03:19.580> really<00:03:19.790> no

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
writing but there's really no

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.599 
writing but there's really no
instructions<00:03:20.690> on<00:03:20.930> here<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:21.920> found<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.370> to

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
instructions on here and I found that to

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.289 
instructions on here and I found that to
be<00:03:22.640> very<00:03:23.859> hard<00:03:24.859> to<00:03:24.950> deal<00:03:25.310> with<00:03:25.579> when<00:03:25.910> I<00:03:25.970> first

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
be very hard to deal with when I first

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.479 
be very hard to deal with when I first
got<00:03:26.570> this<00:03:26.780> device<00:03:27.140> I<00:03:27.440> had<00:03:27.980> no<00:03:28.160> clue<00:03:28.310> how<00:03:28.459> to

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
got this device I had no clue how to

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.640 
got this device I had no clue how to
open<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:28.940> pen<00:03:29.150> i<00:03:29.329> SAT<00:03:29.630> here<00:03:29.840> screwing<00:03:30.200> it<00:03:30.470> and

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
open the pen i SAT here screwing it and

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.560 
open the pen i SAT here screwing it and
then<00:03:30.829> all<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.250> batteries<00:03:31.640> fell<00:03:32.090> out<00:03:32.150> on<00:03:32.450> the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
then all the batteries fell out on the

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.380 
then all the batteries fell out on the
floor<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:34.340> have<00:03:34.519> to<00:03:34.670> really<00:03:34.700> know<00:03:35.150> that

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
floor so you have to really know that

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.180 
floor so you have to really know that
when<00:03:35.780> you're<00:03:35.930> screwing<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.590> you're<00:03:36.739> accessing

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
when you're screwing it you're accessing

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.580 
when you're screwing it you're accessing
the<00:03:37.519> batteries<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.269> this<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.200> just<00:03:39.320> have<00:03:39.470> to

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
the batteries and this you just have to

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.370 
the batteries and this you just have to
pop<00:03:39.890> apart<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.690> without<00:03:41.690> instructions

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
pop apart and without instructions

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.870 
pop apart and without instructions
there's<00:03:42.620> no<00:03:42.799> real<00:03:43.010> way<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.160> know<00:03:43.310> that<00:03:43.670> besides

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
there's no real way to know that besides

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.030 
there's no real way to know that besides
trial<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:44.630> error<00:03:44.780> or<00:03:45.019> watching<00:03:45.709> a<00:03:45.799> YouTube

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
trial and error or watching a YouTube

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.280 
trial and error or watching a YouTube
video<00:03:46.190> like<00:03:46.579> this<00:03:46.820> but<00:03:47.600> all<00:03:47.750> in<00:03:47.900> all<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.260> feel

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
video like this but all in all I feel
