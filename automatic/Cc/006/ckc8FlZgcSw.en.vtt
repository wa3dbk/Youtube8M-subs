00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:06.490
 as always and more than ever the mitsubishi montero is the choice of 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.609
 who are waiting for a car 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:11.779
 the highest degree of the cic towards if and ability 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.669
 in all conditions 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.669
 in all the grounds 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:20.130
 the qualities of the montero 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.590
 are now enhanced by a new diesel engine that has 200 horsepower 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.039
 maximum power and more strength in any regime 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.489
 the driver now has at his disposal this force for example 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.670
 to overtake with safety 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.600
 to tow a trailer 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.600
 or to face the strongest slopes 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.280
 in cities or on the road 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.860
 at cruising speed 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.860
 the qualities of the engine are also patent 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.290
 the new montero 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.140
 has a drastically lower consumption 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.200
 as are their noise level 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.200
 vibrations and roughness 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.289
 a monocoque structure 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:07.979
 ensures the highest degree of passive and active safety 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.090
 this structure towards almonte the least sensitive to rolling 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.790
 the frame supports independent suspensions on the two axles 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.040
 able to ensure the best contact whatever the soil 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.189
 the super select all-wheel drive system 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.440
 s that 4 2 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.630
 remains the reference among vehicles in this category 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.990
 for everyday use is the 2 h rear-wheel drive mode 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.340
 on slippery asphalt 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.380
 or to drive on roads as indicated is the 4-hour all-wheel drive mode 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.860
 that adapts the traction of each axis 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.360
 according to your adhesion 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.370
 If the terrain is irregular or very soft 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.490
 the maximum traction capacity is achieved with 4 h lc mode 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.069
 that locks the central differential 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.749
 It is also possible to lock the rear differential with a button 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.249
 to travel through tri-zone zones 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:22.449
 or face large differences in the 4 l lc mode 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.009
 that gear a reducer 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:31.069
 internally the huntsman is also an all-rounder 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:36.569
 its configuration possibilities allow it to adapt to very needs 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.539
 different 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.959
 through the system jahed ansip 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.060
 you can have two additional seats hidden under the floor of the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.039
 trunk 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:51.679
 in the mitsubishi motion version adds style elements such as upholstery 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:53.829
 leather and suede 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.099
 sports pedals 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.899
 ollanta is 18 inches 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:02.099
 next to devices such as xenon headlights 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.099
 or different automations 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.679
 your ability to travel on any terrain 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:12.509
 its resistance and its reliability 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:15.719
 they are derived from the competition 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:20.739
 The montero is the only SUV that has in his palmarÃ©s twelve victories in 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.349
 the rali dakar 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.379
 efficiency and solidity 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.450
 dressed in a warm finish and refined equipment 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.449
 iron fist 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:33.669
 with a silk glove
