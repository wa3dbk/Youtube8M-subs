hey<00:00:00.780> guys<00:00:00.960> what's<00:00:01.230> up<00:00:01.560> so<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:02.340> go<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.120> Turing

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hey guys what's up so I go to Turing

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.730 
hey guys what's up so I go to Turing
machine

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
machine

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.150 
machine
a<00:00:05.779> majority<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.810> you<00:00:06.990> probably<00:00:07.410> have<00:00:07.589> no<00:00:07.859> idea

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
a majority of you probably have no idea

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.690 
a majority of you probably have no idea
what<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:08.370> is

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
what that is

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.250 
what that is
so<00:00:08.910> I'll<00:00:09.120> start<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.510> up<00:00:09.599> so<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:09.990> can<00:00:10.200> just

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
so I'll start it up so you can just

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.740 
so I'll start it up so you can just
watch<00:00:10.500> while<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.769> talk<00:00:11.179> this<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> simple

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
watch while I talk this is a simple

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.950 
watch while I talk this is a simple
little<00:00:12.870> program<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.440> wrote<00:00:13.740> for<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.900> it<00:00:15.900> just

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
little program I wrote for it it just

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.960 
little program I wrote for it it just
kind<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.320> sends<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:17.070> wolf<00:00:17.279> back<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.730> forth

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
kind of sends the wolf back and forth

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.679 
kind of sends the wolf back and forth
and<00:00:18.570> there's<00:00:18.779> something<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.109> watch<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.619> a

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
and there's something to watch but a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.029 
and there's something to watch but a
turing<00:00:21.689> machines<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:22.109> kind<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.380> I'll<00:00:22.859> try<00:00:22.980> to

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
turing machines are kind of I'll try to

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.650 
turing machines are kind of I'll try to
give<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> quick<00:00:23.460> overview<00:00:23.580> they're<00:00:24.449> kind<00:00:24.600> of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
give a quick overview they're kind of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.679 
give a quick overview they're kind of
like<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.109> predecessors<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.689> modern-day

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
like the predecessors to a modern-day

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.910 
like the predecessors to a modern-day
computing<00:00:28.760> and<00:00:30.080> well<00:00:31.080> anyways<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.560> watched

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
computing and well anyways I watched

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.049 
computing and well anyways I watched
computer<00:00:32.309> file<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.640> that's<00:00:32.759> where<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.910> get

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
computer file and that's where I get

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.310 
computer file and that's where I get
some<00:00:33.180> ideas<00:00:33.540> they<00:00:33.809> were<00:00:33.870> talking<00:00:34.170> about

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
some ideas they were talking about

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.690 
some ideas they were talking about
Turing<00:00:34.590> machines<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.280> figure<00:00:35.579> is

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
Turing machines and I figure is

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.729 
Turing machines and I figure is
something<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.059> could<00:00:36.210> make<00:00:36.360> in-game<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.989> did

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
something I could make in-game and I did

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.069 
something I could make in-game and I did
so<00:00:38.219> here<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.750> works<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.050> you

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
so here it is so way it works is you

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.889 
so here it is so way it works is you
can't<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.620> kind<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.460> like<00:00:41.579> an<00:00:41.700> indexer<00:00:42.300> it's

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
can't have kind of like an indexer it's

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.840 
can't have kind of like an indexer it's
technical<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:43.890> called<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> head<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.760> it

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
technical it's called the head and it

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.819 
technical it's called the head and it
just<00:00:45.000> kind<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.180> paces<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.780> down<00:00:45.930> what's

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
just kind of paces up and down what's

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.740 
just kind of paces up and down what's
called<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.100> tape<00:00:47.340> which<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.360> string<00:00:48.600> of

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
called a tape which is just a string of

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.080 
called a tape which is just a string of
ones<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.140> zeros<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.920> off<00:00:50.090> anyone

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
ones and zeros on and off anyone

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.729 
ones and zeros on and off anyone
familiar<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.539> memory<00:00:51.930> should<00:00:52.050> kind<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
familiar with memory should kind of

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.750 
familiar with memory should kind of
understand<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:55.640> basically<00:00:56.640> what

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
understand that and basically what

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.279 
understand that and basically what
happens<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.510> kind<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.809> moves<00:00:57.989> through

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
happens is it kind of moves through

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.650 
happens is it kind of moves through
different<00:00:58.590> states<00:00:58.920> here<00:00:59.340> each<00:01:00.059> state<00:01:00.480> is

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
different states here each state is

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.729 
different states here each state is
represented<00:01:00.870> by<00:01:01.440> oh<00:01:03.080> don't<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> wolf's<00:01:04.500> like

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
represented by oh don't the wolf's like

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.100 
represented by oh don't the wolf's like
sit<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:05.700> when<00:01:05.909> they<00:01:06.060> shake<00:01:06.299> off<00:01:06.510> or<00:01:06.750> something

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
sit up when they shake off or something

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.800 
sit up when they shake off or something
from<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> rain<00:01:08.570> no<00:01:09.570> no<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:09.990> should<00:01:10.049> be<00:01:10.170> fine

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
from the rain no no it should be fine

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.600 
from the rain no no it should be fine
but<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.890> Wolf's<00:01:14.130> kind<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.460> keeps

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
but it it this Wolf's kind of keeps

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.460 
but it it this Wolf's kind of keeps
track<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.880> what's<00:01:15.180> stated<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.960> if<00:01:16.229> I

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
track of what's stated in and if I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.780 
track of what's stated in and if I
destroy<00:01:16.920> these<00:01:17.040> blocks<00:01:17.280> here<00:01:17.430> you'll<00:01:17.610> see

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
destroy these blocks here you'll see

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.609 
destroy these blocks here you'll see
it's<00:01:17.909> kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.689> summoning<00:01:18.990> writs<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.470> blocks

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
it's kind of summoning writs and blocks

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.710 
it's kind of summoning writs and blocks
for<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> second<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.250> kind<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.520> execute<00:01:21.420> these

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
for a second to kind of execute these

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.570 
for a second to kind of execute these
command<00:01:22.049> blocks<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.560> each<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.159> these<00:01:23.220> command

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
command blocks and each of these command

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.390 
command blocks and each of these command
blocks<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> set<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.270> instructions<00:01:25.400> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
blocks is a set of instructions the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.219 
blocks is a set of instructions the
instructions<00:01:26.700> are<00:01:27.000> pretty<00:01:27.180> basic<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.900> kind<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
instructions are pretty basic it kind of

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.560 
instructions are pretty basic it kind of
is<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.920> there's<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.549> zero<00:01:29.909> which<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.329> white

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
is like if there's a zero which is white

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.749 
is like if there's a zero which is white
so<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:31.200> there's<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.619> white<00:01:31.920> block<00:01:32.280> under<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
so if there's a white block under the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.580 
so if there's a white block under the
wolf<00:01:33.680> either<00:01:35.119> switch<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.299> keep<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> white

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
wolf either switch it keep it as a white

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.920 
wolf either switch it keep it as a white
block<00:01:37.860> or<00:01:38.700> turn<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> into<00:01:39.540> coal<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:42.420> second

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
block or turn it into coal the second

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.840 
block or turn it into coal the second
instruction<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.500> either<00:01:43.799> move<00:01:44.159> right<00:01:44.430> or<00:01:44.460> left

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
instruction is either move right or left

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.310 
instruction is either move right or left
and<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.210> third<00:01:45.390> instruction<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.049> which

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and the third instruction is just which

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.960 
and the third instruction is just which
one<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.590> these<00:01:46.799> states<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.310> move<00:01:47.430> into<00:01:47.610> next

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
one of these states to move into next

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.999 
one of these states to move into next
and<00:01:48.390> there<00:01:49.170> are<00:01:49.229> proofs<00:01:49.409> out<00:01:49.619> there<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.920> you

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and there are proofs out there that you

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.550 
and there are proofs out there that you
can<00:01:50.159> actually<00:01:50.640> compute<00:01:51.509> anything<00:01:52.140> with<00:01:52.290> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
can actually compute anything with a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.929 
can actually compute anything with a
Turing<00:01:52.829> machine<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.549> could<00:01:53.759> with<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
Turing machine that you could with a

Turing machine that you could with a
normal<00:01:54.270> computer<00:01:54.799> obviously<00:01:55.799> they've<00:01:56.700> you

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
normal computer obviously they've you

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.749 
normal computer obviously they've you
would<00:01:57.210> need<00:01:57.360> thousands<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.170> these<00:01:58.979> states<00:01:59.399> for

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
would need thousands of these states for

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.580 
would need thousands of these states for
most<00:02:00.180> common<00:02:00.450> applications<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.469> is

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
most common applications but this is

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.950 
most common applications but this is
just<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.799> simple<00:02:02.009> one<00:02:02.240> let<00:02:03.240> me<00:02:03.270> stop<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.869> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
just a simple one let me stop it a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.740 
just a simple one let me stop it a

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
if it will reset here I have a what do I

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.220 
if it will reset here I have a what do I
have<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.360> start<00:02:08.869> pause<00:02:09.110> step<00:02:09.590> reset<00:02:11.230> I'll

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
have a start pause step reset I'll

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.840 
have a start pause step reset I'll
switch<00:02:12.530> programs<00:02:12.950> cuz<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.310> have<00:02:13.490> just<00:02:13.700> so

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
switch programs cuz I have just so

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.880 
switch programs cuz I have just so
little<00:02:13.970> storage<00:02:14.390> here<00:02:14.630> programs<00:02:15.320> on<00:02:15.530> memory

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890

little storage here programs on memory
to<00:02:16.040> machine<00:02:17.170> I'll<00:02:18.170> just<00:02:18.320> quickly<00:02:18.500> go<00:02:18.650> for<00:02:18.980> what

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
to machine I'll just quickly go for what

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.070 
to machine I'll just quickly go for what
the<00:02:19.190> computer<00:02:19.580> file<00:02:19.760> video<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.120> saw<00:02:20.420> was<00:02:20.600> okay

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
the computer file video I saw was okay

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.350 
the computer file video I saw was okay
this<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.350> string<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.650> me<00:02:25.120> are<00:02:26.120> there<00:02:26.270> gonna

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
this is string to me are there gonna

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.750 
this is string to me are there gonna
shake<00:02:26.600> off<00:02:30.040> okay<00:02:31.040> good<00:02:31.220> they<00:02:31.310> stayed<00:02:31.520> sitting

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
shake off okay good they stayed sitting

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.130 
shake off okay good they stayed sitting
but<00:02:32.950> busy<00:02:33.950> beaver<00:02:34.660> someone<00:02:35.660> kind<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.930> asked

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
but busy beaver someone kind of asked

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.900 
but busy beaver someone kind of asked
the<00:02:36.230> question<00:02:36.620> okay<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.130> we<00:02:37.370> can<00:02:37.520> move<00:02:37.670> these

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
the question okay so we can move these

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.490 
the question okay so we can move these
things<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.390> right<00:02:38.480> into<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.750> left<00:02:38.840> oh<00:02:39.200> by

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
things to the right into the left oh by

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.800 
things to the right into the left oh by
the<00:02:39.530> way<00:02:39.650> um<00:02:39.970> so<00:02:40.970> these<00:02:41.450> Indonesia<00:02:43.810> sometimes

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
the way um so these Indonesia sometimes

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.960 
the way um so these Indonesia sometimes
they<00:02:44.930> can<00:02:45.080> tell<00:02:45.320> it<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:45.950> move<00:02:46.220> into<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.580> state

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
they can tell it to move into a state

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.690 
they can tell it to move into a state
zero<00:02:47.780> or<00:02:48.080> halt<00:02:48.470> which<00:02:48.860> basically<00:02:49.280> just<00:02:49.400> means

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
zero or halt which basically just means

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.190 
zero or halt which basically just means
okay<00:02:50.000> you've<00:02:50.180> done<00:02:50.450> what<00:02:50.630> you're<00:02:50.720> supposed<00:02:51.080> to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
okay you've done what you're supposed to

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.620 
okay you've done what you're supposed to
do<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:51.620> can<00:02:51.800> stop<00:02:52.040> computing<00:02:52.670> so<00:02:53.390> someone

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
do you can stop computing so someone

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.020 
do you can stop computing so someone
asked<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.870> question<00:02:53.900> how<00:02:54.530> many<00:02:54.590> black<00:02:55.459> how

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
asked the question how many black how

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.670 
asked the question how many black how
many<00:02:56.240> coal<00:02:56.420> blocks<00:02:56.630> or<00:02:56.780> how<00:02:56.870> many<00:02:57.020> ones<00:02:57.290> can<00:02:57.560> we

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
many coal blocks or how many ones can we

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.290 
many coal blocks or how many ones can we
have<00:02:57.830> this<00:02:57.980> thing<00:02:58.160> right<00:02:58.400> before<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.000> stops

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
have this thing right before it stops

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.449 
have this thing right before it stops
moving<00:02:59.540> so<00:03:00.440> how<00:03:00.590> many<00:03:00.650> can<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:00.980> do<00:03:01.220> if<00:03:01.340> you

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
moving so how many can you do if you

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.940 
moving so how many can you do if you
have<00:03:01.580> four<00:03:01.850> states<00:03:02.180> how<00:03:02.480> many<00:03:02.680> ones<00:03:03.680> can<00:03:03.920> you

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
have four states how many ones can you

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.890 
have four states how many ones can you
write<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.190> few<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.550> five<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.510> that's<00:03:05.600> what<00:03:05.810> the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
write a few of five and that's what the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.390 
write a few of five and that's what the
busy<00:03:06.140> beaver<00:03:06.440> program<00:03:06.800> is<00:03:06.920> called<00:03:07.100> so<00:03:07.250> this<00:03:07.340> is

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
busy beaver program is called so this is

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.949 
busy beaver program is called so this is
a<00:03:07.520> busy<00:03:07.850> beaver<00:03:08.000> her<00:03:08.300> if<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.600> have<00:03:08.690> four

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
a busy beaver her if you have four

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.770 
a busy beaver her if you have four
states<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:10.190> can<00:03:10.340> write<00:03:10.550> thirteen<00:03:11.420> one<00:03:11.570> so

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
states and it can write thirteen one so

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.100 
states and it can write thirteen one so
that's<00:03:11.930> what's<00:03:12.140> executing<00:03:12.950> right<00:03:12.980> now

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
that's what's executing right now

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.910 
that's what's executing right now
hopefully<00:03:15.110> you<00:03:15.290> guys<00:03:15.470> should<00:03:15.620> kind<00:03:15.769> of<00:03:15.830> get

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
hopefully you guys should kind of get

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.150 
hopefully you guys should kind of get
the<00:03:16.010> idea<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.370> how<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.519> use<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:17.950> more<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:19.010> the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
the idea of how to use this more of the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.370 
the idea of how to use this more of the
pun<00:03:19.400> is<00:03:19.700> using<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:20.570> thing<00:03:20.780> rather<00:03:20.989> than<00:03:21.230> just

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
pun is using this thing rather than just

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.290 
pun is using this thing rather than just
watching<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.830> so<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.040> encourage<00:03:22.940> you<00:03:23.150> guys<00:03:23.239> to

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
download this and mess around with it

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.660 
download this and mess around with it
but<00:03:29.570> let<00:03:30.170> me<00:03:30.260> quick<00:03:30.530> over<00:03:30.890> how<00:03:31.070> to<00:03:31.130> set<00:03:31.400> this<00:03:31.489> up

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
but let me quick over how to set this up

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.420 
but let me quick over how to set this up
if<00:03:31.820> you<00:03:31.850> want<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.120> write<00:03:32.269> your<00:03:32.390> own<00:03:32.450> program<00:03:33.430> so

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
if you want to write your own program so

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.880 
if you want to write your own program so
it<00:03:34.549> always<00:03:34.700> starts<00:03:35.150> in<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:36.350> first<00:03:36.620> state

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
it always starts in the first state

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.190 
it always starts in the first state
that's<00:03:37.640> just<00:03:37.850> state<00:03:38.120> one<00:03:38.330> right<00:03:38.780> here<00:03:39.019> and

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
that's just state one right here and

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.949 
that's just state one right here and
then<00:03:39.890> white<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.340> black<00:03:40.750> basically<00:03:41.750> means

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
then white and black basically means

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.160 
then white and black basically means
block<00:03:42.470> is<00:03:42.650> what<00:03:42.830> it<00:03:42.920> does<00:03:43.130> if<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:43.730> is<00:03:44.600> on<00:03:44.810> top<00:03:45.019> of

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
block is what it does if it is on top of

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.410 
block is what it does if it is on top of
a<00:03:45.260> black<00:03:45.590> block<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.220> white<00:03:46.549> is<00:03:46.970> what<00:03:47.209> it<00:03:47.299> does

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
a black block and white is what it does

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.360 
a black block and white is what it does
this<00:03:47.540> is<00:03:47.780> if<00:03:48.200> it's<00:03:48.350> on<00:03:48.440> top<00:03:48.650> of<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:48.890> white<00:03:49.160> or<00:03:49.310> a

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
this is if it's on top of a white or a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.150 
this is if it's on top of a white or a
quartz<00:03:49.670> block<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:51.140> these<00:03:51.590> commands<00:03:52.130> are

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
quartz block and these commands are

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.710 
quartz block and these commands are
executed<00:03:52.220> from<00:03:52.670> right<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:52.910> left<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.510> first

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
executed from right to left so the first

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.220 
executed from right to left so the first
one<00:03:53.959> is<00:03:54.400> this<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.790> have<00:03:56.600> a<00:03:56.660> template<00:03:57.019> right<00:03:57.170> here

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
one is this I have a template right here

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.530 
one is this I have a template right here
which<00:03:58.010> is<00:03:58.040> just<00:03:58.190> set<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.880> block<00:03:59.030> beneath<00:03:59.209> it

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
which is just set the block beneath it

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.750 
which is just set the block beneath it
to<00:03:59.780> whatever<00:04:00.709> type<00:04:00.920> of<00:04:00.950> luck<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.400> want<00:04:01.580> in

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
to whatever type of luck you want in

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.160 
to whatever type of luck you want in
fact<00:04:02.000> you<00:04:02.150> could<00:04:02.330> have<00:04:02.540> multiple<00:04:03.080> different

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
fact you could have multiple different

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.640 
fact you could have multiple different
types<00:04:03.350> not<00:04:03.680> just<00:04:03.739> white<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.459> black<00:04:05.590> but<00:04:06.590> you

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
types not just white and black but you

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.110 
types not just white and black but you
can<00:04:06.890> in<00:04:07.010> theory<00:04:07.220> do<00:04:07.430> anything<00:04:07.760> with<00:04:07.880> whites

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
can in theory do anything with whites

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.430 
can in theory do anything with whites
and<00:04:08.269> blocks<00:04:08.510> that<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.780> could<00:04:08.930> with<00:04:09.110> different

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
and blocks that you could with different

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.410 
and blocks that you could with different
colors<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:09.980> then<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.489> next<00:04:10.880> one<00:04:11.030> is<00:04:11.150> just

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
colors and then the next one is just

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.390 
colors and then the next one is just
either<00:04:11.930> move<00:04:12.230> it<00:04:12.380> right<00:04:12.500> or<00:04:12.620> left<00:04:12.830> positive

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
either move it right or left positive

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.750 
either move it right or left positive
one<00:04:13.610> for<00:04:13.970> right<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:15.080> a<00:04:15.130> negative<00:04:16.130> one<00:04:16.370> right

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
one for right and a negative one right

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.870 
one for right and a negative one right
here<00:04:16.970> for<00:04:17.000> left

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
here for left

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.440 
here for left
and<00:04:18.270> then<00:04:18.900> next<00:04:19.470> move<00:04:19.830> the<00:04:19.860> move<00:04:20.730> this<00:04:20.970> guy<00:04:21.150> he

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
and then next move the move this guy he

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.050 
and then next move the move this guy he
represents<00:04:22.230> which<00:04:22.380> state<00:04:22.680> you're<00:04:22.800> in<00:04:23.060> move

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
represents which state you're in move

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.450 
represents which state you're in move
him<00:04:24.530> yeah<00:04:25.530> which<00:04:25.710> state<00:04:25.980> you're<00:04:26.100> gonna<00:04:26.220> move

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
him yeah which state you're gonna move

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.310 
him yeah which state you're gonna move
him<00:04:26.610> into<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.960> set<00:04:28.440> it<00:04:28.560> up<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:28.980> that<00:04:30.320> well

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
him into and I set it up so that well

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.560 
him into and I set it up so that well
right<00:04:31.890> here<00:04:32.070> is<00:04:32.190> actually<00:04:32.310> zero<00:04:32.730> zero<00:04:33.030> so

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
right here is actually zero zero so

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.080 
right here is actually zero zero so
right<00:04:33.780> here<00:04:34.230> is<00:04:34.410> zero<00:04:35.130> in<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.400> sequence<00:04:35.970> right

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
right here is zero in the sequence right

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.640 
right here is zero in the sequence right
here<00:04:36.240> someone<00:04:36.570> in<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.810> Z<00:04:36.930> coordinates<00:04:37.380> right

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
here someone in the Z coordinates right

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.010 
here someone in the Z coordinates right
here's<00:04:37.830> 2<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.220> C<00:04:38.340> coordinates<00:04:38.790> so<00:04:39.020> all

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
here's 2 and the C coordinates so all

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.650 
here's 2 and the C coordinates so all
you<00:04:40.170> have<00:04:40.290> to<00:04:40.350> do<00:04:40.590> is<00:04:40.860> make<00:04:41.760> the<00:04:41.940> Z<00:04:42.180> coordinate

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
you have to do is make the Z coordinate

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.240 
you have to do is make the Z coordinate
the<00:04:42.780> state<00:04:43.050> you<00:04:43.200> want<00:04:43.290> it<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.530> move<00:04:43.680> into<00:04:43.830> so

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
the state you want it to move into so

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.820 
the state you want it to move into so
this<00:04:44.640> says<00:04:44.880> teleport<00:04:45.450> this<00:04:45.600> guy<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.780> that<00:04:46.080> Zed

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
this says teleport this guy to that Zed

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.550 
this says teleport this guy to that Zed
coordinate<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.870> which<00:04:48.870> would<00:04:49.020> be<00:04:49.080> state<00:04:49.380> 2

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
coordinate and which would be state 2

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.740 
coordinate and which would be state 2
right<00:04:49.770> here<00:04:49.980> so<00:04:50.760> yeah<00:04:50.880> that's<00:04:51.330> uh<00:04:51.420> that's

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
right here so yeah that's uh that's

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.450 
right here so yeah that's uh that's
about<00:04:51.900> it<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:52.530> this<00:04:52.650> is<00:04:52.830> just<00:04:52.860> what<00:04:53.190> kind<00:04:53.400> of

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
about it and this is just what kind of

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.060 
about it and this is just what kind of
checks<00:04:53.700> what<00:04:54.360> color<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:55.050> is<00:04:55.350> underneath<00:04:55.920> the

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
checks what color the is underneath the

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.690 
checks what color the is underneath the
wolf<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.520> this<00:04:57.450> right<00:04:57.720> here<00:04:57.960> is<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.700> what
