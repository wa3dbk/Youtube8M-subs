option<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.930> use<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> extra<00:01:31.770> strip<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.159> tape

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
option is to use the extra strip of tape

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.609 
option is to use the extra strip of tape
that<00:01:32.640> came<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.180> roll<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.900> downsides<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that came with the roll the downsides to

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.319 
that came with the roll the downsides to
this<00:01:34.770> method<00:01:35.280> are<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.759> takes<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.150> little

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
this method are that it takes a little

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.969 
this method are that it takes a little
longer<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.110> little<00:01:37.380> strips<00:01:37.680> don't

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
longer and the little strips don't

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.560 
longer and the little strips don't
really<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.640> stay<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.000> place<00:01:39.299> while

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
really like to stay in place while

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.780 
really like to stay in place while
you're<00:01:39.720> working<00:01:39.930> Plus<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.040> method<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.579> also

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
you're working Plus this method can also

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.030 
you're working Plus this method can also
come<00:01:42.180> unwrapped<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.720> little<00:01:42.960> easier<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.860> this

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
come unwrapped a little easier but this

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.039 
come unwrapped a little easier but this
method<00:01:44.280> looks<00:01:44.729> very<00:01:45.030> clean<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.630> done<00:01:45.869> well

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
method looks very clean when done well

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.469 
method looks very clean when done well
here's<00:01:46.740> how<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.850> only<00:01:48.030> want<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
here's how you do it you only want the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.179 
here's how you do it you only want the
strip<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.810> tape<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.229> cover<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.619> clamp<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
strip of tape to cover the clamp in the

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.429 
strip of tape to cover the clamp in the
area<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> bar<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.329> above<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.960> below<00:01:52.259> it

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
area of the bar just above and below it

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.440 
area of the bar just above and below it
it<00:01:52.649> does<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.100> need<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.430> cover<00:01:53.640> any<00:01:53.970> part<00:01:54.299> of

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
it does not need to cover any part of

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.539 
it does not need to cover any part of
the<00:01:54.540> lever<00:01:54.780> body<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.829> if<00:01:55.950> I'm<00:01:56.100> using<00:01:56.130> this

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
the lever body so if I'm using this

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.340 
the lever body so if I'm using this
method<00:01:56.969> I'll<00:01:57.149> measure<00:01:57.360> how<00:01:57.630> much<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.990> need<00:01:58.200> to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
method I'll measure how much I need to

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.929 
method I'll measure how much I need to
get<00:01:58.530> around<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.950> back<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.430> clamp<00:01:59.729> and

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
get around the back of the clamp and

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.359 
get around the back of the clamp and
then<00:02:00.090> cut<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.570> pieces<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.200> length<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:02.219> to

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
then cut to pieces to length I like to

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.920 
then cut to pieces to length I like to
then<00:02:02.520> stagger<00:02:02.880> them<00:02:03.210> starting<00:02:03.659> with<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
then stagger them starting with the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.080 
then stagger them starting with the
lower<00:02:04.110> one<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.950> entire<00:02:05.310> area<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
lower one so that the entire area of the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.330 
lower one so that the entire area of the
lever<00:02:06.329> body<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.930> covered<00:02:07.380> most<00:02:07.860> mechanics

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
lever body is covered most mechanics

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.979 
lever body is covered most mechanics
don't<00:02:08.489> use<00:02:08.700> two<00:02:08.940> strips<00:02:09.270> like<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.690> but<00:02:09.959> I

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
don't use two strips like this but I

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.600 
don't use two strips like this but I
found<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.470> necessary<00:02:11.009> when<00:02:11.220> dealing<00:02:11.250> with

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
found it necessary when dealing with

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.790 
found it necessary when dealing with

stick<00:02:57.150> very<00:02:57.420> well<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:58.050> I<00:02:58.080> use<00:02:58.410> electrical<00:02:58.980> tape

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
stick very well so I use electrical tape

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.250 
stick very well so I use electrical tape
instead<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.880> like<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.450> start<00:03:00.690> at<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.960> end<00:03:01.080> of

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
instead I like to start at the end of

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.810 
instead I like to start at the end of
the<00:03:01.380> finishing<00:03:01.800> tape<00:03:02.010> on<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.310> underside<00:03:02.790> of

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
the finishing tape on the underside of

the finishing tape on the underside of
the<00:03:03.060> bar<00:03:03.270> so<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.840> seam<00:03:04.080> is<00:03:04.260> invisible<00:03:04.590> I

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
the bar so that the seam is invisible I

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.680 
the bar so that the seam is invisible I
also<00:03:05.460> like<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.940> make<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.240> edge<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.570> the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
also like to make the edge of the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.540 
also like to make the edge of the
finishing<00:03:07.170> tape<00:03:07.380> flush<00:03:07.770> with<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.190> cut<00:03:08.400> edge

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550

of<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.790> bar<00:03:09.090> tape<00:03:09.300> if<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.810> let<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.260> finishing

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
of the bar tape if you let the finishing

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.350 
of the bar tape if you let the finishing
tape<00:03:10.890> hang<00:03:11.130> over<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.370> edge<00:03:11.490> of<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:11.970> bar<00:03:12.120> tape

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
tape hang over the edge of the bar tape

tape hang over the edge of the bar tape
it<00:03:12.570> has<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.900> be<00:03:13.020> stretched<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.560> lot<00:03:13.770> in<00:03:14.010> order<00:03:14.190> to

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
it has to be stretched a lot in order to

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.400 
it has to be stretched a lot in order to

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
make it around the bar smoothly that

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.840 
make it around the bar smoothly that
tension<00:03:16.860> will<00:03:17.010> eventually<00:03:17.580> cause<00:03:17.790> the
