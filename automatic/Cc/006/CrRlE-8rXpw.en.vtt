guitar<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.900> designed<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.439> built<00:02:01.590> let's<00:02:02.159> have

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
guitar is designed and built let's have

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.490 
guitar is designed and built let's have
a<00:02:02.340> look<00:02:02.520> at<00:02:02.640> what<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.880> sounds<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.320> Paul<00:02:04.320> Reed

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
a look at what it sounds like Paul Reed

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.590 
a look at what it sounds like Paul Reed
Smith<00:02:04.710> says<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.700> ten<00:02:05.880> re-grand<00:02:06.330> was

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
Smith says that the ten re-grand was

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.479 
Smith says that the ten re-grand was
designed<00:02:06.930> with<00:02:06.960> flat<00:02:07.229> peckers<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.650> mind<00:02:07.860> so

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
designed with flat peckers in mind so

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.350 
designed with flat peckers in mind so
let's<00:02:08.700> start<00:02:08.849> with<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.030> little<00:02:09.149> bit<00:02:09.300> of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
let's start with a little bit of

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:37.759 
let's start with a little bit of
traditional<00:02:09.899> flat<00:02:10.080> picking

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.080 

so<00:02:38.769> that<00:02:38.920> guitar<00:02:39.189> would<00:02:39.340> also<00:02:39.459> work<00:02:39.700> great<00:02:39.760> as

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
so that guitar would also work great as

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.000 
so that guitar would also work great as
a<00:02:40.120> rhythm<00:02:40.450> instrument<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.109> puts<00:02:41.349> out<00:02:41.469> a<00:02:41.709> lot<00:02:41.890> of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
a rhythm instrument it puts out a lot of

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.130 
a rhythm instrument it puts out a lot of
sound<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.790> has<00:02:43.000> plenty<00:02:43.209> of<00:02:43.359> headroom<00:02:43.569> even

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
sound it has plenty of headroom even

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.500 
sound it has plenty of headroom even
when<00:02:44.290> played<00:02:44.530> with<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.739> fairly<00:02:45.129> heavy<00:02:45.280> pick<00:02:45.549> so

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
when played with a fairly heavy pick so

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.640 
when played with a fairly heavy pick so
let's<00:02:46.659> try<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.840> little<00:02:46.959> bit<00:02:47.109> of<00:02:47.170> strumming<00:02:47.439> and

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
let's try a little bit of strumming and

00:02:47.650 --> 00:03:18.750 
let's try a little bit of strumming and
see<00:02:47.769> how<00:02:47.859> that<00:02:48.040> works

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.949 

being<00:03:19.760> primarily<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.300> fingerstyle<00:03:20.600> player

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
being primarily a fingerstyle player

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.020 
being primarily a fingerstyle player
myself<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.770> also<00:03:21.920> found<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:22.340> this<00:03:22.490> guitar<00:03:22.819> can

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
myself I also found that this guitar can

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.360 
myself I also found that this guitar can
sound<00:03:23.209> really<00:03:23.420> nice<00:03:23.510> without<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.900> pic<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.380> I

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
sound really nice without a pic and I

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.680 
sound really nice without a pic and I
also<00:03:25.490> was<00:03:25.819> very<00:03:25.880> interested<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.420> see<00:03:26.540> how<00:03:26.630> the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
also was very interested to see how the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.870 
also was very interested to see how the
guitar<00:03:27.020> responded<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.590> lowered<00:03:27.860> tunings<00:03:28.100> so<00:03:28.850> I

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
guitar responded to lowered tunings so I

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.880 
guitar responded to lowered tunings so I
drop<00:03:29.150> down<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.480> dadgad<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.140> let's<00:03:30.709> try<00:03:30.860> a

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
drop down to dadgad and let's try a

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.020 
drop down to dadgad and let's try a
little<00:03:31.010> bit<00:03:31.160> of<00:03:31.220> finger<00:03:31.370> style<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:31.819> see<00:03:31.940> how

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
little bit of finger style and see how

00:03:32.030 --> 00:04:00.650 
little bit of finger style and see how
that<00:03:32.209> works

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:08.390 

you
