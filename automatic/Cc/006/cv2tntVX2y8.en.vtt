lovely you think it was a simple enough

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.869 
lovely you think it was a simple enough
thing<00:00:48.239> getting<00:00:48.449> a<00:00:48.629> cork<00:00:48.900> ID<00:00:49.400> but<00:00:50.400> just<00:00:50.640> look<00:00:50.790> at

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
thing getting a cork ID but just look at

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.520 
thing getting a cork ID but just look at
all<00:00:51.000> these<00:00:51.210> devices<00:00:51.570> people<00:00:52.049> have<00:00:52.290> come<00:00:52.500> up

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
all these devices people have come up

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.619 
all these devices people have come up
with<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:53.100> do<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
with to do it

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.079 
with to do it
this<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.869> pumps<00:00:55.619> compressed<00:00:56.190> air<00:00:56.519> into<00:00:56.970> the

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
this one pumps compressed air into the

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.119 
this one pumps compressed air into the
cork<00:00:57.360> trouble<00:00:58.080> is<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.260> makes<00:00:58.470> the<00:00:58.650> bottle<00:00:58.949> feel

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
cork trouble is it makes the bottle feel

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.960 
cork trouble is it makes the bottle feel
like<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.339> bomb<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.940> me<00:01:00.860> and<00:01:01.860> this<00:01:02.220> was<00:01:02.610> one<00:01:02.820> of

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
like a bomb to me and this was one of

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.719 
like a bomb to me and this was one of
the<00:01:03.059> first<00:01:03.239> greater<00:01:03.659> patent<00:01:04.290> cork<00:01:04.559> screws<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the first greater patent cork screws the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.730 
the first greater patent cork screws the
rack-and-pinion<00:01:05.970> known<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> king<00:01:07.290> screw

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
rack-and-pinion known as the king screw

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.370 
rack-and-pinion known as the king screw
and<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.790> established<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.630> first<00:01:09.780> principle

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and it established the first principle

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.690 
and it established the first principle
of<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> really<00:01:10.680> good<00:01:10.799> course<00:01:11.070> true<00:01:11.310> which<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.580> it

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
of a really good course true which is it

of a really good course true which is it

pushes down on the bottle at the same

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
and then Ram it into the bottle and it

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.190 
and then Ram it into the bottle and it
instantly<00:02:34.710> expands<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:36.270> beautiful<00:02:36.870> snug

fit now a good cork like that will last
25<00:02:42.090> years<00:02:42.540> at<00:02:42.750> least<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.830> slowly<00:02:44.130> becoming

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
brittle and crumbly so long as the cork

is always kept wet by being in contact
with<00:02:49.740> wine<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.400> why<00:02:50.700> we<00:02:50.880> always<00:02:51.360> keep

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
with wine that is why we always keep

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.740 
with wine that is why we always keep
wine<00:02:51.870> bottles<00:02:52.290> lying<00:02:52.590> down<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:54.540> cork

wine bottles lying down and the cork

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.200 
wine bottles lying down and the cork
really<00:02:55.050> can<00:02:55.290> keep<00:02:55.560> because<00:02:55.950> this<00:02:56.160> one<00:02:56.400> was

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
really can keep because this one was
