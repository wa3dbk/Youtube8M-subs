00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
to do so shape rates step by step

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.119 
to do so shape rates step by step
when<00:00:38.850> installing<00:00:39.300> crochet<00:00:39.870> braids<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.500> think

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
when installing crochet braids I think

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.250 
when installing crochet braids I think
the<00:00:41.370> most<00:00:41.579> important<00:00:42.180> thing<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.510> decide<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the most important thing to decide is

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.619 
the most important thing to decide is
how<00:00:43.500> you're<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> part<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.030> hair<00:00:45.059> how

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
how you're going to part the hair how

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.090 
how you're going to part the hair how
you're<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.050> cornrow<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.860> hair

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
you're going to cornrow the hair

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.810 
you're going to cornrow the hair
underneath<00:00:48.890> this<00:00:49.890> determines<00:00:50.489> how

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
underneath this determines how

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.450 
underneath this determines how
natural-looking<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.410> finished<00:00:52.800> look<00:00:53.039> will

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
natural-looking the finished look will

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.069 
natural-looking the finished look will
be<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.739> her<00:00:55.920> case<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.570> separated<00:00:57.570> her<00:00:57.840> hair

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
be so in her case I separated her hair

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.340 
be so in her case I separated her hair
into<00:00:58.440> four<00:00:58.739> sections<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.730> did<00:01:00.239> about<00:01:00.480> 12<00:01:00.930> 1

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
into four sections and did about 12 1

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.539 
into four sections and did about 12 1
rows<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.430> front<00:01:02.850> section

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.450 

once<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.600> was<00:01:06.719> done<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.259> front<00:01:07.590> section<00:01:07.859> I

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
once I was done with the front section I

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.959 
once I was done with the front section I
then<00:01:09.179> pointed<00:01:09.929> at<00:01:10.079> the<00:01:10.200> back<00:01:10.500> section<00:01:10.969> by

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:11.969 
then pointed at the back section by

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.679 
then pointed at the back section by
taking<00:01:12.659> every<00:01:13.469> two<00:01:13.829> corners<00:01:14.369> from<00:01:15.149> the<00:01:15.299> front

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
taking every two corners from the front

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.490 
taking every two corners from the front
section<00:01:16.289> and<00:01:16.700> making<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.820> into<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.569> in<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
section and making it into one in the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.260 
section and making it into one in the
back<00:01:19.679> as<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.929> here<00:01:25.399> again<00:01:26.399> going<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
back as you see here again going for a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.270 
back as you see here again going for a
look<00:01:27.569> that<00:01:27.929> matches<00:01:28.409> her<00:01:28.560> natural<00:01:29.069> hair

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
look that matches her natural hair

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.569 
look that matches her natural hair
texture<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:30.479> decided<00:01:30.899> to<00:01:31.020> use<00:01:31.340> Marvy<00:01:32.340> hair

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
texture we decided to use Marvy hair

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.209 
texture we decided to use Marvy hair
which<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.450> very<00:01:33.659> similar<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.770> texture<00:01:35.189> of

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
which is very similar to the texture of

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.039 
which is very similar to the texture of
her<00:01:35.549> own<00:01:35.759> hair<00:01:37.640> now<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> installation<00:01:39.239> of<00:01:39.840> the

extensions into the corn world hair is a
relatively<00:01:43.500> easy<00:01:43.920> process<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.849> there<00:01:45.299> are

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
relatively easy process and there are

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.210 
relatively easy process and there are
many<00:01:45.539> great<00:01:45.780> videos<00:01:45.810> showing<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.619> how<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.950> do

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
many great videos showing you how to do

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.690 
many great videos showing you how to do
that

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
that

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.690 
that
I<00:01:48.020> took<00:01:49.020> one<00:01:49.439> extension<00:01:49.979> between<00:01:50.159> my<00:01:50.429> thumb

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
I took one extension between my thumb

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.839 
I took one extension between my thumb
and<00:01:50.939> my<00:01:51.000> index<00:01:51.270> finger<00:01:51.989> I<00:01:52.229> opened<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.340> crochet

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:53.849 
and my index finger I opened the crochet

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:56.870 
and my index finger I opened the crochet
latch<00:01:54.119> put<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.929> underneath<00:01:55.319> the<00:01:55.619> cornrows<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
latch put it underneath the cornrows the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.350 
latch put it underneath the cornrows the
hair<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.390> close<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.439> latch<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.099> now<00:01:59.759> here's

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
hair in close the latch and now here's

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.289 
hair in close the latch and now here's
what<00:02:00.539> I<00:02:00.569> did<00:02:00.659> differently<00:02:02.060> instead<00:02:03.060> of

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
what I did differently instead of

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.569 
what I did differently instead of
looping<00:02:03.539> both<00:02:04.079> ends<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.829> hair<00:02:05.009> into<00:02:05.459> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
looping both ends of the hair into the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.749 
looping both ends of the hair into the
circle<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.270> took<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:06.959> one<00:02:07.500> end<00:02:07.829> as<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.579> see

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
circle I took just one end as you see

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.020 
circle I took just one end as you see
here<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.390> left<00:02:10.049> the<00:02:10.200> other<00:02:10.440> end<00:02:10.709> out<00:02:11.069> this

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
here and left the other end out this

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.599 
here and left the other end out this
creates<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.690> method<00:02:13.109> a<00:02:13.350> technique<00:02:13.950> called<00:02:14.190> the

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:14.609 
creates a method a technique called the

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:16.849 
creates a method a technique called the
knotless<00:02:15.239> method<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.319> this<00:02:16.470> gives<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.829> a

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
knotless method and this gives you a

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.000 
knotless method and this gives you a
more<00:02:17.160> natural<00:02:17.220> look<00:02:18.139> then<00:02:19.139> I<00:02:19.170> brush<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.769> hair

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010
