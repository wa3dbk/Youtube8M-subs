the<00:01:35.520> game<00:01:35.759> these<00:01:36.000> pigs<00:01:36.299> they<00:01:36.479> are<00:01:36.960> evolved<00:01:37.619> is

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the game these pigs they are evolved is

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.219 
the game these pigs they are evolved is
the<00:01:38.070> same<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.520> turtles<00:01:39.299> basically<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.049> um

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the same like turtles basically but um

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.340 
the same like turtles basically but um
you<00:01:41.009> know<00:01:41.100> they<00:01:41.280> are<00:01:41.490> pigs<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.780> then<00:01:42.899> there's

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
you know they are pigs and then there's

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.810 
you know they are pigs and then there's
two<00:01:43.530> different<00:01:43.710> forms<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.130> these<00:01:44.280> pics<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
two different forms of these pics so the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.760 
two different forms of these pics so the
pigs<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.390> saw<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> evolved<00:01:46.649> form

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
pigs you just saw that the evolved form

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.210 
pigs you just saw that the evolved form
these<00:01:47.130> pigs<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:48.149> are<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.509> all<00:01:48.689> fours<00:01:49.220> there

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
this is kind of mini game it doesn't

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.660 
this is kind of mini game it doesn't
really<00:02:00.690> matter<00:02:00.870> what<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.550> composition<00:02:02.550> of

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
really matter what a composition of

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
actually used any of them for evolving

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.090 
some of them are level once you get them
at<00:03:08.850> level<00:03:09.540> 1<00:03:09.750> they're<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.320> kind<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.860> basic

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
at level 1 they're the kind of a basic

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.890 
at level 1 they're the kind of a basic
form<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.820> pig<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.600> know<00:03:12.690> sometimes

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
form of the pig you know sometimes

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.050 
form of the pig you know sometimes
you'll<00:03:13.200> get<00:03:13.290> involved<00:03:13.709> once<00:03:13.890> but<00:03:14.160> um<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.519> lot<00:03:14.940> of

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
you'll get involved once but um a lot of

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.150 
you'll get involved once but um a lot of
the<00:03:15.150> time<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:15.450> pick<00:03:15.660> up<00:03:15.840> these<00:03:16.019> level<00:03:16.739> one<00:03:16.890> pic

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
the time you pick up these level one pic

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.550 
the time you pick up these level one pic
so<00:03:17.340> it's<00:03:17.489> kind<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:18.060> kind<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.959> weird<00:03:19.200> kind<00:03:19.470> of

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
so it's kind of a kind of weird kind of

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.949 
so it's kind of a kind of weird kind of
quirky<00:03:19.800> that<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.250> have<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:21.570> have<00:03:21.810> to

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
quirky that you have to you have to

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.699 
quirky that you have to you have to
power<00:03:22.560> up<00:03:22.860> your<00:03:23.810> your<00:03:24.810> revolver<00:03:25.260> before<00:03:25.590> you

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
power up your your revolver before you

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.190 
power up your your revolver before you
can<00:03:25.890> really<00:03:26.130> get<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.180> most<00:03:27.330> out<00:03:27.600> in<00:03:27.810> them<00:03:27.930> so

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
can really get the most out in them so

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.289 
can really get the most out in them so
just<00:03:28.500> gonna<00:03:28.799> test<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.519> out<00:03:29.730> not<00:03:29.940> totally

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
just gonna test this out not totally

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.620 
just gonna test this out not totally
sure<00:03:30.360> how<00:03:30.510> much<00:03:31.790> how<00:03:32.790> many<00:03:32.850> experience<00:03:33.480> points

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
sure how much how many experience points

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.080 
sure how much how many experience points
you<00:03:33.840> need<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.320> get<00:03:34.500> them<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.010> level<00:03:35.519> 10<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:36.030> we

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
you need to get them to a level 10 so we

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.449 
you need to get them to a level 10 so we
just<00:03:36.239> just<00:03:36.480> test<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.049> out<00:03:37.230> with<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.470> extra

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
just just test this out with a extra

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.630 
just just test this out with a extra
seahorse<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:38.940> picked<00:03:39.180> up<00:03:39.390> then<00:03:39.950> that<00:03:40.950> was<00:03:41.610> a

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.570 
dump how are your pigs up with a
seahorse<00:03:49.170> because<00:03:49.440> they<00:03:49.590> won't<00:03:49.769> get<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.370> max

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
seahorse because they won't get to max

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
turtles from total time that you kept

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.539 
turtles from total time that you kept
for<00:03:59.790> this<00:04:00.080> kept<00:04:01.080> over<00:04:01.350> for<00:04:01.530> this<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:02.310> big

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.490 
event and so if you just use one baby
turtle<00:04:05.700> basically<00:04:06.209> that's<00:04:06.450> gonna<00:04:06.690> as<00:04:06.989> going

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
turtle basically that's gonna as going

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
it's going to take him up to level 10 so

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.020 
it's going to take him up to level 10 so
we<00:04:10.140> got<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.290> super<00:04:10.590> success<00:04:10.950> but<00:04:11.130> you<00:04:11.940> know

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
we got a super success but you know

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.699 
we got a super success but you know
whatever<00:04:12.239> that<00:04:12.510> doesn't<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:12.959> don't<00:04:13.500> really

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
whatever that doesn't I don't really

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.770 
whatever that doesn't I don't really
matter<00:04:13.830> so<00:04:14.040> now<00:04:14.220> we've<00:04:14.520> got<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.940> maxed<00:04:15.300> out<00:04:15.420> pink

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
matter so now we've got a maxed out pink

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.870 
matter so now we've got a maxed out pink
there<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.400> then<00:04:17.400> we're<00:04:17.489> going<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.639> take<00:04:17.850> a

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
there and then we're going to take a

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.580 
there and then we're going to take a
look<00:04:18.120> at<00:04:18.269> what<00:04:18.540> it<00:04:18.840> means<00:04:19.200> what<00:04:19.440> the

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
look at what it means what the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.050 
look at what it means what the
difference<00:04:19.950> between<00:04:20.250> these<00:04:20.370> pigs<00:04:20.700> is<00:04:20.850> in<00:04:20.970> a

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
difference between these pigs is in a

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.300 
difference between these pigs is in a
sec<00:04:21.299> but<00:04:21.440> before<00:04:22.440> we<00:04:22.530> get<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:22.800> stage<00:04:23.130> you

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
sec but before we get to that stage you

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.280 
sec but before we get to that stage you
need<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:23.610> involve<00:04:23.970> your<00:04:24.270> baby<00:04:24.540> pic<00:04:24.840> so<00:04:25.110> you've

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
you're only going to get 35,000 there if

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.990 
you're only going to get 35,000 there if
you<00:05:19.470> use<00:05:19.530> a<00:05:19.620> pig<00:05:19.950> that's<00:05:20.160> not<00:05:20.340> involved<00:05:20.729> at<00:05:20.789> all

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
you use a pig that's not involved at all

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.150 
you use a pig that's not involved at all
you<00:05:21.960> get<00:05:22.140> hardly<00:05:22.410> and<00:05:22.590> you<00:05:22.860> get<00:05:23.010> like<00:05:23.130> a

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
you get hardly and you get like a

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.250 
you get hardly and you get like a
thousand<00:05:23.640> experience<00:05:24.120> so<00:05:24.330> it's<00:05:24.870> not<00:05:25.050> worth

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
thousand experience so it's not worth

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.050 
thousand experience so it's not worth
using<00:05:25.530> those<00:05:25.770> unable<00:05:26.070> pigs<00:05:26.640> you<00:05:26.820> better

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
using those unable pigs you better

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.969 
using those unable pigs you better
you've<00:05:27.780> got<00:05:27.870> to<00:05:27.960> power<00:05:28.169> them<00:05:28.350> up<00:05:28.410> to<00:05:28.590> max<00:05:28.800> and

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
you've got to power them up to max and

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.730 
you've got to power them up to max and
then<00:05:29.130> evolved<00:05:29.490> into<00:05:29.760> this<00:05:30.320> standing<00:05:31.320> up<00:05:31.440> form

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
then evolved into this standing up form

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.650 
then evolved into this standing up form
so<00:05:31.919> you<00:05:32.100> got<00:05:32.250> all<00:05:32.280> your<00:05:32.729> pee<00:05:32.910> standing<00:05:33.360> up<00:05:33.479> and

so you got all your pee standing up and
then<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:34.350> can<00:05:34.500> use<00:05:34.680> those<00:05:34.830> so<00:05:35.100> you<00:05:35.130> know

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
then you can use those so you know

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.469 
then you can use those so you know
they're<00:05:35.490> pretty<00:05:35.729> hefty<00:05:36.150> you<00:05:36.300> know<00:05:36.360> you're

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479
