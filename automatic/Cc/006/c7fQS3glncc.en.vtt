California they also made him in Chicago
the<00:03:36.329> California<00:03:36.900> ones<00:03:37.109> generally<00:03:37.469> had<00:03:37.739> the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
the California ones generally had the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.709 
the California ones generally had the
TDK<00:03:39.439> 5103<00:03:40.459> style<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.670> dr.<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.569> Chicago

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
once had what's called a stack and dimes

inductor<00:03:45.500> looks<00:03:46.500> more<00:03:47.280> like<00:03:47.489> this<00:03:47.730> one<00:03:49.129> this

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
inductor looks more like this one this

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.750 
inductor looks more like this one this
is<00:03:50.540> actually<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.870> same<00:03:52.469> company<00:03:52.950> but<00:03:53.250> it<00:03:53.519> was<00:03:53.639> an

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
is actually a same company but it was an

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.619 
is actually a same company but it was an
earlier<00:03:54.090> version<00:03:54.359> of<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:55.590> TDK<00:03:56.010> 5103<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:57.389> one

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
earlier version of the TDK 5103 this one

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.030 
earlier version of the TDK 5103 this one
is<00:03:57.780> more<00:03:57.989> based<00:03:58.319> on<00:03:58.609> the<00:04:00.709> faisal<00:04:01.709> style

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
is more based on the faisal style

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.509 
is more based on the faisal style
inductor<00:04:02.909> which<00:04:03.810> they<00:04:04.799> say<00:04:05.010> it's<00:04:05.159> a<00:04:05.250> really

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
inductor which they say it's a really

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:11.209 
inductor which they say it's a really
close<00:04:06.739> clone<00:04:07.739> of<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.310> faisal<00:04:09.199> so<00:04:10.219> basically

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:11.219 
close clone of the faisal so basically

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.809 
close clone of the faisal so basically
what<00:04:11.519> this<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.969> completely<00:04:12.389> stock<00:04:13.819> California

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819

as<00:04:31.830> i<00:04:32.280> actually<00:04:33.169> bought<00:04:34.550> identical<00:04:35.550> version

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
as i actually bought identical version

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.230 
as i actually bought identical version
of<00:04:36.120> this<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.800> just<00:04:37.800> had<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:38.310> marked<00:04:38.669> up<00:04:38.820> pedal

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
of this and just had a marked up pedal

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.529 
of this and just had a marked up pedal
housing<00:04:39.659> so<00:04:39.930> i<00:04:40.250> wanted<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.310> use<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.550> as<00:04:41.849> a<00:04:42.000> yes

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.499 

just<00:04:45.539> a<00:04:45.690> filter<00:04:46.320> instead<00:04:46.979> of<00:04:47.099> a<00:04:47.190> wawa<00:04:47.610> mid

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
just a filter instead of a wawa mid

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.540 
just a filter instead of a wawa mid
position<00:04:48.720> filter<00:04:49.470> so<00:04:49.680> i<00:04:49.710> put<00:04:49.979> it<00:04:50.070> in<00:04:50.159> this<00:04:50.280> box

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
position filter so i put it in this box

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.890 
position filter so i put it in this box
and<00:04:51.289> added<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:53.280> removable<00:04:53.639> battery<00:04:54.210> but<00:04:54.479> it's

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
and added the removable battery but it's

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.390 
and added the removable battery but it's
changed<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:57.960> Jack's<00:04:58.259> which<00:04:58.680> is<00:04:58.800> functionally

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
changed to Jack's which is functionally

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.159 
changed to Jack's which is functionally
the<00:04:59.430> same<00:04:59.669> they're<00:05:00.150> just<00:05:00.180> switch<00:05:00.630> grab<00:05:00.840> style

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
the same they're just switch grab style

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.100 
the same they're just switch grab style
I<00:05:01.409> put<00:05:02.039> a<00:05:02.070> true<00:05:02.280> bag<00:05:02.490> pass<00:05:02.729> and<00:05:03.120> did<00:05:03.419> the<00:05:03.539> bypass

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
I put a true bag pass and did the bypass

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.029 
I put a true bag pass and did the bypass
mod<00:05:04.729> there<00:05:05.729> was<00:05:05.940> no<00:05:06.349> gain<00:05:07.349> level<00:05:08.120> mods<00:05:09.120> needed

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
mod there was no gain level mods needed

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.490 
mod there was no gain level mods needed
there<00:05:11.039> is<00:05:11.159> a<00:05:11.190> gain<00:05:11.490> mod<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.389> they<00:05:13.229> say<00:05:13.440> you

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
there is a gain mod that they say you

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.379 
there is a gain mod that they say you
need<00:05:13.770> to<00:05:13.800> do<00:05:14.070> when<00:05:14.520> you<00:05:14.669> do<00:05:14.789> a<00:05:14.820> true<00:05:15.030> bypass

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
need to do when you do a true bypass

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.140 
need to do when you do a true bypass
mode<00:05:15.659> but<00:05:15.960> I<00:05:16.110> didn't<00:05:16.349> have<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.789> change<00:05:17.789> any<00:05:18.030> of

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
mode but I didn't have to change any of

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.140 
mode but I didn't have to change any of
the<00:05:18.590> resistor<00:05:19.590> values<00:05:20.009> and<00:05:20.340> it<00:05:20.460> still<00:05:20.880> seemed

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
the resistor values and it still seemed

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.709 
the resistor values and it still seemed
to<00:05:21.240> have<00:05:21.389> unity<00:05:21.780> gain<00:05:21.990> on<00:05:22.229> and<00:05:22.500> off<00:05:22.909> so<00:05:23.909> if<00:05:24.479> you

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:24.719 
to have unity gain on and off so if you

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:26.420 
to have unity gain on and off so if you
do<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.110> true<00:05:25.259> bypass<00:05:25.650> my<00:05:25.889> I<00:05:25.919> don't<00:05:26.159> worry

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
do the true bypass my I don't worry

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.920 
do the true bypass my I don't worry
about<00:05:26.789> if<00:05:27.120> you<00:05:27.270> have<00:05:27.419> this<00:05:27.570> particular

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
about if you have this particular

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.980 
about if you have this particular
circuit<00:05:28.530> don't<00:05:28.740> worry<00:05:28.949> about<00:05:29.509> changing<00:05:30.509> to

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
circuit don't worry about changing to

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.310 
circuit don't worry about changing to
gain<00:05:31.620> resistor<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:33.090> make<00:05:33.360> unity<00:05:33.930> gain<00:05:34.110> because

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
gain resistor to make unity gain because

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.700 
gain resistor to make unity gain because
it<00:05:34.500> are

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
it are

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.090 
it are
we'll<00:05:34.950> have<00:05:35.130> that<00:05:37.250> so<00:05:38.250> this<00:05:38.550> is<00:05:38.880> the

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
we'll have that so this is the

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.840 
we'll have that so this is the
conductor's<00:05:41.100> that<00:05:41.340> I'm<00:05:41.460> selling<00:05:42.950> its<00:05:43.950> 250ml

as<00:05:48.210> far<00:05:48.450> as<00:05:48.480> I<00:05:48.630> know<00:05:48.690> the<00:05:48.930> early<00:05:49.080> gray<00:05:49.380> box<00:05:49.620> was

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
as far as I know the early gray box was

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.990 
as far as I know the early gray box was
the<00:05:50.070> only<00:05:50.220> wow<00:05:51.210> that<00:05:51.510> used<00:05:52.310> 250<00:05:53.310> ml<00:05:53.700> 0<00:05:53.730> Henry

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
the only wow that used 250 ml 0 Henry

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.570 
the only wow that used 250 ml 0 Henry
without<00:05:54.480> the<00:05:54.750> Q<00:05:55.260> resistor<00:05:55.800> you<00:05:56.100> can<00:05:56.250> see<00:05:56.460> it

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
without the Q resistor you can see it

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.040 
without the Q resistor you can see it
removes<00:05:56.880> the<00:05:57.030> cube<00:05:57.270> resistors<00:05:57.720> right<00:05:57.900> here

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
removes the cube resistors right here

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.190 
removes the cube resistors right here
it's<00:05:58.170> 33<00:05:58.500> k<00:05:58.860> and<00:06:01.640> on<00:06:02.640> this<00:06:02.910> pedal<00:06:03.300> here<00:06:03.660> still

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
it's 33 k and on this pedal here still

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.550 
it's 33 k and on this pedal here still
has<00:06:04.380> the<00:06:04.590> 33<00:06:05.100> KN<00:06:05.490> and<00:06:05.730> it<00:06:06.540> has<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:06.840> 500<00:06:07.380> ml

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
has the 33 KN and it has the 500 ml

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.700 
has the 33 KN and it has the 500 ml
Henry<00:06:07.980> so<00:06:08.940> this<00:06:09.240> is<00:06:09.420> a<00:06:09.450> queue<00:06:09.960> resistors<00:06:10.410> just

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
Henry so this is a queue resistors just

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.250 
Henry so this is a queue resistors just
in<00:06:10.830> parallel<00:06:11.310> with<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.520> inductor<00:06:12.030> so<00:06:12.930> here

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
in parallel with the inductor so here

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.590 
in parallel with the inductor so here
with<00:06:13.440> it<00:06:13.560> removed<00:06:13.950> it's<00:06:14.850> just<00:06:15.150> the<00:06:15.270> open

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
with it removed it's just the open

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.140 
with it removed it's just the open
circuit<00:06:16.050> there<00:06:16.290> and<00:06:16.730> so<00:06:17.730> it's<00:06:17.910> just<00:06:18.030> the

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
circuit there and so it's just the

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.090 
circuit there and so it's just the
inductor<00:06:18.600> by<00:06:18.750> itself<00:06:19.020> so<00:06:19.320> the<00:06:19.500> full<00:06:19.680> signal

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
inductor by itself so the full signal

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.250 
inductor by itself so the full signal
goes<00:06:20.280> through<00:06:21.210> the<00:06:21.300> inductor<00:06:21.510> as<00:06:21.810> opposed<00:06:22.110> to

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
goes through the inductor as opposed to

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.030 
goes through the inductor as opposed to
being<00:06:22.410> shunted<00:06:22.770> with<00:06:23.310> the<00:06:23.490> resistor<00:06:25.040> so

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
being shunted with the resistor so

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.790 
being shunted with the resistor so
really<00:06:26.880> you<00:06:27.060> can<00:06:27.120> pick<00:06:27.330> one<00:06:27.510> of<00:06:27.630> these<00:06:27.720> up<00:06:28.440> off

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
really you can pick one of these up off

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.250 
really you can pick one of these up off
ebay<00:06:29.250> it's<00:06:30.060> a<00:06:30.120> lot<00:06:30.300> of<00:06:30.360> people<00:06:30.480> seem<00:06:31.110> to<00:06:31.140> think

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
ebay it's a lot of people seem to think

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.540 
ebay it's a lot of people seem to think
that<00:06:31.530> the<00:06:32.300> TDK<00:06:33.300> 5103<00:06:34.050> is<00:06:34.500> inferior<00:06:35.040> when

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
that the TDK 5103 is inferior when

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.360 
that the TDK 5103 is inferior when
however<00:06:36.470> it's<00:06:37.470> one<00:06:37.650> of<00:06:37.740> the<00:06:37.800> best<00:06:37.950> sounding

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
however it's one of the best sounding

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.750 
however it's one of the best sounding
why's<00:06:38.850> that<00:06:38.880> I've<00:06:39.300> used<00:06:39.600> and<00:06:40.250> there's<00:06:41.250> article

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
why's that I've used and there's article

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.720 
why's that I've used and there's article
by<00:06:41.970> Jeffrey<00:06:42.480> tease<00:06:43.070> where<00:06:44.070> he<00:06:44.220> actually<00:06:44.370> said

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 
by Jeffrey tease where he actually said

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.280 
by Jeffrey tease where he actually said
is<00:06:44.820> that's<00:06:45.090> why<00:06:45.270> I<00:06:45.300> ever<00:06:45.540> heard<00:06:45.810> was<00:06:46.020> one<00:06:46.200> of

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.290 
is that's why I ever heard was one of

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.420 
is that's why I ever heard was one of
these<00:06:46.640> with<00:06:47.640> the<00:06:47.790> Tek<00:06:48.270> 5103<00:06:48.960> and<00:06:49.500> these<00:06:50.220> are

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
these with the Tek 5103 and these are

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.870 
these with the Tek 5103 and these are
hundreds<00:06:50.850> of<00:06:51.000> them<00:06:51.060> but<00:06:51.690> uh<00:06:52.550> he<00:06:53.550> said<00:06:53.580> it's

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 
hundreds of them but uh he said it's

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.070 
hundreds of them but uh he said it's
kind<00:06:54.630> of<00:06:54.690> an<00:06:54.810> anomaly<00:06:55.440> because<00:06:56.900> generally<00:06:57.900> his

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 
kind of an anomaly because generally his

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.520 
kind of an anomaly because generally his
favorites<00:06:58.560> are<00:06:58.710> the<00:06:58.740> Clyde<00:06:59.070> McCoys<00:06:59.490> with<00:06:59.790> the

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
favorites are the Clyde McCoys with the

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.960 
favorites are the Clyde McCoys with the
halo<00:07:01.530> style<00:07:01.860> and<00:07:02.250> dr.<00:07:03.050> but<00:07:04.050> this<00:07:04.800> I<00:07:05.160> find<00:07:05.880> that

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:05.970 
halo style and dr. but this I find that

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.570 
halo style and dr. but this I find that
D<00:07:06.180> some<00:07:06.420> very<00:07:06.900> good<00:07:07.080> as<00:07:07.230> a<00:07:07.260> wah<00:07:07.530> as<00:07:07.890> it's<00:07:08.250> just<00:07:08.460> a

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 
D some very good as a wah as it's just a

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.410 
D some very good as a wah as it's just a
wah-wah<00:07:08.940> but<00:07:09.510> not<00:07:09.990> as<00:07:10.170> a<00:07:10.200> wah<00:07:10.740> filter<00:07:11.420> fixed

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:12.420 
wah-wah but not as a wah filter fixed

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.880 
wah-wah but not as a wah filter fixed
position<00:07:12.870> and<00:07:13.770> so<00:07:14.610> if<00:07:14.700> you<00:07:14.790> gotta<00:07:14.970> make<00:07:15.180> one<00:07:15.450> or

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:15.890 
position and so if you gotta make one or

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.180 
position and so if you gotta make one or
make<00:07:16.890> one<00:07:17.100> claw<00:07:17.930> you<00:07:18.930> really<00:07:19.380> to<00:07:19.830> get<00:07:19.980> it<00:07:20.070> to

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190 
make one claw you really to get it to

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.560 
make one claw you really to get it to
sound<00:07:20.370> the<00:07:20.520> way<00:07:20.610> it's<00:07:20.820> supposed<00:07:20.880> to<00:07:21.090> sound<00:07:21.300> you

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:21.570 
sound the way it's supposed to sound you

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.480 
sound the way it's supposed to sound you
need<00:07:22.110> to<00:07:22.230> buy<00:07:22.380> one<00:07:22.650> of<00:07:22.680> these<00:07:22.860> inductors<00:07:23.460> and

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:23.490 
need to buy one of these inductors and

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.230 
need to buy one of these inductors and
do<00:07:23.820> the<00:07:23.940> mod<00:07:24.120> so<00:07:25.050> you<00:07:25.110> got<00:07:25.320> the<00:07:25.790> early<00:07:26.790> box

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 
do the mod so you got the early box

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.810 
do the mod so you got the early box
great<00:07:27.680> because<00:07:28.680> that's<00:07:28.860> the<00:07:29.040> way<00:07:29.070> they<00:07:29.670> got

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:29.820 
great because that's the way they got

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.310 
great because that's the way they got
the<00:07:30.000> tone<00:07:30.320> if<00:07:31.320> you<00:07:31.470> want<00:07:31.680> it<00:07:31.830> if<00:07:32.010> you<00:07:32.130> want<00:07:32.310> the

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:33.320 
the tone if you want it if you want the

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:39.160 
the tone if you want it if you want the
late<00:07:34.320> 60s<00:07:35.000> hard<00:07:36.000> rock<00:07:37.400> mid-range<00:07:38.400> eat<00:07:38.640> own

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.170 
late 60s hard rock mid-range eat own

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.880 
late 60s hard rock mid-range eat own
otherwise<00:07:40.170> you're<00:07:40.410> just<00:07:40.440> going<00:07:40.680> to<00:07:40.740> get<00:07:40.830> a

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:40.890 
otherwise you're just going to get a

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.430 
otherwise you're just going to get a
bunch<00:07:41.100> of<00:07:41.220> flub<00:07:41.490> you<00:07:42.330> try<00:07:42.570> to<00:07:42.630> use<00:07:42.870> this<00:07:43.230> by
