00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.840 
lock on it this is not an original idea
I<00:04:27.360> seen<00:04:27.870> a<00:04:28.230> video<00:04:28.530> on<00:04:28.830> YouTube<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.520> someone

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
I seen a video on YouTube and someone

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.260 
I seen a video on YouTube and someone
that<00:04:29.940> sells<00:04:30.240> these<00:04:30.450> things<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.910> this<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:32.970> a

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
that sells these things and this is a

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.210 
that sells these things and this is a
little<00:04:33.810> bit<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:34.020> work<00:04:34.200> to<00:04:34.230> build<00:04:34.620> one<00:04:34.919> of<00:04:35.070> these

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
little bit of work to build one of these

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.470 
little bit of work to build one of these
things<00:04:35.280> because<00:04:35.850> you've<00:04:35.970> got<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.180> get<00:04:36.300> your

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
things because you've got to get your

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.230 
things because you've got to get your
distance<00:04:37.130> coming<00:04:38.130> out<00:04:38.370> of<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:38.610> case<00:04:38.910> right

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
distance coming out of that case right

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.860 
distance coming out of that case right
so<00:04:39.510> it'll<00:04:39.780> it'll<00:04:40.169> shut<00:04:40.560> properly<00:04:40.890> so<00:04:41.870> anyway

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
so it'll it'll shut properly so anyway
