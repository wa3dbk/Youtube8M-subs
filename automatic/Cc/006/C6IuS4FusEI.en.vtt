Fish and Wildlife ready for a brief
history<00:01:49.450> lesson<00:01:49.920> back<00:01:50.920> in<00:01:51.100> nineteen<00:01:51.460> fifty

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
history lesson back in nineteen fifty

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.609 
history lesson back in nineteen fifty
when<00:01:51.969> snoqualmie<00:01:52.479> pass<00:01:52.509> was<00:01:52.899> only<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.170> two<00:01:53.409> lane

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
when snoqualmie pass was only a two lane

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.069 
when snoqualmie pass was only a two lane
highway<00:01:53.649> yeah<00:01:54.399> imagine<00:01:54.880> that<00:01:55.060> we<00:01:55.750> built<00:01:55.960> a

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
highway yeah imagine that we built a

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.080 
highway yeah imagine that we built a
snow<00:01:56.320> ship<00:01:56.590> which<00:01:57.070> protected<00:01:57.549> drivers<00:01:57.909> and

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
snow ship which protected drivers and

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.060 
snow ship which protected drivers and
the<00:01:58.149> highway<00:01:58.359> from<00:01:58.570> avalanches<00:01:59.079> that<00:01:59.920> may

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
the highway from avalanches that may

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.830 
the highway from avalanches that may
have<00:02:00.189> worked<00:02:00.219> back<00:02:00.579> then<00:02:00.609> but<00:02:01.119> about<00:02:01.299> 20<00:02:01.689> years

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
have worked back then but about 20 years

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.050 
have worked back then but about 20 years
later<00:02:02.079> when<00:02:02.439> crews<00:02:02.679> expanded<00:02:03.280> i-90<00:02:03.700> from<00:02:03.880> two

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
later when crews expanded i-90 from two

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.880 
later when crews expanded i-90 from two
to<00:02:04.210> four<00:02:04.390> lanes<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:05.140> snow<00:02:05.380> shed<00:02:05.619> didn't

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
to four lanes the snow shed didn't

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.590 
to four lanes the snow shed didn't
expand<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.399> accommodate<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.939> new<00:02:07.060> interstate

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
expand to accommodate the new interstate

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.510 
expand to accommodate the new interstate
which<00:02:08.170> meant<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.530> only<00:02:08.800> cover<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.160> westbound

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
which meant and only cover the westbound

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.000 
which meant and only cover the westbound
lanes<00:02:09.820> and<00:02:10.030> still<00:02:10.420> does<00:02:10.660> now<00:02:10.929> more<00:02:11.500> than<00:02:11.620> 50

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
lanes and still does now more than 50

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.100 
lanes and still does now more than 50
years<00:02:12.220> later<00:02:12.460> did<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.210> mention<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.630> snow<00:02:13.840> shed

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
years later did I mention the snow shed

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.620 
years later did I mention the snow shed
sits<00:02:14.380> in<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.530> prime<00:02:14.770> avalanche<00:02:15.250> zone<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:16.450> this

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
sits in a prime avalanche zone so this

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.600 
sits in a prime avalanche zone so this
time<00:02:16.840> with<00:02:17.140> yet<00:02:17.320> another<00:02:17.470> expansion<00:02:18.070> we're

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
time with yet another expansion we're

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.040 
time with yet another expansion we're
going<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.819> tear<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.120> whole<00:02:19.239> thing<00:02:19.510> down<00:02:19.720> and

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
going to tear the whole thing down and

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.199 
going to tear the whole thing down and
start<00:02:20.260> over<00:02:20.409> with<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.739> brand<00:02:21.099> new<00:02:21.220> wider<00:02:21.730> longer

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
start over with a brand new wider longer

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.880 
start over with a brand new wider longer
structure<00:02:22.659> which<00:02:23.140> will<00:02:23.319> reduce<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.769> amount

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
structure which will reduce the amount

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.480 
structure which will reduce the amount

it<00:02:38.780> very<00:02:38.840> difficult<00:02:39.109> to<00:02:39.590> cross<00:02:39.829> the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
it very difficult to cross the

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.979 
it very difficult to cross the

dangerous<00:02:42.469> and<00:02:42.680> costly<00:02:42.889> collisions<00:02:43.670> we're

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
dangerous and costly collisions we're

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.550 
dangerous and costly collisions we're
going<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.239> build<00:02:44.389> wildlife<00:02:44.810> crossings<00:02:45.260> like

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
going to build wildlife crossings like

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.649 
going to build wildlife crossings like
bridges<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.099> large<00:02:46.250> culverts<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:47.180> Eddie<00:02:47.450> and

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
bridges and large culverts so Eddie and

currently these areas are a little
cramped<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:13.459> can<00:03:13.669> get<00:03:13.790> very<00:03:13.969> congested<00:03:14.449> which

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
cramped and can get very congested which

can<00:03:14.989> be<00:03:15.109> dangerous<00:03:15.319> so<00:03:16.099> we're<00:03:16.400> going<00:03:16.519> to<00:03:16.639> make

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
can be dangerous so we're going to make

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.610 
can be dangerous so we're going to make
them<00:03:16.849> bigger<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.299> give<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.599> some<00:03:17.780> more<00:03:17.989> room

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
them bigger and give you some more room
