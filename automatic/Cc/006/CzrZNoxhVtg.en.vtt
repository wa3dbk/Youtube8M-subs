00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.760
 have been five minutes of respectful silence 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.520
 family friends and neighbors of the deceased have come to this 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.469
 concentration with faces of consternation 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.639
 Hanging from the balcony of the town hall a black crepe 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:19.179
 and on the fountain a bouquet of flowers in mourning and in support of 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.019
 families 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.590
 and according to those who know them, they face these hours with authentic 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:24.689
 bitterness 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.109
 they have been very hard all over the world been 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.820
 scared I do not know 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.489
 because it has been tremendous the impact has been 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.140
 crazy 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.070
 then clear the population colors like this one of 500 thousand inhabitants 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.610
 and with so many dead 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.620
 it's a very fat impact 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.420
 the young people of jadraque the most affected 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.780
 they can not talk 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.790
 everyone knew each other and the impact of the news has left them speechless 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.470
 pain 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.170
 for families for friends seem to be excited 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.620
 respect the world 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.620
 around the world 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.580
 and now without knowing the relatives 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.090
 what they have suffered 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.570
 that's the most credible thing yet they have not known how they died on the spot 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.860
 because apparently the car appeared and they do not know if 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.770
 that's the most permeable now for the relatives 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.040
 this morning the town hall celebrated an extraordinary plenary session in which 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.130
 approved five days of official mourning 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.000
 for the death of the four young people between 18 and 24 years old 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.700
 three of them neighbors of jadraque never fourth who had come to town to 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.850
 spend the weekend 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.700
 They picked up the bodies and took them to Guadalajara to start the tests 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.649
 yesterday they had to make the decision 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.649
 samples for the bn parents to the three families 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.350
 I think the family of madrid came to Guadalajara 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.160
 as well as in the tests 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.870
 i news xinhua 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.780
 the town hall has been made available to families for 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.899
 organize a joint burning chapel 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.789
 in principle the house of culture water flow is to be determined reason 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.549
 precisely because you do not know how long you can extend the tests of 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.580
 arenys 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.040
 meanwhile a whole town tries to take on the consequences of this 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.140
 tragic traffic accident that has left five families destroyed
