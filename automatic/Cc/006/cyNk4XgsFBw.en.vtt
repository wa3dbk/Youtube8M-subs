the new fuel pump but when i pulled the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
Flakes box that my dad evidently I'm

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.250 
Flakes box that my dad evidently I'm
guessing<00:03:37.030> of<00:03:37.510> course<00:03:37.570> he<00:03:37.870> didn't<00:03:38.110> buy<00:03:38.200> the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
guessing of course he didn't buy the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.030 
guessing of course he didn't buy the
tractor<00:03:38.710> new<00:03:38.920> but<00:03:39.190> I'm<00:03:39.310> figuring<00:03:39.670> he<00:03:40.380> he<00:03:41.380> he

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
tractor new but I'm figuring he he he

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.710 
tractor new but I'm figuring he he he
put<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.310> fuel<00:03:42.550> pump<00:03:42.760> on<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:43.000> at<00:03:43.210> one<00:03:43.360> point<00:03:43.570> in

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
put a fuel pump on it at one point in

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.520 
put a fuel pump on it at one point in
time<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.530> years<00:03:44.980> that<00:03:45.190> he<00:03:45.340> had<00:03:45.580> it<00:03:46.170> he<00:03:47.170> got<00:03:47.380> in

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
time the years that he had it he got in

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.930 
time the years that he had it he got in
the<00:03:47.590> middle<00:03:47.710> of<00:03:47.920> changing<00:03:48.130> one<00:03:48.460> out<00:03:48.670> and

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
the middle of changing one out and

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.020 
the middle of changing one out and
actually<00:03:49.450> cut<00:03:50.110> open<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.500> frosted<00:03:50.950> flakes<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.520> box

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
actually cut open a frosted flakes a box

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.020 
actually cut open a frosted flakes a box
and<00:03:52.390> used<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:53.020> to<00:03:53.650> sandwich<00:03:54.400> in<00:03:54.610> between<00:03:54.910> the

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
and used that to sandwich in between the

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.710 
and used that to sandwich in between the
engine<00:03:55.240> block<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.620> fuel<00:03:56.830> pump<00:03:57.070> so<00:03:57.720> anyway

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
engine block and the fuel pump so anyway

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.330

to<00:04:00.550> go<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.940> parts<00:04:01.210> store<00:04:01.240> to<00:04:01.540> get<00:04:01.630> apart<00:04:01.990> I

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
to go to the parts store to get apart I

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.000 
to go to the parts store to get apart I
say<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.220> stuff<00:04:03.430> i'm<00:04:03.580> using<00:04:03.940> here<00:04:03.970> is<00:04:05.010> it's

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
just basically a sheet fiber paper that

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.770 
just basically a sheet fiber paper that
we<00:04:09.580> use<00:04:09.820> it<00:04:10.030> at<00:04:10.870> work<00:04:10.930> and<00:04:12.330> if<00:04:13.330> I<00:04:13.420> didn't<00:04:13.690> have

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
now I mean if you're talking about a

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.520 
now I mean if you're talking about a
head<00:04:42.729> gasket<00:04:42.940> that's<00:04:43.389> a<00:04:43.510> whole<00:04:43.660> nother<00:04:43.690> ball

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
head gasket that's a whole nother ball

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.500 
head gasket that's a whole nother ball
of<00:04:44.740> wax<00:04:44.949> but<00:04:45.280> something<00:04:45.669> on<00:04:45.760> a<00:04:45.790> water<00:04:46.060> pump<00:04:46.270> or

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
of wax but something on a water pump or

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.980 
of wax but something on a water pump or
a<00:04:46.540> fuel<00:04:46.780> pump<00:04:47.070> is<00:04:48.419> something<00:04:49.419> like<00:04:49.570> this<00:04:49.750> is

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
a fuel pump is something like this is

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.159 
a fuel pump is something like this is
it's<00:04:50.500> perfect<00:04:51.040> like<00:04:51.520> say<00:04:51.760> something<00:04:52.180> you<00:04:53.139> know

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
it's perfect like say something you know

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.040 
it's perfect like say something you know
something<00:04:53.560> that<00:04:54.430> has<00:04:54.580> torque<00:04:54.970> torque<00:04:55.540> values

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
something that has torque torque values

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.250 
something that has torque torque values
involved<00:04:56.620> like<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.800> head<00:04:57.070> gasket<00:04:57.310> or<00:04:58.260> intake

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
involved like a head gasket or intake

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.870 
involved like a head gasket or intake
manifold<00:04:59.740> gasket<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:00.370> wouldn't<00:05:00.729> really

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
manifold gasket I wouldn't really

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.790 
manifold gasket I wouldn't really
recommend<00:05:01.000> this<00:05:02.010> but<00:05:03.510> but<00:05:04.510> in<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:05.169> and<00:05:05.500> a<00:05:05.590> grid

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
recommend this but but in a and a grid

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.219 
recommend this but but in a and a grid
down<00:05:06.039> where<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:06.940> couldn't<00:05:07.150> find<00:05:07.479> it<00:05:07.660> it's

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
down where you couldn't find it it's

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.129 
down where you couldn't find it it's
still<00:05:08.560> an<00:05:08.650> option<00:05:08.860> so<00:05:09.490> anyway<00:05:10.389> guys<00:05:10.570> take<00:05:11.110> care

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
still an option so anyway guys take care

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.139 
still an option so anyway guys take care
y'all<00:05:11.740> have<00:05:11.860> a<00:05:11.889> good<00:05:12.070> one<00:05:12.720> Jason<00:05:13.720> out
