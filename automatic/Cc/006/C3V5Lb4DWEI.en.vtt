00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
plastic containers that I already use

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.800 
plastic containers that I already use
for<00:01:40.740> portion<00:01:41.159> size<00:01:41.400> from<00:01:41.790> my<00:01:42.030> farm<00:01:42.420> from<00:01:42.659> my

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
for portion size from my farm from my

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.609 
for portion size from my farm from my
fruit<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.320> there's<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> good<00:01:44.640> idea<00:01:45.229> about<00:01:46.229> how<00:01:46.380> I

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
fruit so there's a good idea about how I

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.860 
fruit so there's a good idea about how I
typically<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.930> is

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
typically do this is

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.980 
typically do this is
I<00:01:51.130> will<00:01:52.130> typically<00:01:52.580> put<00:01:52.850> all<00:01:53.000> of<00:01:53.030> my<00:01:53.180> fruit<00:01:53.660> and

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
I will typically put all of my fruit and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.360 
I will typically put all of my fruit and
I<00:01:54.050> can<00:01:54.230> actually<00:01:54.410> probably<00:01:54.800> feel<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:54.980> bit<00:01:55.190> more

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
I can actually probably feel a bit more

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.930 
I can actually probably feel a bit more
in<00:01:55.520> there<00:01:56.140> into<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.830> purple<00:01:58.220> container<00:01:58.670> and

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
in there into the purple container and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.460 
in there into the purple container and
this<00:01:59.180> I<00:01:59.390> just<00:01:59.690> have<00:01:59.870> grapes<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.380> strawberries

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
this I just have grapes and strawberries

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.520 
this I just have grapes and strawberries
and<00:02:01.310> then<00:02:02.060> what<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.300> do<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.870> make<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.110> super<00:02:03.290> easy

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
and then what I do to make it super easy

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.200 
and then what I do to make it super easy
since<00:02:03.920> we<00:02:04.160> only<00:02:04.310> have<00:02:04.430> one<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.760> containers

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
since we only have one the containers

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.400 
since we only have one the containers
sucks<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.690> containers<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:06.230> you<00:02:06.290> can

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
sucks the containers and you can

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.260 
sucks the containers and you can
obviously<00:02:06.500> get<00:02:06.950> more<00:02:07.010> is<00:02:07.430> I<00:02:07.850> just<00:02:07.910> start

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
obviously get more is I just start

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.810 
obviously get more is I just start
putting<00:02:08.540> it<00:02:08.750> into<00:02:08.899> other<00:02:09.410> containers<00:02:10.160> so<00:02:10.670> that

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
putting it into other containers so that

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.940 
putting it into other containers so that
way<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.030> know<00:02:11.270> that<00:02:11.540> I'm<00:02:11.900> getting<00:02:12.290> my<00:02:12.500> serving

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
way I know that I'm getting my serving

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.020 
way I know that I'm getting my serving
size<00:02:13.280> for<00:02:14.030> my<00:02:14.930> fruits<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.070> I<00:02:16.550> do<00:02:16.610> that

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
size for my fruits and I do that

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.480 
size for my fruits and I do that
continuously<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.440> just<00:02:18.770> do<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.340> then

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
continuously so I just do that and then

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.400 
continuously so I just do that and then
I<00:02:19.580> open<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.300> continue<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.020> just<00:02:21.200> keep

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
I open it and I continue to just keep

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.370 
I open it and I continue to just keep
going<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:21.860> just<00:02:22.190> brought<00:02:22.370> four<00:02:22.700> out<00:02:23.140> for<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.230> to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.040 
going I just brought four out for you to
see<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.280> continue<00:02:26.060> with<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.630> so<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.020> I

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
see I just continue with that so that I

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.200 
see I just continue with that so that I
