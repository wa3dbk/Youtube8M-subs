00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.770
 so we just converted our 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.840
 black and white image using the 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.000
 layer mixer so how 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.650
 works and what is the mixer 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.380
 of layers makes it the mixer of 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.380
 layers uses a number of 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.720
 color channels to apply more or 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.150
 less contrast to each of these 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.090
 channels which you can see here in the 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.660
 sign that we have an orange red channel 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.200
 yellow green blue blue green purple and 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.270
 magenta 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.820
 when you pull the sliders towards the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.800
 left we darkened the concerned channel 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.560
 when pulled to the right 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.600
 the light one can see in this 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.120
 original photo which is predominantly 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.370
 composed of warm tones was the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.790
 red of the oranje of the orange yellow of the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.590
 brown 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.150
 so see what happens in black and 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.090
 white for example if I take the 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.700
 red slider and that I move it to 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.430
 bottom to the left saw I strengthen 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.930
 the density of the shirt 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.080
 the problem is that I start 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.930
 also to act on the skin of my 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.240
 little model and look I'm going to push 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.240
 the cursor a little bit further yeah 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.330
 so we start seeing artifacts 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.520
 not very aesthetic of course if 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.070
 you resume the mixer settings 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.690
 diapers to work on your photo 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.880
 is still very careful about what 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.560
 you do is not going too much 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.090
 in the extremes now I'm going 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.090
 move my cursor 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.090
 see the same thing I clear if the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.850
 red channel but happened to a certain 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.189
 point I will also introduce 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.780
 artifacts and defects at the level of 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.750
 image details 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.840
 same thing for the orange see I 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.320
 will act on the skin of my little 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.409
 model 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.200
 so here I darken the skin color 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.180
 and on the right I clear it then what 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.640
 can serve these settings well and 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.909
 for example here with the orange slider 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.100
 I may give back a little more radiance 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.319
 in the skin compared to the settings 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.239
 propose automatically by 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.520
 layer mixer for example if I 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.340
 click on the automatic button 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.239
 like this I find the setting 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.310
 original 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.019
 now I take my orange cursor 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.019
 and I move it slightly 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.120
 to the right to lighten the power 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.489
 not too much because of the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.310
 artifacts we will see what gives the 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.040
 yellow cursor so to the left 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.750
 we see almost no difference 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.010
 and to the right no longer so there 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.310
 apparently it's not a setting 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.800
 essential like we have very little green 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.530
 and blue in the picture so we will not 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.350
 can really act on these channels 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.960
 on the other hand if I take the purple 1 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.790
 I move to the left I also act at 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.790
 level of skin and hair 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.050
 same for the magenta so see the 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.260
 Junk rovi squarely dark spots 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.630
 in the skin when my setting and at 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.720
 -100 so an extreme setting well 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.880
 obviously so in fact with this mixture 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.550
 hours of diapers you leave the 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.590
 proposal made from the outset by lightroom 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.200
 to black and white conversion and then 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.150
 you can very well adjust the 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.670
 different color channels to your 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.110
 way and for example if I go on a 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.569
 image with hues completely 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.280
 different like this 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.870
 we will also create a copy 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.879
 Virtual 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.959
 so we have mostly blues 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.909
 and yellows 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.819
 so I make my conversion to black and 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.280
 White 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.620
 my red cursor has hardly 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.420
 moved simply because there is 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.630
 no red or not really red 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.700
 in this picture 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.850
 same thing for purple is the 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.850
 magenta by cons we have a lot of blue 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.930
 if we do not act on the green blue then 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.640
 we do not really have any influence on the 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.890
 heaven on the other hand if I take the cursor 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.530
 bruises that remained to him as such 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.590
 there I go to his shining blue the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.840
 sky of course and right 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.690
 I will clear it up 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.310
 so that's roughly the way of 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.100
 operation of the layer mixer 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.040
 you can use either the sliders 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.630
 is the tool of targeted adjustments that we 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.550
 little active by clicking on the small 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.740
 disc which is left in the 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.510
 panel so little demonstration I'm 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.430
 place in the blue sky 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.250
 you can see that it's the blue channel 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.370
 that will be activated and now I 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.350
 go down the mouse 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.980
 to darken the sky 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.870
 or I go back there 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.880
 to clear it up then 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.950
 the disadvantage if I use the mouse 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.050
 with this tool it is that the slider 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.330
 disappears from the image then there is another 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.140
 method that I find more effective and 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.390
 more pleasant 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.170
 it's using the up and down arrows 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.750
 of the keyboard 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.660
 so here I'm going to darken the sky with 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.180
 the ma key on the keyboard so see to 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.420
 the picture what's going on and look at the 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.729
 blue cursor on the left that moves 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.029
 no 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:21.339
 step by step to the dark and if I 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:21.339
 take the keyboard up arrow 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.570
 so if my cursor moves to the 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.060
 clear like these and do not forget 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.280
 not that you can reset the 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.920
 layer mixer settings 1 for 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.330
 back to what the module offers you 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.300
 development simply by 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.970
 clicking the automatic button 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.830
 that's back to the black conversion 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.930
 and default blanks proposed by the 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.030
 software so the diaper mixer 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.280
 is actually a tool that is extremely 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.960
 powerful that will allow you 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.850
 to balance the contrasts in your 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.550
 image according to the color channels 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.250
 and of course if you feel a 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.590
 exploratory soul or artistic you 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.780
 can apply all the settings that 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.280
 you want to go for the extremes 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.440
 so here we have a tool that is 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.290
 particularly flexible and do not forget 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.720
 that it will be all the more effective if 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.700
 you work with a raw file that 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.220
 contains the maximum amount of information 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.380
 can be exploited at this level 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.720
 with a jpeg you would be much more 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.620
 limited in magnitude of corrections 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.620
 that you can do
