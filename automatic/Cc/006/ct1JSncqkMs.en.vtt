 needlewomen by popular demand 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:21.680
 I bring to your attention the process 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.970
 knitting baby pullover this 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:31.000

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.840
 centimeters in length this pullover 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:44.660
 I turned 34 centimeters in 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.230
 unstretched about tone 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:52.310
 lying 52 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:01:01.309
 while this pattern is soft and good 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:05.440
 stretches for knitting i use yarn 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:09.290
 one hundred percent mercerized cotton 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.530
 260 meters per hundred grams per pullover 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:21.320
 it took me almost straight . this is what 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:25.720
 left for knitting i use knitting needles 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.200
 number two knitting gum 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:34.369

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:40.220
 main pattern i use knitting needles number 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:45.920
 3 and for knitting sleeves I use 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.500
 needles number two and a half also in 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:54.020
 the work process will definitely come in handy 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.520
 markers for tying the neck I 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.119
 I use hook number 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.119
 one and a half 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.720
 three buttons scissors and needle 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.990
 this process knitting pullover you 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.830
 can take as a basis that is 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:24.260
 changing the pattern itself the main can you 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:27.650
 choose some other in this place 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:32.830
 can be made from this and from this side 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.830
 buttons that unfasten and 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.830
 clasped 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.560
 the process of knitting a pullover I broke into 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.700
 four steps 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.930
 first step to then knitting forehand second 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.260
 step knitting backless third step knitting 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:03.230
 sleeveless and the fourth step is of course 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:06.829
 assembling tying the neck each one 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:12.019
 step I singled out in a separate video lesson 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:16.459
 but certainly before the start knitting bind 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:21.980
 the sample itself on those needles that 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.049
 will perform the pullover itself so 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.260
 arm yourself 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.260
 knitting yarn do not start knitting
