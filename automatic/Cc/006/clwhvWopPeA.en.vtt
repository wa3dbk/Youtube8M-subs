 to work with rings with pins and 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.790
 with all the other fittings you 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.189
 optional need to be necessary 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.610
 tool and 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.049
 this nippers pay attention to 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.000
 couscous glasses are best to buy exactly 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.649
 budgets of different stores because 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.850
 construction nippers need you will 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:28.020
 cut off their sharp end 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.040
 from this slice in these jewelry pieces 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.310
 the end is straight and you can't hurt yourself 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.570
 Then there are you here too, in side cutters 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.969
 can use the most used 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.070
 to work with wire on 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:47.189
 round pliers need them 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.969
 so that you can bend over here 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.570
 so here 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:55.670
 make a pin if you have left 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:58.619
 here is some kind of smooth track 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.289
 there is a tool then here are two in one then 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.560
 here and round pliers and nippers either 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:07.340
 Separately just nippers yet such

 tool as pliers and narrowly merchants 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.460
 there are also two in the same garden with nippers 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:15.010
 They differ in the fact that pliers 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.680
 they have a wide nose at a piece of lips itself narrow 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.360
 spout it is better to work but again 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.260
 if you will be working with wire you can 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.300
 use these you corruption so 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.700
 further analyze to do 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.090
 some product kit is required 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.580
 we need hooks, hooks, there are hooks 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.540
 common most common too 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.450

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.820
 there are fasteners with and platform they can 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.760
 use even for pouring under 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.540
 large epoxy resin small 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.550
 Carnations can also be used under 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.660
 fill 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.400
 there are clips there are such rings 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.030
 further material needed tool 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.960
 fittings 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.970
 this is a ring of rings that is again 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.380
 still there are different very simple that 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.380
 such here from the platform to which later 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.570
 glued that there is such here 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.190
 big ones are smaller too 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:18.610
 use under epoxy potting 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:20.590
 I can eat there is a fishnet ring 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.810
 here are such with stains and of them possible 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.930
 make beautiful volume which is 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.670
 ring with beads miss flowers 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.290
 more necessary and that the house for 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:39.250
 this carbines then angles in order to 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:40.240
 to collect a bracelet of such an example 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.220
 necessary and 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.440
 this is a clamp for tapes if you will 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.990
 work with ribbons and decks and for laying 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:54.550
 fishing line still needed 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:57.550
 accessories you this hairpins they also have 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.960
 different there is an automatic there are such here 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.060
 too which can be used under 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.260
 fill without brooch two in one 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.890
 here is such here so here such 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:13.660
 small automation in general large 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:17.650
 variety you are already picking up your 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:23.590
 fantasy what you want to do 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:26.289
 further we need hugs again 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.979
 they are so different from different colors 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:32.110
 different shapes for this make them 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.850
 Here is a plan for this 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.639
 to make the bead look a lot 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.710
 more beautiful now we will demonstrate how it is 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.410
 can do 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.780
 let's say and take now the carnation on 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.160
 he put on a bead they first do not 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:51.300
 bead first we dress hugs 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:59.320
 for cinema beads in this way 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:05:11.130
 the middle of the thrust wide air 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:14.560
 wide fit then dress bead 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.130
 again we put on top hugs for 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.130
 key beads 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.750
 here and so we get pliers 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.520
 carefully bite off the excess 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.140
 pins extra air left 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.480
 somewhere around a centimeter can 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.530
 be a little bit bigger 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.770
 We hold that the bank did not fly away for 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:39.540
 bit off here so here we 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.540
 turned out and twists round pliers 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.560
 close neatly take shifts. 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:55.450
 dress and close can be used 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.060
 round nose pliers like i can use uz 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.200
 uz corruption to close here with us 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:08.320
 it turned out like this 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:10.810
 ear ring middle on second immediately if 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.330
 you make a bracelet then you should 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.610
 do not use carnations in the bracelet 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.160
 we have here and here pins 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.340
 so that you can bead between 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.360
 you will be like this 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.360
 Here is a beautiful bracelet 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.920
 so what else do you need for 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:34.810
 there are works here such brooches 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.830
 pins were thrown if such a plan 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.720
 There is an order such here under the fill 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.810
 all very diverse there is very 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.810
 lot 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.750
 bases for decoration 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:59.140
 here are such here if such ones 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:07:01.120
 you can even make a pendant right away 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.020
 the problem is this special 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.410
 pendant base 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:07.180
 we have it copper and the floor us 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.830
 bronze that is, look carefully 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.590
 to you all the fittings were a 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:14.560
 colors to hang the base for 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:17.260
 pendant on the course itself we are here here 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:21.870
 unbend carefully with pliers 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:27.130
 or narrow scars dress our pendant 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:29.370
 holding it and neatly bend 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.990
 shutting down 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.640
 in this way, this is our 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.330
 the pendant will hold very 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:39.700
 good beautiful 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.770

 Suspension can be collected and such a 

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:07.600
 bracelet here too is a chain of beads

 hanging lock it 

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:17.590
 carabiner like ours 

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.640
