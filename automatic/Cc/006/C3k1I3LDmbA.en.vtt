00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 since my last beauty favorites 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.410
 video have some products again 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.780
 I accumulated thought to myself I'll show you 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.219
 Today, a lot of fun catch others 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.719
 the lipstick I wear today and 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.150
 Although the case is a dream of the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.830
 velvet him free i know is slow 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.510
 pretty discredited due to 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.600
 various scandals there you will find 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.609
 Massively on the internet yes that 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.160
 I still love product x 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.099
 is the color red velvet and it stops 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.949
 Just such a tree red and it lasts forever 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.219
 be called eats or drinks something 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.809
 finished then it runs on the corners 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.989
 pretty much out and you look a bit 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.450
 out of joker otherwise he really holds 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.489
 bombproof overtime then if you 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.980
 somehow water drinks or something 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.309
 then he still keeps really good 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.940
 and yes it is super difficult 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.410
 something great vegan in red for 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.559
 to get the lips because everywhere 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.879
 There is a fireplace in it or beeswax in it 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.489
 and that's why I'm pretty happy 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.809
 that I have that and I want them on 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.570
 do not miss any more case 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.150
 the next product is nothing of that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.619
 a lipp reimer and that is me in the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.840
 very close to my heart last week 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.310
 I've grown, I've never had it 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.020
 what stopped by these lipp prime 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.400
 because I always humbug that makes us 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.150
 the lips are only much drier than my lips 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.310
 they are actually 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.200
 But I have to say that makes the lips 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.820
 so supple and holds the lipstick 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.400
 Much better on that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.950
 and yes, I do not want to miss that anymore 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.770
 and another live product of nothing 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.110
 the junkie thanks it is such a big one 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.720
 Lipstick somehow gave it away 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.030
 and so what ever these big ones 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.890
 donator easy to apply on the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.990
 lips and he does not have that right now 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.700
 really much opacity but receives 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.649
 actually so for this creamy 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.570
 consistency just fine and the color 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.450
 I like that very, very much 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.310
 and yes, something else is really different 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.350
 so nude colors i wear otherwise 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.170
 Actually more like that 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.369
 Today he also wear something red but 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.960
 sometimes it has to be a bit 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.210
 with central are just for work 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.530
 sometimes I like it very much and 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.159
 that's where a product comes to me 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.320
 located 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.550
 then we continue with products 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.600
 my products were totally total 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.130
 forget and then 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.170
 my make up myself again 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.120
 discovered that gives me a little bit 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.830
 How much do I think then how much make-up 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.650
 actually have and have accumulated 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.730
 over the last few years but i had so 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.020
 a bit the sought after 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.190
 animal-free cosmetics and is there 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.750
 nothing league again fall into the eye 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.100
 Instead of the moment I had at that time 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.230
 a bit of something in england too 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.870
 smeet ordered is partly set 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.360
 in the same color cord and have the 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.690
 I also like it today and I like it 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.660
 just super super good and 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.700
 he makes a natural beep on 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.620
 the cheek and I am otherwise 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.200
 actually such a pink blush girl 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.260
 but I like it very well right now 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.810
 also in combination with the sleep account 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.970
 kit today I have on the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.980
 banks in any case the contour color 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.030
 I do not care about the insiders 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.460
 I will not be right in mine 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.410
 next favorite yet but the 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.890
 I do not like color very well 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.770
 too fast not so quickly but I know 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.110

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.360

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.540
 account powder like but still I 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.510

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.760
 Cruelty free is better and that 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.820
 next product for the wall is 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.590

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.640

 it is really so disco on the 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.330
 It is so difficult but great 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.100
 nice and just when the weather when the 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.230
 sun shines a reflected light 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.270

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.120

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:50.220

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.730
