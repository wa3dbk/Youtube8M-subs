00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.630 
taking damage my golems are in the
middle<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> golems<00:01:25.110> were<00:01:25.290> smart<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
middle so the golems were smart but the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.030 
middle so the golems were smart but the
golems<00:01:26.970> can't<00:01:27.330> destroy<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.290> town<00:01:28.500> hall<00:01:28.740> what

golems can't destroy that town hall what

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.700 
golems can't destroy that town hall what
is<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.340> point<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> goal<00:01:30.119> white<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
is the point with the goal white so the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.380 
is the point with the goal white so the
pickup<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.400> Pekka<00:01:32.700> almost<00:01:33.030> went<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
pickup one Pekka almost went for the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.450 
pickup one Pekka almost went for the
inside<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:34.049> then<00:01:34.530> he<00:01:34.650> went<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.040> outside

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
inside but then he went for the outside

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.280 
inside but then he went for the outside
so<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.880> helped<00:01:36.210> my<00:01:36.329> pekka's<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> rage

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
so it helped my pekka's with a rage

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.200 
so it helped my pekka's with a rage
spell<00:01:37.500> hoping<00:01:38.159> they<00:01:38.280> would<00:01:38.430> go<00:01:38.579> back<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:39.090> the

spell hoping they would go back for the
inside<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.890> they<00:01:41.640> actually<00:01:41.939> went<00:01:42.720> back<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
inside and they actually went back to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.440 
inside and they actually went back to
the<00:01:43.320> inside<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.130> helps<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.670> lot<00:01:44.880> i<00:01:45.000> McQueen
