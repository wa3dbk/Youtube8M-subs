00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.620
 In you, I saw the imprint of this difficult war. 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.540
 I mean, look at the guy’s jealousy, super scary 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.480
 If we fail tonight 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.380
 Unfortunately 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.260
 Because this battle will not end until next week. 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.840
 Skynet sent the Terminator before the war 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.140
 Kill my mother 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.440
 Sarah Connor 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.720
 The beginning of S is so cold! 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.640
 Chief, let me save her. 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.760
 I spend about 5 minutes every night to "study" the photos you gave me. 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.080
 So I should be able to recognize her. 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.960
 What do you want to do? 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.560
 End the war 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.440
 Do you know that you are holding my OO? 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.579
 My hand is here 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.240
 I still wonder how you hold the light so lightly. 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.060
 Hey, there are so many places to go... 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.120
 She was very weak, fearful and hungry at the time. 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.780
 Help me take care of her, Kyle 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.660
 If you don't want to die, come with me! 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.580
 Soldier, fast action 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.840
 Ok, I am coming. 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.440
 Oh, actually, don’t shoot my legs. 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.740
 The reality that John sent you back is no longer there. 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.920
 Everything has changed 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.360
 Like, I don't like men anymore. 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.420
 Oh, I hate this timeline. 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.840
 I still like it very much. 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.840
 I've been waiting for you 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.400
 Do you think that you are stronger than me just because you are 30 years younger than me? 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.860
 Ready to taste the failure, the reckless young man 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.300
 If you want to surrender 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.480
 Let's talk now! 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.540
 John, mom. 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.060
 How will you be here 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.660
 This? In fact, I am a Terminator. 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.060
 Spoiler 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.780
 Don't be shy, I am also a Terminator 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.520
 Judgment Day 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.520
 Well, this is a bit embarrassing because... 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.460
 I am Chapi! I am still alive! 

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.000
 Hey! Isn’t all the people here really real people? 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.620
 Is this in the end? 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.940
 I am a real person. 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.760
 I will return 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.820
 clam? 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.780
 Why no one told me that there is a second helicopter below 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.040
 Now I know why they call it "choppers". 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.160
 Because he cut me off (chop)! 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.740
 I.. I have other jokes. 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.920
 Do you know what the terminator living on the ocean floor is called? 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.920
 Divers (Mer-minator)! 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.900
 latent... 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.580
 Well, I used all my energy for that joke. 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.620
 And that’s not funny at all.
