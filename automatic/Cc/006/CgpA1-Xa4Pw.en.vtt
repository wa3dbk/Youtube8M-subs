one<00:00:35.180> of<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:35.329> questions<00:00:35.720> that<00:00:35.809> I<00:00:35.900> hear

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
one of the questions that I hear

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.470 
one of the questions that I hear
absolutely<00:00:36.500> most<00:00:37.309> frequently<00:00:37.760> is<00:00:37.940> how<00:00:37.970> can<00:00:38.450> I

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
absolutely most frequently is how can I

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.400 
absolutely most frequently is how can I
make<00:00:38.720> intarsia

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
make intarsia

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.350 
make intarsia
easier<00:00:39.739> if<00:00:40.340> you<00:00:40.460> come<00:00:40.670> on<00:00:40.790> in<00:00:40.970> with<00:00:41.120> me<00:00:41.270> I've

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
easier if you come on in with me I've

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.549 
easier if you come on in with me I've
got<00:00:41.540> a<00:00:41.570> little<00:00:41.809> in<00:00:41.900> charge<00:00:42.140> a<00:00:42.260> swatch<00:00:42.530> that

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
got a little in charge a swatch that

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.950 
got a little in charge a swatch that
I've<00:00:42.800> been<00:00:42.920> working<00:00:43.250> on<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:44.390> it<00:00:44.540> target<00:00:44.900> is

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
I've been working on and it target is

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.600 
I've been working on and it target is
one<00:00:45.079> of<00:00:45.140> those<00:00:45.260> really<00:00:45.590> great<00:00:46.040> techniques

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
one of those really great techniques

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.680 
one of those really great techniques
that<00:00:46.850> there's<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:47.210> much<00:00:47.390> creative

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
that there's so much creative

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.530 
that there's so much creative
possibility<00:00:48.440> with<00:00:48.620> but<00:00:49.070> it<00:00:49.400> has<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:50.059> be<00:00:50.090> said

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
possibility with but it has to be said

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.630 
possibility with but it has to be said
that<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:51.260> actual<00:00:51.590> mechanics<00:00:52.160> of<00:00:52.250> working<00:00:52.550> the

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
that the actual mechanics of working the

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.729 
that the actual mechanics of working the
technique<00:00:53.000> are<00:00:53.120> not<00:00:53.420> great<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:54.440> know<00:00:54.530> you've

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
technique are not great you know you've

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.799 
technique are not great you know you've
got<00:00:54.949> all<00:00:55.190> these<00:00:55.430> separate<00:00:56.000> strands<00:00:56.420> of<00:00:56.600> yarn

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
got all these separate strands of yarn

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.140 
got all these separate strands of yarn
that<00:00:57.260> you're<00:00:57.410> using<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:58.100> twisting<00:00:58.610> at<00:00:58.820> the

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
that you're using and twisting at the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.240 
that you're using and twisting at the
joints<00:00:59.600> to<00:00:59.989> create<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.530> separate<00:01:00.980> color

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
joints to create the separate color

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.430 
joints to create the separate color
blocks<00:01:01.610> of<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.239> separate<00:01:02.600> areas<00:01:03.019> of<00:01:03.200> color

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
blocks of the separate areas of color

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.190 
blocks of the separate areas of color
now<00:01:04.309> one<00:01:05.149> of<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.360> biggest<00:01:05.539> problems<00:01:05.960> is<00:01:06.080> that

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
now one of the biggest problems is that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.770 
now one of the biggest problems is that
your<00:01:06.380> yarns<00:01:06.920> get<00:01:07.280> very<00:01:07.640> tangled<00:01:07.970> up<00:01:08.270> because

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
your yarns get very tangled up because

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.540 
your yarns get very tangled up because
as<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.140> can<00:01:09.289> see<00:01:09.350> I'm<00:01:09.830> gonna<00:01:09.950> work<00:01:10.160> just<00:01:10.310> right

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
as you can see I'm gonna work just right

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.529 
as you can see I'm gonna work just right
across<00:01:10.759> my<00:01:10.880> row<00:01:11.180> here<00:01:12.399> you<00:01:13.399> know<00:01:13.490> as<00:01:13.670> every

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
across my row here you know as every

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.210 
across my row here you know as every
time<00:01:14.720> you<00:01:14.840> come<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.170> a<00:01:15.320> place<00:01:15.619> where<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:15.920> yarn

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
time you come to a place where the yarn

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
time you come to a place where the yarn
switches<00:01:16.759> color<00:01:17.350> you<00:01:18.350> need<00:01:18.590> to<00:01:18.800> twist<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:20.000> old

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
switches color you need to twist the old

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.990 
switches color you need to twist the old
color<00:01:20.690> over<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:21.380> new<00:01:21.560> color<00:01:21.800> before<00:01:22.580> you<00:01:22.700> drop

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
color over the new color before you drop

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.560 
color over the new color before you drop
it<00:01:23.210> in<00:01:23.420> order<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.320> get<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:24.770> nice<00:01:25.340> smooth<00:01:25.970> join

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
it in order to get a nice smooth join

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.480 
it in order to get a nice smooth join
between<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.170> colors<00:01:27.500> as<00:01:27.680> opposed<00:01:27.979> to<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.190> gap

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
between the colors as opposed to a gap

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.370 
between the colors as opposed to a gap
and<00:01:28.789> so<00:01:29.450> you've<00:01:29.600> got<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:29.929> you<00:01:30.020> end<00:01:30.200> up<00:01:30.259> with

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
and so you've got so you end up with

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.870 
and so you've got so you end up with
this<00:01:30.470> big<00:01:30.679> giant<00:01:30.860> tangled<00:01:31.280> mess<00:01:31.460> on<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.729> back

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
this big giant tangled mess on the back

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.980 
this big giant tangled mess on the back
of<00:01:32.030> your<00:01:32.149> auric<00:01:32.360> especially<00:01:32.810> if<00:01:32.899> you're

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
of your auric especially if you're

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.530 
of your auric especially if you're
working<00:01:33.140> with<00:01:33.350> several<00:01:33.679> colors<00:01:34.220> and<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:35.450> know

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
working with several colors and you know

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.999 
working with several colors and you know
there<00:01:35.689> are<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:35.840> lot<00:01:35.900> of<00:01:36.110> different<00:01:36.560> schools<00:01:36.770> of

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
there are a lot of different schools of

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.499 
there are a lot of different schools of
thought<00:01:37.220> on<00:01:37.430> kind<00:01:37.640> of<00:01:37.700> how<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:37.880> manage<00:01:38.479> your

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
thought on kind of how to manage your

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.539 
thought on kind of how to manage your
different<00:01:38.900> strands<00:01:39.500> of<00:01:39.680> yarn<00:01:39.920> how<00:01:40.220> to<00:01:40.280> deal

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
different strands of yarn how to deal

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.700 
different strands of yarn how to deal
with<00:01:40.759> all<00:01:40.939> that<00:01:40.970> one<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.960> my<00:01:42.140> favorite<00:01:42.530> things

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
with all that one of my favorite things

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.320 
with all that one of my favorite things
to<00:01:42.799> do<00:01:43.009> when<00:01:43.220> I'm<00:01:43.310> working<00:01:43.430> with<00:01:43.610> intarsia<00:01:44.030> is

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
to do when I'm working with intarsia is

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.960 
to do when I'm working with intarsia is
to<00:01:44.570> just<00:01:44.840> cut<00:01:45.200> out<00:01:45.409> all<00:01:45.979> of<00:01:46.040> those<00:01:46.520> trips<00:01:46.820> and

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
to just cut out all of those trips and

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.490 
to just cut out all of those trips and
techniques<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.420> just<00:01:47.479> stick<00:01:47.960> with<00:01:48.110> cutting

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
techniques and just stick with cutting

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.469 
techniques and just stick with cutting
just<00:01:48.650> one<00:01:48.979> yard<00:01:49.340> lengths<00:01:49.670> of<00:01:49.759> yarn<00:01:49.909> fairly

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
just one yard lengths of yarn fairly

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.210 
just one yard lengths of yarn fairly
short<00:01:50.750> lengths<00:01:50.990> of<00:01:51.110> yarn<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:51.799> then<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.070> can

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
short lengths of yarn and then you can

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.069 
short lengths of yarn and then you can
just<00:01:52.430> let<00:01:52.579> them<00:01:52.790> hang<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.360> tangle<00:01:53.780> as<00:01:53.930> they

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
just let them hang and tangle as they

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.530 
just let them hang and tangle as they
may<00:01:54.259> as<00:01:54.500> these<00:01:54.829> have<00:01:55.100> obviously<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:55.939> when<00:01:56.390> you

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
may as these have obviously and when you

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.929 
may as these have obviously and when you
need<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:57.049> every<00:01:57.409> once<00:01:57.590> in<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:57.770> while<00:01:57.799> just<00:01:58.100> go

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
need to every once in a while just go

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.899 
need to every once in a while just go
ahead<00:01:59.180> and<00:01:59.299> start<00:01:59.600> from<00:01:59.840> your<00:02:00.020> work<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.909> just
