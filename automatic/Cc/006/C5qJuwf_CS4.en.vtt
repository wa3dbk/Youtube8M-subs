 all very well today I told you a 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.290
 news regarding a meteorite that 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.439
 it looked like a plane on fire and it lit up 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.470
 the east coast in the USA more than 200 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:26.119
 sighting reports from 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.160
 at least 10 states like ohio maryland and 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.070
 until the South Carolina were 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.430
 collected by the meteorite society in 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.399
 us one of the resident witnesses in 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.410
 silver spring maryland said that the 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.080
 meteor looked like a burning plane that 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.480
 it was approaching it was like a huge tail 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.060
 fiery yellow that let loose 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.010
 about the city as he wrote another of 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.010
 eyewitnesses from virginia 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.930
 beach is to say that the society of 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.840
 meteors also traced exactly the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.960
 direction in which people saw 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.200
 approaching the meteorite that you have there 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.550
 the lines is a bit bland the lines 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.520
 red and green that you have 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.100
 others discovered and others described 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.320
 the meteor or meteor that appeared 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.480
 a little after seven o'clock 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.360
 last Thursday as a white wake 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.790
 blue or even green a similar event 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.580
 happened the night of last Monday and it was 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.400
 seen by at least 100 people from 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.610
 Maryland to the north of Connecticut 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.530
 the organization says that several thousands of 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.900
 meteorites that could be classified 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.910
 as fireballs enter the 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.950
 atmosphere every day but in the 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.320
 most of them go by without being seen because 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.820
 burn during the ride over 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.909
 oceans or uninhabited areas 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.750
 so it's not what I always tell you 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.370
 a lot of rocks client I walk in 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.290
 contact with our planet is 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.800
 disintegrated half way or fall to 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:58.030
 sea is therefore lucky or the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:02.200
 misfortune to be seen and was named and 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.330
 was spotted by several people so 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.700
 I hope you guys all interested 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.679

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.130
