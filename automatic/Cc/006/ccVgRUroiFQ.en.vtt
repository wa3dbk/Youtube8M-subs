here in the hens paren and clucking and

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.399 
here in the hens paren and clucking and
a<00:00:52.460> lot<00:00:52.729> of<00:00:52.850> soft<00:00:53.089> Colin<00:00:53.449> that's<00:00:53.930> what<00:00:54.170> you're

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
a lot of soft Colin that's what you're

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.560 
a lot of soft Colin that's what you're
gonna<00:00:54.619> adapt<00:00:55.549> to<00:00:55.820> that's<00:00:56.059> how<00:00:56.210> you're<00:00:56.449> gonna

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
gonna adapt to that's how you're gonna

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.750 
gonna adapt to that's how you're gonna
call<00:00:56.869> the<00:00:57.019> turkeys<00:00:57.379> because<00:00:57.530> that's<00:00:57.920> what's

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
call the turkeys because that's what's

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.180 
call the turkeys because that's what's
happened<00:00:59.150> in<00:00:59.330> the<00:00:59.510> woods<00:00:59.720> at<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.110> time<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.159> I

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
happened in the woods at that time so I

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.460 
happened in the woods at that time so I
think<00:01:01.339> it's<00:01:01.549> very<00:01:01.760> important<00:01:02.360> to<00:01:02.449> tune<00:01:03.170> in

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
think it's very important to tune in

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.890 
think it's very important to tune in
your<00:01:03.680> calling<00:01:04.309> with<00:01:04.610> what<00:01:04.909> you<00:01:05.089> see<00:01:05.360> happening

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
your calling with what you see happening

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.859 
your calling with what you see happening
in<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:06.140> woods<00:01:06.850> we<00:01:07.850> all<00:01:08.000> know<00:01:08.240> that<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.630> rut

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
in the woods we all know that the rut

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.440 
in the woods we all know that the rut
goes<00:01:09.229> in<00:01:09.439> different<00:01:09.799> stages<00:01:10.040> you<00:01:10.520> have<00:01:10.760> you

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
goes in different stages you have you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.840 
goes in different stages you have you
know<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.689> pre<00:01:11.930> rut<00:01:12.170> you<00:01:12.440> have<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:13.070> chase<00:01:13.490> and

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
know the pre rut you have the chase and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.910 
know the pre rut you have the chase and
the<00:01:13.910> seeking<00:01:14.450> phase<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:15.170> then<00:01:15.290> you<00:01:15.440> have<00:01:15.620> the

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
the seeking phase and then you have the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.120 
the seeking phase and then you have the
the<00:01:16.490> full-blown<00:01:17.290> peak<00:01:18.290> of<00:01:18.410> the<00:01:18.500> rut<00:01:18.740> where<00:01:18.980> the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
the full-blown peak of the rut where the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.250 
the full-blown peak of the rut where the
breeding<00:01:19.550> is<00:01:19.670> taking<00:01:20.030> place<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:21.050> at

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
breeding is taking place and at

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.770 
breeding is taking place and at
different<00:01:21.560> stages<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.580> deer<00:01:22.850> vocalizing<00:01:23.660> in

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
different stages the deer vocalizing in

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.800 
different stages the deer vocalizing in
different<00:01:24.140> ways<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:25.810> I<00:01:26.810> find<00:01:27.650> that<00:01:28.810> rattling

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
different ways and I find that rattling

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.850 
different ways and I find that rattling
and<00:01:30.110> grunting<00:01:31.070> in<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:32.360> early<00:01:32.750> season<00:01:32.990> or<00:01:33.620> in

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
and grunting in the early season or in

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.740 
and grunting in the early season or in
not<00:01:34.400> so<00:01:34.610> much<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:34.940> early<00:01:35.240> season<00:01:35.540> but<00:01:35.660> the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
not so much the early season but the

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.410 
not so much the early season but the
early<00:01:36.020> stages<00:01:36.290> of<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.650> rut<00:01:36.940> when<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.090> when

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
early stages of the rut when the when

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.730 
early stages of the rut when the when
the<00:01:38.450> Bucks<00:01:38.720> are<00:01:38.870> just<00:01:39.170> starting<00:01:39.380> to<00:01:39.500> make

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
the Bucks are just starting to make

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.290 
the Bucks are just starting to make
their<00:01:39.920> rubs<00:01:40.190> and<00:01:40.430> they're<00:01:40.550> just<00:01:40.880> starting<00:01:41.180> to

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
their rubs and they're just starting to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.240 
their rubs and they're just starting to
open<00:01:41.390> up<00:01:41.720> those<00:01:41.900> scrapes<00:01:42.320> I<00:01:42.560> think<00:01:43.100> they're

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
open up those scrapes I think they're

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.550 
open up those scrapes I think they're
real<00:01:43.430> susceptible<00:01:44.180> to<00:01:44.210> calling<00:01:44.960> especially

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
real susceptible to calling especially

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.800 
real susceptible to calling especially
with<00:01:45.680> rattling<00:01:46.190> and<00:01:46.370> I<00:01:46.909> also<00:01:47.090> think<00:01:47.659> they're

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
with rattling and I also think they're

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.930 
with rattling and I also think they're
susceptible<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.530> decoying<00:01:49.040> I<00:01:49.340> don't<00:01:49.580> I<00:01:49.700> don't

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
susceptible to decoying I don't I don't

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.660 
susceptible to decoying I don't I don't
do<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.090> lot<00:01:50.180> of<00:01:50.390> decoying<00:01:50.840> but<00:01:51.110> I<00:01:51.140> do<00:01:51.400> have<00:01:52.400> some

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
do a lot of decoying but I do have some

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.450 
do a lot of decoying but I do have some
some<00:01:53.420> success<00:01:53.900> with<00:01:54.110> it<00:01:54.290> I've<00:01:54.500> never<00:01:54.830> shot

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
some success with it I've never shot

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.070 
some success with it I've never shot
what<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:55.700> would<00:01:55.909> consider<00:01:56.210> a<00:01:56.330> quality

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
what I would consider a quality

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.140 
what I would consider a quality
whitetail<00:01:57.290> over<00:01:57.830> decoying<00:01:58.190> but<00:01:58.729> I<00:01:58.760> haven't

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
whitetail over decoying but I haven't

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.390 
whitetail over decoying but I haven't
really<00:01:59.330> done<00:01:59.479> it<00:01:59.659> that<00:01:59.810> much<00:02:00.050> but<00:02:00.860> getting

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
really done it that much but getting

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.480

you have Bucks I think that opted out of
the<00:04:12.880> breeding<00:04:13.150> cycle<00:04:13.750> just<00:04:14.230> because<00:04:14.620> they're

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
the breeding cycle just because they're

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.400 
the breeding cycle just because they're
more<00:04:15.010> passive<00:04:15.430> animals<00:04:15.850> they<00:04:16.720> won't<00:04:16.930> get<00:04:17.170> into

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
more passive animals they won't get into

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.050 
more passive animals they won't get into
the<00:04:17.620> rigors<00:04:17.980> of<00:04:18.010> it<00:04:18.250> if<00:04:18.370> they<00:04:18.520> come<00:04:18.700> across<00:04:19.030> a
