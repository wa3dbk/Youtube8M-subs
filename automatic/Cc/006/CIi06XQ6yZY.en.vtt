okay<00:00:00.690> I<00:00:00.719> decided<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.230> make<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:01.800> video<00:00:02.010> to

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
okay I decided to make this video to

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.499 
okay I decided to make this video to
give<00:00:02.909> everyone<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.360> comparison<00:00:05.270> if<00:00:06.270> their

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
give everyone a comparison if their

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.000 
give everyone a comparison if their

the<00:00:08.370> front<00:00:08.670> differential<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.510> was<00:00:10.440> going<00:00:10.679> to

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
the front differential I was going to

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.749 
the front differential I was going to
show<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.370> what<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:12.440> front<00:00:13.440> pinion<00:00:14.130> shaft<00:00:14.160> looks

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
show you what a front pinion shaft looks

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.790 
show you what a front pinion shaft looks

ring<00:01:35.009> gear<00:01:35.189> teeth<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.729> would<00:01:36.570> say<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.020> this

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
ring gear teeth I would say that this

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.690 
ring gear teeth I would say that this
right<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> normal<00:01:38.189> amount<00:01:38.400> of

right here is a normal amount of

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.020 
right here is a normal amount of
backlash<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.930> said<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.280> front

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
backlash and like I said this is a front

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.460 
backlash and like I said this is a front

post number 291 is one possible solution
for

for

actually modifying the pinyin and now
I'm<00:02:16.099> seeing<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.459> post<00:02:16.879> number<00:02:17.090> 301<00:02:17.629> may<00:02:18.590> even<00:02:18.860> be

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
I'm seeing a post number 301 may even be

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.509 
I'm seeing a post number 301 may even be
a<00:02:19.010> simpler<00:02:19.549> solution<00:02:20.209> as<00:02:20.870> far<00:02:21.080> as<00:02:21.319> a<00:02:21.400> seeing<00:02:22.400> if

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
a simpler solution as far as a seeing if

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.300 
a simpler solution as far as a seeing if
there<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.790> any<00:02:23.060> slack<00:02:23.390> where<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.950> bearing

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
there is any slack where the bearing

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.940 
there is any slack where the bearing
actually<00:02:25.610> goes<00:02:25.760> up<00:02:25.940> inside<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.480> housing<00:02:26.950> if

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
actually goes up inside the housing if

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.680 
actually goes up inside the housing if
there<00:02:28.159> is<00:02:28.310> slack<00:02:28.610> if<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:28.940> shaft<00:02:29.150> can<00:02:29.480> go

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
there is slack if the shaft can go

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.500 
there is slack if the shaft can go
further<00:02:29.989> towards<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.799> ring<00:02:31.129> gear<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:32.360> we

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
further towards the ring gear then we

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.270 
further towards the ring gear then we
may<00:02:32.690> be<00:02:32.750> able<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.170> shove<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.590> in<00:02:33.799> there<00:02:34.010> further

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
may be able to shove it in there further

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.670 
may be able to shove it in there further
and<00:02:34.640> then<00:02:34.790> put<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.299> shim<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.200> take<00:02:36.440> up<00:02:36.560> the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
and then put a shim to take up the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.070 
and then put a shim to take up the
difference<00:02:37.069> where<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:38.090> retaining<00:02:38.629> ring<00:02:38.750> is

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
difference where the retaining ring is

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.989 
difference where the retaining ring is
that<00:02:40.989> okay
