00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.380
 because this is a review video 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.430
 dt claudio borghi in olite facts peking 6 dic 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.929
 but keep 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.309
 clear that in these times it has become very accessible 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:14.849
 what is recommended 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.619
 and that's why I'm going to make this video for what 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.619
 be with the people with whom it counts 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.739
 believes that these hours and that requires that the state of the roof 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.380
 but he showed them how the box so they have an idea of 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.350
 ec is what it seems 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.520
 in this case I bought it in the online store 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.520
 from here in Mexico it's pretty good 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.220
 the waterfall of the pitchers 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.690
 on the other hand 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.860
 the disc 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.690
 so despite the images 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.310
 This is not everything 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.210
 nothing but milk use of the keyboard is in English 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.820
 in this case it has nothing 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.860
 naimí 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.860
 but if it was there only on some keys that are lost 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.840
 they also died buried 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.310
 take them to the mercedes screen 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.220
 Normal p as it comes 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.070
 but there is a program 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.260
 bring your own program so you can configure 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.540
 in this case 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.960
 reverse the image 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.040
 here you can see 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.390
 How it changes 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.950
 of other colors 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.950
 in this case the keyboard only has orange color 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.500
 and it only has three levels 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.850
 had in that case paid 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.370
 in the Mérida sense 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.370
 a little stronger 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.540
 the keyboard comes common 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.540
 the sentence explains that many times it is excellent 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 the money and subsequently 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.699
 the keyboard but we get married scholarships 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.879
 but it is possible 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.370
 excuse me that this is in this forum continuing with the camera 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:19.089
 it's not a professional video camera 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:21.629
 he tried to free 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.629
 the sense of giving an idea of ​​what is happening 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.009
 that was our party 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:30.179
 we can see the macro keys 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:32.719
 they have 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.029
 programmable trespass 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.029
 I do not see how they change 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.779
 by hawks duct a macroweb 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.179
 selected for example 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:47.219
 I believe that one 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:51.929
 leaders of haniya borba then record the macro that stress 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:54.929
 that level 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.579
 in this case 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.739
 ue uu will not be left with ana basanta 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.459
 the gathering of the state 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.879
 it would be a macro to the flight the institute that is very interesting 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.589
 cecilio to block the windows key 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:12.569
 in this case 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.569
 for we are playing 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.069
 we would not like this to happen 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.359
 then we apply the law 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.319
 own the lock button 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.859
 to left 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.299
 the windows and mac key that applies to them is a very good option 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:35.929
 also the same 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.899
 as you can see 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:41.699
 today we have multimedia control 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.699
 quite interesting in par 3 of the pit and roofs 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:49.899
 after months after changing 

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:51.369
 intentions 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:53.729
 in this case it also has some 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:57.559
 notion of news as important news companies are happening in 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:00.559
 certain page 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.069
 personal settings 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.779
 on the other hand in the month of April 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.779
 that is to say all pose could put it back 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.709
 Advance the rest 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:16.969
 start it 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:20.049
 that's why I took equipment m both compared with year 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.449
 this is how they are explained 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:25.640
 the numeric keypad 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.029
 normal 90+ 

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:31.199
 the scarce while you can 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.199
 in this case it will complicate 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.199
 he also urged another 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.270
 gt another small if it takes away 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.550
 integrated flows 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.569
 he likes his focus bad taste 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.159
 can not depend on a single use not only look 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:54.469
 and have everything tied 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:59.110
 get also 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.589
 a cable management 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:03.589
 good part of the higher cost 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.749
 you can customize the environment 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:11.749
 your keyboard we check loves lcd studio 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.779
 that allows you to never put on screen consume custom 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.889
 presentation 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.889
 what I had after I took photos 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.150
 not rendered a level 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.969
 Much smaller 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.279
 so that he can enter the keyboard because art is the one that handles 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.080
 mobile 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.430
 then you want to continue living with you 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.839
 a keyboard that is already quite accessible here in Mexico 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.169
 so commented 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.419
 If you want to have something 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.009
 binner 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.960
 because it allows him to play 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.699
 and feel more comfortable with what he has put on long 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:57.150
 it's a very good one he concluded 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.869
 It was recommended 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:03.499
 I hope I can really make widows can be tested the study or 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:06.689
 However, it does not happened 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:09.689
 members of the wolf soda both sides 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.460
 in December but only mouche 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.770
 under this agreement 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.270
 the wiring here is where idol is or direct 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:24.369
 dyn this is right now 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:29.589
 so I remain 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.520
 in this case your taste more space 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.520
 you can simply remove it 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.800
 yes we seen 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:52.219
 luck will help you make a decision and in this case 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.379
 on the contrary or not buy 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:57.459
 this note and because this
