00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 Hey, hey, I'll find you . 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.320
 It's a bee . 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:13.259
 Now if you look at what is happening, the wall itself is 700 800 cloudy 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.250
 That's the kind of mix. 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.869
 The bottom is now open- aired, so come in here. 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.609
 You're tempting. 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:27.029
 Taunting them and now some two daughters in law Youtube 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:32.130
 What say you converted your very own air space, not any Thermos 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.059
 I made it, but I thought maybe it was a weakness on the waist side. 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.380
 same 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.000
 Or maybe it's the clan's biggest joke when the riders heard that the jumping track was stolen 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.230
 To step on 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.710
 Hagekkeum to prevent any cracking or breaking even on this subject here once, 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.980
 I think there are many purposes 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.280
 I do not know. Exactly, I do not know about self-help intentions. 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.770
 If you see it's your top tower now then switch to what 's the late saw 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.449
 This is the easiest way for you 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:04.439
 There 's this guy, and he's got a big bomb right here underneath. 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:09.090
 If I say that I am now here in my abalone civil war tower 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:13.140
 I can not. 0 The bomb will be on the front and the brain on both sides . 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.880
 Itguyo one side may be opposite to what suggests a large bomb got that way 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.090
 It looks crazy. 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.369
 Maybe there will be some response on top because 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:30.060
 Because it is open, it is better to defend 5 tons of large bombs 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:33.750
 So when you see a big, anyway now that anti-aircraft itself apart just call me and write 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.710
 It covers only halfway there, actually. The upper part is not covered . 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.270
 So, in fact, it is very good, 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.979
 Of course, there is also a ride and mouse towers, but the damage is actually a penalty 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.009
 As well as put a crucifix Replacing lead to trade then you should never give 13 Rooms 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.329
 Unless you meet from search because it does not burst 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:59.040
 Abandoned anti-aircraft fire because what if something awful formally chigoneun Balloon Dog 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:02.250
 I have got tremendous looked very little like that are now part of what the map 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.619
 Vulnerability Next we will have a few more airspace points 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.619
 I'll give you an additional explanation while watching the video. 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:16.440
 I took eight, 40,000 won. Open. I got two golems on both sides. 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:21.170
 Two sideways, then eight witches. 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.470
 Ah, Chucky first saw it less and wrote it when it was a loan. 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.959
 I have no place among them, and then pick a time on both the quantity pigs Boys 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.230
 I'm sticking to this one. 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.590
 I'll be getting it after I clean up the road . 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.670
 Because there are so many witches, what they are hiding in this way from now on 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.799
 It pops 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:44.390
 Now if I try a blur burst body skeletons are at once a moment that little 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:50.330
 The road has changed nationally and has been replaced by other units. 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:53.299
 4 It's a way to get away from it. I do not take that skeleton palm apart now. 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.370
 It's the way you 're kneeling with your strength . 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.370
 I went in. 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:07.310
 Barking ibabi team died, but behind the law was in love with skulls cartoon comic 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.760

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.570
 Like a flamethrower 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.760
 Then I left some forces in the popped through the match because now fit 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.970
 Cedar wakes up and gives more. 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.720
 I also Xuan witch witch is also very important late Achan 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.710
 The place is very important because the Judiciary is now the time I'm not 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.710
 For the noon press 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.939
 Also, since both sides are not organized, they release it to the side. 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.920
 4 Now that you have been sentenced to legal guard , 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.940
 Not here. 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:53.110
 Anyway, come across only one died from search operations by hitting just one shot damage 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:57.130
 I'm dead. I look like iron. 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.690
 I still do a lot to live very much to find a color you're alive to me 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.740
 Because bet was livable 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.700
 If it's not a joke skeletons are breaking more united a lot of breath to stop 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.470
 Count 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.850
 Oh'll Toka spinal witches anger sea hitting the region ahkkado side Wheat 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.810
 I'll kill prevailed 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:18.040
 I admit that witches are like this 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:21.970
 I have a lot of hard work on maps that are a little off the hook. 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.110
 Now the witch behind the wall gained School If you have a mouse tower now Anyang 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.550
 At the head 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:31.270
 2005 If you have a mouse tower, then the skulls are still awake in the wall 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.410
 That's how it goes, and now the skulls are a lot of anyway. 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.590
 You do it. 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:39.250
 The skeletons have lost their strength and are now continuing to be made by the temple tower 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.030
 Now that you are united and die, you will not be carrying a lot of witches 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.680
 It's good. 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:48.700
 This is the only way to see this kind of thing . 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.860
 Ono: The more you eat, the better you will take a lot of witches. 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.660
 Witches are great on the field. 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:59.530
 If you have to claim a place like Juno that if at least six to about 9 units 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:03.190
 It's good enough to take. Except Gollum 1 instead of Witch. 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.580
 You can take off a lot, and I can see that I'm getting enough of it . 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.120
 Thank you for giving me the video. 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.120
