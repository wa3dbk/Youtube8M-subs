 works it's the day in which 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.849
 we will see that all 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.430
 main works are finished so these 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.990
 works it is the realization of 106 km 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.520
 of high speed lines between 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.500
 Baudrecourt and Vendenheim 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.480
 these are works that started to 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.420
 summer 2010 with civil engineering 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.850
 they continued afterwards in 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.830
 end of 2013 with the commitment of works 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.839
 of railway equipment and today 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.820
 we will see the completion of 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.040
 all of these works at once 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.049
 civil engineering and all my rail so 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.220
 which represents a little more this not far 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:55.220
 five years of work 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.610
 the day suits today gives 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.350
 a good picture of what will be 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.480
 the future just witnessed the laying of the 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.400
 last rail in the presence of both 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.510
 presidents of many elected officials and the 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.510
 press at vendenheim 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.580
 this last rail actually is both 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.220
 the end of a 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.160
 an adventure that adventure network sncf 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.110
 with the construction of a line that will 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.880
 to be very important to us and that's 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.220
 a new page that opens a page 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.940
 which opens for the carrier tgv 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.640
 to make 2 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.890
 this new line a big hit at 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.630
 horizon 2 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:02.680
 of its opening, ie April 3rd 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:04.950
 2016 my ambition is that tgv is who 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.210
 is today the best of tgv 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.990
 on the one hand the rest and especially 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.730
 still improves as our customers and the 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.750
 feeling of a real 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.110
 difference of a real leap 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.090
 qualitative when we open the 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.069
 commercial service on April 3, 2016 there 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.209
 only when the customers 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.890
 the tgv will arrive on April 3, 2016 and 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.700
 travel with us they say there it 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.700
 there really is something that has changed
