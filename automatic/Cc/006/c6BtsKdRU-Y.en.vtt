00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.979 
I thought it was pretty cool there were
a<00:02:17.610> couple<00:02:17.640> ones<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.239> you<00:02:18.659> know<00:02:18.689> I<00:02:18.780> don't

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
a couple ones that I you know I don't

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.119 
a couple ones that I you know I don't
think<00:02:19.049> I<00:02:19.200> would<00:02:19.319> get<00:02:19.500> they're<00:02:19.799> kind<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.010> like

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
think I would get they're kind of like

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.830 
think I would get they're kind of like
more<00:02:20.250> like<00:02:20.310> Paisley<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.420> I'm<00:02:21.599> not<00:02:21.720> really

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
more like Paisley and I'm not really

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.699 
more like Paisley and I'm not really
into<00:02:22.079> that<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.829> thought<00:02:24.439> they're<00:02:25.439> kind<00:02:25.650> of

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
into that but I thought they're kind of

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.759 
into that but I thought they're kind of
fun<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:27.049> they<00:02:28.049> have<00:02:28.319> different<00:02:29.299> I<00:02:30.769> guess

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
fun and they have different I guess

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.660 
fun and they have different I guess
every<00:02:32.959> Hollett<00:02:33.959> like<00:02:34.280> season<00:02:35.280> they<00:02:35.400> come<00:02:35.579> out

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
every Hollett like season they come out

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.380 
every Hollett like season they come out
with<00:02:35.819> new<00:02:36.000> ones<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.079> ordered<00:02:37.500> from<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.739> fall

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
with new ones so I ordered from the fall

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.929 
with new ones so I ordered from the fall
selection<00:02:40.370> yeah<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.400> think<00:02:41.549> they're<00:02:41.819> just

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
selection yeah I think they're just

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.500 
selection yeah I think they're just
already<00:02:42.209> like<00:02:42.480> holiday<00:02:43.140> went<00:02:43.349> out<00:02:44.150> but<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.390> was

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
already like holiday went out but it was

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.390 
already like holiday went out but it was
pretty<00:02:45.689> cool<00:02:45.840> because<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.409> think<00:02:46.530> all<00:02:47.069> three

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
pretty cool because I think all three

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.780 
pretty cool because I think all three
bags<00:02:47.609> came<00:02:48.389> up<00:02:48.510> for<00:02:48.629> like<00:02:48.720> $60<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.639> guess

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
bags came up for like $60 and I guess

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.580 
bags came up for like $60 and I guess
they<00:02:51.030> can<00:02:51.209> like<00:02:51.359> ship<00:02:51.659> it<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.170> or<00:02:53.750> or<00:02:54.750> I

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
they can like ship it to you or or I

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.470 
they can like ship it to you or or I
don't<00:02:56.430> know<00:02:56.579> I<00:02:56.639> guess<00:02:56.819> they<00:02:57.000> just<00:02:57.030> ship<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.359> to

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
don't know I guess they just ship it to

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.360 
don't know I guess they just ship it to
like<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.750> consultant<00:02:58.290> maybe<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:58.859> Jamie<00:02:59.129> just

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
like the consultant maybe but Jamie just

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.670 
like the consultant maybe but Jamie just
brought<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.609> all<00:02:59.670> over<00:02:59.909> here<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:01.260> yeah<00:03:01.439> I<00:03:01.470> think

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
brought it all over here so yeah I think

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.990 
brought it all over here so yeah I think
I'll<00:03:02.400> be<00:03:02.790> able<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.120> use<00:03:03.209> them<00:03:03.680> pretty

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
I'll be able to use them pretty

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.879 
I'll be able to use them pretty
frequently<00:03:06.000> because<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.870> actually<00:03:07.319> used<00:03:07.650> the
