00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hey y'all I want to make a video is

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.889 
hey y'all I want to make a video is
shown<00:00:02.250> how<00:00:02.490> infused<00:00:03.000> works<00:00:03.330> and<00:00:03.540> how<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.659> light

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
shown how infused works and how a light

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.769 
shown how infused works and how a light
bulb<00:00:04.200> works<00:00:04.910> this<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.120> gonna<00:00:06.270> simulate<00:00:06.569> a

type<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.750> light<00:00:09.900> bulb<00:00:10.110> which<00:00:11.070> inside<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.610> hear

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
type of light bulb which inside to hear

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.680 
type of light bulb which inside to hear
you<00:00:12.540> got<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:13.309> filament<00:00:14.309> which<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.360> pretty<00:00:15.599> much

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
you got a filament which is pretty much

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.500 
you got a filament which is pretty much
a<00:00:15.780> wire<00:00:16.109> around<00:00:16.320> wound<00:00:16.770> up<00:00:16.980> like<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.460> it's<00:00:18.300> in

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
a wire around wound up like that it's in

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.179 
a wire around wound up like that it's in
a<00:00:18.539> vacuum<00:00:19.580> so<00:00:20.580> don't<00:00:20.970> burn<00:00:21.720> up<00:00:21.980> and<00:00:22.980> how<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
a vacuum so don't burn up and how the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.839 
a vacuum so don't burn up and how the
fuse<00:00:23.609> works<00:00:24.920> pretty<00:00:25.920> much<00:00:26.070> running<00:00:26.369> too<00:00:26.640> much

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
fuse works pretty much running too much

fuse works pretty much running too much
car<00:00:27.210> through<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.630> wire

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
car through a wire

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.410 
car through a wire
I'm<00:00:28.920> putting<00:00:29.310> 12<00:00:29.550> volts<00:00:29.939> he<00:00:30.060> was<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> little

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
I'm putting 12 volts he was a little

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.319 
I'm putting 12 volts he was a little
piece<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.599> wire<00:00:30.869> here<00:00:31.550> this<00:00:32.550> coil<00:00:32.910> will<00:00:33.090> start

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
piece of wire here this coil will start

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.520 
piece of wire here this coil will start
glowing<00:00:33.480> red<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:39.450> that's<00:00:39.570> how<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:40.079> light<00:00:40.350> bulb

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
glowing red and that's how a light bulb

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.810 
glowing red and that's how a light bulb
works<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:42.510> reason<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.350> glass

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
works the reason they have to have glass

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.369 
works the reason they have to have glass
because<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.270> order<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.629> get<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.170> glow

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
because in order to get this to glow

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.650 
because in order to get this to glow
bright<00:00:47.010> enough<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> hundred<00:00:48.059> or<00:00:48.210> 60<00:00:48.510> watt

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
bright enough like a hundred or 60 watt

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.520 
bright enough like a hundred or 60 watt
light<00:00:48.690> bulb<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:50.010> wire<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.550> Melton<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
light bulb the wire will Melton to

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.290 
light bulb the wire will Melton to
because<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> gases<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> air<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.180> all

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
because of the gases in the air and all

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.619 
because of the gases in the air and all
that<00:00:54.710> kind<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.770> hard<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.949> explain<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.640> but

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
that kind of hard to explain there but

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.369 
that kind of hard to explain there but
now<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.219> see<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.370> put<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.730> 6<00:01:00.000> volts<00:01:00.390> you'll<00:01:01.109> see

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
now I see if I put on 6 volts you'll see

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.369 
now I see if I put on 6 volts you'll see
it<00:01:01.469> dimmed<00:01:01.739> down<00:01:02.600> because<00:01:03.600> you're<00:01:03.809> reducing

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
it dimmed down because you're reducing

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.020 
it dimmed down because you're reducing
the<00:01:04.589> voltage<00:01:04.710> which<00:01:05.250> lowers<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> current

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the voltage which lowers the current

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.320 
the voltage which lowers the current
through<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> wire<00:01:08.720> that's<00:01:09.720> six<00:01:10.020> volt<00:01:10.280> that's

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
through the wire that's six volt that's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.600 
through the wire that's six volt that's
12<00:01:12.330> volts<00:01:15.049> now<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.710> demonstrate<00:01:16.860> how<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.280> fuse

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
12 volts now to demonstrate how the fuse

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.840 
12 volts now to demonstrate how the fuse
works<00:01:18.170> we'll<00:01:19.170> hook<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.560> smaller<00:01:20.549> piece<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
works we'll hook the smaller piece of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.030 
works we'll hook the smaller piece of
wire<00:01:21.090> what's<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> same<00:01:22.409> side<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:22.950> your

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
wire what's the same side with your

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.640 
wire what's the same side with your
shorter<00:01:23.430> piece<00:01:23.869> and<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.259> will<00:01:25.470> glow<00:01:25.619> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
shorter piece and as this will glow a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.399 
shorter piece and as this will glow a
little<00:01:25.770> bit<00:01:26.130> less<00:01:26.939> than<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.570> right<00:01:28.229> now

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
little bit less than this right now

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.740 
little bit less than this right now
because<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.729> adding<00:01:30.030> more<00:01:30.150> resistance

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
because this is adding more resistance

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.999 
because this is adding more resistance
to<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.020> circuit<00:01:31.909> now<00:01:33.380> say<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.409> start<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.829> flow<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
to the circuit now say I start to flow a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.580 
to the circuit now say I start to flow a
little<00:01:35.220> bit<00:01:37.460> now<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:39.240> something<00:01:39.479> happens<00:01:39.930> when

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
little bit now if something happens when

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.039 
little bit now if something happens when
whatever<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.520> running<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.509> decides<00:01:42.869> to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
whatever you running and it decides to

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.999 
whatever you running and it decides to
short<00:01:43.320> out<00:01:45.049> this<00:01:46.049> will<00:01:46.229> simulate<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.680> short

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
short out this will simulate a short

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.120 
short out this will simulate a short
circuit<00:01:47.869> like<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.640> fuse<00:01:50.640> or<00:01:52.100> Melton<00:01:53.100> to

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
circuit like is a fuse or Melton to

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.929 
circuit like is a fuse or Melton to
just<00:01:54.640> like<00:01:54.820> that<00:01:55.680> that's<00:01:56.680> how<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.950> fuse<00:01:57.310> works

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.230

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
catching the place on fire here and your

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.359 
catching the place on fire here and your
fuses<00:02:04.720> come<00:02:05.049> in<00:02:05.170> different<00:02:05.320> sizes<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.310> shapes

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
fuses come in different sizes and shapes

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.910 
fuses come in different sizes and shapes
your<00:02:09.369> smaller<00:02:09.729> fuses<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:10.650> are<00:02:11.650> going<00:02:11.860> to

this<00:02:17.770> is<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:17.950> 30<00:02:18.310> amp<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:19.900> one's<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.170> 20<00:02:20.500> amp

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
this is a 30 amp and this one's a 20 amp

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.360 
this is a 30 amp and this one's a 20 amp
and<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:22.030> brings<00:02:22.300> up<00:02:22.450> another<00:02:22.569> point<00:02:23.160> if<00:02:24.160> your

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
and that brings up another point if your

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.080 
and that brings up another point if your
house<00:02:24.550> has<00:02:24.880> fuses<00:02:25.769> you<00:02:26.769> blow<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.190> 20<00:02:27.519> amp<00:02:27.730> fuse

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
house has fuses you blow the 20 amp fuse

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.920 
house has fuses you blow the 20 amp fuse
a<00:02:28.830> 30<00:02:29.830> amp<00:02:30.040> fuse<00:02:30.340> will<00:02:30.580> screw<00:02:30.910> into<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.420> but

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
a 30 amp fuse will screw into it but

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.740 
a 30 amp fuse will screw into it but
don't<00:02:32.170> do<00:02:32.380> it<00:02:32.410> because<00:02:32.970> your<00:02:33.970> wire<00:02:34.180> ain't
