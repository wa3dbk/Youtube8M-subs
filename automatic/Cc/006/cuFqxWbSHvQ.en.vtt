00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.970
 then to cover all the sounds necessary for this type of repertoire 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.090
 I use a good part of the collection of women mayors stratocaster 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.659
 with recent models of old model 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:15.419
 so here I first used the favorite which game plays for 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:16.829
 years that a woman of honor 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.060
 the stochastic 19 156 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.050
 it is a beautiful model of the collection 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.090
 and who even though she is a former mistress of the museum very fast very 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.390
 happy skating 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.079
 they are absolutely splendid 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.800
 for all the chante de sarkozy repertoire like vitalis-cros complex 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.660
 think about him at afp 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.830
 with one year plus two options the soundtrack of time and for good reason 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.680
 I do not say that we understand anything that these audio recordings also 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.280
 use this one 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.910
 who's the current feast thomas 56 because it's a model that this is 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:46.940
 than a decade 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.820
 and that reproduces all the specificities 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.260
 guitars 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.170
 of that year besides it's called stop me because 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.810
 it's the name of the American musician who had ordered a 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.260
 stratocaster voice 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.520
 to be colored 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.520
 and it is a very very beautiful instrument that I took the fact often 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.600
 for the rhythm that I used a lot of this model there 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.410
 it's a new TV series of 164 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.410
 then the same is because the fed keeps its small mistakes 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.660
 the guitars for sanex brands and a few minutes they sheltered 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.600
 butter 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.619
 so we know them a monthly rise the center-forward ten years 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.440
 and yesterday that's why I trust in me it's different clinic 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.030
 rousson 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.789
 also from a connected generation 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.579
 in the 50s it belonged to one of the producers of the creek 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.579
 I'm going out of the car 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.679
 really amazing at this kind of career 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.590
 the musician was proud of his success 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.880
 seen as such for example in Swiss francs 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.740
 a lot of a lot of charisma the concern is that m 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.140
 we are here 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.200
 it's a 1971 model we were doing 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.130
 traffic checked 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.670
 very comfortable stone-vernier I changed the course 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.020
 no I'm no longer that the team can only make more complete 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.900
 once for all 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.490
 it was signed by the arrival michel daugan 84 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.960
 more fear than foot pain 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.010
 so I used it for years 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.740
 some 56 billion 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.380
 I am not sure of this model 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.820
 on that of 1979 on the site experienced at home under the warning shot 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.939
 often served 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.869
 however much more used 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:18.009
 this model to the first generation of models and the four tons of this 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:19.109
 young father 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.530
 a fabulous guitar and for all saturated sounds like Paris moscow and 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:27.089
 not suffer increased also used it's a real snub 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:31.069
 and it was really really great audience has extremely nice with a 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.179
 handle 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:34.329
 and then I started 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.849
 no one else has it for now we do not want to leave it was the 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.199
 first time needed 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:40.679
 they are 80 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:44.149
 % and those guitars that had not always good reputation and his friends 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.009
 it is difficult that it is really excellent 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:48.799
 professor of the polytechnic school 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.909
 it's a little surprising that the risk is effective 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.169
 the first strike 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.450
 the angola has since made stage in the young people who complained to do 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:56.139
 that 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.329
 according to these sources the bodies of other albums 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.299
 a few months and concerts too and especially this one 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.779
 It's a first 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:05.730
 the editions that scare those of the 50s models by hand 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.159
 at the end of the month the 80s 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.989
 it's a question of talent 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.909
 8 I wish to finalize all the others that are there 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.269
 and then where she stratocaster in sweet body does not quite 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.539
 unusual and stone 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.089
 5:36 p.m. 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:23.319
 the challenge also use the logo that is there 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.459
 with a guitar but not with the United States 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.379
 the left-handed thrower will serve a great sun 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.329
 current expectations 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.329
 phillies philadelphia 'philly fed' who is so sexy 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.209
 and then this one I'm not sure yet 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.209
 but I think for them 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:43.820
 the crisis is not just the crisis 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.820
 more and more annoyed the next 48 hours 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.989
 and percent 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.989
 since and who will spray both this corner 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.149
 he died on the spot 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:59.149
 what that of the bass 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:01.619
 no reason whatsoever 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:04.309
 gerets moved at the last moment smile 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.839
 so why
