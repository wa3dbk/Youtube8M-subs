you have you have the glass side and we
have<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.040> actual<00:02:05.910> negative<00:02:06.270> side<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.440> can

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
have the actual negative side so you can

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.680 
have the actual negative side so you can
tell<00:02:07.830> which<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.310> glass<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.670> don't<00:02:09.209> see<00:02:09.569> how

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
tell which is the glass I don't see how

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.330 
tell which is the glass I don't see how
see<00:02:09.929> how<00:02:10.019> that's<00:02:10.229> it's<00:02:10.590> got<00:02:10.709> like<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.920> silver

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
see how that's it's got like a silver

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.759 
see how that's it's got like a silver
color<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.760> that's<00:02:11.879> just<00:02:12.090> kind<00:02:12.269> of<00:02:12.500> glass<00:02:13.500> and

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
color and that's just kind of glass and

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.870 
color and that's just kind of glass and
that's<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.069> actual<00:02:14.340> negative<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:14.940> side

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
that's the actual negative on that side

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.210

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
some of the darkroom can use this just

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.020 
some of the darkroom can use this just
like<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.170> celluloid<00:03:18.830> negative<00:03:19.550> there<00:03:19.910> like

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
like a celluloid negative there like

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.010 
like a celluloid negative there like
they<00:03:20.150> used<00:03:20.330> to<00:03:20.450> before<00:03:20.599> they<00:03:20.750> had<00:03:20.870> digital

they used to before they had digital
cameras<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:21.980> then<00:03:22.550> they<00:03:22.700> can<00:03:22.959> print<00:03:23.959> a

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
cameras and and then they can print a

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.199 
cameras and and then they can print a
put<00:03:24.680> on<00:03:24.890> paper<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.370> put<00:03:25.610> it<00:03:25.700> in<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.819> emulsion

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
put on paper and put it in the emulsion

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.610 
put on paper and put it in the emulsion
and<00:03:26.510> make<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:26.930> print<00:03:27.230> front
