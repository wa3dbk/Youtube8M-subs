 I was asking about how to make a

 bottle shaped tower made with 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.120
 balloons so in this tutorial we are going to 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.040
 see just that how to make a 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.700
 bottle shaped tower made with 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.320
 balloons 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.120
 so please join us 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.570
 fun decorating with color 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:48.670
 balloons and more and good friends we're going to 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.980
 start this tutorial by checking the 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.829
 elements that we are going to need and 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.470
 first we are going to have to fix 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.350
 5 balloon quintets inflated to 8 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.350
 inches like the one we have here is a 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.600
 green flag and we will need 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.330
 5 quintets inflated to 8 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.299
 and something like what we have here for another 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.030
 part to start what is the neck 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:17.049
 of our bottle we are going to need a 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.090
 only balloon quintet inflated to 7 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.460
 inches something like what we have here 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.080
 of a lighter green color so that 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.240
 you see the difference between what is the 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.530
 neck and body of the bottle a 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.590
 quintet to 7 inches we are also going to 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.200
 need a single quintet of the globe 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.330
 inflated to 6 inches like this that 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.750
 we have here you should also one more green 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.390
 clear to form the neck of the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.300
 bottle we are going to need 5 what attempts 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.020
 of the balloon inflated to 5 inches something like 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.020
 what we have here and finally 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.539
 we're going to need a balloon quintet 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.820
 to number 6 for the final part for the 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.130
 then our bottle's corcholata 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.619
 let's see the process that goes on for 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.860
 that you see how this is done 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.860
 bottle 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:11.370
 the initial thing about this is that the attempts 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.310
 balloon inflated to 8 inches 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.590
 we have to place in a garland 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.360
 this is the body of our bottle that 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.800
 what we can visualize here right now 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.960
 let's make a shot so that what 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.270
 can take out completely but 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.960
 first we are going to place the 5 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.150
 quintets forming a garland 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.680
 this is the initial part of our 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.230
 bottle is the bottom part is the 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:40.350
 body of the bottle let's continue 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:42.360
 with the neck and with the ball from 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.550
 this moment since we have our 5 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.320
 quintets of the number 8 logo now 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.850
 we are going to place the two quintets the 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.770
 lighter green to form our 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.230
 neck of the bottle then we're going to 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.460
 place the largest and then the most 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.460
 boy from here 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.750
 we already put part of the neck of our 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.060
 bottle now we are going to do the part 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.610
 superior then at this time we're going 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.980
 to place the balloons inflated to 5 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.310
 inches on the top we are going to 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.310
 do what 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.569
 and good friends like you could 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.220
 give an account in the images in the part 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.140
 top of the bottle we place the 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.689
 quintet inflated to 6 inches for 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.030
 simulate the corcholata so we've already 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:10.269
 concluded this beautiful bottle can be 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.310
 you place on a metal base or 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.439
 well on a light basis or on a base 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.690
 cement sada everything depends on where 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:19.000

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.549

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.560
