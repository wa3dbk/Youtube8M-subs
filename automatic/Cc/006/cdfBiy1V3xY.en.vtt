00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:04.399
 hi all this success today resides in this tutorial for wnv the 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.650
 everything i'm going to show you how to know everything about your pc the contest has 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.019
 started by going into the start menu harper and three times everything for 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.449
 go see the system information 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.609
 the lawyer had been a little shy it's a music 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.289
 August 18, 2010 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.679
 and pretty much what it is but all I just know I'm 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.759
 strong so your operating system two centuries to locate list all the 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.109
 world knows the version we do not care about taxes in its title report 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:41.100
 they can be done if you have less of it it was circulating 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.240
 computer so the new screw turn the manufacturer which the title did not 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.580
 not prevented the basis of false invoices 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.240
 its creator 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.510
 I would like to see him tell me it started in force at the bare necessities 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.350
 he made his parents 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.399
 yet we were good in the solar and pencils with ups and downs 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.220
 low 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.179
 and so 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.659
 elia more passwords to be we ran out of time 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.320
 the more he can perform chickens detach completely crazy 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.840
 consulted by the processor so no it goes that's what makes it turn 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.850
 in other words, it's the brain of barrels 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.450
 the long version of the old gentleman divorce 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.120
 how to say 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.110
 art is a little bit the one that makes the security in the country it's because 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.700
 so it's enough so every time at startup of your computer and so these 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.920
 8 6% the body works so that the cd player I expect that for 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.960
 to get it stung like a cancer so this is not the version our place of this 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.820
 repertoire one of this magnitude which in my opinion type a phase of 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.480
 start a greenhouse 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.030
 if you want for example to put a chip or a usb key is a 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.600
 the world to make your pc start its CEO 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.520
 - the group made two deaths his first hard drive 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.049
 user who will be retained in rome 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.420
 their weapons so I know what serves to presence to the problems that 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.060
 meet 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.450
 it is he who supports the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.870
 in europe the processor and which serves to advance so more programmed 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.180
 special duty xp at the same time 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.660
 in addition you are entitled to a higher at the end of the butterfly program m 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.659
 the head 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.559
 so I like yes I think so 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:27.209
 we will say that if you ever want the best performing European of your 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.189
 pc now that we leaf through 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.549
 I just did my first trimester 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.189
 spread out in time task manager 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:40.680
 and yet the performances will eventually be back in shape in order to 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.019
 understand why 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.130
 so no longer let use on the wings 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.670
 so it's in the native ream 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.909
 meet 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.349
 their weapons 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.489
 a boat Thursday shit because in front of it is the processor because there 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.129
 there are 22 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.389
 the snacks underestimate that there was a sense 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.469
 so here is the bridge 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.619
 these processors let me pga so he swaps the life to four people 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:09.819
 in dying 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.400
 so steel morale meets her 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.920
 users that were added on the 80 available 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.069
 and here he is more 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.129
 happy elected 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.519
 further the process of 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.709
 2 and so here 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.689
 - you have process so got it here all the programs are started in 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:31.159
 same time compaorÃ© process i want too diluted verbeek 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.180
 underperformance euros maintenance activity nearly four hours 31 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.150
 minutes eyi 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.400
 in 34 minutes ap 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.859
 6 this step 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.669
 here it is that is what has others who have believed it when we 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.209
 know pretty much everything about your pc's performance 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.869
 a lack really for the very beginning i wanted to do the housework in the 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:54.129
 control panel 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.469
 heavy 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.889
 the system 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.369
 and so there you have windows phone performance analysis 7 a hint 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:06.319
 that are worth gold 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.429
 our accounts 2 8% this event and therefore that the more you are ready to loosen 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.269
 the pen of an author who is very powerful 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.769
 the people who do poorly controlled for the police take a break 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.989
 complete in the exam with pc 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.790
 they are only for a rise of Tuesday morning behind the car 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.279
 these minimum performance indices you have to see why 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:32.589
 to finally succeed so that we learn that his people still want yours 

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:34.939
 this is what indicated to consider the year 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:37.939
 next to that it's my lowest disk 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.759
 so that's being done know the cenacle performance index are 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.809
 have become key system components on a scale from a to z 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:50.150
 high so I see the world was running up to sixth growth show 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.850
 then underlined 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.979
 nine people wish 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.099
 so and if you want to know that on your pc you have 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.349
 downloaded 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.659
 right here 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.850
 what spicy 67 nuclear form that really gives you everything 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.370
 he entrusts the processors temperature was that your audience 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.180
 first size guest because there are smes 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.330
 so if we want we come back to surpass ourselves and it goes in the sector 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.360
 he had also already tempered and giuly 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.180
 2 this information to be loved 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.509
 you just have to be exciting 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.710
 the details of the next euro 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.570
 anyway we can not have it starts to touch still in progress 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.150
 c 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.699
 the judge even though it's even more interesting for a long time the 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.089
 triple 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:43.819
 the attempt of 3 6% 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:46.300
 there will be a slap to find 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.099
 gm how to know everything about your pc and so the next other races at 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:52.539
 trot october 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:53.450
 to begin 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.779
 Boost your pc cigarettes 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:06:00.649
 nine other clues convincing voters and too low it remains of his 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:04.889
 wine estate is not finished the committee has become not already done 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:05.279
 to do this
