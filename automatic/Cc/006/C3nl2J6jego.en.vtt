00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:22.529
 22 and a great player of the general 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.519
 and barge pin the whole map flies like 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.710
 one since it is called the halt ne beast 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.300
 the pink panther suggested and there 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.489
 I just have it quite harmless 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.260
 unpacked must now also one 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.320
 or other and I play the full 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.219
 But modus get it paid off 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.370
 laborious 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.219
 you can already see his tricky fingers 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.500
 sparing because systems makes 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.070
 following the forebode that you stop 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.760
 automatically shoots because I call like that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.920
 the reducing thing 21 zloty 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.379
 and if you have the thrust on it then 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.940
 You can just often switch to off 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.100
 stay on it and it shoots today 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.100
 tomorrow a man free of things 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.340
 impeccable yes this is the astro end 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.310
 the day of the morning 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.700
 and the week respectively 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.649
 months with an abo only argument of 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.000
 wanted anti-state says 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.979
 like not to be with the people together 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.439
 only in battlefield 3 also from time to time 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.720
 in black ops 2 while coming a 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:31.630
 little 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:36.390
 well and often to say before but like it 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:43.180
 comes then I want to tell you 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:45.010
 or point out and how 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.220
 one calls it i get every case 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:53.860
 many private psion day you tube 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.310
 Although it went or is in the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.060
 Aryan as you like at such events 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.990
 Battlefield 3 or be it in black ops 2 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.100
 shove and clip or last whole 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.649
 stories can join 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.929
 that would just be it again 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.070
 publicly announced 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.830
 you just go to the steam clients 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.830
 the late and friends and if you know 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.680
 how to win his wife of the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.280
 oberland just gives it to google 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.120
 on 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.830
 as likely to find a tutorial 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.450
 how it works so as I said 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.780
 the family and friends is again 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.070
 linked below are then the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.360
 various events unhitched 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.580
 mostly on the weekend because under week 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.920
 is a bit bad for work and 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.780
 but also something else by the way 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.600
 to do 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:54.459
 and that's exactly where I am depending on my desire 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.170
 and capricious time loss or capricious because such a 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.580
 Event out there in there 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.100
 for example, bellevue gives three today 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.540
 the one and please come there to 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.010
 deepest and then just could one 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.890
 hurt in the teamspeak if possible 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.920
 do not stop but your teamspeak 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.790
 have set that is a microphone 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.230
 what a does not rustle what am I 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.400
 sad and pretty much 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.950
 which does not feel sad or in 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.780
 any way that bothers you 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.230
 means noises are natural 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:37.910
 then love the rushing 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:40.040
 I can even say more 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.440
 so send it before and after 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.810
 first created the deepest no me 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.569
 always wanted ten minutes more 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.129
 before I really go after the event 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.019
 what I gave out then really 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.090
 start so we have enough time in 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.360
 to come and so many people come then 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.000
 Anyway, it's never possible anyway 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.859
 50 people are so you have real 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.620
 chance to really be there I do 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:06.280
 above actually not really 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.280
 people prefer 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:19.359
 to celebrate from la fertÃ© and can 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.359
 who does not 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.979
 and where is that roughly what I mean 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.120
 you with this little but yet 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:31.880
 Relatively a commentary wanted to say that 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.410
 topics were just this deep 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.440
 attitude of world history and how 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.139
 no taxes and back and forth and 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.229
 that actually makes me feel pretty 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:46.800
 heart that it all works out so and 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:49.050
 then without complication 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.930
 You can start, so to speak 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.000
 any detours as fast as 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.210
 possible to produce a video and 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.889
 then upload, because that's yes 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.930
 then what you finally did 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:06.990
 wanted and if everyone was working together 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.949
 I'll say pull that then works 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.379
 a little better with that 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:13.430
 Community events I think and that 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:15.900
 is not only with me 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.610
 Of course that is still a bit 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.949
 after pieces of vischer the pink panther 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.000
 that there is also possible euro tv 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:28.319
 has stopped and all reasonable 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.219
 join in as that was as said by 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:34.379
 me the gameplay is slowing down 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:37.680
 the end is protected to pure then 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:40.050
 times the one or other geilenkirchen 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.990
 because then that's really protected in here 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.230
 this game really 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.610
 earned deserves to travel earned 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.920
 one can say that protected healing can be said that way 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.530
 and something in between 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.050
 the gameplay is of course you see 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:02.340
 I would be relatively short of such things 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.590
 easy so I personally see you 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.180
 here at the beginning of the gameplay or 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.630
 middle or almost in the end even prima 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.010
 Weissberg winning phrases 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.280
 that it really is so close to saying 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:19.800
 is that it is really in the end right at the end 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:21.980
 really strange I will'm raushaut 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.980
 purely
