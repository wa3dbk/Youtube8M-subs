and<00:02:14.710> we<00:02:15.130> showed<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.520> some<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.030> super

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
and we showed you some of the super

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.060 
and we showed you some of the super
pinks<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.810> our<00:02:16.960> larger<00:02:17.350> super<00:02:17.650> ticks<00:02:17.890> are

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
pinks and our larger super ticks are

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.010 
pinks and our larger super ticks are
made<00:02:18.220> out<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.400> white<00:02:18.700> nylon<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.420> there<00:02:19.960> are

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
made out of white nylon and there are

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.190 
made out of white nylon and there are
larger<00:02:20.380> super<00:02:20.680> pegs<00:02:20.950> go<00:02:21.490> up<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:22.090> 2<00:02:22.570> inches<00:02:22.600> in

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
larger super pegs go up to 2 inches in

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.980 
larger super pegs go up to 2 inches in
size<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:24.460> that's<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.030> Cyclops<00:02:25.510> with<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
size so that's the Cyclops with the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.680 
size so that's the Cyclops with the
round<00:02:26.200> peg<00:02:26.500> pattern<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:28.060> final<00:02:28.450> jig<00:02:28.660> that

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
round peg pattern and the final jig that

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.620 
round peg pattern and the final jig that
we'll<00:02:28.990> show<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.260> is<00:02:29.680> our<00:02:30.580> wave<00:02:30.880> jig<00:02:31.120> centaur

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
we'll show you is our wave jig centaur

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.610 
we'll show you is our wave jig centaur
the<00:02:32.470> Centaur<00:02:32.920> has<00:02:33.340> same<00:02:34.060> square<00:02:34.960> peg<00:02:35.230> pattern

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
the Centaur has same square peg pattern

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.740 
the Centaur has same square peg pattern
it's<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.010> Delfy<00:02:36.400> with<00:02:36.640> five<00:02:36.970> holes<00:02:37.210> per<00:02:37.570> inch

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
it's the Delfy with five holes per inch

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.370 
it's the Delfy with five holes per inch
the<00:02:38.380> same<00:02:38.650> 1/16<00:02:39.490> inch<00:02:39.790> pegs<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.870> also<00:02:41.020> has

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
the same 1/16 inch pegs and it also has

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.500 
the same 1/16 inch pegs and it also has
half<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.220> round<00:02:42.460> peg<00:02:42.760> pattern<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.390> the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
half of the round peg pattern of the

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.960 
half of the round peg pattern of the
Cyclops<00:02:43.960> so<00:02:44.710> that<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.070> allows<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.640> make

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
Cyclops so that it allows you to make

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.920 
Cyclops so that it allows you to make
either<00:02:46.570> square<00:02:46.990> or<00:02:47.350> round<00:02:47.740> patterns<00:02:48.750> with<00:02:49.750> our

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
either square or round patterns with our

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.050 
either square or round patterns with our
smaller<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.530> more<00:02:50.620> delicate<00:02:50.680> pegs<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.880> with

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
smaller and more delicate pegs and with

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.330 
smaller and more delicate pegs and with
the<00:02:52.210> Delfy<00:02:52.600> here<00:02:52.810> we<00:02:52.960> also<00:02:53.170> have<00:02:53.350> an<00:02:53.830> accessory

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
the Delfy here we also have an accessory

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.760 
the Delfy here we also have an accessory
we<00:02:54.550> called<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.880> spiral<00:02:55.180> maker<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:56.350> spiral

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
we called a spiral maker the spiral

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.130 
we called a spiral maker the spiral
maker<00:02:57.010> allows<00:02:57.520> us<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.940> make<00:02:58.120> spirals<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.930> the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
maker allows us to make spirals and the

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.330 
maker allows us to make spirals and the
way<00:02:59.290> we<00:02:59.470> use<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.860> spiral<00:03:00.280> maker<00:03:00.490> is<00:03:02.100> we<00:03:03.100> put

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
way we use the spiral maker is we put

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.130 
way we use the spiral maker is we put
the<00:03:03.490> wire<00:03:03.700> through<00:03:04.210> one<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.630> holes<00:03:04.750> in<00:03:05.020> the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
the wire through one of the holes in the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.770 
the wire through one of the holes in the
spiral<00:03:05.410> maker<00:03:05.650> we<00:03:05.920> bend<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:06.310> flat<00:03:06.600> put<00:03:07.600> the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
spiral maker we bend it flat put the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.810 
spiral maker we bend it flat put the
spiral<00:03:08.170> maker<00:03:08.350> into<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.980> jig<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.370> then<00:03:09.640> while

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
spiral maker into the jig and then while

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.550 
spiral maker into the jig and then while
we're<00:03:10.030> looking<00:03:10.150> through<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.870> jig<00:03:11.080> we<00:03:11.290> pull

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
we're looking through the jig we pull

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.330 
we're looking through the jig we pull
the<00:03:11.740> wire<00:03:11.950> around<00:03:12.460> into<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:13.000> spiral<00:03:14.340> allowing

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
the wire around into a spiral allowing

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.070 
the wire around into a spiral allowing
us<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.489> make<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.790> nice<00:03:16.060> tight<00:03:16.090> spiral<00:03:16.600> without

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
us to make a nice tight spiral without

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.960 
us to make a nice tight spiral without
marking<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.830> wire<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:18.280> that's<00:03:18.459> our<00:03:18.640> spiral

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
marking the wire so that's our spiral

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.390 
marking the wire so that's our spiral
maker<00:03:19.270> accessory<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.260> again<00:03:20.980> we<00:03:21.190> have<00:03:21.370> a

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
maker accessory and again we have a

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.280 
maker accessory and again we have a
spiral<00:03:21.730> maker<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.570> will<00:03:22.750> work<00:03:22.900> with<00:03:23.110> the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
spiral maker that will work with the

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.140 
spiral maker that will work with the
Olympus<00:03:23.709> and<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:24.250> different<00:03:24.640> spiral<00:03:24.940> maker

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
Olympus and a different spiral maker

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.390 
Olympus and a different spiral maker
that<00:03:25.360> will<00:03:25.540> work<00:03:25.720> with<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.110> Delfy<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.709> those

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
that will work with the Delfy and those

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.290 
that will work with the Delfy and those
are<00:03:27.580> our<00:03:27.790> wig<00:03:28.030> jig<00:03:28.209> tools<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.750> accessories
