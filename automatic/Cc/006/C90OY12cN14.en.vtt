what<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.410> done<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.040> have<00:00:41.340> tried<00:00:42.239> to

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
what we have done is we have tried to

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.560 
what we have done is we have tried to
attach<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.860> external<00:00:44.670> prosthesis<00:00:45.059> the

attach the external prosthesis the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.369 
attach the external prosthesis the
artificial<00:00:45.870> arm<00:00:46.230> or<00:00:46.350> leg<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.809> skeleton

artificial arm or leg to the skeleton

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.889 
artificial arm or leg to the skeleton
and<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:50.100> has<00:00:50.280> obvious<00:00:50.640> advantages<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.600> sort

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
and that has obvious advantages it sort

of transmits the load through bone which

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.260 
of transmits the load through bone which
is<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.739> natural<00:00:55.949> way<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.370> transmitting<00:00:56.820> load

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
is the natural way of transmitting load

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.189 
is the natural way of transmitting load
in<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:58.109> body<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.760> it<00:00:59.760> sort<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.390> alleviates

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
in the body and it sort of alleviates

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.119 
in the body and it sort of alleviates
the<00:01:02.120> rubbing<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.409> soft<00:01:04.409> tissues<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.070> the

the rubbing of the soft tissues and the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.399 
the rubbing of the soft tissues and the
stump<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.640> don't<00:01:05.820> need<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.390> socket<00:01:07.049> for

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409

example<00:01:10.100> this<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.340> lady<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.880> had<00:01:12.119> her<00:01:12.240> arm

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
example this is a lady that had her arm

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.179 
example this is a lady that had her arm
blown<00:01:12.720> off<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.140> London<00:01:13.470> bombings<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.040> we

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
blown off in the London bombings and we

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.030 
blown off in the London bombings and we
inserted<00:01:14.580> an<00:01:14.880> itap<00:01:15.270> device<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.799> her

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
inserted an itap device and this is her

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.940 
inserted an itap device and this is her
with<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.350> projection<00:01:19.350> out<00:01:19.500> through<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> skin

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
with the projection out through the skin

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.730 
with the projection out through the skin
which<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.490> see<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.330> fairly<00:01:21.840> stable<00:01:22.200> after<00:01:22.500> two

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
which you see is fairly stable after two

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.640 
which you see is fairly stable after two
years<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.470> an

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
years and you can see that this is an

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.149 
years and you can see that this is an
artificial<00:01:26.009> or<00:01:26.840> with<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> iTap<00:01:28.380> device<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
artificial or with the iTap device the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.429 
artificial or with the iTap device the
port<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> implant<00:01:30.750> that's<00:01:30.990> stuck<00:01:31.290> into

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
port of the implant that's stuck into

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.190 
port of the implant that's stuck into
the<00:01:31.619> bone<00:01:32.060> projects<00:01:33.060> through<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.689> skin<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the bone projects through the skin and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.149 
the bone projects through the skin and
the<00:01:35.600> crucial<00:01:36.600> part<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.890> to

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the crucial part is that you have to

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.770 
the crucial part is that you have to
provide<00:01:38.729> an<00:01:39.110> infection<00:01:40.110> free<00:01:40.409> seal<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.780> you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
provide an infection free seal so you

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.480 
provide an infection free seal so you
don't<00:01:43.020> want<00:01:43.200> bacteria<00:01:43.770> getting<00:01:44.100> along<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
don't want bacteria getting along the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.630 
don't want bacteria getting along the
skin<00:01:44.790> interface<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.659> causing<00:01:46.200> an<00:01:46.290> infection

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.800 

it<00:01:49.640> always<00:01:49.939> occurred<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.390> me<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:50.509> if<00:01:50.719> you

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
it always occurred to me that if you

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.660 
it always occurred to me that if you
could<00:01:50.960> attach<00:01:51.229> a<00:01:51.409> leg<00:01:51.619> without<00:01:52.009> having<00:01:52.549> to

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
could attach a leg without having to

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.330 
could attach a leg without having to
have<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.450> socket<00:01:53.899> then<00:01:54.109> you<00:01:54.229> overcome<00:01:55.219> the

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
have the socket then you overcome the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.849 
have the socket then you overcome the
major<00:01:55.549> disadvantages<00:01:56.420> of<00:01:56.859> conventional

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
major disadvantages of conventional

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:04.539 
major disadvantages of conventional
prosthetics<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:02.210> was<00:02:02.390> limited<00:02:02.899> by<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:04.520> fact

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
prosthetics it was limited by the fact

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.109 
prosthetics it was limited by the fact
that<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.030> socket<00:02:05.420> was<00:02:05.630> very<00:02:05.869> rigid<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:07.340> if<00:02:08.000> I

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
that the socket was very rigid and if I

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.809 
that the socket was very rigid and if I
walk<00:02:08.390> too<00:02:08.660> far<00:02:08.899> I'd<00:02:09.410> gets<00:02:09.739> orbits<00:02:10.399> where<00:02:10.670> the

socket rubbed on me it was also very

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.400 
socket rubbed on me it was also very
difficult<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.090> wherein<00:02:14.299> the<00:02:14.599> heat<00:02:14.810> because<00:02:15.230> I

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.750 
is use paws metal to reattach the
tendons<00:04:59.750> onto<00:05:00.200> the<00:05:00.320> implant<00:05:00.860> which<00:05:01.430> is<00:05:01.460> what

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
tendons onto the implant which is what

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.550 
tendons onto the implant which is what
we've<00:05:01.910> done<00:05:02.120> with<00:05:02.360> Rowley<00:05:02.690> and<00:05:03.230> that's<00:05:03.380> why

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
we've done with Rowley and that's why

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.440 
we've done with Rowley and that's why
Raleigh's<00:05:04.010> operation<00:05:04.520> was<00:05:04.640> quite<00:05:04.880> pioneering

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
Raleigh's operation was quite pioneering

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.340 
Raleigh's operation was quite pioneering
so<00:05:06.140> in<00:05:06.500> patients<00:05:07.040> that<00:05:07.460> have<00:05:07.700> a<00:05:08.450> proximal

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
so in patients that have a proximal

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
so in patients that have a proximal
femoral<00:05:09.530> or<00:05:09.940> a<00:05:10.940> transradial<00:05:11.750> amputation<00:05:12.370> you

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
femoral or a transradial amputation you

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
femoral or a transradial amputation you
still<00:05:13.670> have<00:05:14.320> residual<00:05:15.320> nerves<00:05:15.620> and<00:05:16.180> what<00:05:17.180> we

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
still have residual nerves and what we

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.490 
still have residual nerves and what we
want<00:05:17.690> to<00:05:17.810> do<00:05:18.020> in<00:05:18.140> the<00:05:18.230> future<00:05:18.410> is<00:05:18.860> to<00:05:19.160> couple<00:05:19.940> up

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
want to do in the future is to couple up

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.250 
want to do in the future is to couple up
electrodes<00:05:21.500> with<00:05:21.830> those<00:05:22.070> nerves<00:05:22.370> internally

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
electrodes with those nerves internally

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
electrodes with those nerves internally
and<00:05:24.640> transmit<00:05:25.640> the<00:05:26.000> those<00:05:26.480> signals<00:05:26.990> through<00:05:27.890> a

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
and transmit the those signals through a

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.180 
and transmit the those signals through a
hard<00:05:29.150> wire<00:05:29.480> out<00:05:29.780> to<00:05:30.500> an<00:05:30.620> artificial

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
hard wire out to an artificial

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.150 
hard wire out to an artificial
prosthesis<00:05:31.580> and<00:05:32.030> in<00:05:32.780> theory<00:05:33.110> you<00:05:33.680> would<00:05:33.710> be

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
prosthesis and in theory you would be

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.290 
prosthesis and in theory you would be
able<00:05:34.520> to<00:05:34.930> control<00:05:35.930> an<00:05:36.260> artificial<00:05:36.920> hand<00:05:37.300> using

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
able to control an artificial hand using

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.970 
able to control an artificial hand using
a<00:05:38.480> thought<00:05:38.720> process<00:05:38.990> in<00:05:39.410> the<00:05:39.530> brain<00:05:39.770> it's

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
a thought process in the brain it's

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.400 
a thought process in the brain it's
bionic<00:05:41.660> limbs<00:05:42.660> with<00:05:44.450> we<00:05:45.450> talk<00:05:45.660> about<00:05:45.810> bionic

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
bionic limbs with we talk about bionic

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.030 
bionic limbs with we talk about bionic
limbs<00:05:46.650> yeah<00:05:46.950> and<00:05:47.550> I<00:05:47.610> think<00:05:47.820> it's<00:05:47.940> a<00:05:48.590> it<00:05:49.590> may<00:05:49.980> be

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
limbs yeah and I think it's a it may be

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.790 
limbs yeah and I think it's a it may be
you<00:05:50.550> know<00:05:50.700> a<00:05:50.910> few<00:05:51.120> years<00:05:51.450> away<00:05:51.780> but<00:05:52.170> i<00:05:52.320> think<00:05:52.680> it

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
you know a few years away but i think it

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.040 
you know a few years away but i think it
is<00:05:52.830> doable<00:05:55.850> rody<00:05:56.850> was<00:05:57.030> walking<00:05:57.450> game<00:05:57.660> within<00:05:57.930> a

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
is doable rody was walking game within a

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.130 
is doable rody was walking game within a
couple<00:05:58.200> of<00:05:58.350> days<00:05:59.240> his<00:06:00.240> recovery<00:06:00.780> then<00:06:00.960> was

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
couple of days his recovery then was

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.950 
couple of days his recovery then was
over<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.470> next<00:06:01.770> six<00:06:01.950> months<00:06:05.630> Raleigh<00:06:06.630> has<00:06:06.840> an

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
over the next six months Raleigh has an

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.660 
over the next six months Raleigh has an
excellent<00:06:07.200> life<00:06:07.500> runs<00:06:07.830> around<00:06:07.950> very<00:06:08.310> happily

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
excellent life runs around very happily

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.930 
excellent life runs around very happily
and<00:06:08.970> would<00:06:09.810> not<00:06:10.050> be<00:06:10.320> here<00:06:10.650> if<00:06:10.860> it<00:06:11.550> wasn't<00:06:11.670> for

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
and would not be here if it wasn't for

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.480 
and would not be here if it wasn't for
that<00:06:12.150> technology<00:06:12.840> so<00:06:13.110> I<00:06:13.500> would<00:06:13.830> say<00:06:13.980> to<00:06:14.040> people

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
that technology so I would say to people

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.040 
that technology so I would say to people
who<00:06:14.520> say<00:06:14.610> well<00:06:14.970> why<00:06:15.180> should<00:06:15.720> you<00:06:15.840> use<00:06:16.020> that

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
who say well why should you use that

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.500 
who say well why should you use that
technology<00:06:16.650> well<00:06:17.640> look<00:06:17.850> him<00:06:18.030> in<00:06:18.120> the<00:06:18.240> eye<00:06:18.270> and

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
technology well look him in the eye and

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.260 
technology well look him in the eye and
you<00:06:18.660> tell<00:06:18.990> Dennis<00:06:19.830> his<00:06:20.010> honor<00:06:20.220> to<00:06:20.610> put<00:06:21.060> him<00:06:21.150> to

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
you tell Dennis his honor to put him to

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.450 
you tell Dennis his honor to put him to
sleep<00:06:21.300> because<00:06:21.900> that<00:06:22.200> wasn't<00:06:22.620> necessary<00:06:23.220> and

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
sleep because that wasn't necessary and

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:33.840 
sleep because that wasn't necessary and
gardens<00:06:24.450> research<00:06:25.430> made<00:06:26.430> this<00:06:27.000> possible

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.110 

he's<00:06:34.850> getting<00:06:35.090> um<00:06:35.620> more<00:06:36.620> treats<00:06:36.980> and<00:06:37.370> more<00:06:37.610> fun

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
he's getting um more treats and more fun

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.660 
he's getting um more treats and more fun
out<00:06:38.330> of<00:06:38.360> life<00:06:38.570> because<00:06:39.230> he<00:06:39.830> has<00:06:39.980> only<00:06:40.220> in

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
out of life because he has only in

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.940 
out of life because he has only in
theory<00:06:41.060> maybe<00:06:41.570> he<00:06:41.900> only<00:06:42.080> has<00:06:42.350> another<00:06:42.620> six

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
theory maybe he only has another six

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.250 
theory maybe he only has another six
months<00:06:43.010> to<00:06:43.340> go<00:06:43.520> so<00:06:44.210> his<00:06:44.390> quality<00:06:44.780> of<00:06:44.810> life<00:06:44.900> now

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 
months to go so his quality of life now

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.140 
months to go so his quality of life now
is<00:06:45.410> much<00:06:45.650> better<00:06:45.950> we<00:06:46.280> do<00:06:46.460> more<00:06:46.670> now<00:06:46.910> than<00:06:47.090> we

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
is much better we do more now than we

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.510 
is much better we do more now than we
did<00:06:47.270> before<00:06:47.570> because<00:06:48.530> I'm<00:06:48.710> trying<00:06:48.980> to<00:06:49.040> cram<00:06:49.310> in

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
did before because I'm trying to cram in

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.700 
did before because I'm trying to cram in
what<00:06:50.240> we<00:06:50.360> would<00:06:50.480> maybe<00:06:50.690> be<00:06:51.110> doing<00:06:51.320> over<00:06:51.440> three

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
what we would maybe be doing over three

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.590 
what we would maybe be doing over three
or<00:06:51.800> four<00:06:51.950> years<00:06:52.100> enter<00:06:52.520> into<00:06:52.880> the<00:06:53.150> next<00:06:53.420> six

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
or four years enter into the next six

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.780 
or four years enter into the next six
months
