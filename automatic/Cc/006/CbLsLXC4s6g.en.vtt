00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.810
 play nintendo 64 games what are we going 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.940
 to do here at the bar 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.940
 with the good web internet go to the link 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:24.640
 that I will leave in the description 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:27.070
 for project 24 they download it 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.000
 and it's very fast this the truth the 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.000
 experiment 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.900
 more wait a moment because it takes longer 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.900
 that is downloaded 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.470
 is for all the windows is the 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.920
 64 server project for all 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.810
 windows inside so you have the oldest 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.410
 evaluation I'm going to cancel it because 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.410
 I already have it 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.670
 cancel 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:59.219
 the two seems to be something like that 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.219
 never west they install it 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.120
 normal to install both 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.120
 nothing happens 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.470
 [Music] 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.190
 moment 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.520
 [Music] 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:24.110
 you can not believe we have it unloaded 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.110
 when here download 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.450
 in 1.6 and I have 1.7 but then we're going 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.450
 to download instantly 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.849
 [Music] 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.400
 I felt like removing it because it's removed 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:49.140
 the discharge was removed I can not find 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.140
 it's a problem of this 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.959
 [Music] 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.620
 you may have downloaded it in 3.6 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.210
 they go here to mex 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.680
 Good thing we also put you next 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.130
 been all everything here in the middle they put 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.130
 plus 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.160
 thank you, change 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.810
 you depend on the folder depends on the 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.810
 folder where the overflow disappear 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.410
 this has to charge after 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.430
 Load them will appear something like 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.210
 I will also leave the link 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.950
 in the description I will leave you 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.430
 the link of all the games that are 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.430
 they can 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.410
 will send us all 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.290
 in it for the same page 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.760
 normal that depends on the hockey they put 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.280
 there I will put the name of the game 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.280
 and below the link take more from here 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.550
 [Music] 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.280
 and whole is very slow that's why it worked 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.280
 without 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.740
 Well, although I think that at a higher price 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.210
 [Music] 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.460
 you get back 8 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.710
 of this 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.290
 Spanish ok 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.730
 it is unloading who mario the 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.970
 neighborhood 74 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.700
 because I already have it 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.040
 [Music] 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.630
 once is all when you download it 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.730
 is going to put this and it depends on the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.260
 saved folder already 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.260
 open round 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.380
 the round are the games 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.199
 here are all my only three choruses 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:42.180
 that are the only ones that I like I go 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.180
 to play super Mario 64 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:11.210
 and then I see him play on me in my project 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:15.050
 64 because this I have control of xbox 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:18.279
 and the control from what you configure in the 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:25.129
 pre 64 and it is not configured by project 60 and 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:29.870
 66 16 1.6 and I have the 1.7 is the same 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:32.919
 nothing but I put the bad 74 1.7 because 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.919
 I have configured 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.810
 to 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:47.509
 here if you want to also configure your 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:51.449
 control if you have two play box of what 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:55.599
 that is that you leave and here says 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:59.439
 how do you have to configure one already 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:02.169
 It's fine that's why you saw, I have the 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:05.079
 control of xbox and urine taxi I put the 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:07.910
 project 1.6 which is the one that you are going to 

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:11.230
 download will not leave me 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:15.410
 and they also configure it and they give it a click 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.940
 here to jump and now more the button 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.150

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.150

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.669

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.669
 [Music] 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.290
