mascara here we have volume shocking I

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.979

thought<00:03:57.400> this<00:03:57.520> was<00:03:57.700> L'Oreal's<00:03:58.209> top<00:03:58.480> mascara

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
thought this was L'Oreal's top mascara

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.780 
thought this was L'Oreal's top mascara
next<00:03:59.140> to<00:03:59.380> balling<00:03:59.709> this<00:03:59.830> until<00:04:00.160> bare<00:04:00.370> natural

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
next to balling this until bare natural

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.300 
next to balling this until bare natural
came<00:04:00.970> out<00:04:01.150> but<00:04:01.780> it's<00:04:01.930> decent<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.590> say<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.130> one

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
came out but it's decent I say the one

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.460 
came out but it's decent I say the one
thing<00:04:03.520> it<00:04:03.640> has<00:04:03.670> over<00:04:04.060> ver<00:04:04.239> natural<00:04:04.660> is<00:04:05.020> that<00:04:05.200> it

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
thing it has over ver natural is that it

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.710 
thing it has over ver natural is that it
provides<00:04:05.830> better<00:04:06.040> volume

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
provides better volume

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.930 
provides better volume
other<00:04:07.720> than<00:04:08.080> that<00:04:08.230> it's<00:04:09.190> not<00:04:09.250> really<00:04:09.670> like<00:04:09.820> the
