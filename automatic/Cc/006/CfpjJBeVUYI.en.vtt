mods and this is one of them so this mod
is<00:00:32.730> kind<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.149> old<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.809> hasn't<00:00:34.170> been<00:00:34.260> updated

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
is kind of old it hasn't been updated

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.560 
is kind of old it hasn't been updated
for<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> while<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.550> still<00:00:36.000> play<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.450> on

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
for a while you can still play it on

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.299 
for a while you can still play it on
0.9.5<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.730> kind<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.410> bugging<00:00:40.410> kind<00:00:41.129> of

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
0.9.5 but it's kind of bugging kind of

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.729 
0.9.5 but it's kind of bugging kind of
bursting<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.450> right<00:00:42.629> texture<00:00:42.989> pack<00:00:43.320> I

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
bursting you the right texture pack I

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.160
