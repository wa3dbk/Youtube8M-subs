have reduced the permanent price to $15

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.260 
have reduced the permanent price to $15
however<00:00:15.599> there<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.900> no<00:00:15.929> longer<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:17.270> monthly

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.220 
price so I'm just going to show you a
new<00:00:20.670> speed<00:00:20.939> comparison<00:00:21.480> with<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> new<00:00:21.930> server

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
new speed comparison with a new server

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.950 
new speed comparison with a new server
we<00:00:22.470> have<00:00:22.650> now<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.789> I'm<00:00:23.970> going<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.810> my

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
we have now so I'm going to this is my

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.679 
we have now so I'm going to this is my
iphone<00:00:25.500> 4s<00:00:25.980> as<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.490> can<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:26.820> from<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.330> signal

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
iphone 4s as we can see from the signal

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.400 
iphone 4s as we can see from the signal
break<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.590> SIM<00:00:28.769> card<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.539> here<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> GSM

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
break and the SIM card and here is a GSM

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.030 
break and the SIM card and here is a GSM
iphone<00:00:31.920> 4<00:00:32.960> so<00:00:33.960> let's<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> quick<00:00:34.620> speed

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
iphone 4 so let's just do a quick speed

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.430 
iphone 4 so let's just do a quick speed
comparison<00:00:35.520> keep<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.090> mind<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.600> has<00:00:36.840> an<00:00:37.020> a4

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
comparison keep in mind this has an a4

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:47.350 
comparison keep in mind this has an a4
processor<00:00:37.590> which<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.280> slower<00:00:38.520> than<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.790> a5

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:57.410 

how's<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.629> weather<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:57.000> we<00:00:57.030> actually

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
how's the weather so here we actually

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.680 
how's the weather so here we actually
saw<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.780> faster<00:00:58.320> speed<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.940> iphone<00:01:00.239> 4<00:01:00.480> then

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
saw a faster speed on the iphone 4 then

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.109 
saw a faster speed on the iphone 4 then
the<00:01:00.809> 4s<00:01:01.140> let's<00:01:01.500> try<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.770> different<00:01:02.070> question

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:17.480 

how's<00:01:06.119> apples<00:01:06.540> stock<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.100> see<00:01:17.280> that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
how's apples stock so here we see that

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.030 
how's apples stock so here we see that
the<00:01:17.580> iphone<00:01:17.909> 4<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.509> performing<00:01:19.140> faster<00:01:19.770> than

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
the iphone 4 is performing faster than

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.749 
the iphone 4 is performing faster than
the<00:01:20.189> iphone<00:01:20.549> 4s<00:01:21.799> so<00:01:22.799> now<00:01:23.100> i'm<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.549> show

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the iphone 4s so now i'm going to show

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.460 
the iphone 4s so now i'm going to show
you<00:01:23.790> another<00:01:24.299> speed<00:01:24.630> comparison<00:01:25.140> between<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
you another speed comparison between the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.370 
you another speed comparison between the
iphone<00:01:25.890> 4s<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.729> ipad<00:01:27.240> keep<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.080> mind<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
iphone 4s and the ipad keep in mind the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.890 
iphone 4s and the ipad keep in mind the
ipad<00:01:28.680> has<00:01:28.920> significantly<00:01:29.700> less<00:01:30.060> ram<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
ipad has significantly less ram but the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:42.530 
ipad has significantly less ram but the
same<00:01:31.110> processor<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.040> iphone<00:01:32.430> 4<00:01:41.329> how's<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
same processor as the iphone 4 how's the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.910 
same processor as the iphone 4 how's the
weather<00:01:47.750> here's<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.960> forecast<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.560> today

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
weather here's the forecast for today

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.980 
weather here's the forecast for today
through<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.430> Monday<00:01:50.880> let's<00:01:51.659> try<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.930> one

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
through this Monday let's try that one

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.069 
through this Monday let's try that one
more<00:01:52.079> time<00:01:52.200> um<00:01:53.329> when<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> next<00:01:54.750> solar

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
more time um when is the next solar

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:05.179 
more time um when is the next solar
eclipse<00:02:01.399> your<00:02:02.399> question<00:02:03.409> so<00:02:04.409> here<00:02:04.770> we<00:02:04.950> see

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
eclipse your question so here we see

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.399 
eclipse your question so here we see
once<00:02:05.490> again<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.329> ipad<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.930> loading

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
once again that the ipad is loading

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.880 
once again that the ipad is loading
faster<00:02:07.710> than<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> iphone<00:02:08.819> 4s<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.560> server

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
faster than the iphone 4s so this server

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.940 
faster than the iphone 4s so this server
is<00:02:11.039> actually<00:02:11.670> performing<00:02:12.239> faster

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
is actually performing faster

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.280 
is actually performing faster
then<00:02:13.040> Apple<00:02:13.430> servers<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.780> hope<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.260> guys

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
then Apple servers so I hope you guys
