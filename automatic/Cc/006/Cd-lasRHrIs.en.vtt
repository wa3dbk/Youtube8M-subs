00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.279
 and if I like not to shake something 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.619
 A) Yes 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.360
 this trend I will speak for 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:14.600
 depends on that in a program 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.100
 television that for example I do gymnastics 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.650
 I like to be at one feels that there is a 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.710
 TV in the place and I see 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.710
 television and I finished his putting in a 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.679
 work in those interior the now there is no 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.130
 a nice news in my country and I think 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.090
 that is not the case, it seems to me all bad 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.250
 our country 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.800
 I have a vision not so 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.320
 tremendista I loved yesterday a little day 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.329
 what what what francella said does not 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.559
 I feel very identified with what 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.930
 I say in your program 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.780
 I have a tendency to try to see 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.699
 everything there is and what is missing and I 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.850
 it seems that sometimes in the eagerness of 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.399
 criticize this we are missing 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.769
 precious time to move forward to 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.289
 correct to discuss for example 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.550
 punctually the topic is of the of the 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.670
 people 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.610
 of these beatings if it is good or bad 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.470
 It is definitely wrong to smoke and in 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.230
 keep talking about a reality that 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.630
 it is not so we are objective and we are 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.820
 sensitive with things that happen not 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.610
 also wonderful that are 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:27.320
 superior to the wonderful lord the 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:31.120
 I kept this thing now 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.120
 tendentious to me generates me 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.670
 between those people and me as is the song 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.680
 of that age there is something personal to me I do not 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.000
 Like how I do not like the other one 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.820
 side either my husband neither argentina nor 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.710
 switzerland nor the lucerna liberal danny south 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:53.920
 ics is to write then if you ask me 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.380
 this is my answer I do not like the 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.600
 agitators do not put those who confuse 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.250
 you saw when you see this statement 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.610
 these actions are intended to blame 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.929
 only to the media or only 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.209
 I do not like the extreme but there 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.640
 means it's worth I know if it's a burden 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.940
 a person appears in hidden love for 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.440
 you know that title was not for the 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.560
 cover then those things to me I do not 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.900
 they like how I do not like how they said 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.910
 is that it's going to be mercy instinct instead 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.019
 of opponent is also must generate 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.209
 rating 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.980
 with more readers but 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.299
 you can also put cute things in 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.269
 a television program at a level 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.269
 news because things happen too 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.790
 tell the reality 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.489
 actually the message of the societies 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:57.609
 do something please in front of the 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.590
 insecurity for that when in addition to 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.930
 message of the society those of the message 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.560
 of the people who behave that way 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.269
 way he does not feel that he behaves that way 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.069
 way I do not know what message is broadcasting 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.329
 I think it's a horror that I think there's 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.599
 nation and I think they are implementing 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.849
 many policies of the new laws that 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.459
 needed for a society that the 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.139
 has changed and that is debated and that all 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.560
 the policy will basically be in the 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:26.799
 Congress not any programs 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.769
 huge review of everything that is of what 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.150
 that mercedes morán said yesterday I could not 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.219
 see the program for the boys I 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.040
 they waited with some cuts and be during 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:38.139
 the day on the field to the exit someone 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.290
 he told me he saw what Mercedes morán said and 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:43.010
 He said he was not in another matter but he is 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.860
 very interesting 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.500
 to involve women this artist 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.110
 exceptional that mercedes morán that with 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.739
 a lot of calm it seems that he put a little 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.790
 order on a table that was a bit 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:01.099
 devastated by the feeling of insecurity 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.010
 and all those stories that are given and that 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.190
 mix in realities with fictions what 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.019
 that can not be denied with what 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.230
 fable from the media 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.470
 fabled in the sense of making one 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.780
 look like a thousand and everything we already know 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.090
 they say it was extraordinary how 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.940
 that mercedes morán spoke yesterday in that 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.800
 program and how it had been related to 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.380
 francella was the audio that they made me 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.479
 listen when I came with hernán abella 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.100
 that does the putting in the air of our 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.100
 program that we did mix this
