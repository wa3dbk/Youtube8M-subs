vodka jr. um I see him figuring out

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.010 
vodka jr. um I see him figuring out
first<00:02:21.410> uh<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:22.340> know<00:02:22.460> first<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.240> distance

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
first uh you know first the distance

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.350 
first uh you know first the distance
between<00:02:24.980> them<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.490> seeing<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.910> rhythm<00:02:26.210> that

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
between them and seeing the rhythm that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.940 
between them and seeing the rhythm that
bad<00:02:26.750> kids<00:02:27.020> had<00:02:27.940> his<00:02:28.940> tendencies<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.710> think

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
bad kids had his tendencies and I think

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.200 
bad kids had his tendencies and I think
that<00:02:31.100> you'll<00:02:31.280> feel<00:02:31.460> amount<00:02:31.760> in<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:31.940> first

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
that you'll feel amount in the first

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.090 
that you'll feel amount in the first
round<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.630> see<00:02:32.810> where<00:02:33.380> he<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.620> probably<00:02:33.860> wrong

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
round to see where he is probably wrong

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.820 
round to see where he is probably wrong
once<00:02:34.370> he<00:02:34.460> starts<00:02:34.760> getting<00:02:34.850> that<00:02:35.150> rhythm<00:02:35.360> in

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
once he starts getting that rhythm in

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.200 
once he starts getting that rhythm in
and<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:36.950> think<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.340> everything<00:02:37.820> will<00:02:37.910> be<00:02:38.060> good

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
and I think that everything will be good

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.720 
and I think that everything will be good
final<00:02:39.200> question<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.710> whole<00:02:39.890> world<00:02:40.190> is

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
final question the whole world is

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.820 
final question the whole world is
waiting<00:02:41.150> for<00:02:41.570> Paquiao<00:02:42.050> Mayweather<00:02:42.500> do<00:02:42.770> you

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
waiting for Paquiao Mayweather do you

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.630 
waiting for Paquiao Mayweather do you
think<00:02:43.040> it's<00:02:43.190> ever<00:02:43.370> going<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.670> happen<00:02:44.440> if<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.680> is

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
think it's ever going to happen if it is

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.240 
think it's ever going to happen if it is
that's<00:02:47.000> quick<00:02:47.510> if<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.320> did<00:02:48.500> happen<00:02:48.680> who<00:02:49.070> would

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
that's quick if it did happen who would

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.180 
that's quick if it did happen who would
you<00:02:49.370> pick<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.760> women<00:02:50.350> Pacquiao<00:02:51.350> has<00:02:51.410> doing<00:02:52.040> it

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
you pick the women Pacquiao has doing it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.210 
you pick the women Pacquiao has doing it
you<00:02:52.430> know<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:52.610> mean<00:02:53.200> Mayweather<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.680> feel<00:02:55.070> like

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
you know I mean Mayweather I feel like

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.850 
you know I mean Mayweather I feel like
he<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:56.600> know<00:02:56.720> he's<00:02:56.930> picking<00:02:57.260> his<00:02:57.290> opponent

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
he you know he's picking his opponent

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.040 
he you know he's picking his opponent
and<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.430> think<00:02:58.700> he's<00:02:58.910> he's<00:02:59.270> scared<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.720> fighting

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
and I think he's he's scared of fighting

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.840 
and I think he's he's scared of fighting
someone<00:03:00.350> that<00:03:00.500> was<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.620> southpaw<00:03:01.070> I<00:03:01.430> think<00:03:01.730> the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
someone that was a southpaw I think the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.880 
someone that was a southpaw I think the
reason<00:03:02.000> why<00:03:02.270> he's<00:03:02.630> holding<00:03:03.080> out<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:03.440> long<00:03:03.620> the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
reason why he's holding out so long the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.310 
reason why he's holding out so long the
reason<00:03:04.160> why<00:03:04.250> he<00:03:04.310> picked<00:03:04.760> even<00:03:05.090> Marquez<00:03:05.510> to

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
reason why he picked even Marquez to

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.860 
reason why he picked even Marquez to
fight<00:03:07.130> when<00:03:07.550> more<00:03:07.730> kids<00:03:07.940> can<00:03:08.120> barely<00:03:08.540> make<00:03:08.690> the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
fight when more kids can barely make the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.390 
fight when more kids can barely make the
weight<00:03:09.050> because<00:03:09.440> of<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.650> fact<00:03:09.830> that<00:03:09.950> he's<00:03:10.220> so

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
weight because of the fact that he's so

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.400 
weight because of the fact that he's so
much<00:03:10.550> lighter<00:03:10.880> than<00:03:11.030> me<00:03:11.330> with<00:03:11.510> it<00:03:11.660> you<00:03:12.380> know

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
much lighter than me with it you know

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.220 
much lighter than me with it you know
kind<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.310> makes<00:03:13.489> one<00:03:13.760> thing<00:03:14.330> if<00:03:14.660> he's<00:03:14.930> afraid

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
kind of makes one thing if he's afraid

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.410 
kind of makes one thing if he's afraid
if<00:03:15.560> his<00:03:15.890> weakness<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.430> fighting<00:03:16.850> cell<00:03:17.150> phones

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
if his weakness is fighting cell phones

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.479 
if his weakness is fighting cell phones
and<00:03:17.840> concerned<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:18.680> Maddie's<00:03:18.950> not<00:03:18.980> just<00:03:19.370> the

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
and concerned that Maddie's not just the

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.110 
and concerned that Maddie's not just the
regular<00:03:19.970> southpaw<00:03:20.420> he<00:03:20.630> has

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
regular southpaw he has

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.160 
regular southpaw he has
braddock<00:03:23.190> random<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.370> this<00:03:24.840> makes<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:26.049> lot

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
braddock random and this makes it a lot

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.140 
braddock random and this makes it a lot
harder<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.560> read<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.370> think<00:03:27.489> something<00:03:28.060> like

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
harder to read so I think something like

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.619 
harder to read so I think something like
that<00:03:28.360> because<00:03:28.510> he's<00:03:29.080> so<00:03:29.319> unorthodox<00:03:30.360> he's<00:03:31.360> not

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
that because he's so unorthodox he's not

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.619 
that because he's so unorthodox he's not
in<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.200> box<00:03:32.440> like<00:03:32.890> most<00:03:33.220> boxers<00:03:33.640> are<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:34.209> think

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
in the box like most boxers are I think

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.059 
in the box like most boxers are I think
that's<00:03:34.810> what<00:03:35.140> is<00:03:35.519> his<00:03:36.519> Mayweather<00:03:37.060> spear<00:03:38.069> so

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
that's what is his Mayweather spear so

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.830 
that's what is his Mayweather spear so
here<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.340> is<00:03:39.430> from<00:03:39.640> Rachel's<00:03:40.150> mouth<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.659> your

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
here it is from Rachel's mouth to your

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.140 
here it is from Rachel's mouth to your
ear
