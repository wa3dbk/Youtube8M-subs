 well it's all from the first page to the second 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.610
 I have a page set 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.259
 applications which are slightly because 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.820
 and I don't like to keep these on the phone 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.610
 applications that I don't use 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.740
 that is, if I need it, I can 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.799
 download and then delete all i have 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.799
 folder is simple which application which 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.149
 on the phone just like that 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.579
 standard which I do not use 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.439
 except a calculator and probably so 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.890
 just hooray again so they don't get me 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.110
 interfered with 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.509
 No more for me because there is no 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.490
 I do not like when everything is organized by 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.070
 daddies laid out there program for 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.320
 photo processing area in my social networks 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.789
 interspersed 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.689
 before their perfume can make me grandma 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.100
 just too lazy to google 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.310
 the first application that I have here 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.560
 there is this shiz application for laying 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.450
 music for example if you go somewhere in 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.450
 the store and here is playing some cool 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.399
 song such turn on he listens and 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.020
 so to say what kind of song are you 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.209
 Downloading gypsum 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.640
 the next application is a film search I them 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.709
 I use as a poster that is, I see that 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.050
 today what cinema is going to the cinema 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.930
 to have the film well, and watch trailers of different 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.090
 new movies movies movies following 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.980
 the application is called waka player 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.959
 this is simply ingenious application because 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.209
 that in the iPhone some kind of zapara with music 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.970
 there everything is hard to download and listen at all 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.900
 so this one is super ie only 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.599
 there is vkontakte 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.280
 you can save it and then without 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.709
 internet just listen to it 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.319
 then I have a sensitive game there is a game 100 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.930
 balls called cups go on 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:48.319
 circle and need balls to lose cups 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:50.840
 so that the balls are not confused following 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.090
 count is called tudor i just bay this 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.780
 terrible time because about such 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.760
 simple 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.099
 a kind of cool I like that it is no 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.329
 any type of problems in short the essence of the game 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.459
 that you are given using 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:05.890
 colorful balls that you should 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:08.450
 connect with each other and they will only 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.220
 get out forgive me for what it is 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.709
 of course tells the next game 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.380
 similar to the previous one almost the same 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.180
 only with squares need to connect 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.720
 among themselves in a square of different colors 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.910
 the next game is called the wing essence 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.190
 the game is that you have to come up with your 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.859
 disease and infect and then end up all 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.150
 the land that is for coming up with all sorts 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.970
 disease symptoms to pins will 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.220
 transferred and you should do so 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.230
 for the whole planet to be infected with yours 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.319
 the disease is very wing the next game 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.450
 called magical 5th to me always 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.450

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.140
 cool application it is called 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.219

 why is she hanging by me 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.329
 I just sometimes go into it and matter 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.989

 called a mixture with she of course cool 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.389

 already it is very curve following 

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:41.439
 the application is called power core i7 

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:43.479
 I downloaded only to do these 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:45.549
 crooked faces like my blog 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.860
 it may be follow many 

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:50.110
 asked what kind of application so here 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.509
 yes powercom there is still a lot of things you can 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.729
 do but i only use this 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.799
 funny thing and the latest application 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.689
 associated with photos called 

00:05:56.799 --> 00:06:00.789
 Moldir in this application can do 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:02.049
 all sorts of different collages and what is she to me 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.039
 I like what you need to do here 

00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:05.469
 manually 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.879
 that is, any settings to resize 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.979
 photos in your collages 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:11.349
 there you can also make collages for the magazine 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:13.059
 type such voice pens are free 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.849
 application to create 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:16.419
 position creation in order to do 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:18.789
 collages 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.999
 simply speaking and at the very end we are only two 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.539
 games they really paid killed smelly 

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:26.409
 clubs and 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:28.419
 this type of monument puzzle game 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:30.550
 You can say the essence of the game is that 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:33.659
 some little girl walks by 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.919
 such a magical world and all of this type 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:38.919
 geometric all shapes need all 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:41.079
 collect all 10 tracks so that it passes 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.629
 she's so hard but not cool 

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:46.079
 sit down generally for a long time on her somewhere over 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:48.849
 a day has passed and i just have no power place and 

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:50.919
 whether the last to develop mbow is 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:53.199
 such a perishable black and white game 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:55.599
 you walk by some kind of perishable boy 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:58.360
 to some black and white world and the point is 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:00.699
 what does not need a boy to die is he 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.679
 so as not to drown not hanged himself just 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.819
 peristalsis then you want therefore 

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:06.639
 liked the game 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:08.800
 graphics and tobacco it is made shorter well 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:11.050
