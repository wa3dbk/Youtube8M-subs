the spring approximately one inch when

the spring approximately one inch when
installed<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.760> neutral<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:18.930> will<00:00:19.170> produce

installed and neutral this will produce

installed and neutral this will produce
a<00:00:19.740> tension<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.520> approximately<00:00:21.240> 25<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.750> 30

the<00:00:26.070> pn<00:00:26.400> violet<00:00:27.060> link<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.599> i<00:00:27.660> used<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.990> different

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the pn violet link so i used a different

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.900 
the pn violet link so i used a different
link<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.890> accomplished<00:00:29.429> by<00:00:29.519> inserting

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
link this is accomplished by inserting

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.939 
link this is accomplished by inserting
one<00:00:30.060> end<00:00:30.330> okay<00:00:30.599> well<00:00:30.750> i<00:00:30.779> did<00:00:30.990> all<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.289> but

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
one end okay well i did all that but

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.840 
one end okay well i did all that but
it's<00:00:32.130> definitely<00:00:32.369> showing<00:00:33.920> that<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.219> springs

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it's definitely showing that the springs

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.119 
it's definitely showing that the springs
are<00:00:36.090> stretched<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.719> i<00:00:37.079> tried<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.829> strike<00:00:38.070> a

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
are stretched so i tried to strike a

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.840 
are stretched so i tried to strike a
difference<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.879> i<00:00:39.860> installed<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
difference and i installed it with the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.880 
difference and i installed it with the
springs<00:00:42.260> just<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.680> would<00:00:44.579> say<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.750> snug

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.040 

they're<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.190> stretched<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.690> they're<00:00:51.840> just

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
they're not stretched but they're just

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.639 
they're not stretched but they're just
snug<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.309> appears<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.230> when<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.350> swivel

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
snug and it appears that when you swivel

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.060 
snug and it appears that when you swivel
the<00:00:55.829> tailwheel<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.180> unlocks<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:58.070> quite

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the tailwheel that it unlocks it quite

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.580 
the tailwheel that it unlocks it quite
readily<00:00:59.480> before<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.570> gets<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> stop<00:01:01.350> of

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
readily before it gets to the stop of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.429 
readily before it gets to the stop of
the<00:01:01.710> rudder<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:04.880> and<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.810> still<00:01:07.049> got<00:01:07.200> quite<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the rudder so and I still got quite a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.420 
the rudder so and I still got quite a
bit<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.710> runner<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.010> go<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:10.130> would<00:01:11.130> say<00:01:11.280> it's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
bit of runner to go and I would say it's

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.830 
bit of runner to go and I would say it's
just<00:01:11.490> barely<00:01:11.909> snug<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.590> anyway<00:01:14.220> that's<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
just barely snug so anyway that's the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.210 
just barely snug so anyway that's the
new<00:01:15.840> laying<00:01:16.140> tail<00:01:16.500> wheel<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.770> spring

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
new laying tail wheel and the spring

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.670 
new laying tail wheel and the spring
adjustment<00:01:21.110> how<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> did<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:24.530> seems<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.619> be

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
adjustment how I did it seems to be

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.399 
adjustment how I did it seems to be
pretty<00:01:25.950> straight<00:01:26.369> shot

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.889 

and<00:01:32.409> as<00:01:32.649> far<00:01:32.890> as<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:34.619> turning<00:01:36.659> usually<00:01:37.659> pretty

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
and as far as it turning usually pretty

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:50.930 
and as far as it turning usually pretty
good

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:01.310 

again<00:01:51.940> it<00:01:52.300> releases<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:54.850> about<00:01:56.280> there<00:01:57.280> so

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.300 

seems<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.440> be<00:02:02.530> about<00:02:02.710> right<00:02:02.979> we're<00:02:03.130> going<00:02:03.280> to

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
seems to be about right we're going to

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:11.070 
seems to be about right we're going to
go<00:02:03.430> out<00:02:03.550> and<00:02:03.670> tax<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.180> test<00:02:04.450> it

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.050 

and<00:02:12.080> see<00:02:12.350> how<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.560> goes<00:02:13.040> anyway<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:16.130> Lang

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
and see how it goes anyway the Lang

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.390 
and see how it goes anyway the Lang
tailwheel<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:19.390> installation
