00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.370

 in short, the tree is the last day of 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.360
 how can i enjoy it then i wanted to do it 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.819

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:13.889
 my kids did at school and that didn't 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.539
 potato door ni colony because of b 2 2 

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:18.569
 then more beautiful is without a doubt 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:22.679
 this one here is purist ball of 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:26.130
 beautiful christmas this was made 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.509
 it really was a mom that one 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.599
 mom of our class that together 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.429
 to the other one before they have operated 

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:34.560
 so precisely other materials helped i 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.389
 children to do the chore and us 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.179
 all to thank you and we did 

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:41.959
 a basket for parents with products from 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:46.109
 Fair Trade Store and it really is 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.800
 beautiful but with the hands of massacres of 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.170
 English 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.770
 the math teacher has already done 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.570
 this 4 this arena I have subscribed to 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:03.150
 Christian apples because it has a nose made 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:06.180
 so and lorenzo instead this is the cd 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.700
 conflict merry christmas made in star with 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.010
 behind a little poem for the party of 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.900
 Christmas the most beautiful I would like 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.960
 make me a clear promise bugs bunny 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.180
 to the promise of being as good as 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:23.430
 little jesus like all the little angels 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.930
 concerning the car is true 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.390
 and every year practically my home 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.120
 is enriched by these objects which 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.040
 that I learn around the house then me 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.050
 he would have liked to ask him to make you 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.840
 see what our people did 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.560
 children in kindergarten or school 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.180
 elementary 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.470
 but I realize that today is more 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.300
 families that maybe many of you have 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.060
 still they have already folded things up though 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.350
 I would love it so much I don't say 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.380
 because we don't even see just one 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:54.140
 postpones some photographs I would be 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.390
 was happy and then another thing 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.050
 I would like to know where the hell you are 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.610
 children when you work children 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.410
 instead I'm home for the holidays 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.610
 this year you find in the room in 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.620
 hotel were not particularly 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.720
 long in the sense that I started on 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.670
 22 but still in the fridge before school 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.890
 also on Saturday 22 still went to 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.810
 school and start again tomorrow which 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.400
 it's just 7 then there just aren't there 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.630
 have been pontist mind attacking 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.630
 so the other night is particularly 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.250
 strong and I settled you all in 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.300
 a structure called you is called 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.370
 the swirl of associations that 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.440
 during the year we say its meaning 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.540
 normal a kindergarten wishing 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.250
 he would also have the opportunity to do 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.440
 elementary schools but I think al 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.630
 so there are no classes then 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.519
 we say that it is private and then during 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.700
 summer there was the afternoon boys 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.959
 every afternoon we say a moment of 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.030
 graph for which you can bring 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.130
 bring the children and a structure that 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.230
 it doesn't cost me particularly dear because 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.100
 I take you for half a day at 10 euros a 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.630
 baby and all day long he wants 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.739
 say in my case from 8am until 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.480
 five in the afternoon 15 euros being 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.400
 two children instead of making me 30 have me 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.989
 fact 25 then in short compared to 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.250
 other problem structures parts in 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:13.970
 ceti archecontrol salvador is definitely 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.530
 it is not very expensive although unfortunately there 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.430
 we brought to eat that for me is 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.949
 always 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.139
 and just the night before and you never know 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:25.039
 what to prepare him and you have to vary all 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:27.169
 days and then let's say you what 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.820
 basically he is so vivid 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.289
 it's not a big problem because 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.470
 whatever you give him the least 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.060
 lorenzo lorenzo instead remains the first 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.530
 time this structure took him 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.570
 ma.be life that is costing me 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.190
 really a lot for a few days 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.210
 because then precisely from two therefore the 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.639
 then leave and then he instead of 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.360
 he eats he eats too much 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:52.039
 so willingly then or a little 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.660
 crisis so if you want girls sent 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.099
 what kind of structures what 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.620
 feed you because I already have 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.210
 find all the pasta I do not 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.460
 cook the cold one the night before 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.740
 under the water so that it does not bloom 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.139
 too much and then I tried with the pies 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.759
 salt and then or with the meatballs of 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.740
 meat in short things that at the most are 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.180
 they can heat in the microwave though if you 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.400
 do you have any idea since then every 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.310
 what I don't find all summer 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.630
 however also in March now though 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.210
 forgive a little holiday in short easter 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.190
 premature and in any case at easter 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.199
 surely I will have to settle it 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.729
 at least he would give me some good ones 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.409
 idea of ​​something to fit that yes 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.260
 it can only warm up I would be much 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.580
 very very very happy then it is a 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.080
 a little late to wish him well though 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.599
 I can wish you a good recovery 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.520
 of the normal life of normality 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:38.810
 because now it starts again with the 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.610
 school that begin all the activities 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.349
 We begin with the sun various things 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.009
 catechism and focuses on starting again 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:48.169
 to run basically and then 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:50.810
 I send my best wishes for today for ball 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.550
 epiphany and for a good recovery and there 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.669
 see you again soon 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.669
 Hello
