00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.029
 further about conformance tables 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.849
 of application 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.990
 shank lengths have already been spoken to me 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.990
 why i apply 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:22.439
 I will show how I do as I ask the masters 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.420
 make me land 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.300
 this is also not a simple thing competently 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.110
 shank fit or else 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.680
 tip on the body of the arrow 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.590
 must be performed correctly unfortunately 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.920
 than i rush about this 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.240
 in fact, very, very many subtleties 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.540
 even in a snap just such a thing 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.620
 grapes she is not used to rice if you can 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.620
 call it all in the collection 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:57.980
 so here I ask the masters to apply 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.100
 the so-called movement here 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:07.930
 it is executed surely about. 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:10.490
 I hope it will be seen here and so 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.710
 carried pro. so called 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:20.030
 humiliation and spinning shank on the body 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.860
 arrows we remove all the load from the thread 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.860
 and all the talk about that 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.130
 screw connection loosens the harpoon 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.520
 they practically do not consist us if 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.170
 very well carved and 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.300
 tip mate aroma made 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.870
 the tip of his mate 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.380
 with the body of an arrow what is the place itself 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.030
 thread 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.380
 it ceases to be a hub 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.050
 the stress of striding attacks all 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.220
 load here you can see all these 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.440
 one and a half centimeters 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.570
 finds a shank here I twist 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.920
 thread tails and titanium expose 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.570
 find one and a half centimeters on those 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.960
 shots run into the groove 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:03.300
 and kink load from the thread dropped drops 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:07.350
 and confirmed not by moles fighting 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.270
 real fights with big fish bodies 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.960
 Lyuli tied a ram's horn but never 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.970
 it was not 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.020
 kink on the thread I have no tips 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.820
 merkulov could happen next even 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.880
 back in the transition area right here 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.340
 never tips not landing 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.860
 tipped body boom and landing 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.860
 shank find his arrows 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.560
 This is a very important question for him. 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.680
 need to pay attention 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.019
 further we will consider further 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.730
 a constructive solution that I really 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.439
 I like to come too 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.239
 as far as i remember the ball to the crown type 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:47.359
 Of course, before this, someone has already come to this 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.920
 came can so it turns out that 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:53.540
 some things never come hunters 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.540
 they themselves already exist 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:03:05.870
 I use these harpoons I will have two 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:13.739
 Now I will show a pair of boots from 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:15.510
 he was looked at this chain well it is not 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:21.060
 The essence is important to explain to explain 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:26.150
 what I wanted to say here I apply 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:30.060
 very tricky thing if 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.709
 unscrew the tip of the grip it's not 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.719
 tip I would call that bike 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.639
 tip to my understanding have 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:40.949
 holding devices flash drives 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.840
 the clamp of the fungus can still be 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.810
 dropping the tip on the cable us he 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.639
 must hold the fish 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.560
 gives my understanding only performs 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.579
 sagging trying function 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.549
 and holding on its own 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.319
 so I call it a bike me 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.530
 price tags i try to carry price tag 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.590
 spike case if by his hair dye 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:09.359
 and got lost blunt unwound on 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:11.810
 for some reason, I definitely have me 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.099
 I ask the master to perform 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.650
 do become it all sharpens me in 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:20.000
 mostly all things like that 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.770
 sly thin master andrey klymenko 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.580
 very literate man with gold 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.690
 hands master andrew proper forums 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.840
 nice currency with such a person and friend 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.659
 friend literally that the word 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.430
 there is no need many moments have passed 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:40.220
 then skated here seen 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.360
 I hope it will be seen here too 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.590
 performed and the movement here is carving 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.240
 then filmed shot 5 millimeters movement 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.460
 hammer is made exactly the same thread 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.430
 here we saw carving rested I 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:01.100
 I wind and more than five millimeters 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.730
 the dagger sits on the body of the arrow on it 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.700
 humiliation on pro. 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.840
 be sure I am landing on 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.810
 polyethylene 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.830
 on some detachable connections on 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.580
 liquid rubber 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.530
 I do not sit on loctite and on superglue and in 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.600
 principle can but does not require heating and i 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.400
 I think it's too much to sit on 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:29.210
 the usual flew we will also consider a little 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.310
 the fact that one more point here besides 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.260
 the fires of zhania to which we came in order 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.600
 to shoot on Russian destiny with me 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:41.310
 thread sharpen necessarily produce 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:45.240
 sharpening why again if 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:48.870
 lost warlock lost flooded i can 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.270
 shoot just thread if the shooting is not 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.190
 on the rocks of which principle too 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.270
 big problem carving will come together and 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:59.190
 can be fixed on the machine or cut 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.130
 as a last resort well i haven't lost in 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.560
 hunting that is, in it all the gear in general 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.229
 we are all the whole world approach outfit this 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.370
 maximum reliability 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:12.840
 say condo volske maximum 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:17.370
 reliability because i am my principle 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:20.550
 hunt it be always ready meeting with 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.380
 trophy, even if a number of these are 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.830
 hunting there not knit we do not shoot 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.870
 big fish and going out 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.880
 our we can not go to corso with 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:34.240
 the pleasure of hunting gives me 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:37.210
 pleasure or pike for big but 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.729
 can get caught all and always from this 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:44.560
 positions I proceed 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:45.660
 we reviewed buy uk we reviewed buy 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.889
 uk 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.759
 next we look at the selection 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:50.759
 binga
