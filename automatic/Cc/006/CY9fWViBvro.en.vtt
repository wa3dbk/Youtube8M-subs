to go the way to this oh you can hear

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.400 
to go the way to this oh you can hear
your<00:00:45.420> pressure<00:00:45.600> place<00:00:45.870> but<00:00:46.079> there's<00:00:46.289> an

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
your pressure place but there's an

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
your pressure place but there's an
impression<00:00:46.890> place<00:00:47.070> down<00:00:47.340> here<00:00:50.780> yeah<00:00:51.949> blue<00:00:52.949> so

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
impression place down here yeah blue so

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.760 
impression place down here yeah blue so
this<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.239> record<00:00:54.480> six<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.350> recall<00:00:55.590> one

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
this can record six it can recall one

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.529 
this can record six it can recall one
more<00:00:55.949> I'll<00:00:56.129> go<00:00:56.340> back<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.239> used<00:00:57.449> to

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
more I'll go back to this one used to

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.529 
more I'll go back to this one used to
show<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:57.870> reuse<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:59.359> yes<00:01:00.359> see

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
show you I can reuse this yes see

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.240 
show you I can reuse this yes see
there's<00:01:00.719> no<00:01:00.840> pressure<00:01:01.020> plates<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.680> I'll

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
there's no pressure plates it's I'll

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.039 
there's no pressure plates it's I'll
show<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.910> pixels<00:01:03.300> are<00:01:03.449> back<00:01:03.780> there

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
show you what the pixels are back there

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.340 
show you what the pixels are back there
but<00:01:04.290> these<00:01:04.470> pressure<00:01:04.799> plates<00:01:05.299> anyway<00:01:06.350> let's

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
but these pressure plates anyway let's

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.960 
but these pressure plates anyway let's
go<00:01:07.590> play<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.700> first<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:11.479> is<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.970> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
go play so first on that is that and the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.520 
go play so first on that is that and the
good<00:01:15.150> thing<00:01:15.180> about<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.869> i<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.320> read

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
good thing about this is that i can read

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.100 
good thing about this is that i can read
it<00:01:16.680> again<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.600> read<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:18.900> many

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
it again so this is I can read as many

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.420 
it again so this is I can read as many
times<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.650> want<00:01:23.689> yep<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:25.380> works<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
times as I want yep it works and to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.910 
times as I want yep it works and to
erase<00:01:27.060> all<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.780> memory<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.619> click<00:01:28.829> this

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
erase all the memory I just click this

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.609 
erase all the memory I just click this
button<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:30.450> does<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.439> see<00:01:31.590> that

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
thing blinking over that it usually

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.969 
thing blinking over that it usually
takes<00:01:33.420> around<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.720> second<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.110> two<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.290> delete

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
takes around a second or two to delete

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.859 
takes around a second or two to delete
everything<00:01:35.280> there<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.420> everything's

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
we go anyway just uses ol D flip-flops

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.330 
we go anyway just uses ol D flip-flops

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
want to get down into detail causes

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.530 
want to get down into detail causes
quite<00:01:51.960> confusing<00:01:52.619> but<00:01:53.090> just<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.210> show<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.420> how

quite confusing but just to show you how

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.719 
quite confusing but just to show you how
everything<00:01:54.899> works<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.369> basically

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
everything works here this is basically

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.830 
everything works here this is basically
everything<00:01:57.360> all<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.530> Oh<00:01:59.390> some<00:02:00.390> down<00:02:00.630> to

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
everything all of this Oh some down to

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.350 
everything all of this Oh some down to
this<00:02:01.020> little<00:02:01.979> D<00:02:02.430> flip-flop<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.000> an<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.299> gate

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
this little D flip-flop in an and gate

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.080 
this little D flip-flop in an and gate
oh<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:05.009> how<00:02:05.159> everything<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.640> responding

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
oh and how everything is responding

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.139 
oh and how everything is responding
really<00:02:06.270> fast<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:07.020> using<00:02:07.469> instant<00:02:07.860> wire<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.489> you

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
really fast is using instant wire so you

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.820 
really fast is using instant wire so you
can<00:02:09.300> make<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.599> really<00:02:09.869> big<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.530> not<00:02:10.709> going

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
can make this really big it's not going

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.589 
can make this really big it's not going
to<00:02:10.950> delay<00:02:11.220> or<00:02:11.250> anything<00:02:11.790> it's<00:02:12.239> still<00:02:12.420> going<00:02:12.540> to

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
to delay or anything it's still going to

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.550 
to delay or anything it's still going to
be<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> same

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
be in the same

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.640 
be in the same
as<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.489> debris<00:02:14.849> time<00:02:15.360> takes<00:02:15.780> nine<00:02:16.140> ticks

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
as this so debris time takes nine ticks

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.130 
as this so debris time takes nine ticks
for<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.489> information<00:02:17.849> to<00:02:18.330> come<00:02:18.660> up<00:02:18.780> from<00:02:18.930> this

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
for the information to come up from this

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.170 
for the information to come up from this
memory<00:02:19.620> area<00:02:19.950> or<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.190> way<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.459> your<00:02:20.760> display

memory area or the way to your display

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.990 
memory area or the way to your display
and<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:22.319> takes<00:02:22.650> around<00:02:25.220> five<00:02:26.870> tix<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:29.000> write

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
whatever i'm getting off track anyway

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.160 
whatever i'm getting off track anyway
there's<00:02:59.549> basically<00:02:59.730> a<00:03:00.000> d<00:03:00.269> flip-flop<00:03:00.690> for<00:03:00.870> you

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
there's basically a d flip-flop for you

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.690 
there's basically a d flip-flop for you
cool<00:03:01.739> kids<00:03:01.950> up<00:03:02.130> there<00:03:02.160> who<00:03:02.400> don't<00:03:02.519> know

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
cool kids up there who don't know

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.220 
cool kids up there who don't know
anything<00:03:02.940> about<00:03:03.209> this<00:03:03.450> because<00:03:03.750> i<00:03:03.900> didn't

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
anything about this because i didn't

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.259 
anything about this because i didn't
know<00:03:04.319> anything<00:03:04.560> about<00:03:04.709> this<00:03:05.130> until<00:03:05.760> i<00:03:05.819> started

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
know anything about this until i started

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.170 
know anything about this until i started
into<00:03:06.569> this<00:03:06.599> project<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.920> d<00:03:08.489> flip-flop<00:03:08.970> is

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
into this project a d flip-flop is

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.140 
into this project a d flip-flop is
basically<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.340> your<00:03:11.459> input<00:03:11.610> area<00:03:11.910> it

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
basically you have your input area it

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.990 
basically you have your input area it
has<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.420> be<00:03:12.510> toggled<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.250> for<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.400> get<00:03:14.790> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
has to be toggled and for it to get the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.780 
has to be toggled and for it to get the
memory<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.599> have<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:16.080> clock<00:03:16.349> it<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:17.609> just

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
memory you have to clock it so you just

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.520 
memory you have to clock it so you just
have<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.060> activate<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:19.049> then<00:03:19.200> we<00:03:19.260> go<00:03:19.380> the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
have to activate that and then we go the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.660 
have to activate that and then we go the
memory<00:03:19.799> stays<00:03:20.100> on<00:03:20.480> yeah<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:22.410> read<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:23.010> have

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
memory stays on yeah and to read I have

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.009 
memory stays on yeah and to read I have
this<00:03:23.880> red<00:03:24.180> line<00:03:24.209> up<00:03:25.140> is<00:03:25.380> reading<00:03:26.060> input<00:03:27.060> this

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
this red line up is reading input this

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.280 
this red line up is reading input this
is<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.380> reading<00:03:28.590> output<00:03:29.190> if<00:03:29.630> I<00:03:30.630> do<00:03:31.140> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
is the reading output if I do the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.680 
is the reading output if I do the
reading<00:03:31.650> input<00:03:32.250> as<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.940> can<00:03:33.090> see<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.510> output

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
reading input as you can see the output

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.410 
reading input as you can see the output
is<00:03:33.959> whatever<00:03:34.319> this<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.709> so<00:03:35.250> if<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.000> clock<00:03:36.299> it

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
is whatever this is so if I clock it

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.449 
is whatever this is so if I clock it
again<00:03:36.690> since<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.230> nothing's<00:03:37.680> on<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.220> will

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
again since I nothing's on it will

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.410 
again since I nothing's on it will
disappear<00:03:38.670> that's<00:03:39.420> off<00:03:39.980> that's<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.420> reading

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
disappear that's off that's the reading

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.319 
disappear that's off that's the reading
now<00:03:42.600> it's<00:03:42.930> nothing<00:03:43.410> it's<00:03:43.859> off<00:03:44.329> that's

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
now it's nothing it's off that's

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.819 
now it's nothing it's off that's
basically<00:03:45.600> how<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:45.780> works<00:03:46.109> it<00:03:46.260> uses<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.590> lot<00:03:46.769> of

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
basically how it works it uses a lot of

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.300 
basically how it works it uses a lot of
instant<00:03:47.579> wire<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:49.049> not<00:03:49.200> complicated<00:03:49.680> it

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
instant wire this is not complicated it

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.699 
instant wire this is not complicated it
might<00:03:50.519> look<00:03:50.730> complicated<00:03:51.090> but<00:03:51.480> it's<00:03:52.200> just

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
might look complicated but it's just

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.910 
might look complicated but it's just
pretty<00:03:53.670> simple<00:03:54.209> here<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:54.900> have<00:03:55.319> to<00:03:55.470> reset

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
pretty simple here I have to reset

that's<00:04:23.490> on<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:23.849> surf<00:04:24.210> reset<00:04:24.690> time<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:25.680> make<00:04:25.919> that

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
that's on a surf reset time to make that

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.790 
that's on a surf reset time to make that
four<00:04:26.490> tix<00:04:26.880> because

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
four tix because

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.260 
four tix because
instant<00:04:28.800> wire<00:04:28.949> can't<00:04:29.250> be<00:04:29.370> toggled<00:04:29.729> on<00:04:29.849> or<00:04:29.909> off

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
instant wire can't be toggled on or off

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.360 
instant wire can't be toggled on or off
it<00:04:30.599> just<00:04:31.080> sends<00:04:31.319> a<00:04:31.469> to<00:04:31.650> post<00:04:31.949> in<00:04:32.129> the<00:04:32.189> matter

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
it just sends a to post in the matter

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.779 
it just sends a to post in the matter
what<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:32.879> I<00:04:32.909> had<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.150> extend<00:04:33.569> that<00:04:33.870> post<00:04:34.169> with

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
what so I had to extend that post with

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.270 
what so I had to extend that post with
Cyrus<00:04:35.789> no<00:04:35.819> lashes<00:04:36.500> all<00:04:37.500> right<00:04:37.710> that's

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
Cyrus no lashes all right that's

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.129 
Cyrus no lashes all right that's
explaining<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.389> memory<00:04:39.900> system<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:41.550> explain

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
explaining the memory system to explain

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.270 
explaining the memory system to explain
how<00:04:43.139> all<00:04:43.469> these<00:04:43.830> works<00:04:44.159> basically<00:04:45.150> I<00:04:45.180> have

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
how all these works basically I have

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.980 
how all these works basically I have
arrows<00:04:47.280> on<00:04:47.520> pressure<00:04:47.789> plates<00:04:48.180> as<00:04:48.419> you<00:04:48.659> can<00:04:48.840> see

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
arrows on pressure plates as you can see

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.550 
arrows on pressure plates as you can see
it<00:04:49.199> activates<00:04:49.800> when<00:04:50.370> I'm<00:04:50.490> Europe<00:04:50.969> if<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.560> really

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
it activates when I'm Europe if I really

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.779 
it activates when I'm Europe if I really
go<00:04:53.400> really<00:04:53.789> far<00:04:54.120> away<00:04:54.300> around<00:04:54.659> here<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:54.960> think

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
go really far away around here I think

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.409 
go really far away around here I think
yeah<00:04:56.789> offs<00:04:58.639> this<00:04:59.639> is<00:04:59.819> actually<00:05:00.240> quite

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
yeah offs this is actually quite

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.269 
yeah offs this is actually quite
complicated<00:05:00.930> we're<00:05:01.590> not<00:05:01.710> really<00:05:01.860> complicated

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:02.279 
complicated we're not really complicated

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:04.249 
complicated we're not really complicated
to<00:05:02.370> explain<00:05:02.400> just<00:05:02.669> take<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.120> bit<00:05:03.509> of<00:05:03.539> time<00:05:03.750> so

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
to explain just take a bit of time so

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.550 
to explain just take a bit of time so
I'm<00:05:04.379> going<00:05:04.560> to<00:05:04.620> save<00:05:04.860> that<00:05:04.889> for<00:05:05.279> next<00:05:05.310> video

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
I'm going to save that for next video

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.369 
I'm going to save that for next video
but<00:05:07.560> that's<00:05:08.430> how<00:05:08.849> you<00:05:08.909> basically<00:05:09.629> detect<00:05:10.110> its

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:10.379 
but that's how you basically detect its

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:15.640 
but that's how you basically detect its
fresher<00:05:10.830> play<00:05:11.129> fire<00:05:11.490> underneath<00:05:12.319> arrow<00:05:13.639> yeah

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
fresher play fire underneath arrow yeah

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.360 
fresher play fire underneath arrow yeah
the<00:05:16.650> number<00:05:17.900> well<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:19.229> good<00:05:19.259> the<00:05:19.949> really<00:05:20.219> good

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
the number well the good the really good

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.580 
the number well the good the really good
thing<00:05:20.550> about<00:05:20.669> this<00:05:21.029> system<00:05:21.270> is<00:05:21.569> that<00:05:21.629> this

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
thing about this system is that this

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.290 
thing about this system is that this
will<00:05:22.800> work<00:05:22.830> all<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.430> time<00:05:23.460> when<00:05:23.939> you<00:05:24.029> leave

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
will work all the time when you leave

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.140 
will work all the time when you leave
the<00:05:24.509> server<00:05:24.779> when<00:05:25.020> you<00:05:25.110> come<00:05:25.349> back<00:05:26.060> when<00:05:27.060> you

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
the server when you come back when you

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.610 
the server when you come back when you
leave<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.479> chunk<00:05:27.750> and<00:05:27.900> come<00:05:28.110> back<00:05:28.289> it<00:05:28.529> will

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
leave the chunk and come back it will

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.999 
leave the chunk and come back it will
still<00:05:28.889> work<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:30.000> only<00:05:30.389> bad<00:05:30.930> side<00:05:31.469> to<00:05:31.770> this<00:05:31.949> is

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
still work the only bad side to this is

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.399 
still work the only bad side to this is
that<00:05:32.219> sometimes<00:05:32.909> the<00:05:33.060> arrows<00:05:33.539> get<00:05:33.990> deleted

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
that sometimes the arrows get deleted

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:37.490 
that sometimes the arrows get deleted
they<00:05:35.039> don't<00:05:35.370> despawn<00:05:36.089> they<00:05:36.360> just<00:05:36.629> get<00:05:37.080> deleted

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
they don't despawn they just get deleted

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.439 
they don't despawn they just get deleted
for<00:05:37.830> some<00:05:38.009> reason<00:05:38.460> maybe<00:05:38.969> because<00:05:39.210> it's<00:05:39.389> just

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
for some reason maybe because it's just

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.209 
for some reason maybe because it's just
too<00:05:39.629> many<00:05:39.870> arrows<00:05:40.139> or<00:05:40.680> something<00:05:41.039> I<00:05:41.159> don't

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
too many arrows or something I don't

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:43.969 
too many arrows or something I don't
know<00:05:41.400> about<00:05:42.169> anyway<00:05:43.169> they<00:05:43.440> just<00:05:43.680> delete

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
know about anyway they just delete

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.430 
know about anyway they just delete
themselves<00:05:44.639> for<00:05:44.789> some<00:05:44.969> strange<00:05:45.300> reason<00:05:45.539> it's

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
themselves for some strange reason it's

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.959 
themselves for some strange reason it's
not<00:05:46.500> a<00:05:46.620> dude<00:05:46.889> spoon<00:05:47.190> I'm<00:05:47.430> hundred<00:05:47.940> percent

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:47.969 
not a dude spoon I'm hundred percent

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:50.680 
not a dude spoon I'm hundred percent
sure<00:05:48.300> it's<00:05:48.509> not<00:05:48.599> a<00:05:48.659> team<00:05:48.900> sport<00:05:49.169> but<00:05:50.159> anyway

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
sure it's not a team sport but anyway

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.420 
sure it's not a team sport but anyway
