00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Those who win outdistance are now 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.080
 one of the most impressive things 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.929
 of the universe of games in quality and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.790
 very simple to steam paetê pockets case 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.950
 The game you bought does not work on 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.109
 your computer or in case you do not like 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.449
 I play because I'm young so who says 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.880
 told the news to the minimum 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.279
 details why kotaku made a story 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.960
 not getting into the stick and sending a 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.250
 negative point about the initiative of the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.130
 which is one of the best initiatives 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.960
 that we already had in the universe of then 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.610
 I'll tell mills there really set me 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.110
 we will assess it impartially 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.440
 rethink about all the negatives 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:43.079
 positive, so do not leave if you do not 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:47.539
 she called me paqui, even doing 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.539
 this is something all upas by ct 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.170
 briefly the news is exactly 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.570
 that China has now launched a policy 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.610
 refund of riffa or leave nobody 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.260
 in the description I only found English - to the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.789
 when the premium happens to happen after the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.739
 Portuguese star can not also that 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.530
 how is it going to work in 14 days 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.110
 you have less than two hours played 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.180
 otherwise I bought the game for 14 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.070
 Today I got to play two hours. 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.930
 I can go there to sting and request the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.880
 reimbursement for why you 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.979
 stay for 14 days with one player less than 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.630
 two hours with him because he sometimes 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.000
 your computer does not work because 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.740
 You'll like the game, you 'll have it. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.960
 within that 14-day period you do not 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.610
 played dodo came to play of the game you 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.350
 can request reimbursement to stretch the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.360
 principle seems perfect I do not vote 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.310
 deal launched 13 of this size and I read 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.020
 all because I made a point of mourning because 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.060
 talked about the negatives so I read one 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.320
 text of this size in kotaku to know 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.420
 why maybe there was a point 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.950
 negative and I even understand what they 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.470
 they spoke but I do not think it's a 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.750
 worry our wave with the taco or 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.430
 anyone to create controversy on top of 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.770
 best decision for games that have already 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.329
 have had in recent times 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.009
 when he said that the news is good for 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.110
 example to who bought the witcher 31 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.850
 300 hours two hours on twitter is not 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.560
 Nothing and you can not play at 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.840
 Brazil even because you did not like it 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.640
 of the expensive game and 300 hours that maybe you 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.320
 really regret buying these 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.969
 14 days this would be nothing more fair 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.560
 you get repayment them 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.629
 They pointed out two concerns moreover three 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.520
 pumps the biggest concerns the first is 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.080
 user behavior means with 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.580
 two hours having that software 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.990
 your computer because the user 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.760
 can do with it sometimes until 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.230
 even the ace to the game sometimes pick up 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.630
 all the game files the parent in the 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.850
 torrent and return the game then the mother 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.070
 with Sergio of kotaku at this point is the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.690
 the main concern of kotaku in this 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.910
 matter that they did was really 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.340
 scoring said that the behavior of 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.410
 consumer users may not be 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.090
 worthy then guys use this to 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.830
 to facilitate piracy according to 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.210
 point pointed and leaves I think it is 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.470
 valid but extremely simple 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.450
 to solve is the fact that small 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.250
 indian games producers minor games 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.500
 for example the metal gear solid of 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.080
 Phantom well I can not get a game. 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.820
 funec the bissau metal and of great turned 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.680
 He had what it takes you will up to 40 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.209
 minutes in theory if you buy 10 to 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.820
 40 years you can request a refund 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.980
 fills this year according to what 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.530
 they are compromising they may have to 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.940
 and if yes you should already give in 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.320
 pocket and that they thought that 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.480
 could harm smaller companies 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.630
 companies that produce second-hand games 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.820
 of a dinha one day né of shorter line 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.410
 with other types of proposals is a 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.390
 much shorter experience and that this 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.340
 would break the companies because it would generate 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.840
 these companies a rule that has a game 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.730
 that has at least two hours of steel 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.739
 duration for you to produce this 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.330
 game and launch your cpi instinct that a 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.340
 older videos in relation to the 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.900
 games that is quoted in the average sculpture 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.640
 but they 're really really strong in the 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.900
 games that amazes me a lot that they 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.040
 news start of way 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.480
 necessarily polemical indelicately 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.030
 inducing people to behave 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.220
 Just right every single one of them, you crazy shit in mine. 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.810
 room talking about news or 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.519
 This I'm going to get here I'm going to leave the scene 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.739
 besides anything without thinking a little 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.019
 in the games market in the 15km is 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.700
 him because he wants kotaku to be the right 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.530
 carry any shit when it comes to 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.420
 this happens with the company rate 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.370
 It is clear that, of course, this 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.930
 because it obviously does not express 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.180
 nothing of the gamers ' interest in this 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.769
 first point of user behavior 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.840
 user behavior is not this 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.580
 refund policy that will say something 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.590
 or do not say something about it actually 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.299
 when you create a refund system 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.910
 You decide this in Brazil, since the 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.799
 valve via braid plus a vargas if you 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.090
 buy three games three in a row 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.830
 to see the two hours since the 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.989
 presence of 97 horses will not open the 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.459
 look at you and other all products 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.650
 individually in the world of the 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.360
 consumer needs a policy of 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.200
 anything expensive I'll say 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.000
 the consumer and returns simply 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.920
 both it and even so it is a 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.780
 slutty big companies the 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.910
 companies may by rules bring 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.740
 regulate this return policy 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.840
 you have not suffered any damage for example 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.370
 A clothing store talks you can not 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.780
 take label then I do not know you 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.340
 want to buy T-shirt and worked with 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.840
 the tag hung to ask and the 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.760
 convertible money back her 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.740
 will not accept to see brands use will not 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.150
 hit if you have ripped anything from the 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.820
 type will not accept 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.280
 Dancem has reasons that will make the store 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.200
 and refuse to return if you arrive 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.870
 to the legal point of something of the 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.520
 type usually in doubt the defendant, right? 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.200
 always doubt the judge will aside more 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.210
 weak is usually the consumer 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.130
 but if the company can prove that 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.930
 person is wrong or the person is 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.210
 acting in bad faith this function is not 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.280
 obligatory then the first point 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.140
 is the one who detected the misbehavior of 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.640
 a user or is the guy against the game 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.470
 and he returns three because he wanted 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.270
 make a copy of the files or crack or 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.950
 whatever face devil who would make a 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.870
 good game but that is banish this user 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.790
 and nobody wants to lose a user in the 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.710
 extinguished. 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.440
 you if the guy is bad character to the point 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.150
 want to use this return policy 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.780
 For your own benefit it will 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.310
 harm 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.290
 so it does not have to be the concern of the 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.480
 kotaku beauty the second concern is 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.040
 that all of the issue of summer games 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.660
 have to be at least two hours old and can 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.730
 development companies 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.350
 games in Utah is a bit more bearable 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.880
 see a little heavier that she 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.290
 Why did you say that? 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.330
 companies that want to do 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.950
 games that lasted less than two hours of 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.350
 some way this really can yes 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.260
 damage to the sale of this product in 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.420
 once again we enter into the policies of 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.160
 if that user is extinguished 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.450
 night the car keeps changing and creating 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.490
 several different users and that 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.470
 eyes team has done in other ways 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.120
 to find out if that user is 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.650
 buying games books have duration of 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.120
 less than 12 hours finishing games 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.560
 because this has no way of knowing if you 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.810
 came to the end of a warm and 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.700
 returning the team can also fight 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.440
 with relations, moreover, exchange policy 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.780
 also serves some products you 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.000
 can not return then you buy 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.280
 the game and that's all that leaves a warning 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.500
 of this size all this product does not 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.590
 goes through the website repayment process is 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.210
 simple if it knows is the boot the text attacks 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.860
 of this size and there at the end they 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.900
 they say that something really good for 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.310
 company proposes the use of the game is just to think 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.990
 only on the positive side in this matter 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.620
 There's nothing negative after all who 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.090
 do not need 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.889
 by doing this they are doing this 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.389
 thinking about the consumer then does not 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:44.710
 It is up to you to create a 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:47.590
 list of problems as if the 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.750

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.690
 simplistic on the website of the back saying that 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.370

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.440
 can exchange for regardless of the reason is 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.150
 scared a little more in the back post 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.040
 because almost 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.080
 digital game company does this is from 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.600

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:44.860
 date onwards that as I said that 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.870
 14-day period that most of the 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.340
 games and of course no longer hit 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.940
 this term but that's it wants your
