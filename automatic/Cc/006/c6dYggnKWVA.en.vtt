 because this dream will become buzz or 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:20.020

 fake listings 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.450
 the Germans have crossed the border 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.540
 the 88:30 in the morning the first 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.430
 the ways were the gendarmes of the 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.230
 brigade of game niches these gendarmes have 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.480
 received the order to retreat to cork 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.830
 which they would go by target they 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.130
 followed the movements of the army 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.750
 up to the gendarmes who 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.670
 have arrived at sight all came from 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.310
 the brigade of gemmenich he was 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.810
 controlled by a holding hours ago 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.360
 had the gendarmes Taillefer job 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.100
 do they reject and goofy they go 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.860
 monitor the progress of the army 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.660
 German making time stops 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.630
 in time this hiding to try oise 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.540
 where they are and they will progress towards 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.620
 targeted they will arrive from the north of 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.950
 sighted by the rue du moulin 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.260
 they obviously do not know that by 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.900
 other ways the Germans are already 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.700
 arrived when they get there 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.730
 must know that it is the second army 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.820
 theft and mich know which brands 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.710
 ayed since crossing the border 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.830
 hours and hours of troops that 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.780
 go on horseback on horseback 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.020
 hundreds of cars already at 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.300
 the time is a huge army that 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.280
 landed it's thirty thousand men who 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.709
 will be engaged the first day by 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.680
 there but no amish they are going to compete 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.209
 they are over 1 against 100 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.640
 the gendarmes will arrive from the north 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.740
 by the street white louis they will pass 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.109
 in front of the college is adler it's a 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.200
 where we already have in anticipation 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.640
 install a red cross antenna 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.630
 obviously you have to imagine the city 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.790
 in a completely different context 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.620
 since at the time the buildings 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.170
 do not exist in front of the college are 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.650
 loans 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.320
 they are weapons the gendarmes must 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.850
 judge a tire broke out from the street of 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.350
 of the world to beat 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.940
 boucau the policeman directly 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.950
 doubts fundamentally take refuge behind 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.620
 one starts to derive profit tied that 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.590
 wanted a 1889 rifle that shoots 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.750
 it's the Germans in the face 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.360
 line is directly from a truce 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.150
 working perfectly legal after the pdl 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.330
 the others obviously a lot and by 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.470
 land the Germans will start to 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.230
 take off an hour of a war will be 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.720
 butchers bakers will have the hand busted 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.720
 by a bullet so impossible to rearm 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.370
 a rifle a payfair lock will be hit 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.470
 in turn 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.140
 he will take a ball at the level of the 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.850
 throat and facade in front of which list 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.710
 rousset splashed with his blood that is going 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.270
 stay there for months and who will 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.280
 also mark populations 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.820
 result of the races we will end up 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.870
 with two seriously wounded who will be 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:30.930
 transferred to the red cross at the 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.090
 sat channel adlene a wounded lighter 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.360
 baker who will go to activities 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.640
 that they come back to tell without 1918 and 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.730
 two dead auguste boucau and jean pierre 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.450
 teale that will stay forever lying on 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.850
 the city floor 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.890
 the fight to aim is important 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.840
 particular for the gendarmerie in 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.880
 sense that this is it's very first 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.200
 military engagement until then 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.630
 gendarmes they are military but 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.850
 their mission they are rather civil 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.490
 so I think that explains 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.500
 why this fight will mark both the 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.710
 memories and we have kept several 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.440
 rather moving memories especially the 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.810
 bonnet with thil hair that we have here 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.140
 behind us there is also the holding 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.570
 complete with boucau his comrade boucau 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.330
 who she is at the army museum 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.100
 there are also guns from one of the two 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:24.060
 gendarmes who are kept at 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.470
 museum the city of visit we are here 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.540
 at the cemetery of lorette on the heights 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.430
 to aim 7 in this lawn of honor 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.330
 that are buried all the soldiers of 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.010
 1914 as jean pierre teale moreover 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.470
 auguste boucau louis for his part is 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.820
 buried at cork cork cemetery 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.670
 on the vizelia monument square 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:44.190
 specific and dedicated to goofy and helpful 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.230
 it's a monument that was erected just 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.270
 after the 14 hours war memory and 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.570
 this monument been destroyed by the occupier 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.640
 German 1942 I would like to do it again at 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:57.090
 the same the monument as it was 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.070
 before it was destroyed in 1942 to sell 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.659
 maja it's two fighters who are 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.979
 fell there because we have 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:04.939
 memory duty that is essential is 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:06.219
 that we must pass on to 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:08.449
 future generations 

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:10.219
 there are not many people today 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:13.310
 who can tell us about the war 14 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:15.469
 first and then even the next and 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.419
 I think we have a duty 

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:19.550
 essential to tell the generations 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:21.560
 following which should not forget this 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.610
 happened in the past because 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:29.509
 history never does that 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:38.300
 repeated Nazis on the teen wolf of 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:41.539
 living room and police officers 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:44.870
 alone augustus in october jean wirth 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:46.310
 and to the friends of the clues are of 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.639
 new sales 

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:52.750
 a police officer that craze such a goal in 

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:52.750
 form of an app
