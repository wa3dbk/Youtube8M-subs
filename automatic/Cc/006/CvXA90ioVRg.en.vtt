00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
purely because that's the only shirt

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.969 
purely because that's the only shirt
which<00:01:57.719> has<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.079> shade<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.469> green<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.829> we

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
which has the shade of green that we

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.590 
which has the shade of green that we
wanted<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.790> was<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.329> make<00:02:00.420> this

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
wanted and I was just going to make this

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.120 
wanted and I was just going to make this
shirt<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:00.960> myself<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.500> then<00:02:01.590> leave<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.920> there

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130

but<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.340> thought<00:02:02.579> maybe<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.880> few<00:02:03.090> other<00:02:03.270> people

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
but I thought maybe a few other people

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.090 
but I thought maybe a few other people
wouldn't<00:02:03.899> want<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> dark<00:02:04.409> one<00:02:04.680> they<00:02:04.799> wanted

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
wouldn't want the dark one they wanted

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.530 
wouldn't want the dark one they wanted
to<00:02:05.159> match<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.610> original<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:06.270> much<00:02:06.420> as

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
to match the original as much as

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.080 
to match the original as much as
possible<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.259> yeah<00:02:08.069> if<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.819> give<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.030> the
