00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.449
 so 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:16.149
 not the case arose because i like you of course they go 

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.300
 put together and a short do followed 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.679
 usually separate from the salmon defender because it is there that i put on 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.560
 my preference because the real work has gone 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.929
 to 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.520
 for me the idea was around me 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.130
 the standard is to bring the police than the pass that tell more about 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.850
 A woman who ensures that is of course also on whether there is one 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.040
 play a role 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.740
 and is the power of reciting 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.740
 pieter 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.030
 the union 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.980
 he is 4 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.180
 gamble 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.360
 the dug out 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.880
 8 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.550
 I want them to be the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.440
 the city impact marks were worse than pigs going to come 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.650
 that is quite a challenge considering that 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.390
 Every summer is often a problem 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.550
 the high council 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.729
 reason 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.100
 who is now 8 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.380
 and the chamber choir is required to be strong in the second 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.610
 device to make things worse for all ages 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.040
 so especially the mystical as a leader to have modern music on it 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.550
 own yard 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.980
 to be heard 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.760
 and this program offers the gesture a great opportunity to get a sample card 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.240
 play and bring musical forms together and yet with a denominator 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.240
 satisfied at the bottom 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.500
 a that of the right also a past of passports of the programs v 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.990
 according to just after the paint job 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.390
 the car i have to sit there a park like the players that can go from all that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.159
 players 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.409
 that says Hans van Heelsbergen disputes that excellent 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.409
 for whom laid because they think from the group 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:29.979
 one of
