 will compete Saturday's quinté will be the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.170
 price jean cabrol a nice test that has 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.800
 gathered 18 starters on the 2700 meters of 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.859
 the big track 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.630
 and in this test because an idea of 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.050
 horses of quality I advise you the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.359
 17 euros for hubert an original horse 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.930
 Italian that knows him well on the floor 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.330
 French 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.940
 he has just won a quinté 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.890
 in vincennes we see it on this video 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.809
 you are on a 2100 meters from the big 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.790
 track then the horse had certainly 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.710
 bravely resisted everything going from 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.910
 gournay to finish but you have to know 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.860
 that the horse had made a big effort 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.140
 to come back in the climb he had 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.610
 then countered and seductive and pictures he 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.020
 had to resist to finish 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.059
 topaz of gournay it is a horse of 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.469
 quality is not going to be bothered by 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.390
 the lengthening of the distance 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.370
 and as they enjoy here a beautiful 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.100
 commitment i let tim able to 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.050
 keep up 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.510
 however, he should be wary of number 4 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.920
 triskell pasha on horseback who set himself 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.110
 evidence and this winter at several 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.640
 times in vincennes he gets along very 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.320
 well with franck nivard he is very 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.150
 performing deferré four feet 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.290
 note that lastly it would be 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.080
 certainly imposed 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.850
 if franck nivard v can the offbeat rather 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.159
 in the straight line they have indeed 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.229
 ended very hard to fail little of the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.009
 victory when certainly the lot was of 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.930
 lower quality 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.610
 it is a horse that is without a term in 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.150
 able to mount category 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.380
 the holmose ciss of a horse also and 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.479
 who has the means 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.250
 he just returned to victory over 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.700
 the racecourse of Crusader-laroche la 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.820
 recipe 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.350
 he resisted by little asterisk asterix 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.509
 by the way who also run in 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.520
 this test that I retained in my 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.710
 selection we will talk about it later so 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.899
 holmose had certainly withstood a little 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.189
 asterix can know that the horse 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.899
 was not really better in the beginning 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.520
 of winter so the horse is on the 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.750
 rising and will this time be deferré 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.890
 four feet this was not the case 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.969
 lastly he was only 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.270
 straightened hind legs 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.770
 it'll be a little more about him 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.119
 and he is certainly able to fight 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.250
 for the first places like the 5 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.659
 torminal m who just realized the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.950
 best performance of his career 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.379
 in the grand prix de paris 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.090
 this game is finished 4th behind 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.300
 champions like baked bread What 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.740
 pond tiego 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.120
 so some I was that day 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.350
 facts of the four feet but this is 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.540
 not embarrassing because she took almost 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.250
 all these guys being shod it's going to be 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.320
 antoine triolet who will settle at his 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.600
 solid car tony nolbert can not 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.120
 bring him but antoine triolet know her 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.780
 very well for having already led him to 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.000
 the arrival on the vincennes racecourse 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.320
 then the number 14 sure and the thune 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 housing that we know well in 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.430
 this category so some did not 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.810
 a very big margin of maneuver but 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.910
 she just finished fourth of 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.550
 the reference test won by water 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.440
 for hubbard that day to she had 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.910
 ended bravely she some 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.860
 could not follow tolca de bellouet and 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.870
 to finish precisely tolca de bellouet 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.480
 it will be the horse that I place in 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.340
 sixth position of my prognosis a 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.400
 mare looking a little bit her run 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.260
 for several weeks by a little the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.300
 same profile as hurel needs a good 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.560
 course to give its full measure 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.040
 but that's the case it seems 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.020
 competitive at least for an accessit in 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.700
 seventh position I put the 8 astier 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.040
 rick so I was talking about it just now 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.480
 just finished second of 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.130
 the lover on the racecourse of the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.780
 cross-stitch the horse comes back 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.790
 also at best he has proven himself 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.800
 in this kind of category then the same 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.060
 as safe and there and tolca from bellouet to 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.920
 have to have it going well that they are 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.480
 do will be conducted in a back but if 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.670
 this is the case he is certainly capable 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.130
 to take a place and finally in 8th 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.050
 position I put the 12 renardo bello 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.739
 which seems to me capable of causing a 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.540
 surprise 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.250
 he also ran well in the race 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.570
 reference this kind was not very 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.070
 happy in the last turn he 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.070
 had come back well finish at the fifth 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.510
 place just behind sure and so has it so 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.130
 the horse is in a good day and can 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.180
 why not spice up the reports 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:57.340
 so my selection in numbers on 17 the 4 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:59.170
 the 6th the 5th the 14th the ninth the 8th and the 12th 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.420
 so if you want to make a game you 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.360
 can you let yourself be tempted by a 2 on 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.380
 4 with my two bases on the 17th and the caté 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.530
 if you want to make games 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.230
 combination for you add the 6 the 5 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.160
 the 14th and the ninth are hello to all 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.160
 on the killer point fr
