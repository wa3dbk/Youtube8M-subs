 Solar-USB Charger Also known as LAH-0009 

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:13.458
 This appliance is capable of: 

00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:17.845
 ¹Connect a USB port and load any USB-capable device (including iPods) 

00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:21.404
 ²Recharge your internal NI-MH battery with an external power source 

00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:24.285
 (Made especially to work with a solar cell I bought from Sparkfun Electronics) 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.800
 Loading iPod Nano 3rd generation 

00:01:08.406 --> 00:01:11.704
 Charging the internal battery with solar energy 

00:01:49.086 --> 00:01:51.078
 Smart charger 

00:01:51.017 --> 00:01:55.245
 An ATmega8 controls charging. Your ADC is connected to the battery and you may notice variations in voltage. 

00:01:55.245 --> 00:01:58.520
 When the charge is complete, the microphone goes into trickle charge mode. 

00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:01.821
 Learning to charge NI-MH batteries 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.989
 I had to test my algorithm and see how it worked on the battery. 

00:02:05.116 --> 00:02:06.876
 The lcd display helped a lot. 

00:02:29.404 --> 00:02:31.560
 Useful information 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.748
 The internal battery composed of 3 AA 2000mAh NI-MH batteries are connected in series. 

00:02:35.748 --> 00:02:39.649
 There are step-up and step-down transformers to supply the USB and charger respectively. 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:41.804
 The micro has its own voltage regulator. 

00:02:41.804 --> 00:02:46.946
 The battery is normally charged to C / 14 and trickle charge to C / 40. 

00:02:46.946 --> 00:02:50.525
 Although C / 14 seems slow, it works best with the Solar Cell, so I chose this value. 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.001
 Useful Information 

00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:56.142
 It was difficult to prepare and cut the outer carton (especially with my limited tools), 

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:57.842
 but the hardest part was by far ... 

00:02:57.842 --> 00:03:04.487
 ... punch everything in the little box and the little plaque. I also had to draw the design with what I had available. 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.068
 I wanted to thank the SparkFun Electronics store for their Free Day on 07/01/2010. 

00:03:08.068 --> 00:03:10.368
 I was one of the lucky ones to get the discount ... 

00:03:10.368 --> 00:03:14.829
 ... and certainly would not have built that device without the Solar Cell or the LCD Graphic I bought. 

00:03:15.137 --> 00:03:20.077

00:03:20.077 --> 00:03:25.179
 Music: Well, I'll let you guess and then I put it in the description of the video. (What a game!) 

00:03:25.197 --> 00:03:26.604
