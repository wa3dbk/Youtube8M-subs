00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
these of spades so it's just a setup so

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.499 
these of spades so it's just a setup so
we<00:00:30.920> can<00:00:31.070> remember<00:00:31.279> that<00:00:31.430> the<00:00:31.640> hearts<00:00:31.910> are<00:00:32.119> even

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.939 
we can remember that the hearts are even
and<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:33.319> spades<00:00:33.620> are<00:00:34.370> odds<00:00:34.670> and<00:00:35.769> they<00:00:36.769> just

and the spades are odds and they just

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.889 
and the spades are odds and they just
alternate<00:00:37.370> red<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:37.670> black<00:00:37.819> just<00:00:38.089> to<00:00:38.210> hide<00:00:38.510> the

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
alternate red and black just to hide the

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.930 
alternate red and black just to hide the
setup<00:00:39.319> in<00:00:39.499> the<00:00:39.649> deck<00:00:39.859> a<00:00:40.069> little<00:00:40.460> better<00:00:40.639> rather

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
setup in the deck a little better rather

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.340 
setup in the deck a little better rather
than<00:00:41.120> using<00:00:41.269> all<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:41.629> same<00:00:41.780> suits<00:00:42.139> which

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
than using all the same suits which

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.180 
than using all the same suits which
looks<00:00:42.589> quite<00:00:42.710> obvious<00:00:43.420> anyways<00:00:45.069> what<00:00:46.069> we're

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
looks quite obvious anyways what we're

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.619 
looks quite obvious anyways what we're
going<00:00:46.309> to<00:00:46.370> do<00:00:46.460> now<00:00:46.729> is<00:00:46.789> sorry<00:00:47.299> we're<00:00:47.449> going<00:00:47.569> to

going to do now is sorry we're going to

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.450 
going to do now is sorry we're going to
leave<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:47.929> setup<00:00:48.679> face<00:00:48.889> up<00:00:49.129> like<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:49.399> and

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
leave the setup face up like that and

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.459 
leave the setup face up like that and
then<00:00:49.760> you're<00:00:49.879> going<00:00:49.969> to<00:00:50.030> add<00:00:50.179> 20<00:00:50.780> random<00:00:51.049> cards

portion no problem you're going to of

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.610 
portion no problem you're going to of
course<00:01:25.190> want<00:01:25.550> to<00:01:25.610> skip<00:01:26.300> through<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.750> obvious

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
course want to skip through the obvious

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.670 
course want to skip through the obvious
sequence<00:01:28.190> of<00:01:28.310> cards<00:01:29.020> very<00:01:30.020> quickly<00:01:30.290> but<00:01:30.560> they

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
sequence of cards very quickly but they

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.720 
sequence of cards very quickly but they
won't<00:01:30.860> really<00:01:31.100> notice<00:01:31.310> because<00:01:31.580> they're

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
won't really notice because they're

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.160 
won't really notice because they're
alternating<00:01:32.330> red<00:01:32.480> and<00:01:32.600> black<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:33.110> can

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
alternating red and black and you can

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.930 
alternating red and black and you can
just<00:01:33.410> kind<00:01:33.590> of<00:01:33.650> skim<00:01:33.920> through<00:01:34.040> those<00:01:34.220> and<00:01:34.460> then

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
just kind of skim through those and then

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.370 
just kind of skim through those and then
you<00:01:35.030> can<00:01:35.150> slow<00:01:35.330> down<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.570> show<00:01:35.870> the<00:01:36.110> remaining

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
you can slow down and show the remaining

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.160 
you can slow down and show the remaining
mix<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.280> cards<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:38.030> I'm<00:01:38.750> sure<00:01:38.900> you'll<00:01:39.080> agree

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
mix of cards and I'm sure you'll agree

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.890 
mix of cards and I'm sure you'll agree

19 cards so you have them cut about a

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.550 
19 cards so you have them cut about a
quarter<00:02:04.940> of<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.090> deck<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.570> have<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.840> mix<00:02:06.050> the

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
case so 20 plus 12 would give you of

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.580 
case so 20 plus 12 would give you of
course<00:04:18.459> 32<00:04:19.459> so<00:04:20.329> you'll<00:04:20.510> know<00:04:20.750> then<00:04:21.200> you<00:04:21.470> can

you can even count the cards face up to

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.439 
you can even count the cards face up to
show<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.740> randomness<00:04:34.220> of<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.370> guards<00:04:34.729> so

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449

31<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.910> I<00:04:46.940> believe<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.270> was<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.449> eight<00:04:47.569> of

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
31 and I believe it was the eight of

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.360 
31 and I believe it was the eight of
Spades<00:04:47.810> that<00:04:48.229> we<00:04:48.319> looked<00:04:48.530> at<00:04:48.680> and<00:04:48.949> there<00:04:49.160> it<00:04:49.250> is

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
Spades that we looked at and there it is

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.670

the thirty second card so that's how

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.779 
the thirty second card so that's how
