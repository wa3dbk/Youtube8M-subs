00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.869
 Long ago there lived in China a 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.170
 emperor 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.090
 he loved the most beautiful things and 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.369
 when he heard there was a bird in it 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.900
 the sun was so beautiful 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.020
 that mine came from afar for his songs 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.660
 He instructed him on this 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.899
 bird for them 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.670
 the nightingale was very 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.379
 and then that evening the window appeared 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.840
 did look hello 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.600
 the Emperor exclaimed disappointedly 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.570
 seeing the simple gray bird 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.989
 but it's like the nightingale 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.300
 hit the keyser directly in the heart of 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.920
 the tears ran over with emotion 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.570
 the cheeks 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.760
 this is the handy hello I could ever loose 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.470
 have felt 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.810
 stammered the case and every evening after 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.259
 the nightingale and its grade and appeared 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.830
 sang the highest song for the keyser 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.350
 but one day 30 red suit remote 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.290
 which contained the mechanical nightingale 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.180
 set with precious diamonds and 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.759
 precious stones 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.590
 osho talks comes celebrity and sometimes one 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.979
 highest song 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.869
 this one was much younger than dekker and come 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.180
 just as nicely ill the way to go 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.509
 who just had to come to this because I 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.600

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.380

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.549
 just unwind it until something 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:03.630
 ship came nasty runs and you can 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.270
 follow it deep and feeds the keyser 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.739

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.400

 distant chip of sorrow throughout china 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.819

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.819
