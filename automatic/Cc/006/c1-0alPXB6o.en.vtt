00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.390
 found for a new presentation 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.920
 of a city hall and today it is 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.290
 the level 10 town hall that is put 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.450
 to honor a level city hall 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.300
 10 years training run 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.340
 so why is it for me 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.160
 a very good city hotel that's all 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.720
 simply because they against three 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.239
 strategies attacks which are the three 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.309
 the three most used strategies 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.290
 on call of plant currently to know 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.909
 the pig the dragon and the golem so I 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.100
 will now explain everything from 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.620
 following by showing you the city hall 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.120
 in question 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.909
 I hope you'll like me 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.780
 say right now for the presentation 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.030
 here we are for the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.170
 presentation of this city hall and I 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.420
 start right away to show you 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.559
 an overview of this village for 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.540
 that you see a little head that has it 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.860
 overall and I'm going to start all of 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.229
 next by showing you why this one 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.090
 I was little pig look I'm in 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.329
 going through you all the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.850
 all the reserves the and creators who 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.250
 are not defenses and so who does not 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.289
 are not attracted to who does not attract 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.869
 the pigs and so here are the pigs 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.310
 will go around all that and will die 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.500
 before the internal power channel 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.780
 central that is composed of all 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.579
 the differences that really make it very 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.270
 effective on all the troops to know 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.880
 tower of hell arc x mortar tower 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.130
 wizard castle of clans lorraine 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.359
 darrois and there the king and the queen is 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.640
 so see that this central square is 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.929
 really very well built because 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.329
 it really contains all 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.799
 very effective defenses and so what 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.750
 really does all the strength of this 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.450
 village is there so you see that the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.350
 defenses are located at the beginning of the village 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.450
 to attract and to get around 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.670
 the pigs the golems and that's why 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.259
 that this one I really very effective 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.810
 because he can send golems 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.429
 dragon pigs it will not happen except 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.590
 if he attacks really well and so 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.180
 I 'll show you that we slow down so 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.610
 could see that he will be attracted who 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.880
 who will be attacked by donating with 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.510
 heavy 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.330
 these are columns 5 of the wizards 6d 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.740
 pk5 kings and queens of high level and 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.650
 you and see that he is really going 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.780
 well resisted he almost even managed to 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.780
 his defense just happened 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.070
 for the opponent he was lucky 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.590
 and so you see at the beginning that he sends 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.010
 his saplings m for the moment everything seems 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.140
 normal 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.240
 it sends a sow center to attract 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.680
 the central square defenses and there you 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.580
 make sure he's really going to take himself 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.840
 all the defenses to know who 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.300
 are in the central square like the 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.280
 towers of hell the mortars and there you 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.570
 can see that the golem to uncle and the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.400
 village because he is attracted to 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.810
 defenses and so he is he does the trick 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.820
 and we were shooting so he is not there 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.160
 yet quÃ©au central what 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.150
 would have been really helpful to the king who is 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.910
 in the center of the village and who is in the process 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.290
 to take very expensive input by all 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.150
 defenses that are high level and 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.890
 who are on the face and so you 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.660
 really see that it's really very 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.880
 just for the opponent who is going 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.530
 to come out just when they had 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.560
 really and excellent trouble 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.000
 max is very high level and so you 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.950
 see that this is exactly where 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.540
 really very powerful and very 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.980
 effective that's why I want you 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.430
 advise and that's why I 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.860
 present 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.210
 I hope you enjoy me 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.530
 say to the next maybe for a 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.700
 new city hall presentation 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.780
 it was silly 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.780
 ciao bye
