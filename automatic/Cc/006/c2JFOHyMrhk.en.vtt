00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hockey mask was and remains 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.589
 the only weakness to which 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.070
 capable of the most desperate and brave players 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.049
 teams taking places at the gate to 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.540
 this element of protection goalkeepers include 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.580
 35 she just because in our time a mask and 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.400
 helmet became an important part of equipment 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.970
 hockey goalkeeper one of the most 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.970
 important until 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:29.160
 Well, first of all, this mask is iron 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.250
 special holes to see the washers 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.730
 it was all right well, plastic is very 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.579
 strong saves from all shots to the head 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.940
 1 ice hockey match in history took place 3 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.219
 March 1875 in Montreal it was 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.500
 time crazy romantics played without 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.140
 helmets received nemerine dissection 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.430
 abrasions but managed to get 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.039
 the fun of the game 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.469
 the hardest goalkeepers were if the puck 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.079
 flies to you in the head with a piglet dodge 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.030
 almost impossible and given that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.100
 hockey played in the open and in 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.530
 good frost from hitting the frozen 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.840
 rubber disc could seriously 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.430
 suffer so looked goalkeeper 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.360
 professional hockey team 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.650
 mid past century now right 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.650
 from us the gates of the Soviet team 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.850
 attack the Swedes are not confident in their abilities 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.100
 plays easy and calm after direct 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.369
 hitting the head in two games 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.289
 consecutive goalkeeper montreal cl. benedict 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.479
 first tried to protect his face 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.030
 Benedict back on the ice putting on his face 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.100
 awesome leather and wire shell 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.990
 mouth and forehead covering his nose 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.420
 it was the first of many attempts 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.399
 protect yourself when playing at the gate right down 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.159
 until the end of the 50s of the last century 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.140
 the man in the gate remained defenseless 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.990
 in danger of serious injury 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.450
 and trying to somehow secure yourself with 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.259
 using technical means 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:01.369
 perceived by others as 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:03.229
 manifestation of weakness and cowardice and yet 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.619
 the right to become a goalkeeper 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.630
 fashion 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.590
 belongs to one of the most ingenious 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.660
 20th century goalkeepers to the famous Jacques Plantu 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.910
 in game montreal with rangers from 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.430
 New York puck hit the goalkeeper in the face 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.720
 the match was stopped for 45 minutes Plantu 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.120
 put seven stitches 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.069
 the goalkeeper refused to go on the ice without 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.540
 protective mask which he occasionally 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.940
 used in training 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.790
 since the reserve goalkeeper montreal is not 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.760
 it was a step was a great coach player 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.440
 I had to agree with him, the plant went out and 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.290
 I finished the meeting on my own 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.600
 masks this artifact now 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.739
 stored in the hockey glory museum in 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.019
 Toronto of course innovations much 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.790
 reduced the number of fractures times sections 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.040
 but by virtue of its design it is not 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.109
 possessed due quality of depreciation 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.900
 washers from reliability was only 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:56.750
 visibility in europe everything went differently 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.639
 the way there earlier than nhl entered 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.040
 mandatory helmets for the head 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.980
 European goalkeepers guessed to attach 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.810
 steel mesh covering face to helmet 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.700
 nothing much eye protection 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.430
 good ventilation excellent visibility 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.680
 washers and improved depreciation after 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.430
 direct hits demonstrated this 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.650
 achievement of national economy 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.120
 ki nobody else but vladislav tretiak 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.659
 the super series of 1972 I generally started at 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.480
 gaming helmet until when everyone gave me all 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.879
 form and to the thunder of slam just principle 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.909
 lot protector field helmet players he 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.920
 very light there is less protection but she 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.230
 there of course but it is a little 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.439
 goalie helmet is much harder if 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.939
 compare them but here everything is protected helmet in 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.920
 which modern goalkeepers play 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:46.079
 certainly different from the classic 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.060
 samples of Soviet hockey Canadians 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.780
 the cells that recognized the advantage decided 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.299
 to combine 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.030
 new style with the usual what 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.409
 It turned out in the end and there is a modern 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.409
 goalkeeper mask
