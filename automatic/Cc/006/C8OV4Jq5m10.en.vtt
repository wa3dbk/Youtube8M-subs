been waiting for to either fix the game

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.290 
been waiting for to either fix the game

or probably make it a little bit worse

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.930 
or probably make it a little bit worse
now<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.230> course<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.590> being<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> PC<00:00:41.399> player<00:00:41.640> have

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
now of course I being a PC player have

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.479 
now of course I being a PC player have
had<00:00:42.120> access<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.600> CTE<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.620> quite<00:00:43.829> some<00:00:44.070> time<00:00:44.100> so

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
had access to CTE for quite some time so

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.889 
had access to CTE for quite some time so
I<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.760> had<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> chance<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.450> play<00:00:45.719> these

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
I have had a chance to play these

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.959 
I have had a chance to play these
changes<00:00:46.440> before<00:00:46.770> they've<00:00:47.129> been<00:00:47.280> released<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
changes before they've been released and

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.790 
changes before they've been released and
I've<00:00:48.329> got<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.600> say<00:00:48.750> whilst<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.230> think<00:00:49.680> they

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
I've got to say whilst I do think they

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.290 
I've got to say whilst I do think they
did<00:00:50.010> make<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> massive<00:00:50.550> difference<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
did make a massive difference to the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.540 
did make a massive difference to the
game<00:00:51.510> there's<00:00:51.989> absolutely<00:00:52.379> no<00:00:52.649> doubt<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.100> CTE

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
game there's absolutely no doubt the CTE

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.250 
game there's absolutely no doubt the CTE
version<00:00:54.149> was<00:00:54.300> definitely<00:00:54.750> leaps<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.199> bounds

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
version was definitely leaps and bounds

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.840 
version was definitely leaps and bounds
better<00:00:55.559> than<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> standard<00:00:56.280> version<00:00:56.340> I

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
better than the standard version I

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.970 
better than the standard version I
wasn't<00:00:57.510> too<00:00:57.629> excited<00:00:58.140> about<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.469> patch<00:00:58.710> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
wasn't too excited about this patch I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.680 
wasn't too excited about this patch I
thought<00:00:59.280> we'll<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> few<00:00:59.699> things<00:01:00.059> fixed<00:01:00.600> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
thought we'll see a few things fixed a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.990 
thought we'll see a few things fixed a
few<00:01:00.719> things<00:01:01.109> broken<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:02.039> overall<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.430> placebo

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
few things broken but overall a placebo

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.490 
few things broken but overall a placebo
effect<00:01:03.359> will<00:01:03.510> probably<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:03.989> us<00:01:04.110> thinking

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
effect will probably have us thinking

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.920 
effect will probably have us thinking
this<00:01:04.650> game<00:01:04.890> has<00:01:05.070> improved<00:01:05.330> now<00:01:06.330> without<00:01:06.540> said

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
this game has improved now without said

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.840 
this game has improved now without said
after<00:01:07.470> playing<00:01:07.680> four<00:01:07.979> or<00:01:08.070> five<00:01:08.250> hours<00:01:08.400> since

the<00:01:53.640> game<00:01:53.850> I've<00:01:54.090> been<00:01:54.119> playing<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.290> come

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
the game I've been playing so to come

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.109 
the game I've been playing so to come
straight<00:01:55.649> back<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.920> battlefield<00:01:56.610> 4<00:01:56.850> since

straight back to battlefield 4 since
this<00:01:57.240> patch<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.719> now<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.020> see<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.530> massive

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
this patch I now can see a massive

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.310 
this patch I now can see a massive
comparison<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> guys<00:02:00.479> at<00:02:00.750> dice<00:02:01.020> have

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
comparison and the guys at dice have

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.630 
comparison and the guys at dice have
said<00:02:01.619> they've<00:02:01.770> now<00:02:01.920> changed<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> player

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
said they've now changed the player

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.999 
said they've now changed the player
movement<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.390> identical<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.170> battlefield

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
movement to be identical to battlefield

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.920 
movement to be identical to battlefield
3<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> speed<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.000> move<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.420> way<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.630> move

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
3 so the speed you move the way you move

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.469 
3 so the speed you move the way you move
is<00:02:07.140> identical<00:02:08.009> now<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:08.700> also<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.270> way<00:02:09.420> you

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
is identical now but also the way you

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.390 
is identical now but also the way you
take<00:02:09.840> damage<00:02:10.020> now<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.530> course<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.220> down

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
take damage now of course this is down

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.270 
take damage now of course this is down
to<00:02:11.550> changes<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> net

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
to changes to the net

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.490 
to changes to the net
code<00:02:12.520> hit<00:02:12.819> detection<00:02:12.970> but<00:02:13.900> now<00:02:14.020> just<00:02:14.350> like

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
code hit detection but now just like

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.260 
code hit detection but now just like
battlefield<00:02:14.980> 3<00:02:15.250> if<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.430> get<00:02:15.640> shot<00:02:15.670> rather

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
battlefield 3 if you get shot rather

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.240 
battlefield 3 if you get shot rather
than<00:02:16.420> dying<00:02:16.720> super<00:02:17.350> super<00:02:17.530> quickly<00:02:17.890> which<00:02:18.130> is

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
than dying super super quickly which is

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.040 
than dying super super quickly which is
something<00:02:18.459> I've<00:02:18.910> always<00:02:19.180> had<00:02:19.540> an<00:02:19.750> issue<00:02:19.870> with

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
something I've always had an issue with

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.170 
something I've always had an issue with
the<00:02:20.260> battlefield<00:02:20.740> 4<00:02:20.830> since<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.730> beta<00:02:21.910> I've

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
the battlefield 4 since the beta I've

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.059 
the battlefield 4 since the beta I've
always<00:02:22.390> said<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.900> just<00:02:23.050> seem<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.350> die<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.890> much

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
always said you just seem to die so much

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.620 
always said you just seem to die so much
quicker<00:02:24.280> than<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.610> did<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:24.819> battlefield<00:02:25.450> 3

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
quicker than you did in battlefield 3

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.930 
quicker than you did in battlefield 3
but<00:02:26.500> now<00:02:26.620> with<00:02:26.830> changes<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.280> netcode<00:02:27.700> and

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
but now with changes to netcode and

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.820 
but now with changes to netcode and
damage<00:02:28.240> models<00:02:28.569> you<00:02:28.930> have<00:02:29.080> chance<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.500> react

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
damage models you have chance to react

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.220 
damage models you have chance to react
turn<00:02:30.160> around<00:02:30.280> fight<00:02:30.819> back<00:02:31.090> jump<00:02:31.540> behind<00:02:31.750> cover

turn around fight back jump behind cover

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.140 
turn around fight back jump behind cover
laid<00:02:32.620> down<00:02:32.860> which<00:02:33.340> makes<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.700> game<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.970> lot

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
laid down which makes the game a lot

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.400 
laid down which makes the game a lot
more<00:02:34.330> interesting<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.930> course<00:02:34.959> on

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
more interesting of course on

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.110 
more interesting of course on
battlefield<00:02:36.010> 4<00:02:36.190> used<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.520> get<00:02:36.640> shot<00:02:36.940> and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
battlefield 4 used to get shot and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.490 
battlefield 4 used to get shot and
straightaway<00:02:37.510> that'll<00:02:37.870> be<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.080> be<00:02:38.290> on<00:02:38.410> the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
straightaway that'll be it be on the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.960 
straightaway that'll be it be on the
floor<00:02:38.709> no<00:02:39.040> chance<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.400> react<00:02:39.730> which<00:02:39.850> is

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
floor no chance to react which is

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.640 
floor no chance to react which is
something<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.450> didn't<00:02:40.780> enjoy<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.530> was

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
something I didn't enjoy and was

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.960 
something I didn't enjoy and was
something<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.040> massively<00:02:42.430> preferred<00:02:42.819> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
something I massively preferred the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.150 
something I massively preferred the
other<00:02:43.000> way<00:02:43.180> around<00:02:43.209> in<00:02:43.690> battlefield<00:02:44.200> 3<00:02:44.290> so

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
other way around in battlefield 3 so

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.259 
other way around in battlefield 3 so
that's<00:02:45.310> one<00:02:45.430> of<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.550> biggest<00:02:45.730> changes<00:02:46.120> I

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
that's one of the biggest changes I

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.699 
that's one of the biggest changes I
noticed<00:02:46.660> straight<00:02:46.900> away<00:02:46.930> now<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.470> actually

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
noticed straight away now you actually

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.560 
noticed straight away now you actually
have<00:02:47.980> chance<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.550> react<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:48.970> do<00:02:49.180> something

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
have chance to react and do something

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.240 
have chance to react and do something
about<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.840> rather<00:02:50.410> than<00:02:50.470> just<00:02:50.680> being<00:02:50.830> sprawled

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
about it rather than just being sprawled

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.040 
about it rather than just being sprawled
out<00:02:51.430> on<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.610> floor<00:02:51.700> straight<00:02:52.180> away<00:02:52.420> now

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
out on the floor straight away now

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.630 
out on the floor straight away now

also<00:03:03.280> seen<00:03:03.610> this<00:03:03.760> support<00:03:04.180> come<00:03:04.360> across<00:03:04.630> for

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
also seen this support come across for

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.290 
also seen this support come across for
the<00:03:04.810> PlayStation<00:03:05.410> 3<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.920> xbox<00:03:06.400> 360<00:03:06.970> so

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
the PlayStation 3 and the xbox 360 so

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.880 
the PlayStation 3 and the xbox 360 so
personally<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.260> think<00:03:08.380> that's<00:03:08.650> one<00:03:08.769> of<00:03:08.800> the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
personally I think that's one of the

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.559 
personally I think that's one of the
biggest<00:03:09.100> changes<00:03:09.550> we've<00:03:09.730> actually<00:03:09.940> seen<00:03:10.390> to

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
biggest changes we've actually seen to

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.759 
biggest changes we've actually seen to
the<00:03:10.660> game<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:11.019> will<00:03:11.110> make<00:03:11.319> the<00:03:11.739> biggest

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
the game that will make the biggest

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.710 
the game that will make the biggest
difference<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.640> think<00:03:12.670> for<00:03:13.090> your<00:03:13.180> day<00:03:13.450> today

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
difference I think for your day today

fighting<00:03:23.500> experience<00:03:23.890> in<00:03:24.340> this<00:03:24.579> game<00:03:24.820> a

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
fighting experience in this game a

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.390 
fighting experience in this game a
massive<00:03:25.690> improvement<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:26.680> now<00:03:26.829> feels<00:03:27.070> very

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
massive improvement it now feels very

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.710 
massive improvement it now feels very
satisfying<00:03:28.030> when<00:03:28.180> you're<00:03:28.299> hitting<00:03:28.420> somebody

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
satisfying when you're hitting somebody

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.210 
satisfying when you're hitting somebody
and<00:03:29.079> it<00:03:29.320> does<00:03:29.500> feel<00:03:29.739> like<00:03:29.920> you're<00:03:30.040> actually

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
and it does feel like you're actually

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.520 
and it does feel like you're actually
connecting<00:03:31.060> with<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.269> target<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:31.810> also<00:03:32.410> in

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
connecting with the target and also in

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.350 
connecting with the target and also in
your<00:03:32.560> getting<00:03:32.980> shot<00:03:33.220> at<00:03:33.370> now<00:03:33.670> you<00:03:33.730> do<00:03:33.970> feel<00:03:34.209> if

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
your getting shot at now you do feel if

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.970 
your getting shot at now you do feel if
you<00:03:34.450> get<00:03:34.630> behind<00:03:34.780> cover<00:03:35.170> you're<00:03:35.680> not<00:03:35.799> going<00:03:35.920> to

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
you get behind cover you're not going to

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.530 
you get behind cover you're not going to
get<00:03:36.130> shot<00:03:36.160> around<00:03:36.489> corners<00:03:37.060> as<00:03:37.180> much<00:03:37.329> now

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
get shot around corners as much now

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.120 
get shot around corners as much now
there<00:03:37.720> are<00:03:37.840> still<00:03:38.110> a<00:03:38.140> few<00:03:38.320> things<00:03:38.530> with<00:03:38.890> lag

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
there are still a few things with lag

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.340 
there are still a few things with lag
spikes<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.640> pings<00:03:39.910> but<00:03:40.570> I<00:03:40.600> think<00:03:40.930> over<00:03:41.200> next

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
spikes and pings but I think over next

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.289 
spikes and pings but I think over next
coming<00:03:41.709> days<00:03:41.739> is<00:03:42.070> this<00:03:42.190> new<00:03:42.340> patch<00:03:42.609> settles<00:03:43.120> in

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
coming days is this new patch settles in

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.910 
coming days is this new patch settles in
those<00:03:43.720> things<00:03:44.079> should<00:03:44.230> hopefully<00:03:44.470> died<00:03:44.859> down

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
those things should hopefully died down

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.250 
those things should hopefully died down
now<00:03:45.400> we've<00:03:45.640> also<00:03:45.850> seen<00:03:46.209> massive<00:03:46.510> improvements

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
now we've also seen massive improvements

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.810 
now we've also seen massive improvements
to<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.440> hood<00:03:47.590> system<00:03:47.829> something<00:03:48.280> I've<00:03:48.519> spoke

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
to the hood system something I've spoke

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.099 
to the hood system something I've spoke
to<00:03:48.940> you<00:03:49.000> guys<00:03:49.150> about<00:03:49.329> before<00:03:49.780> something

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
to you guys about before something

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.080 
to you guys about before something
that's<00:03:50.320> been<00:03:50.470> in<00:03:50.620> CTE<00:03:51.070> for<00:03:51.700> quite<00:03:51.850> some<00:03:52.060> time

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
that's been in CTE for quite some time

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.180 
that's been in CTE for quite some time
now<00:03:52.450> of<00:03:52.600> course<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.930> triage<00:03:53.320> system<00:03:53.590> which

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
now of course the triage system which

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.130 
now of course the triage system which
allows<00:03:54.310> players<00:03:54.700> to<00:03:54.880> see<00:03:55.180> how<00:03:55.570> much<00:03:55.750> time<00:03:55.989> they

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
allows players to see how much time they

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.840 
allows players to see how much time they
have<00:03:56.170> left<00:03:56.320> to<00:03:56.650> revive<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.010> down<00:03:57.370> player<00:03:57.760> and

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
have left to revive a down player and

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.670 
have left to revive a down player and
I've<00:03:58.329> actually<00:03:58.450> found<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:59.170> far<00:03:59.200> that's

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
I've actually found so far that's

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.170 
I've actually found so far that's
actually<00:03:59.859> improved<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.640> rate<00:04:00.820> you<00:04:00.970> get

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
actually improved the rate you get

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.060 
actually improved the rate you get
revived<00:04:01.600> whether<00:04:02.440> or<00:04:02.530> not<00:04:02.650> it's<00:04:02.769> because

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
revived whether or not it's because

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.650 
revived whether or not it's because
teammates<00:04:03.519> now<00:04:03.700> see<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:03.970> is<00:04:04.060> a<00:04:04.090> challenge<00:04:04.540> to

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
teammates now see it is a challenge to

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.270 
teammates now see it is a challenge to
try<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:04.930> revive<00:04:05.140> you<00:04:05.380> before<00:04:05.709> that<00:04:05.829> time<00:04:06.040> runs

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
try and revive you before that time runs

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.830 
try and revive you before that time runs
out<00:04:06.459> or<00:04:06.640> whether<00:04:07.060> or<00:04:07.239> not<00:04:07.359> just<00:04:07.570> having<00:04:07.810> that

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
out or whether or not just having that

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.960 
out or whether or not just having that
extra<00:04:08.079> information<00:04:08.590> allows<00:04:09.430> them<00:04:09.609> to<00:04:09.640> judge

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
extra information allows them to judge

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.849 
extra information allows them to judge
if<00:04:10.180> it's<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.510> wise<00:04:10.810> thing<00:04:11.170> to<00:04:11.230> try<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:11.650> revive

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
if it's a wise thing to try and revive

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.460 
if it's a wise thing to try and revive
you<00:04:12.070> or<00:04:12.190> not<00:04:12.340> either<00:04:12.880> way<00:04:13.120> so<00:04:13.540> far<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:13.930> find<00:04:14.290> I

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
you or not either way so far I find I

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.199 
you or not either way so far I find I
probably<00:04:14.739> get<00:04:14.920> revived<00:04:15.220> twice<00:04:15.609> as<00:04:15.820> many<00:04:15.910> times

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
probably get revived twice as many times

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.880 
probably get revived twice as many times
as<00:04:16.359> I<00:04:16.479> used<00:04:16.720> to<00:04:16.840> you<00:04:16.900> in<00:04:17.049> your<00:04:17.079> average<00:04:17.560> match

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
as I used to you in your average match

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.310 
as I used to you in your average match
so<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.549> triage<00:04:18.850> system<00:04:19.090> so<00:04:19.419> far<00:04:19.690> does<00:04:20.079> seem

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
so the triage system so far does seem

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.529 
so the triage system so far does seem
like<00:04:20.349> a<00:04:20.500> great<00:04:20.890> success<00:04:21.099> now<00:04:22.060> on<00:04:22.210> top<00:04:22.360> of<00:04:22.479> this

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
like a great success now on top of this

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.719 
like a great success now on top of this
you<00:04:22.750> also<00:04:22.930> have<00:04:23.260> multiple<00:04:23.830> new<00:04:24.070> options<00:04:24.550> for

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
you also have multiple new options for

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:25.270 
you also have multiple new options for
how<00:04:24.849> you<00:04:24.880> want

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
how you want

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.160 
how you want
your<00:04:25.370> hood<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.730> look<00:04:25.910> all<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:26.570> do<00:04:26.750> is<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:26.990> head

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
your hood to look all you do is you head

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
carry this number has been decreased

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.550
