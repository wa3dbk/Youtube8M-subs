00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.480
 and hello how about friends how have they been 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.030
 welcome to an update of a 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.980
 video that went up last year that is 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.260
 causing a bit of controversy in my 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.290
 channel some told me rat boy 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.160
 some told me it was an east that 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.960
 it was a crack 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.730
 some others tell me it was okay 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.500
 that some others that were wrong but 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.930
 good that the video I'm talking about 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.180
 specifically this video I uploaded it on 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.990
 last year to think how to find 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.210
 specific biomes in minecraft in that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.400
 then it was working was the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.310
 version 1.7 point 10 and I 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.290
 I specifically said in the video that 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.050
 it was not yet functional for the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.879
 1.8 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.879
 because I was ready to leave 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.180
 because the program has not been updated 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.340
 more than once since then if in 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.490
 that time it was in version 3.6 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.560
 today it is in a version 3.7 to that 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.050
 program they refer to me I mean is a 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.050
 This has always cost me a lot 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.630
 I work to pronounce it but it is this 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.520
 are you watching 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.649
 the 3.7 to meet 3.7 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.579
 and well now I'll show you how 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:20.850
 find the biomes in version 1.8 or 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:24.210
 the most current 1.8 point 3 with the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:29.009
 version of amyts 3.7 I'm leaving the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.110
 download link in the same box here 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.209
 down then where you write all those 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.939
 things there I leave you 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:37.619
 but here I leave the download link that 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.110
 is what we have to do first must 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.179
 temple I have to have minecraft 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.000
 in the version downloaded the version 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.599
 current which is 1.8 point 3 and the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.860
 version 1.7 point 10 because I say this 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:56.810
 because it's if we work in half in 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.039
 version 1.7 1.8 sorry 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.690
 will automatically tell us that the 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.870
 program that 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.490
 that will not even tell us anything 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.280
 it's just going to grow it closes and 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.100
 ready then we have to do it in the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.660
 version 1.7 point 10 that's why 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.930
 we must have installed both 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.720
 versions 18 is the most current and the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.330
 1.7 point 10 I'm trying this module 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.560
 point 8.3 I imagine it works for 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.410
 the 1.81 and 1.8 point 2 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.210
 I want to guess what if you do not change 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.470
 to version 1.8 point do you think the most 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:37.890
 current and we leave this one of this 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:42.060
 fight in in this good video we're going to 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.370
 use version 1.8 1.7 point 10 in 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.950
 the amis version and the minecraft version 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.520
 the 1.8 point 3 pts 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.840
 I already have a map of this fact that 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.739
 I made the same name 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.019
 program let's give play we're going to 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.810
 expect me to carry the world I hope that 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.810
 born this is done 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.870
 in the last tutorial we made a 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.920
 question that was and elnosa a file in new 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.170
 and we look for the folder of what would be the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.500
 map in this case we are going to work 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.020
 this for the seeds 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.020
 although he could not open the key 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.830
 we have to 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.710
 there it is we have to open it open the 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.440
 seed 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.600
 that this is the seed of our 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.610
 world 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.310
 what is the seed of our world 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.600
 we press control n in the field or we 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.630
 we go directly to file new and francis 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:00.230
 that is the same as control 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:03.459
 we wrote our appointment 92 172 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.459
 40 19 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:11.269
 40 19 77 48 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:22.630
 80 06 21 those would be our id of the 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.490
 game when not from this map in what 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.990
 specific to the map that you see you were 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:33.310
 this scan or search the biomes here 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.350
 he asks us to thank the chat he asks us 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.770
 We leave the world type by default 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.460
 and we accept 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.460
 we wait 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.160
 our list had already scared me 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:52.229
 well here is our world that 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:55.080
 our map sorry we have 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:58.800
 currently with the seed such here is 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.789
 the backup that is where I am going to 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.789
 vary a bit 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.370
 value already here a little 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.370
 hey 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.060
 but basically it's where I'm at x 16 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.690
 and 256 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.460
 well now if we are going to look our what 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.160
 what we want to look for let's say we want 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.580
 look for huge to merme so far 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:31.520
 I'm going to look for this villa that is here 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.639
 I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it more 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.540
 fast first I 'm going to put in mode 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.470
 viewer 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.470
 but not die 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:46.490
 I'm in spectator mode and now I'm going 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.490
 to put the tp 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:54.210
 276 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:58.490
 I always wear 70 in height 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.490
 and 288 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:08.350
 The most center and effectively as 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:11.680
 indicates here are our coordinates 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:14.310
 is a village or a village that is 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:19.060
 exactly the village that we have here 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:21.790
 then now this one since they already saw it 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:25.120
 you can now look for your lake 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:28.810
 scan your maps to look for some 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.900
 specific language or some west for 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:35.590
 look for villages the strong or whatever you want 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:39.150
 look for this is new I have not seen it 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.150
 still but good 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:49.400
 x we are not going to enter into that because 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:52.180
 even I know it is but good and 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.260
 we saw that it works for 1.8 point 3 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.930
 specifically we have to do it with 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.960
 the seed not doing it like in the 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.479
 last tutorial that this one 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.030
 that was entering the moya folder and 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:06.350
 find the map folder in this 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.509
 occasion we are going to work on the 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:12.319
 seed it is important that they do so 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:13.940
 this way because if they do it from the 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.400
 another way then he will create the program 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:19.190
 and they will come to claim me by my side 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.259
 that's why he stressed to them that it's about 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.539
 seed we have to have installed the 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:26.210
 two versions the 1.7 point 10 and the 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:29.630
 more current version than 1.8 point 3 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.940
 so far and well nothing we see that 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.280
 is working we have the coordinates 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.919
 and we see that we are in a villa 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.139
 exactly here in the minecraft in the 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:42.910
 game so well I do not expect this 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:45.490
 tutorial will work for you and well what 

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:48.010
 if you work to you maybe a friend 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:50.530
 is looking for some good in specific 

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.450
 happens in this video recommends doing it if 

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.520
 you liked give me a like you can follow me
