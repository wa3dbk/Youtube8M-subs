00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
stop five of your viewers right and said

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.990 
stop five of your viewers right and said
hey<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:13.799> steampunk<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:14.729> are<00:01:14.820> they<00:01:14.880> gonna

successful pillars its successful
steampunk<00:01:18.630> design<00:01:18.960> will<00:01:19.469> they<00:01:19.530> understand

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
steampunk design will they understand

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.830 
steampunk design will they understand
what<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> Victorian<00:01:20.850> era<00:01:21.030> does<00:01:21.420> when<00:01:21.689> its

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
what the Victorian era does when its

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.469 
what the Victorian era does when its
meted<00:01:22.200> with<00:01:22.229> met<00:01:22.710> with<00:01:22.859> rust<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.280> metal<00:01:23.640> No

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
meted with met with rust and metal No

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.300 
meted with met with rust and metal No
so<00:01:25.049> what<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.289> wanted<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> do<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.920> focus<00:01:26.250> on

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
so what we wanted to do is focus on

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.560 
so what we wanted to do is focus on
where's<00:01:26.579> the<00:01:26.670> user<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.149> going<00:01:27.359> well

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
they're going to an alternate reality

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.179 
they're going to an alternate reality
that's<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.729> turmoil<00:01:30.179> because<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.600> fascism<00:01:31.189> hmm

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
off as you get into a firefight now as

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.039 
off as you get into a firefight now as
you<00:02:58.640> actually<00:02:58.819> lay<00:02:59.090> in<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.420> much<00:02:59.540> destruction

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
you actually lay in so much destruction

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.660 
you actually lay in so much destruction
in<00:03:00.140> time<00:03:00.319> slow<00:03:00.620> your<00:03:01.130> views<00:03:01.459> actually

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
in time slow your views actually

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.819 
in time slow your views actually
cluttered<00:03:02.299> by<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:02.810> much<00:03:02.989> debris<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.739> you

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
cluttered by so much debris that you

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.979 
cluttered by so much debris that you
might<00:03:04.099> consider<00:03:04.340> not<00:03:04.849> using<00:03:05.180> your<00:03:05.299> powers<00:03:05.720> in

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
might consider not using your powers in

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.740 
might consider not using your powers in
order<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.349> sacrifice<00:03:07.220> that<00:03:07.790> power<00:03:08.209> control

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.600 
order to sacrifice that power control
for<00:03:08.959> more<00:03:09.140> visibility<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.340> it's<00:03:10.489> about

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
for more visibility and so it's about

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.520 
for more visibility and so it's about

god mode when you play the game so when

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.979

the rest of the competition this this

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.860 
the rest of the competition this this
fall<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.400> think<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:50.090> competition's

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
fall I think that the competition's

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.390 
fall I think that the competition's
stiff<00:03:50.930> this<00:03:51.290> fall<00:03:51.500> I'm<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.709> shooter<00:03:51.980> fan<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.220> know

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
stiff this fall I'm a shooter fan I know

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.830 
stiff this fall I'm a shooter fan I know
all<00:03:52.849> the<00:03:52.970> games<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:53.239> are<00:03:53.329> coming<00:03:53.599> out<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:53.720> know

all the games that are coming out I know

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.809 
all the games that are coming out I know
what<00:03:54.169> I<00:03:54.200> want<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.620> play<00:03:54.799> right<00:03:55.069> I<00:03:55.310> think<00:03:55.549> the

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
what I want to play right I think the

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.280 
what I want to play right I think the
answer<00:03:56.150> that<00:03:56.269> comes<00:03:56.510> with<00:03:56.690> time<00:03:56.900> shift<00:03:57.169> is

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
answer that comes with time shift is

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.140 
answer that comes with time shift is
what<00:03:57.470> is<00:03:57.590> next<00:03:57.859> generation<00:03:58.220> really<00:03:58.370> visually

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
what is next generation really visually

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.520 
what is next generation really visually
look<00:03:59.419> at<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.599> screenshots<00:03:59.870> you'll<00:04:00.260> see<00:04:00.410> that
