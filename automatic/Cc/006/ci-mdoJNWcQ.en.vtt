seeing<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.920> don't<00:01:02.730> remember<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.950> fade<00:01:08.250> leads

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
seeing I don't remember the fade leads

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.460 
seeing I don't remember the fade leads
this<00:01:10.320> rift<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:11.130> sealed<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.060> closed

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
this rift is not sealed but it is closed

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.649 
this rift is not sealed but it is closed
albeit<00:01:13.470> temporarily<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.400> believe<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.479> with

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
albeit temporarily I believe that with

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.170 
albeit temporarily I believe that with
the<00:01:15.810> mark<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.500> rift<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.040> opened<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.520> then

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the mark the rift can be opened and then

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.760 
the mark the rift can be opened and then
sealed<00:01:18.479> properly<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.200> safely

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
sealed properly and safely

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.280 
sealed properly and safely
however<00:01:20.640> opening<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> rift<00:01:21.810> will<00:01:22.080> likely

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
however opening the rift will likely

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.039 
however opening the rift will likely
attract<00:01:22.740> attention<00:01:22.860> from<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.490> other<00:01:23.610> side

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
attract attention from the other side

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:35.260 
attract attention from the other side
that<00:01:25.049> means<00:01:25.409> demons<00:01:26.130> stand<00:01:27.060> ready

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270
