00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.380
 there was a time 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.380
 in which we were much more powerful 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:38.560
 but that was a long time ago 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.660
 until he wakes up and finds his voice 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.260
 I am the one who speaks on behalf of 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.260
 traveler 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.260
 you must have many guardian questions 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.120
 in his last death the traveler created 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.149
 spectra 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.199
 to look for those able to use the 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:05.230
 light as a weapon 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:10.150
 guardians to protect us 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:13.290
 Now that he can not do it 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.290
 what happened 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.820
 I could tell you about the great battle that 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.790
 happened centuries ago 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.550
 how the traveler was rendered useless 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.680
 I could tell you about the power of 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.550
 darkness your ancestral enemy 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.620
 before they counted 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.620
 stories to scare children 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.050
 but lately not 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.050
 already 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.360
 No child needs them 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.950
 the darkness looms again and this 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.340
 we will not survive 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.720
 his troops surround us the fallen ones I observed 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.290
 beginning 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.979
 what can i do 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.590
 make the darkness recede 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.780
 the guardians fight on earth and more 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:19.110
 there 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.110
 join them your spectrum will guide you 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.560
 I hope you have chosen wisely 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.670
 I did it 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.980
 we are an animal 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.110
 they inform us that the fallen of the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.690
 Cosmodrome jealously protect the old 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.239
 observatory could be one of 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.890
 its leaders or something of value the speaker has 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.890
 asked the guardians to investigate 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.230
 ok the observatory is on the other side 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.950
 of this valley and surrounded by fallen good 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.950
 whenever you want 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.160
 you know this place had to be amazing 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.200
 before the collapse thousands of humans 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.170
 getting on colony ships for 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.270
 build cities in other places and 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.270
 now the fallen collect their bones 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.330
 hill up the radar building that 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.330
 It is the observatory 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.700
 we are already one of the stations of the 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.720
 observatory to contact the 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.720
 lunar colonies 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.370
 there is no way out the fallen have sealed 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.370
 I can open it 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:33.410
 the fallen did not want anyone to enter 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.410
 I got my face 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:47.749
 and this is a lot of movement ahead and 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.749
 this gives me a very bad thorn 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:07.020
 the beehive has not stepped on the 

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:09.560
 Earth that magician is from the moon 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.479
 I thought they were contained there 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.110
 maybe the darkness is much closer 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:15.110
 of what we think 

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:29.169
 give him if he could only see me mom 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.169
 I would be proud
