00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.019
 meal 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.099
 this is the reason for us 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.420
 preparation exactly the same as before in 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:21.849
 my game 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:24.009
 that means it's going on preliminary work 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.160
 it we look about times where are 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.859
 the strengths of the opponent how can we 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.100
 hold against it and where is there for us 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.500
 Opportunities in the offensive game too 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.309
 to become dangerous yourself and that 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.230
 logically a piece against bavaria 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.250
 that is far more difficult for one 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.309
 or other club 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.250
 that is clear but the work in 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.960
 this week was exactly the same and also 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.770
 We'll be in with these ideas 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.680
 the player enter 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.949
 there are always offensive at bayern 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.559
 strengthen more than the one or 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.199
 other club that is clear, it is not one 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.759
 Surprise that you know his side 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:09.909
 that the passing game pass quality extremely 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:12.280
 high is that is called Fehlpassquote and 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.650
 this is to come to possibilities 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.400
 relatively low as well as lower than 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:22.990
 Of course, others are also possible 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.939
 play on the center with as well 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.200
 always the tip plays in the front 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.579
 someone the belle then lays down 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.530
 playing on the outside you need 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.420
 not discuss any case that the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:40.350
 players who come from outside enormous 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:43.210
 Quality in the 11th with all groups is 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.320
 Of course , a player doing the in 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.049
 a special team yet 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.310
 stand out 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.799
 So there is enough for us to do 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.990
 even with the knowledge that you can too 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.490
 our defensive game so far in order 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.270
 is not everything to defend 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.270
 that will be yes
