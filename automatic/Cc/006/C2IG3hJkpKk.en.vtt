00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.699 
and I like using it on the peephole
setup<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.629> even<00:03:03.629> this<00:03:03.840> here<00:03:04.230> if<00:03:04.379> you<00:03:04.470> can<00:03:04.590> see

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
the hash marks are lined up at zero so

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.849 
the hash marks are lined up at zero so
this<00:03:17.430> rear<00:03:17.730> sight<00:03:17.940> has<00:03:17.970> been<00:03:18.209> zeroed<00:03:18.569> and<00:03:18.859> I

just threw it on here and I only made a

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.530 
just threw it on here and I only made a

very slight adjustments to my front

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.680 
very slight adjustments to my front

with<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.519> and<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.450> realized<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:00.989> I<00:04:01.109> was<00:04:01.380> just

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
with it and I realized that I was just

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.020 
with it and I realized that I was just
going<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.739> end<00:04:01.829> up<00:04:01.889> zooming<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.340> at<00:04:02.430> 50<00:04:02.790> so<00:04:03.000> I

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
going to end up zooming it at 50 so I

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.210 
going to end up zooming it at 50 so I
did<00:04:03.299> that<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.349> has<00:04:04.500> no<00:04:04.680> problem<00:04:05.099> hitting

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
did that and it has no problem hitting

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.610 
did that and it has no problem hitting
it<00:04:05.519> dead<00:04:05.639> center<00:04:05.970> 50<00:04:06.389> yards<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.959> know<00:04:07.019> after

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
it dead center 50 yards you know after

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.830 
it dead center 50 yards you know after
that<00:04:07.650> it's<00:04:07.919> just<00:04:07.980> movement<00:04:08.639> and<00:04:09.090> ammunition

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
that it's just movement and ammunition

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.960 
that it's just movement and ammunition
I<00:04:09.870> shoot<00:04:10.560> wolf<00:04:10.889> ammo<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.519> buy<00:04:12.419> it<00:04:12.480> in<00:04:12.660> bulk<00:04:12.690> so<00:04:13.230> I

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
I shoot wolf ammo I buy it in bulk so I

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.250 
I shoot wolf ammo I buy it in bulk so I
mean<00:04:14.970> that's<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.720> know<00:04:15.810> it's<00:04:15.959> knocking

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
mean that's you know it's knocking

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.140 
mean that's you know it's knocking
you're<00:04:16.380> expecting<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.220> superior<00:04:17.669> accuracy<00:04:17.880> on

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
you're expecting a superior accuracy on

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.150 
you're expecting a superior accuracy on
that<00:04:18.269> kind<00:04:18.450> of<00:04:18.479> ammunition<00:04:19.010> here's<00:04:20.010> at<00:04:20.130> a

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
that kind of ammunition here's at a

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.760 
that kind of ammunition here's at a
hundred<00:04:20.489> yards<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.140> here<00:04:22.140> I<00:04:22.169> was<00:04:22.289> also<00:04:22.620> trying

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
hundred yards and here I was also trying

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.159 
hundred yards and here I was also trying
to<00:04:22.860> figure<00:04:22.979> out<00:04:23.099> where<00:04:23.400> was<00:04:23.789> and<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.930> realized

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
to figure out where was and I realized

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.160 
to figure out where was and I realized
that<00:04:25.500> when

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
that when

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.280 
that when
you<00:04:26.680> 0.50<00:04:27.610> that<00:04:28.180> at<00:04:28.300> 100<00:04:28.690> yards<00:04:28.960> that<00:04:29.020> shoot

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
you 0.50 that at 100 yards that shoot

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.470 
you 0.50 that at 100 yards that shoot
four<00:04:29.620> inches<00:04:29.860> high<00:04:30.100> so<00:04:31.000> you're<00:04:31.150> going<00:04:31.300> to<00:04:31.360> aim

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
four inches high so you're going to aim

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.600 
four inches high so you're going to aim
about<00:04:31.840> right<00:04:32.140> here<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:32.770> each<00:04:33.310> one<00:04:33.340> of<00:04:33.490> these

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
about right here and each one of these

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.670 
about right here and each one of these
squares<00:04:33.910> is<00:04:33.970> one<00:04:34.210> inch<00:04:34.420> so<00:04:34.630> one<00:04:34.930> two<00:04:35.200> three<00:04:35.560> and

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
squares is one inch so one two three and

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.680 
squares is one inch so one two three and
four<00:04:35.920> so<00:04:36.250> it's<00:04:36.400> going<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.550> hit<00:04:36.700> so<00:04:37.450> let's<00:04:37.570> be

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
four so it's going to hit so let's be

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.330 
four so it's going to hit so let's be
hitting<00:04:37.930> here<00:04:38.170> theoretically<00:04:38.770> but<00:04:39.010> when<00:04:39.250> the

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
hitting here theoretically but when the

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.400 
hitting here theoretically but when the
ammunition<00:04:39.880> is<00:04:40.060> not<00:04:40.570> going<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:40.990> be<00:04:41.050> doing<00:04:41.200> that

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
ammunition is not going to be doing that

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.860 
ammunition is not going to be doing that
because<00:04:41.620> it's<00:04:41.920> not<00:04:42.100> top<00:04:43.030> grade<00:04:43.330> ammunition

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
because it's not top grade ammunition

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.140 
because it's not top grade ammunition
and<00:04:44.160> you<00:04:45.160> know<00:04:45.220> just<00:04:45.430> show<00:04:45.610> you<00:04:45.670> the<00:04:45.790> accuracy

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
and you know just show you the accuracy

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.980 
and you know just show you the accuracy
out<00:04:46.360> of<00:04:46.480> the<00:04:46.540> box

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
out of the box

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.020 
out of the box
ten<00:04:47.170> ten<00:04:47.650> yards<00:04:48.010> you<00:04:48.160> know<00:04:48.280> I<00:04:48.460> could<00:04:48.760> split

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
ten ten yards you know I could split

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.510 
ten ten yards you know I could split
cards<00:04:49.480> on<00:04:49.600> edge<00:04:49.750> like<00:04:49.990> this<00:04:50.170> all<00:04:50.500> day<00:04:51.190> I<00:04:51.220> knew

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
cards on edge like this all day I knew

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.210 
cards on edge like this all day I knew
where<00:04:51.700> to<00:04:51.730> hit<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.210> I<00:04:52.300> did<00:04:52.480> five<00:04:52.980> like<00:04:53.980> this

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
where to hit and I did five like this

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.370 
where to hit and I did five like this
and<00:04:54.460> this<00:04:54.550> was<00:04:54.700> at<00:04:54.850> ten<00:04:55.030> yards<00:04:55.390> so<00:04:55.630> where<00:04:56.350> I

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
and this was at ten yards so where I

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.840 
and this was at ten yards so where I
could<00:04:56.620> still<00:04:56.800> see<00:04:56.980> the<00:04:57.010> edge<00:04:57.190> of<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.400> card<00:04:57.640> and

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
could still see the edge of the card and

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.940 
could still see the edge of the card and
you<00:04:58.570> can<00:04:58.600> look<00:04:58.840> at<00:04:58.990> that<00:04:59.110> that<00:04:59.260> almost<00:04:59.440> cut<00:04:59.740> all

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
you can look at that that almost cut all

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.480 
you can look at that that almost cut all
the<00:05:00.070> way<00:05:00.190> through

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
the way through

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.460 
the way through
well<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.240> 30<00:05:01.450> caliber<00:05:01.660> bullet<00:05:02.230> I<00:05:02.290> mean

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.440 
well the 30 caliber bullet I mean
hitting<00:05:02.710> on<00:05:02.890> edge<00:05:03.040> like<00:05:03.280> that<00:05:03.310> it's<00:05:04.240> pretty

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
hitting on edge like that it's pretty

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.280 
hitting on edge like that it's pretty
cool<00:05:06.300> so<00:05:07.300> you<00:05:07.390> know<00:05:07.600> questions<00:05:08.080> you<00:05:08.140> might

caliber so I don't have any other two to
three<00:05:26.740> guns<00:05:26.950> so<00:05:27.640> it<00:05:27.700> just<00:05:27.880> made<00:05:28.000> sense<00:05:28.030> to<00:05:28.390> buy

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
three guns so it just made sense to buy

three guns so it just made sense to buy
them<00:05:28.810> this<00:05:28.990> Plus<00:05:29.830> this<00:05:29.860> cartridge<00:05:30.310> packs<00:05:30.700> a

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
little bit of a punch and in this

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.380 
little bit of a punch and in this
platform<00:05:32.350> I<00:05:32.830> think<00:05:33.370> it's<00:05:33.490> definitely<00:05:33.700> great<00:05:34.150> I

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.300 
platform I think it's definitely great I
sure<00:05:35.140> as<00:05:35.260> hell<00:05:35.380> recommend<00:05:35.800> this<00:05:35.950> to<00:05:36.100> anybody

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
sure as hell recommend this to anybody

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.590 
sure as hell recommend this to anybody
who<00:05:36.610> wants<00:05:36.940> you<00:05:37.000> get<00:05:37.120> something<00:05:37.390> different

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
who wants you get something different

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.050 
who wants you get something different
rather<00:05:38.290> than<00:05:38.620> a<00:05:38.650> two<00:05:38.920> to<00:05:39.100> three<00:05:39.400> this<00:05:40.000> is

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
rather than a two to three this is

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.640 
rather than a two to three this is
probably<00:05:40.420> a<00:05:40.510> very<00:05:40.570> good<00:05:40.840> cartridge<00:05:41.350> to<00:05:41.500> go

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
probably a very good cartridge to go

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.850 
probably a very good cartridge to go
with<00:05:42.810> sure<00:05:43.810> so<00:05:43.960> I<00:05:43.990> would<00:05:44.140> buy<00:05:44.260> it<00:05:44.290> again<00:05:44.470> if<00:05:44.770> I

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
with sure so I would buy it again if I

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.770 
with sure so I would buy it again if I
could<00:05:44.920> and<00:05:45.280> I<00:05:45.340> want<00:05:45.550> to<00:05:45.640> get<00:05:45.760> a<00:05:45.790> short<00:05:46.420> upper

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
could and I want to get a short upper

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.590 
could and I want to get a short upper
for<00:05:46.990> this<00:05:47.370> 16<00:05:48.370> inch<00:05:48.460> to<00:05:48.730> be<00:05:48.820> particular<00:05:49.330> to<00:05:49.360> be

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
for this 16 inch to be particular to be

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.970 
for this 16 inch to be particular to be
exact<00:05:49.960> but<00:05:50.800> that's<00:05:51.010> that<00:05:51.760> they'll<00:05:52.000> be<00:05:52.180> in<00:05:52.270> time

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
exact but that's that they'll be in time

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.610 
exact but that's that they'll be in time
one<00:05:53.980> key<00:05:54.310> thing<00:05:54.580> to<00:05:54.730> note<00:05:54.940> is<00:05:55.180> that<00:05:55.500> you<00:05:56.500> may

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
one key thing to note is that you may

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.840 
one key thing to note is that you may
have<00:05:56.740> a<00:05:56.770> question<00:05:57.100> about<00:05:57.190> the<00:05:57.370> bolt<00:05:57.610> carrier

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
have a question about the bolt carrier

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.300 
have a question about the bolt carrier
in<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:58.270> group<00:05:58.480> a<00:05:58.750> bolt<00:05:59.350> carrier<00:05:59.620> group<00:05:59.650> the

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
in the group a bolt carrier group the

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.490 
in the group a bolt carrier group the
bolt<00:06:00.520> carrier<00:06:00.820> is<00:06:01.300> actually<00:06:01.840> identical<00:06:02.080> to<00:06:02.470> a

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
bolt carrier is actually identical to a

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.500 
bolt carrier is actually identical to a
two<00:06:02.680> to<00:06:02.830> three<00:06:03.100> it's<00:06:03.670> just<00:06:03.850> the<00:06:03.970> bolt<00:06:04.240> that's

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
two to three it's just the bolt that's

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.840 
two to three it's just the bolt that's
different<00:06:04.990> so<00:06:05.950> all<00:06:06.100> you<00:06:06.190> have<00:06:06.310> to<00:06:06.370> do<00:06:06.460> is<00:06:06.580> swap

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
different so all you have to do is swap

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.940 
different so all you have to do is swap
bolts<00:06:07.270> out<00:06:07.420> and<00:06:07.660> you<00:06:07.900> can<00:06:08.080> run<00:06:08.260> that<00:06:08.410> same<00:06:08.680> bolt

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
bolts out and you can run that same bolt

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.070 
bolts out and you can run that same bolt
carrier<00:06:09.340> in<00:06:09.490> a<00:06:09.610> two<00:06:09.820> to<00:06:10.000> three<00:06:10.210> and<00:06:10.360> the<00:06:10.840> firing

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
carrier in a two to three and the firing

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.620 
carrier in a two to three and the firing
pin<00:06:11.320> has<00:06:11.470> a<00:06:11.500> little<00:06:11.830> bit<00:06:11.950> of<00:06:12.040> a<00:06:12.420> has<00:06:13.420> a<00:06:13.450> little

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
pin has a little bit of a has a little

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.210 
pin has a little bit of a has a little
bit<00:06:13.780> of<00:06:13.900> material<00:06:14.110> taken<00:06:14.590> off<00:06:14.710> so<00:06:14.890> it<00:06:14.980> fits

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
bit of material taken off so it fits

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.160 
bit of material taken off so it fits
correctly<00:06:15.760> and<00:06:16.210> so<00:06:16.390> you<00:06:16.450> can<00:06:16.600> strike<00:06:16.900> these

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.170 
correctly and so you can strike these

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.380 
correctly and so you can strike these
all<00:06:17.380> wolf<00:06:17.620> primers<00:06:18.130> better<00:06:18.400> but<00:06:19.120> on<00:06:19.210> then<00:06:19.360> that

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
all wolf primers better but on then that

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.560 
all wolf primers better but on then that
is<00:06:19.690> pretty<00:06:19.930> good<00:06:20.200> recoil<00:06:21.010> wise<00:06:21.340> it's<00:06:21.700> decent

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
is pretty good recoil wise it's decent

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.180 
is pretty good recoil wise it's decent
it's<00:06:22.720> a<00:06:22.840> little<00:06:23.170> bit<00:06:23.290> more<00:06:23.590> than<00:06:23.770> a<00:06:23.800> two<00:06:24.010> to

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
it's a little bit more than a two to

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.460 
it's a little bit more than a two to
three<00:06:24.460> so<00:06:24.910> I've<00:06:25.030> been<00:06:25.240> told<00:06:25.480> I<00:06:25.780> only<00:06:26.260> have

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
three so I've been told I only have

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.860 
three so I've been told I only have

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
experience with 30 caliber rifles like F

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.950 
experience with 30 caliber rifles like F
involves<00:06:29.770> you<00:06:29.890> know<00:06:29.920> and<00:06:30.390> thirty-odd<00:06:31.390> sixes
