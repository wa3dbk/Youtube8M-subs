00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.930 
looks really nice in my personal opinion
and<00:02:24.240> my<00:02:24.470> shield<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.400> wrathful

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
and my shield is the wrathful

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.800 
gladiator's barrier you can get that in
dollar<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:30.690> basically<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.940> it's<00:02:32.940> just<00:02:33.660> for

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
dollar on basically and it's just for

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.960 
dollar on basically and it's just for
PvP<00:02:34.260> points<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.860> relatively<00:02:35.250> high<00:02:35.460> amount

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
PvP points it's a relatively high amount

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.050 
PvP points it's a relatively high amount
but<00:02:36.270> shields<00:02:36.720> really<00:02:36.960> don't<00:02:37.110> cost<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.500> much

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
but shields really don't cost that much

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.580 
but shields really don't cost that much
