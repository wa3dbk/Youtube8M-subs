beginning<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> game<00:01:16.380> they're<00:01:16.590> gonna<00:01:16.740> ask

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
beginning of the game they're gonna ask

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.520 
beginning of the game they're gonna ask
you<00:01:17.189> if<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:18.509> know<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.869> katana<00:01:19.140> ask<00:01:19.350> some

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
you if I you know the katana ask some

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.770 
you if I you know the katana ask some
tips<00:01:19.830> or<00:01:20.070> how<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.939> use<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> buttons<00:01:21.689> or

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
tips or how to use the buttons or

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.969 
tips or how to use the buttons or
whatever<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.320> you're<00:01:22.439> gonna<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.740> click

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
whatever so you're gonna have to click

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.280 
whatever so you're gonna have to click
it<00:01:23.100> off<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:24.030> looks<00:01:24.270> exactly<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.810> same<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.259> I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it off it looks exactly the same so I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.109 
it off it looks exactly the same so I
think<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.770> year<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.189> tight<00:01:26.490> formation<00:01:27.030> is

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
think this year the tight formation is

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.980 
think this year the tight formation is
going<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:27.450> good<00:01:27.659> again<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.229> also<00:01:29.009> had<00:01:29.340> some

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
going to be good again I also had some

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.210 
going to be good again I also had some
nice<00:01:30.990> reads<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.920> again<00:01:32.460> saw<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:34.220> defense

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
nice reads to do again saw the defense

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.310 
nice reads to do again saw the defense
is<00:01:35.430> they<00:01:35.549> were<00:01:35.610> playing<00:01:35.850> zone<00:01:36.180> or<00:01:36.540> man<00:01:36.780> with

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
is they were playing zone or man with

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.399 
is they were playing zone or man with
the<00:01:38.100> tight<00:01:38.939> formation<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:40.020> can't<00:01:40.290> wait

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the tight formation so I just can't wait

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.410 
the tight formation so I just can't wait
to<00:01:40.740> dominate<00:01:41.189> once<00:01:41.430> again<00:01:41.820> we're<00:01:42.119> gonna<00:01:42.180> make

right<00:02:20.220> here<00:02:20.430> we<00:02:20.610> are<00:02:20.730> with<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.050> screenplay<00:02:22.050> I

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
right here we are with the screenplay I

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.290 
right here we are with the screenplay I
guess<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.650> one<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.950> new<00:02:23.070> features

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
guess this is one of the new features

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.360 
guess this is one of the new features
supposedly<00:02:24.300> they<00:02:24.510> switched<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.470> up<00:02:25.530> how<00:02:26.310> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
supposedly they switched it up how the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.220 
supposedly they switched it up how the
screenplays<00:02:26.970> we're<00:02:27.120> going<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.300> work<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.930> as

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
screenplays we're going to work and as

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.360 
screenplays we're going to work and as
you<00:02:28.320> saw<00:02:28.440> there<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.740> was<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.860> quick<00:02:29.100> preview

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
you saw there that was a quick preview

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.290 
you saw there that was a quick preview
of<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:31.160> this<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.310> studio<00:02:32.550> update<00:02:32.850> right

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
of it and this is studio update right

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.790 
of it and this is studio update right
here<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.530> game<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:35.280> guess<00:02:36.060> Florida<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.800> as

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
here of the game I guess Florida and as

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.400 
here of the game I guess Florida and as
you<00:02:37.980> saw<00:02:38.130> there<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.610> quick<00:02:39.330> score<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.110> that's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
you saw there a quick score so that's

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.660 
you saw there a quick score so that's
something<00:02:40.680> new<00:02:40.950> i<00:02:40.980> don't<00:02:41.250> think<00:02:41.550> i<00:02:41.610> remember

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
something new i don't think i remember

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.760 
something new i don't think i remember
that<00:02:42.180> i<00:02:42.450> don't<00:02:42.780> know<00:02:42.840> these<00:02:42.960> guys<00:02:43.170> playing<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
that i don't know these guys playing the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.830 
that i don't know these guys playing the
computer<00:02:44.280> or<00:02:44.640> playing<00:02:45.150> somebody<00:02:45.540> else<00:02:45.750> he

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
computer or playing somebody else he

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.210 
computer or playing somebody else he
looked<00:02:45.990> like<00:02:46.020> he<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:46.380> playing<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.710> computer

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
looked like he just playing the computer

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.000 
looked like he just playing the computer
or<00:02:48.180> playing<00:02:48.510> just<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.840> regular<00:02:49.020> game<00:02:49.350> but<00:02:49.680> you

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
or playing just a regular game but you

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.610 
or playing just a regular game but you
know<00:02:50.160> III<00:02:50.820> really<00:02:51.420> enjoyed<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.110> game<00:02:52.320> last

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
know III really enjoyed the game last

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.050 
know III really enjoyed the game last
year<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.130> really<00:02:53.430> don't<00:02:53.550> have<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.760> problem

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
year so I really don't have a problem

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.570 
year so I really don't have a problem
with<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.620> they<00:02:55.620> just<00:02:55.650> probably<00:02:56.010> just<00:02:56.340> added

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
with it they just probably just added

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.370 
with it they just probably just added
some<00:02:56.610> new<00:02:56.850> things<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.050> same

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
some new things to it but the same

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.280 
some new things to it but the same
mechanics<00:02:59.250> looks<00:02:59.490> exactly<00:02:59.910> like<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:01.050> did<00:03:01.230> last

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
mechanics looks exactly like it did last

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.840 
mechanics looks exactly like it did last
year<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:01.800> i'm<00:03:01.920> pretty<00:03:02.130> sure<00:03:02.310> i'm<00:03:02.550> going<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.760> be

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
year so i'm pretty sure i'm going to be

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.400 
year so i'm pretty sure i'm going to be
one<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.210> top<00:03:03.450> players<00:03:03.660> for<00:03:03.990> any<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.260> boy

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
one of the top players for any the boy

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.380 
one of the top players for any the boy
once<00:03:04.710> again<00:03:05.040> i<00:03:05.280> think<00:03:05.610> last<00:03:05.790> year<00:03:05.970> i<00:03:06.090> made<00:03:06.120> it

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
once again i think last year i made it

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.780 
once again i think last year i made it
to<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.600> top<00:03:06.780> 50<00:03:07.290> this<00:03:08.280> year<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.550> should

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
to the top 50 this year I should

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.120 
to the top 50 this year I should
probably<00:03:09.030> go<00:03:09.330> all<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.600> way<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.990> top<00:03:10.020> 10<00:03:10.500> if

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
probably go all the way to the top 10 if

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.340 
probably go all the way to the top 10 if
not<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.700> top<00:03:11.730> or<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.570> main<00:03:12.780> one<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.290> the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
not the top or the main one of the

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.230 
not the top or the main one of the
number<00:03:13.860> one<00:03:13.890> player<00:03:14.280> frenzy<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.850> boy<00:03:15.000> this

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
number one player frenzy the boy this

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.310 
number one player frenzy the boy this
year<00:03:15.270> so<00:03:15.600> that's<00:03:15.780> one<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:15.990> my<00:03:16.080> predictions

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
year so that's one of my predictions

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.420 
year so that's one of my predictions
basically<00:03:19.320> last<00:03:19.530> year<00:03:19.709> used<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:19.980> use<00:03:20.100> a<00:03:20.130> lot<00:03:20.400> of

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
basically last year used to use a lot of

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.570 
basically last year used to use a lot of
the<00:03:20.550> pistol<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.209> Maryland<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.830> used<00:03:23.370> to

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
the pistol the Maryland and I used to

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.300 
the pistol the Maryland and I used to
use<00:03:24.300> a<00:03:24.330> lot<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.900> okie<00:03:25.440> defense<00:03:25.920> as<00:03:26.100> well

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
use a lot of the okie defense as well

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.150 
use a lot of the okie defense as well
and<00:03:27.120> which<00:03:27.989> actually<00:03:28.260> translated<00:03:28.950> really

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
and which actually translated really

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.740 
and which actually translated really
good<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.520> Madeline<00:03:29.910> which<00:03:30.060> actually<00:03:30.270> was<00:03:30.570> the

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
good and Madeline which actually was the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.560 
good and Madeline which actually was the
fight<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.110> defense<00:03:31.530> in<00:03:31.680> Madden<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:33.450> know

fight to defense in Madden and you know

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.240 
fight to defense in Madden and you know
I<00:03:33.600> did<00:03:33.870> really<00:03:34.050> good<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:34.440> I'm<00:03:34.590> gonna<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:35.040> mean<00:03:35.130> I

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250
