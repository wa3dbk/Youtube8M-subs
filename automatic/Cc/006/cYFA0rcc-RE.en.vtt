it's<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.710> same<00:01:53.890> basic<00:01:54.280> things<00:01:54.460> it's<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.790> same

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
it's the same basic things it's the same

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.940 
it's the same basic things it's the same
you<00:01:55.540> know<00:01:55.570> evaluation<00:01:56.259> of<00:01:56.350> risk<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.770> all<00:01:56.830> that

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
you know evaluation of risk and all that

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.070 
you know evaluation of risk and all that
kind<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.130> stuff<00:01:57.539> because<00:01:58.539> you<00:01:58.720> know<00:01:58.750> I<00:01:58.840> start

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
kind of stuff because you know I start

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.539 
kind of stuff because you know I start
climbing<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.470> make<00:01:59.619> sure<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.920> materials<00:02:00.399> are

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
climbing I make sure the materials are

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.370 
climbing I make sure the materials are
solid<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:00.940> mean<00:02:01.119> because<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.899> concrete<00:02:02.080> work

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
solid I mean because the concrete work

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.810 
solid I mean because the concrete work
on<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.619> Palace<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:02.950> Fine<00:02:02.979> Arts<00:02:03.340> was<00:02:03.549> actually

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
on the Palace of Fine Arts was actually

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.550 
on the Palace of Fine Arts was actually
super<00:02:04.360> well<00:02:04.539> maintained<00:02:04.899> like<00:02:05.170> really<00:02:05.439> nice

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
super well maintained like really nice

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.230 
super well maintained like really nice
solid<00:02:06.039> I<00:02:06.189> kept<00:02:06.610> thinking<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:06.909> was<00:02:07.000> like<00:02:07.030> this

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
solid I kept thinking it was like this

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.699 
solid I kept thinking it was like this
is<00:02:07.420> really<00:02:07.570> good<00:02:07.689> rock<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.019> my<00:02:08.440> weight<00:02:08.649> I

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
is really good rock and my weight I

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:09.990 
is really good rock and my weight I
guess<00:02:08.860> it's<00:02:09.009> like<00:02:09.130> concrete<00:02:09.489> but<00:02:09.729> either<00:02:09.819> way

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
guess it's like concrete but either way

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.400 
guess it's like concrete but either way
like<00:02:10.209> this<00:02:10.300> is<00:02:10.450> really<00:02:10.660> good

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.240
