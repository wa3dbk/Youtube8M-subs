00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
said one minute

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.300 
said one minute
and<00:02:51.610> then<00:02:52.240> a<00:02:52.480> radius<00:02:53.080> of<00:02:53.410> say<00:02:54.480> 20<00:02:55.480> blocks<00:02:56.310> that

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
and then a radius of say 20 blocks that

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.290 
and then a radius of say 20 blocks that
should<00:02:57.780> get<00:02:58.780> rid<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:59.190> that<00:03:00.190> there<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.910> are

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
should get rid of that there you are

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.220 
should get rid of that there you are
so<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:01.480> can<00:03:01.630> do<00:03:01.750> two<00:03:02.560> methods<00:03:02.980> by<00:03:03.280> user<00:03:03.580> or<00:03:04.330> you

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
so you can do two methods by user or you

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.580 
so you can do two methods by user or you
can<00:03:05.440> actually<00:03:05.620> use<00:03:06.190> by<00:03:07.030> time<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.810> then<00:03:08.410> give

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
can actually use by time and then give

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.530 
can actually use by time and then give
it<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.769> ray<00:03:08.950> radius<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:09.700> was<00:03:09.820> about<00:03:10.000> 20<00:03:10.360> blocks

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
it a ray radius that was about 20 blocks

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.440 
it a ray radius that was about 20 blocks
and<00:03:11.140> that<00:03:11.500> gets<00:03:11.739> it<00:03:11.920> gets<00:03:12.130> rid<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.459> now

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
and that gets it gets rid of that now

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.690 
and that gets it gets rid of that now
this<00:03:13.600> hasn't<00:03:13.959> got<00:03:14.200> rid<00:03:14.380> of<00:03:14.470> this<00:03:14.590> now<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:15.519> can

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
this hasn't got rid of this now you can

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.580 
this hasn't got rid of this now you can
do<00:03:15.880> that<00:03:16.090> by<00:03:16.330> just<00:03:16.360> going<00:03:17.100> see<00:03:18.100> Oh<00:03:19.019> roll<00:03:20.019> back

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
do that by just going see Oh roll back

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.120 
do that by just going see Oh roll back
and<00:03:20.950> then<00:03:21.880> either<00:03:22.480> user<00:03:23.940> all<00:03:24.940> time<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:26.130> then

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
and then either user all time and then

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.860 
and then either user all time and then
you<00:03:27.310> would<00:03:27.430> put<00:03:27.670> like<00:03:27.940> some<00:03:28.150> more<00:03:28.360> like<00:03:28.570> five

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
you would put like some more like five

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.259 
you would put like some more like five
minutes<00:03:29.350> would<00:03:29.650> clear<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.459> then<00:03:30.640> radius

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
minutes would clear it and then radius

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.400 
minutes would clear it and then radius
of<00:03:31.720> say<00:03:32.560> 20<00:03:33.489> again<00:03:33.790> which<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.300> cover<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.750> you

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
of say 20 again which I cover it you

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.390 
of say 20 again which I cover it you
know<00:03:35.560> 20<00:03:36.160> blocks<00:03:36.370> I'll<00:03:37.330> put<00:03:37.540> it<00:03:37.660> in<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:38.190> see<00:03:39.190> 20

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
know 20 blocks I'll put it in to see 20

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.030 
know 20 blocks I'll put it in to see 20
blocks<00:03:39.700> all<00:03:39.970> 13<00:03:40.450> blocks<00:03:40.660> that<00:03:41.530> would<00:03:41.650> get<00:03:41.860> rid

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
blocks all 13 blocks that would get rid

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.530 
blocks all 13 blocks that would get rid
of<00:03:42.070> that<00:03:42.340> but<00:03:43.120> I<00:03:43.540> was<00:03:43.930> trying<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.290> find<00:03:45.540> another

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
of that but I was trying to find another

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.800 
of that but I was trying to find another
method<00:03:46.920> if<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:48.160> can't<00:03:48.459> roll<00:03:49.330> it<00:03:49.360> back<00:03:49.780> and

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
method if you can't roll it back and

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.970 
method if you can't roll it back and
you've<00:03:50.170> got<00:03:50.320> a<00:03:50.350> bit<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.620> lava<00:03:50.860> back<00:03:51.330> left<00:03:52.980> burn

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
you've got a bit of lava back left burn

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.400 
you've got a bit of lava back left burn
method<00:03:54.489> you<00:03:54.610> couldn't<00:03:54.910> actually<00:03:56.670> do<00:03:57.670> that<00:03:58.120> get

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
method you couldn't actually do that get

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.990 
method you couldn't actually do that get
lava<00:03:59.410> like<00:03:59.709> that<00:04:00.269> but<00:04:01.269> I<00:04:01.630> like<00:04:02.310> this<00:04:03.310> as<00:04:03.549> well<00:04:03.760> I

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
lava like that but I like this as well I

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.300 
lava like that but I like this as well I
like<00:04:04.209> them<00:04:04.660> I<00:04:04.870> think<00:04:05.500> it's<00:04:05.620> worldedit

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
like them I think it's worldedit

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.420 
like them I think it's worldedit
drain<00:04:07.239> I<00:04:07.600> quite<00:04:08.500> like<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:08.739> I<00:04:08.980> think<00:04:09.310> you

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
drain I quite like that I think you

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.360 
drain I quite like that I think you
don't<00:04:09.850> you<00:04:10.030> staff<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.600> stand<00:04:10.870> in<00:04:11.080> it<00:04:11.290> but<00:04:12.250> you

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
don't you staff to stand in it but you

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.120 
don't you staff to stand in it but you
can<00:04:12.400> drain<00:04:12.819> this<00:04:13.060> by<00:04:13.300> going<00:04:13.510> forward<00:04:13.990> slash

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
can drain this by going forward slash

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.570 
can drain this by going forward slash
this<00:04:15.610> has<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.940> be<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.750> world<00:04:17.170> edit<00:04:17.650> plug-in<00:04:18.160> by

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
this has to be the world edit plug-in by

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.420 
this has to be the world edit plug-in by
the<00:04:18.640> way<00:04:19.050> so<00:04:20.050> there's<00:04:20.440> two<00:04:20.620> plugins<00:04:20.950> this<00:04:21.280> is

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
the way so there's two plugins this is

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.120 
the way so there's two plugins this is
the<00:04:21.640> second<00:04:22.090> one<00:04:22.240> will<00:04:22.720> dead<00:04:22.960> 't<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.410> then<00:04:24.010> you

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
the second one will dead 't and then you

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.930 
the second one will dead 't and then you
just<00:04:24.340> put<00:04:24.550> drained<00:04:26.700> and<00:04:27.700> then<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.240> radius<00:04:28.810> of

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
just put drained and then a radius of

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.800 
just put drained and then a radius of
say<00:04:30.940> 30<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:32.230> it<00:04:33.190> should<00:04:33.990> drain<00:04:34.990> all<00:04:35.230> the<00:04:35.260> lava

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
say 30 and it should drain all the lava

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.280 
say 30 and it should drain all the lava
there<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:37.900> are

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
there you are

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.170 
there you are
56<00:04:38.980> blocks<00:04:39.580> of<00:04:39.760> lava<00:04:40.560> so<00:04:41.560> just<00:04:41.800> disappeared<00:04:42.370> so

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
56 blocks of lava so just disappeared so

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.860 
56 blocks of lava so just disappeared so
I<00:04:43.210> hope<00:04:43.510> that<00:04:43.540> helps<00:04:44.020> you<00:04:44.110> everyone<00:04:45.690> this<00:04:46.690> is

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
and put another point there of lava

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.650 
and put another point there of lava
there<00:05:50.200> that<00:05:50.560> look<00:05:50.800> and<00:05:51.130> a<00:05:51.610> point<00:05:52.270> of<00:05:52.390> lava

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.530 
there that look and a point of lava
there<00:05:53.130> what<00:05:54.130> you<00:05:54.280> do<00:05:54.490> is<00:05:55.680> see<00:05:56.680> oh<00:05:56.710> I<00:05:56.950> just<00:05:57.730> put<00:05:58.480> a

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
there what you do is see oh I just put a

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.340 
there what you do is see oh I just put a
block<00:05:58.870> any<00:05:59.110> block<00:06:00.840> let's<00:06:01.840> put<00:06:02.020> a<00:06:02.050> grass<00:06:02.320> block

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
block any block let's put a grass block

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.230 
block any block let's put a grass block
because<00:06:02.860> then<00:06:03.010> it's<00:06:03.160> obvious<00:06:03.670> what<00:06:03.850> I'm<00:06:03.910> doing

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
because then it's obvious what I'm doing

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.820 
because then it's obvious what I'm doing
then<00:06:04.650> so<00:06:05.650> they<00:06:05.710> put<00:06:05.890> a<00:06:05.920> grass<00:06:06.670> block<00:06:07.210> there

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
then so they put a grass block there

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.910 
then so they put a grass block there
there<00:06:08.830> there<00:06:09.400> there<00:06:09.820> there<00:06:10.470> and<00:06:11.470> there

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.340 

the<00:06:14.920> lava<00:06:15.160> should<00:06:15.490> go<00:06:15.700> put<00:06:16.270> but<00:06:16.930> you<00:06:17.020> still

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
the lava should go put but you still

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.940 
the lava should go put but you still
want<00:06:17.590> to<00:06:17.710> know

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950

mr. Philander's the lavas probably all
the<00:06:22.040> way<00:06:22.190> around<00:06:22.490> here<00:06:27.250> you<00:06:28.250> did<00:06:28.580> it<00:06:28.790> but<00:06:29.780> by

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
putting a block there I think they

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.100 
putting a block there I think they
should<00:06:31.580> work<00:06:31.820> if<00:06:32.060> it<00:06:32.180> doesn't<00:06:32.210> not<00:06:32.750> not<00:06:33.080> a

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
should work if it doesn't not not a

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.820 
should work if it doesn't not not a
