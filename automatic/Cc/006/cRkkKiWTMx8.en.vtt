00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.720
 Well, when I say that the Modus, that was the small MPV from Renault, not .. 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.529
 was really a blast, then I didn't really lie much. 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.219
 We are now driving with his successor, the Captur. 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.560
 It is really better in everything: because it is bigger, it is lighter and very important, it .. 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.890
 consumes much less. 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.269
 Now let's take a look: is it really much better? 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.429
 The similarity is of course striking between these, the Clio that we do know .. 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:31.800
 and the Captur. 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.410
 Up to the hood it is just completely right, 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.120
 only the Captur that goes up about 12 cm higher. 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.050
 If you opt for a gasoline engine in the Captur, 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.680
 you have the choice of two: 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.700
 namely the small 3-cylinder 0.9 liter that we also know from the Renault Clio .. 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.040
 with 90 hp, or .. 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.350
 the car we are now in, 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.700
 1.2 liters, 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.740
 4 cylinder, with 120 hp. 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.710
 He does have a certain peculiarity, that he namely .. 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.340
 can only be connected to this automatic gearbox, 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.170
 the so-called 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.920
 DSG gearbox, or .. 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.210
 in beautiful French an .. 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.820
 "Doppelkopplungschaltgetriebe". 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.820
 In this car that is a very pleasant combination. 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.010
 This engine has one badness and that is this: when you drive away .. 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.290
 holds it smooth. 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.290
 That will undoubtedly have to do with consumption, but it is not pleasant. 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.370
 The entry in the front .. 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.400
 it's super easy. 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.870
 And once you sit down you have enough legroom and certainly a lot .. 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.890
 main room. 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.870
 Those seats that are nice and French comfortable. They are only for the wat .. 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.720
 taller people, they are a bit short and narrow. 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.130
 This is really something we have never seen in a car: 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.250
 Normally cars just have a glove compartment, 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.619
 but this one has, unbelievably, a windscreen drawer. Take a look: 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.110
 11 liter capacity. Gigantic. 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.999
 Also in the back there is enough space, because if I sit down behind myself - I am 1 m 87 - 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:15.899
 then the knee room is just sufficient, but the headroom is plenty. 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:17.519
 You can see the child's seat here: 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.239
 the space for the legs does not end there. 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.249
 The storage options in the back are not too big. 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:27.239
 You do have a small pocket in the doors and some elastics against the backrest .. 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.779
 where you can put some flat things in between. 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.159
 What is very handy is removable upholstery. 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.639
 Because if you have a child in the back who gets a little car sick, 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.859
 you have very simple .. 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.629
 release the zipper and you can throw it in the washing machine. 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.089
 The trunk is 380 liters for its class, quite large. 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:48.789
 and is also variable once. You can have that back seat in 16 .. 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:50.549
 move back and forth by an inch. 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.569
 The second is, it has a double bottom, so you can also lose a whole lot below that. 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.979
 Also very handy: the key card. No more messing around with a key with buttons. 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.629
 You just do this in your pocket and .. 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.439
 it will close automatically. 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.989
 And when you return, with the key in your pocket, 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.339
 just press the button and it is open. 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:15.219
 Just like with other modern cars, the view around is not too bad, certainly .. 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:16.369
 backwards. 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:17.630
 The sensors .. 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.219
 and in this case a camera, that is really necessary. 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.759
 We can actually be very short about the driving characteristics: they are just good. 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:29.259
 It is well on the road, cornering properties are good, 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.099
 really perfect handling. 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.359
 And especially the braking distance that is real .. 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.239
 very short. 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.389
 Because this is really the big difference with the direct competitor, the Peugeot 2008. 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:50.389
 Because suppose this had been at 100 km / h, then that 2008 was only .. 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:54.659
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 meters further silent. 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.520
 The so-called Airlink system is also on the more expensive levels. 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.269
 That is not just the familiar navigation and connection with your phone, 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.309
 it goes much further. Then you also have a system for vehicle information and even .. 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:06.559
 retrieve your e-mail. 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:08.579
 You must have a subscription for it. 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.669
 And that navigation is a very simple Tomtommetje, with the advantage that you too .. 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.529
 for example, file information. 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:18.349
 But be aware that some cars only have a Netherlands card, but you want .. 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.969
 of course have the map of the whole of Europe. 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.400
 And there are also two ecosystems on it. The first is .. 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.180
 a fairly obvious one: 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.409
 the bigger the leaf becomes, the more economical you drive, 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.999
 but the second is really an unknown, because it measures the air quality. 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:36.919
 Then I think it's nice to know, but what else do you get out of it? 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.710
 We come to the conclusion: well, we are actually very positive about the Renault Captur, 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.180
 because this is just a nice and spacious car for its kind and class, 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.889
 with a few big advantages over its big competitor, the Peugeot .. 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.599
 2008. That is, after all, the handy user options with that rear seat and .. 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.419
 that braking distance that is considerably shorter. 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.610
 Have we also discovered disadvantages to the Captur? Well, actually not. The only thing that.. 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.120
 I could think of is .. 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.210
 you are hitting at a somewhat higher consumption of that 1.2. Well, there is a solution .. 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.270
 for, that is the 0.9 3-cylinder, 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.469
 he is also tired of it.
