00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.620
 Is thought that Kaiserslautern 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.090
 Thank you very much for visiting 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.610
 I will 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:24.500
 Today I would like to introduce the lens of the camera and threaten it . 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:30.350
 Yes Today's lens is here Nikon's nikkor lens 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:37.040
 It is g goodwill f 4 vr of 1635 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:40.430
 In Japan, this lens is mainly in the category called wide angle 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:47.270
 It is wide-angle standard zoom 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:50.370
 It has a lens other's macros as other special-purpose Kedomo fundamental to the wide-angle standard 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:56.430
 It will be classified as zoom, of which 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:01:03.660
 I 'm in the category of passing, so it 's like a letter that you can get a lot of demotion 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:10.360
 The reason I decided to buy this lens is, for example, a meal in the room 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:16.500
 Birthday is a household possessions went is the sea I With this kind of lens right 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:22.440
 It is very convenient because the photo many showing off can be taken until towards the left from the direction of 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:29.370
 I thought it was good to buy this and I think the scene is with the father and mother in kindergarten 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:34.619
 At that time together or to shop in the kindergarten with the children in times is though is Attan 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.520
 Now I'm very close Kedomo I did you work to make a lot of things are on the small desk 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.109
 Such children to close in the 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:46.000
 It's not away from your home is also narrow I'm close 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:50.560
 In even if such a because you take widely if there is such a wide-angle lens 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.959
 I thought Tteyuu lot of product even close to the required can be taken 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.510
 I think the lever is easy, but it will be a very long lens so it's very good to have one 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:04.370
 To 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:08.300
 I think that it is convenient It is another one point It is this kind of Nikkor lens 16 mm this time 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:12.720
 It is another lens called 35 mm name 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:20.760
 There is lens called 10 millimeters 24 millimeters 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:23.650
 In terms of the big difference, this means that the f value is called and the 1424 mentioned earlier is the f value 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:30.939
 Is bright at 2.8 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:34.450
 But that Tteyuu first of weakness that everyone is said it is a filter glass prior to this table 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:39.480
 This is the f 4 lens protector 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:45.170
 Month of Tteyuu its 1424 mm f 2.8 lens 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:51.319
 The surface of this lens is high without this projector 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:55.550
 The hood is worn out because it is out on the surface, which is a curved protrusion . 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:03:01.280
 This in the last minute hood in a state in which the hood with this 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:05.160
 It is a lens that draws a circle , so I put a filter as a result 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.400
 That I can not I will Welcome also those who are wearing that forcibly 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.550
 There is no screw-in filter . 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.750
 Is, for example, the Tteyuu If you use a 2.8 lens 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:19.050
 If it is taken closer when you're swinging with a lens 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:24.510
 Unexpected Toka it would hit the doctor 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.810
 A lens that can be considered so kind of accident Toka you would against a tree when wielding the 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.209
 I'm there 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:36.760
 There is a place where you don't have to worry about it just because it has a hood 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:41.950
 But there are some disadvantages like that, but the merit is f value 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:45.830
 This lens of 4 is a lens whose beginning is 16 mm 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:49.180
 Just 14 mm 24 mm is the 14th floor 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:52.180
 Further than you of at this lens begins 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:58.930
 I can take a wide angle wide angle 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:03.280
 In the f 2.8 it here 35 mm with respect to it telephoto face is the telephoto side to reverse 1424 - 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:09.060
 Since it becomes 24 mm, this one is far 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:15.180
 As the boom is sharp and say that to you it after other basic specs happens 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:23.040
 The nanocrystal coat has a big difference after it's both weight 16 mm 35 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:29.040
 Milli f 4 to about 680g to 1 o 2 of 2.8 to about 1 kg 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:35.430
 It will no but I'm such a place that say you take if Well rod of the side 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:41.670
 Mine It is also in fact 14 and Japan Tteyuu this 1635 was lost really 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:44.700
 I lost 3 months in there and why did you decide this 16 35 mm and it was also heavy? 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:49.030
 It is this vr but is 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:53.440
 I'm hand-shake correction is not about 142 Ono 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:05:00.850
 This 16 mm 35 mm comes with a vr 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:06.520
 As I have a camera shake correction, I still work as children are the main 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:09.020
 Because it fleamer, it is said that a lens like that comes out and camera shake correction is not attached by all means 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.319
 How much is the edge 2.8 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:17.180
 Even I was taken in the manner of the disadvantage 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:19.270
 I thought it was good to see from the results and it would be better if there was a bag 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.420
 Risk of damaging the lens 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:27.640
 Think of it as a hobby like me 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.970
 It could be honest because there is no need to wo and from human being to the camera and hobby 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.690
 The 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:37.090
 I think that I would like to see it 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:39.910
 Well, let's look at the details here . First we will take the food. 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.810
 There is a flower-shaped climate 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:50.320
 Nde wide-angle has become quite shallow feeling of culture 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:55.360
 Since the filter diameter here is 77 mm, it is a lens with a fairly large aperture in a clock 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:59.900
 So the filter itself is a little expensive, so if you think about it including that side too 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.160
 I think that zoom ring is this mount side 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.849
 Tilaga 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:08.370
 It becomes a zoom ring 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:09.300
 The lens zooms in front because the zoom only moves in with the inner zoom. 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:14.580
 Or 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:16.080
 There is no thing that the filter will turn around It is the lens side It is the front side of the lens 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:21.990
 It Dial 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:24.009
 It is a movie that will be on the 10th of manual focus, but there is some play 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.050
 I will 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.050
 Have 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.050
 Hmm
