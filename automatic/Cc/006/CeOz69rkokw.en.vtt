00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.349
 a picture of the destruction in the bützower 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.460
 Old town consists of numerous houses 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.739
 collapse danger 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.750
 At least 17 are permanently uninhabitable 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:37.059
 Residents and 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.860
 operational forces, the debris aside the 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.410
 a tornado last night through the 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.390
 flung roads has eyewitnesses 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.190
 According to him, he is about ten minutes over 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.650
 the inner city have raged 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.080
 You can not do that because it is so 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.010
 Bad is last night you can do that 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.229
 I do not believe words 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.269
 describe that is like in the war 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:58.350
 been said last night we have 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:01.299
 Solar cells fly like bullets 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.430
 flown in the air so you can do it 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.260
 Do not describe that is then too 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.390
 shocked if you see that, so chaos 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.810
 pure fear will be the guests evening 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.990
 Running through it was scary 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:19.710
 we have made a video so has 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:22.990
 cried and so cool I knew then 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.719
 especially the historical core of the 7600 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.490
 inhabitant of the city is affected first 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:31.500
 it is estimated that the damage is 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.500
 in the double-digit million range 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.159
 equal to several tornados yesterday in 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.710
 Mecklenburg they emerge through a 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.890
 extreme weather conditions with wind forces of 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.719
 probably more than 250 kilometers per hour 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.610
 soon they will probably fly over more often 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:46.920
 country 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.280
 in the course of climate warming it always gets 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.110
 moister and warmer and there you can 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.210
 the thunderstorms certainly do 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.240
 achieve strength and then tornadoes 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.100
 produce will be with you yesterday evening 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.700
 nobody had such a force of nature 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.650
 expected 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.690
 until late at night, residents and 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.510
 operational forces debris aside the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.759
 Fire department reports more than 100 cars 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.080
 will be damaged in the storm 30 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.270
 Persons slightly injured 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.530
 a cyclist gets heavy from 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.120
 hit a brick 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.640
 This nursing home also gets it 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.900
 bad a coworker reports it 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.459
 was terrible so very terrible 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.750
 We had the inhabitants away 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.780
 bring to 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.989
 The windows were broken 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.900
 did not go fight today everywhere 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.220
 in the place and the return to normality 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.440
 Homeless people become homeless 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.850
 neighbors or strangers under a group 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.860
 helper has left the neighboring 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.550
 Gustrow on the way 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.750
 I saw what's here and 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.310
 district town in our circle and then 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.790
 I spontaneously call via facebook 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.739
 We are happy to help you with the cleaning up 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.690
 it will take to become 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.880
 all the roofs of the city as here on 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.750
 city ​​hall must first loose 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.730
 be searched for months 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.830
 probably pass until all damage in the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.200
 small town in Mecklenburg eliminated 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.060
 are 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.150
 in bützow our reporter susanne 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.959
 seidel susanne absolute emergency there 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.580
 where they stand 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.299
 how do the houses look like? 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.830
 People are still living there 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.110
 is very different some houses 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.880
 have been evacuated because there 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.860
 danger of collapse exists other houses 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.989
 are really bad the damaged 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.670
 Roofs are partially covered the 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.560
 window smashed and you tried 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.510
 to fix it with a makeshift repair now 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.959
 the people stay in there live 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.370
 can 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.290
 at the moment it is really very 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.810
 dangerous to walk through jokes 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.580
 because thw and firefighters are on everywhere 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.560

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.489
 become roof tiles from the roofs 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.950
 to throw 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.320
 because the danger is just too big for that 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.519
 a next wind comes and everything 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.110
 again cleared and then it is 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.060
 actually wants to hurt again 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.380
 could come 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.000
 we see it have the scavenging work 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.470

 delmenhorst in the district hasbergen 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.559
 the storm was raging in the yard before 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.149
 by farmer long ago kinking ancient 

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:48.209
 tree giant around the matches 

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:51.209
 All at once the white wall came like 

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:53.249
 a tornado and wind speeds 

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:55.349
 and you and then we started here 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:56.669

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:58.739
 fell over within two minutes 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:00.539
 This haunting was more or less over 

00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:03.509
 and now the goals look like it 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:06.299
 look it builds impression in one 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:07.919
 even if this if that thing 

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:09.269
 This thing is uncouth 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:12.919
 that builds a squad in the build up 

00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:15.839
 body and you get anxiety 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:17.909
 Firefighters and thw needed hours and hours 

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:18.659
 the storm damage alone in hasbergen 

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:21.029
 remove 

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:22.799
 many railway tracks were affected by the 

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:25.439
 weather conditions also for the experienced 

00:07:22.799 --> 00:07:26.810
 It was almost unusual 

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:29.120
 fill the weather 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.120
 was very warm then got very strong 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.610
 wind up and rain and very short 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.680
 heavy breezes a thunderstorm 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:40.840
 will underestimate to have deep 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.840
 In any case nobody in the north anymore
