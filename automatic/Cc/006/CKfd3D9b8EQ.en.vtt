00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.680
 what's up with greetings and points sometimes 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.320
 annoying the bustle of the city constant rush 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.000
 lack of sleep stress and stuff if 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.910
 date advice you to play for from the same volume 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.900
 took yes released in 1986 and 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.790
 prefixes nes 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.620
 this game is about a brave hero molt 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.360
 who must save the earth and not give 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.100
 foam but gather the force of wisdom a 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.170
 filled with the spirit of adventure and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.059
 timely was one hundred percent hit and 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.280
 of course if the game becomes a cafe 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.640
 tom and should be a movie to 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.559
 get even more money and in 1989 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.780
 based on the first and second part of this 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.240
 playing the dead animated series called You 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.040
 do not believe it and to the goal jet he took yes 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.110
 time savers tell us that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.820
 there are triforce of wisdom and your gene 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.800
 she wants to get him but him also 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 eat riffar power greedy bastard 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.760
 if he gets both trifors then all 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.060
 plunge into darkness forever or we can 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.340
 to help 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.979
 Well, at first, pretty good 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.230
 so far everything in the game seems almost the same but 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.760
 stop what is the link 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.920
 I understand that then Livien represented 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.060
 a bunch of pixels was difficult 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.270
 imagine what he looks like 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.400
 business and we were helped by imagination and manuals 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.980
 although in some images his nose 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.110
 was like a sausage or cucumber 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.360
 agree some thoughts were not 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.640
 very much but the Japanese version was nothing 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.890
 could take it as a basis 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.930
 although you know find fault with the animated series 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.030
 just because of the appearance of the main character not 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.760
 a very good thing may not have conducted 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:03.700
 there is no excellent work on the character of Lenk 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.590
 ask why and because link is here 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.570
 It appears in the form of some cool 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.869
 a guy who sort of saves the princess 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.400
 but he behaves cool 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.380
 Protestant is always on horseback 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.510
 put badly and not thinking further 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.730
 actions in general he is just a fool but with 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.950
 this cool fool and you know if i don’t 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.480
 played the game then maybe i took it 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.000
 this character for granted 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.800
 but I played the game while playing it in 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.060
 I have a little other associations 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.220
 with the main character 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.010
 I imagined him more kind and 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.959
 sympathetic character in the ordinary general 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.490
 novice, I understand that this is arrogance and 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.740
 other output and links are just 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.209
 means in order for it to stand out on 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.580
 against other cartoon characters 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.530
 had its uniqueness but they could not 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.090
 would be other traits to express it 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.610
 uniqueness okay he good 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.500
 fit into this story but no macedon 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.500
 and Lenka do not suit me completely 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:05.860
 my hands to satanists 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.780
 what about the other characters besides 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.480
 molt there still zelda which time from 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.160
 time does not give Lenka or gives but 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.530
 the very last moment everything breaks off 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.730
 And the link is perplexed, I sometimes can not 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.890
 understand this princess 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.959
 she seems to like yanko and at the same time 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.430
 trying to avoid intimacy with him i 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.849
 just can't understand the logic 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.160
 and those she's like a woman then everything is clear 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.380
 there is also a small one on the screen 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.790
 fairy named sprite which sticks 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.610
 blade like a fan 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.280
 and trying to screw up with him in my opinion she 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.230
 giants sawing or something else on 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.299
 the screen often appears ben which 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.040
 by all means trying to steal triforce 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.380
 wisdom and and plans range from 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.500
 simple transfusion then large 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.700
 Occupations General hijacked typical title about 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.890
 nothing to tell him 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.049
 the rest of the characters are ordinary to tell 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.060
 it makes no sense about them it can be simple 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.830
 principle part of Julia or the fairy king 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.870
 someone else's purpose of this cartoon series is usually 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.840
 comes down to one and he tries to steal 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.150
 triforce link first blinks then he 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.670
 goes to save princess ali triforce here 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.500
 and everything is still at the end of the link to flash 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.239
 a kiss in general it would be ordinary 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.310
 animated series if he didn't have 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.739
 the names of the widgets took yes so from me 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.200
 there were big requests for him and he didn’t even 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.299
 I thought them to perform a boring plot and everything 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.650
 full of stereotypes and of course crazy 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.650
 not delivering the main character 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.050
 don't just go away in my humble opinion 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.210
 such a series of games as grain widgets are not 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.710
 must have any kind of adaptation because 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.870
 it is during the game process we 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.090
 we invent the character of the main character 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.220
 even the developers themselves don't voice it 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.220
 dialogues besides this squalor 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.220
 thank you all for watching subscribe
