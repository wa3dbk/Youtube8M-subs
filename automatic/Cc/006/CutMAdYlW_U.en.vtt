00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.669
 look and in addition to the outfit in full os 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.439
 I tell you that I am missing and not 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.239
 been uploading routine videos of 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.580
 gym and others because between work 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:31.279
 between colds that as I suppose 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.449
 you will notice that I have and live for others 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.519
 the truth is that I have not had any 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.550
 moment and also did not give you strength to 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:39.250
 put me to record and do other things a 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.140
 a little bit more elaborate so 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.909
 forgive me already the month of August I'm 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.210
 vacation so I'll be rested and 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:49.280
 I can go back to resume my routine 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.680

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.150
 other and good that for what you want already 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.920
 you know that yes you can write to me 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.229
 about everything that always attends 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.299
 I am an instagram and facebook 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.519
 channel so do not hesitate to ask me 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.610
 there and that nothing that I leave you with 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.610
 video 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.479
 use your preferred makeup base 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.939
 I am using this from sephora with 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.939
 the illuminating chest in tone 35 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.840
 correct imperfections 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.659
 now goes to qualify 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.240
 for an eye makeup last long 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.080
 enough is very important to use 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.080
 a good prebase 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.850
 apply a shadow bull skin on the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.850
 eyelid mobile 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.350
 now with a brown shadow we are going to do 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.880
 the ub and mark the basin 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.040
 if you notice , I'm already using a 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.040
 pen type brush to facilitate the task 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.189
 a taupe shadow did something to me we're going to 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.189
 make the transition 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.000
 as a shadow skin tone lighter 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.000
 let's light up the arch of the eyebrow 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.670
 Fill your eyebrows if you think it is 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.670
 necessary 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.739
 now let's delineate the line below 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.390
 of the eyelashes with a color pencil 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.910
 that we want in this case I'm going to 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.620
 use that pretty green I'm going to 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.630
 use it also in the water line and 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.520
 then I'm going to seal everything both the 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.220
 water line like delineating what 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.700
 you are seeing with a shadow of kiko from 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.700
 same tone 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.670
 for me there is nothing with a good 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.310
 outlined and I recommend you assemble a 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.490
 gel exterminator is trenc because 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.270
 for me it takes the palm to better 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.270
 quality / price ratio 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.440
 to give volume and blame my tabs 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:31.530
 I'm going to use the beige astor mask 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.530
 full the curve format 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:02.919
 as according to the layer I'm going to use the 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:07.089
 beautiful pija with in the case is the 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.089
 water cross 24 hours 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.380
 I think a fuchsia blush tone 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.380
 comes great with these shades 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:39.400
 a little illuminator is that my favorite 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.040
 low cost but the truth is that it 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.080
 spoiled, do not think it has turned me 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.750
 spoil what we apply in the hundred 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.570
 forms does 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.910
 and all over the face in the central part 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.300
 there in the center of the face form 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.300
 blatter 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:06:00.559
 and to accompany a fuchsia lipstick 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:03.549
 true however is normal is the 

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:03.549
 buffeting m 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.479
 I hope you liked that you have 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.129
 enjoyed and that if you put it in 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.539

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:36.460
