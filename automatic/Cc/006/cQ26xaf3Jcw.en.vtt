thing<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.570> really<00:00:24.689> caught<00:00:24.869> my<00:00:25.050> eye<00:00:25.260> when<00:00:25.769> I

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
thing that really caught my eye when I

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.130 
thing that really caught my eye when I
open<00:00:26.490> up<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.730> box<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.510> actually<00:00:27.720> saw<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
open up the box and I actually saw the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.160 
open up the box and I actually saw the
specter<00:00:28.680> dr<00:00:29.039> was<00:00:29.490> probably<00:00:30.449> its<00:00:30.750> serial

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
specter dr was probably its serial

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.020 
specter dr was probably its serial
number<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.740> made<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> really

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
number it made it have a really

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.209 
number it made it have a really
authentic<00:00:33.149> look<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.739> second<00:00:35.160> I

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
authentic look and for a second I

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.100 
authentic look and for a second I
actually<00:00:35.370> thought<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:35.880> he<00:00:36.149> shipped<00:00:36.960> me<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
actually thought that he shipped me a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.880 
actually thought that he shipped me a
real<00:00:37.380> one

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
real one

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.580 
real one
look<00:00:38.879> right<00:00:39.180> below<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.690> serial<00:00:40.020> number<00:00:40.320> and

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
look right below the serial number and

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.139 
look right below the serial number and
you'll<00:00:40.770> see<00:00:40.980> even<00:00:41.040> more<00:00:41.340> scripting<00:00:41.879> which

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
you'll see even more scripting which

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.720 
you'll see even more scripting which
adds<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.079> realism<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.219> optic<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:47.579> add
