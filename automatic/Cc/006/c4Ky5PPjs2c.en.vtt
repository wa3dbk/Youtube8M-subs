00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.270 

I<00:04:45.530> couldn't<00:04:46.530> live<00:04:46.620> with<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:46.860> very<00:04:46.920> long

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
I couldn't live with it very long

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.340 
I couldn't live with it very long
because<00:04:47.580> it<00:04:47.850> you<00:04:48.180> got<00:04:48.330> it<00:04:48.360> low<00:04:48.750> speeds<00:04:49.140> and

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
because it you got it low speeds and

00:04:49.350 --> 00:05:21.409 
because it you got it low speeds and
just

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:06:25.890 

and<00:05:22.419> then<00:05:23.110> it<00:05:23.229> gives<00:05:23.349> silent

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.540 

I'll<00:06:26.470> make<00:06:26.620> a<00:06:26.650> video<00:06:26.830> of<00:06:27.100> it<00:06:27.190> with<00:06:27.340> the<00:06:27.430> new
