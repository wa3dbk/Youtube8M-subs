I<00:05:03.419> don't<00:05:03.600> really<00:05:03.720> know<00:05:03.900> how<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:04.020> describe<00:05:04.200> it

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
I don't really know how to describe it

I don't really know how to describe it
they<00:05:04.980> make<00:05:05.280> like<00:05:05.580> dark<00:05:05.940> jeans<00:05:06.240> look<00:05:06.480> a<00:05:06.600> lot

better<00:05:07.080> like<00:05:07.440> classier<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.340> guess<00:05:08.640> it<00:05:08.880> would<00:05:09.000> be

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
better like classier I guess it would be

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.520 
better like classier I guess it would be
better<00:05:09.300> for<00:05:09.419> like<00:05:09.690> a<00:05:09.720> more<00:05:09.990> formal<00:05:10.380> thing

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
better for like a more formal thing

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.230 
better for like a more formal thing
because<00:05:10.710> they<00:05:10.800> still<00:05:11.070> look<00:05:11.160> really<00:05:11.190> nice<00:05:11.550> cuz

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
because they still look really nice cuz

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.850 
because they still look really nice cuz
they<00:05:12.360> probably<00:05:12.390> would<00:05:12.990> look<00:05:13.169> like<00:05:13.320> kind<00:05:13.830> of

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
they probably would look like kind of

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.260 
they probably would look like kind of
like<00:05:13.950> a<00:05:14.100> leather<00:05:14.310> gene<00:05:14.610> from<00:05:14.790> far<00:05:15.000> away<00:05:15.030> the

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
like a leather gene from far away the

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.550 
like a leather gene from far away the
way<00:05:15.390> the<00:05:15.570> light<00:05:15.720> reflects<00:05:16.020> off<00:05:16.140> of<00:05:16.200> it<00:05:16.440> I'll

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
way the light reflects off of it I'll

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.110 
way the light reflects off of it I'll
put<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.830> link<00:05:17.010> down<00:05:17.070> to<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.430> pacsun<00:05:17.760> website
