anything I like oh I'm in here there's I
don't<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.439> any<00:01:43.590> laces<00:01:43.979> put<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.310> here<00:01:44.490> but

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
don't have any laces put in here but

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.649 
don't have any laces put in here but
without<00:01:45.030> them<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.329> fine<00:01:47.420> let's<00:01:48.420> go<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
without them it's fine let's go on to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.730 
without them it's fine let's go on to
the<00:01:48.780> back<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:49.079> right<00:01:49.170> now<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> back

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
the back all right now on to the back

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.139 
the back all right now on to the back
which<00:01:49.979> looks<00:01:50.009> pretty<00:01:50.490> much<00:01:50.579> like<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> front

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
which looks pretty much like the front

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.940 
which looks pretty much like the front
has<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.570> ventilation<00:01:52.259> holes<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.619> take<00:01:52.799> out

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
has the ventilation holes to take out

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.889 
has the ventilation holes to take out
the<00:01:53.070> weight<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.850> lot<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.030> pulling<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.810> be

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
the weight and a lot of pulling to be

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.139 
the weight and a lot of pulling to be
easier<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.380> faster<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.950> mean<00:01:56.700> how's<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.030> raise

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
easier and faster I mean how's it raise

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.270 
easier and faster I mean how's it raise
up<00:01:57.329> areas<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.869> deflect<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.259> absorption<00:01:58.649> or

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
up areas to deflect the absorption or

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.230 
up areas to deflect the absorption or
deflect<00:01:59.670> impact<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.390> increase<00:02:00.780> absorption

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
deflect impact and increase absorption

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.910 
deflect impact and increase absorption
and<00:02:03.240> here<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.079> little<00:02:04.290> bit<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.530> padding<00:02:04.710> on

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
and here is a little bit of padding on

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.709 
and here is a little bit of padding on
the<00:02:04.979> side<00:02:05.189> where<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.520> straps<00:02:05.820> are<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.299> for<00:02:06.509> a

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
the side where the straps are just for a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.710 
the side where the straps are just for a
little<00:02:07.049> bit<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.409> side<00:02:08.599> then<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.690> have

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
little bit on the side then you have

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.449 
little bit on the side then you have
little<00:02:09.989> straps<00:02:10.200> connecting<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.890> two

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
little straps connecting the two

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.460 
little straps connecting the two
and<00:02:12.819> then<00:02:12.939> you<00:02:13.030> have<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.269> bottom<00:02:13.659> the<00:02:13.930> back

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
and then you have the bottom the back

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.869 
and then you have the bottom the back

can you go look that up but has a
ventilation<00:02:21.129> holes<00:02:21.459> like<00:02:22.090> in<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.360> actual

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
ventilation holes like in the actual

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.990 
ventilation holes like in the actual
shoulder<00:02:22.780> pad<00:02:23.049> and<00:02:23.319> it<00:02:23.560> has<00:02:23.680> pretty<00:02:23.890> much<00:02:24.000> a

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
shoulder pad and it has pretty much a

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.199 
shoulder pad and it has pretty much a
good<00:02:25.689> luck<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:26.110> tena<00:02:26.500> everything<00:02:26.829> fits

should<00:02:29.560> fit<00:02:29.620> I'm<00:02:30.069> like<00:02:30.310> Riedel<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.000> shot<00:02:31.390> they

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
should fit I'm like Riedel and shot they

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.080 
should fit I'm like Riedel and shot they
don't<00:02:31.720> really<00:02:31.900> mix<00:02:32.110> but<00:02:32.860> um<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.370> like<00:02:33.909> the

backplate<00:03:05.709> um<00:03:06.599> that's<00:03:07.599> about<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.200> there's

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
backplate um that's about it and there's

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.649 
backplate um that's about it and there's
like<00:03:08.680> these<00:03:08.889> little<00:03:09.069> pad<00:03:09.310> right<00:03:09.519> here<00:03:09.659> these

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
like these little pad right here these

that's about it for that so into the
inside<00:03:49.780> of<00:03:49.840> it<00:03:50.879> this<00:03:51.879> is<00:03:52.060> what<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.299> pads<00:03:52.510> look

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
to where the holes are matched up with

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.819 
to where the holes are matched up with
the<00:03:57.459> holes<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.019> like<00:03:59.349> I<00:03:59.470> said<00:03:59.500> that

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
the holes so that like I said that

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
them off right now but all these pads

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.129 
them off right now but all these pads
are<00:04:09.370> four<00:04:09.669> of<00:04:09.790> them<00:04:09.879> what's<00:04:10.449> going<00:04:10.510> on<00:04:10.959> your

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
are four of them what's going on your

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.899 
are four of them what's going on your
collarbone<00:04:11.620> this<00:04:12.069> is<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.459> ones<00:04:12.639> that<00:04:12.760> go<00:04:12.849> on

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
collarbone this is the ones that go on

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.319 
collarbone this is the ones that go on
your<00:04:13.030> collarbone<00:04:13.799> so<00:04:14.849> it<00:04:15.849> right<00:04:16.030> kind<00:04:16.239> of

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
your collarbone so it right kind of

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.390 
your collarbone so it right kind of
raises<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.659> pad<00:04:16.930> on<00:04:17.169> you<00:04:17.320> but<00:04:17.889> you<00:04:18.099> could<00:04:18.250> take

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
raises the pad on you but you could take

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.219 
raises the pad on you but you could take
them<00:04:18.549> off<00:04:18.699> easily<00:04:18.909> and<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:19.659> don't<00:04:19.750> really<00:04:20.019> think

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
them off easily and I don't really think

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.379 
them off easily and I don't really think
it<00:04:20.440> would<00:04:20.560> give<00:04:20.769> you<00:04:20.979> you<00:04:21.789> probably<00:04:22.150> wouldn't

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
it would give you you probably wouldn't

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:23.720 
it would give you you probably wouldn't
notice<00:04:22.479> a<00:04:22.750> lot<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.200> I'm

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
notice a lot and I'm

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.490 
notice a lot and I'm
impact<00:04:24.360> absorption<00:04:24.720> on<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.260> you<00:04:25.350> probably

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
impact absorption on you you probably

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.740 
impact absorption on you you probably
wouldn't<00:04:25.830> feel<00:04:25.920> anything<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:27.180> that's<00:04:27.600> about
